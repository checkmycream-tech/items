            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with freckles and most tanners</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not overpowering, spreads like a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Just used the reorder with more input from the company and still good stuff</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve applied the lotion twice and achieved a perfect glow that looks natural without any streaks.</li>
            <li>This sunless tanning lotion is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>It works as described makes your skin soft, and smells great!</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST sunless tanner I have used!  </li>
            <li>easy to put on!</li>
            <li>and I was able to build up to a believable, nice tan look.</li>
            <li>Overnight, the leg with the lotion applied had turn a very light brown.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and is very smooth in application.</li>
            <li>and the color is fabulous and real! !!!!</li>
            <li>My skin not only looks good and healthy, it feels good and healthy!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, and it gave me a beautiful, dark, natural-looking, streak free tan.  </li>
            <li>Better than promised in the advertisement.  </li>
            <li>– there is no need for me to consider another option, and keep my skin free from the damage associated with tanning beds and the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of the product from the manufacturer for purpose of honest review.</li>
            <li>I have tried many self tanners over the years.  </li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s all natural/organic &amp; how I could wear it overnight without the lotion staining my clothes/bed</li>
            <li>Tried so many sunless tanning products that claim everything under the sun but didn&#x27;t produce.</li>
            <li>Thank you for actually making the best sunless tanning lotion in the world! !!!!</li>
            <li>I love that I can control the depth of the color and my ankles and knees</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others that have turned my face orange.  </li>
            <li>Really love the ease of application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I stumbled across it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Your product has made it possible for me to have that “glow” in a way that looks and feels healthy, while providing wonderful moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li>I think this will be a permanent part of my beauty ritual :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no tint to it, so it can be tricky to make sure you&#x27;ve covered every bit of skin, but if you&#x27;re used to using self-tanners then you probably know how to make sure you&#x27;re getting every bit covered.  </li>
            <li>One thing to take into consideration is make sure to wash your hands immediately after applying or your palms will be tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If shaving your legs, make sure to wait for the pores to close before applying the product to avoid spotting (15-20 mins).Also if applying after shaving</li>
            <li>More like a moisturizer than a tanner.</li>
            <li>so I did one more application</li>
            <li>✔ Has a lot of ingredients that are conducive to healthy skin.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I already have a sunless tanner that I love</li>
            <li>wonder whether those of you who want a darker tan could get that by applying more of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one you would use more to get desired color.  </li>
            <li>This product is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>This is the best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried several over the years.  </li>
            <li>Most family and friends noticed and complimented my tanned skin within minutes of seeing me; all wanting to know where I was, what I did, or what</li>
            <li>Works fast,  looks great and doesn&#x27;t rub on your clothes.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love that it is vegan.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll love it:)</li>
            <li>so make sure you skin is moisturized</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>and I woke up with a nice light even tan.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and light.  </li>
            <li>But if those are the results you want, then go for it :).</li>
            <li>To be natural, for the price, amount you get and its looks good!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a subtle self tanner that looks good and leaves your skin happy and smooth, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I find it best to apply sunless tanners about 20-30 minutes after I shower when my skin is dry but still has that water suppleness.</li>
            <li>GREAT natural alternative!</li>
            <li>Happy that it&#x27;s natural and not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>Watch what you&#x27;re doing to be sure you&#x27;ve got the lotion evenly and lightly applied.  </li>
            <li>Oh and your skin feels silky smooth after :)</li>
            <li>Smelled nice and absorbed well.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product and the golden color it provided.</li>
            <li>You really need to massage it into the skin so you are more apt to run the cream over all areas in a more even fashion.</li>
            <li>After one application I got a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li>and so far I love it!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use with no streaking.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>No streaking at all gives super good coverage with nice color that looks natural, even around knees, elbows and ankles.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy...very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions to a &#x27;t&#x27;, as you can easily overdue it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily it rubbed in and disappeared into my skin.</li>
            <li>Not tested on animals, simple to apply and a beautiful result</li>
            <li>In all honesty, no sunless tanner is perfect (at least out of the numerous I&#x27;ve tried), but it&#x27;s so wonderful when you find one that works well for you and your skin.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I enjoy having a sun-kissed glow, but so many of the sunless tanning products are full of toxic chemicals and strong fragrances that bother my skin.  </li>
            <li>The key to getting a beautiful tan is to apply the lotion lightly every couple of nights, and watch the tan build.  </li>
            <li>I have used many self tanners in the past and this one is the BEST!</li>
            <li>I love that it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The company confirmed this when I asked.</li>
            <li>I think this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous, even tanning.</li>
            <li>✔ Lightly scented.</li>
            <li>But fortunately, it&#x27;s light and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>item was provided free in exchange for an impartial review.</li>
            <li>I was provided with this free review sample I was eager to try it though nervous as well.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and creamy and feels substantial but does not leave my skin feeling sticky or mushy.  </li>
            <li>This lotion should be applied evenly and lightly.  </li>
            <li>A light buff of the nails with a file or buffer removes any discoloring on them that may have occurred, too.</li>
            <li>A light buff of the nails with a file or buffer removes any discoloring on them that may have occurred, too.</li>
            <li>Great product and lasting tan!!</li>
            <li>Turned a lovely golden brown color, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>This really gives a nice color.</li>
            <li>I like that this lotion smells really good and has lots of natural ingredients</li>
            <li>After the four hours like it said I was tanned with a real looking tan! !!</li>
            <li>Still totally worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is Perfect for prom, weddings, vacations, or everyday use!</li>
            <li>I think the fact that the product has the consistency of a cream rather than a light lotion may be a large part of why it delivers more even coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the natural ingredients and will definitely purchase again when I run out!</li>
            <li>This lotion is a light cream color and when applied rubs onto my skin where it looks like I have to keep rubbing to blend it in but then disappears rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried many tanning lotions and towels and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>and I did the tanning booths because I didn’t like my very fair skin with little</li>
            <li>Ive tried soooo many self tan lotions,both high end and cheap.</li>
            <li>Great product it will give your the prefect tan, without going to tanning bed or outside in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to love this</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any friend who wants a safe tanning alternative.</li>
            <li>opening the bottle put me on a tropical beach with its light scent of fresh coconut and shea butter.</li>
            <li>but I read such good things about it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>but this one is great, no negative effects!The smell is a nice coconut like smell compared to the typical self tanners and also didn&#x27;t make my skin orange.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a mild, sweet fragrance with a hint of the shea and cocoa butters in the formula.</li>
            <li>I used it twice, a day apart from one application to the other, and it turned out great.  </li>
            <li>even more so I was excited to try something new...</li>
            <li>Thanks for marketing such a great product.</li>
            <li>If you love a fake tan like me then don&#x27;t hesitate trying this awesome lotion!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I found this one and ordered it, although after I ordered it, I found one that has even better ingredients (Caribbean Solutions Beach Colours self tanner) than this one, so I will finish this and start using the new product.</li>
            <li>This is for sure one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>This is now my new favorite self-tanner.</li>
            <li>Smells great, not like typical sunless tanners.</li>
            <li>Anyways, the first thing I noticed from this is that is doesn&#x27;t smell like 1000 chemicals!</li>
            <li>Remembering thai I live in Ohio, and it&#x27;s December convinced me that this lotion was the reason for my great and sudden tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two standout qualities of this stuff that deserve to be repeated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once, but I love how easily the lotion applies.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and resulted a light, even tan that looks absolutely natural.</li>
            <li>It was just a normal consistency that spread easily and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love how it has organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Lovely and natural.</li>
            <li>I also purchased a bottle for my 20 year old daughter, fantastic!</li>
            <li>Does not smell and does not have the orange color, looks more of a natural glow.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing,like fresh coconut.</li>
            <li>Not stinky, lovely soft color, long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>False advertising at its best.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in only 2 days and was easy to use, kind to my skin and gave me a natural golden tan.</li>
            <li>Exfoliating is always in my regimen, but I make sure to always do it the couple days before I&#x27;m going to apply, especially when I want to have my sunless tan for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>I always do self tanning right before bed.</li>
            <li>dont do it right away because it will leave your legs looking stubbly.</li>
            <li>I can put my clothes on right after spreading the lotion all over, and washing my hands...</li>
            <li>used a quarter sized glob on each leg right after showering, and promptly forgot I&#x27;d used it.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight scent to it but a pleasant one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and the tan looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like sun tan lotion where you have to rub it in really well for the white color to go into your skin.</li>
            <li>I NEEDED TO WORK QUICKLY SINCE IT DRIES SO FAST.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural and goes on easily with no streaking.  </li>
            <li>my forever new tanning lotion! !!</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smoothly and the resulting tan is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I do like this very much and will buy again.</li>
            <li>It gave me a nice, even brown tan that was somewhat subtle but got darker with more applications.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to using on whole body!</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>atleast 2-3 times a week and seen a difference after the first use within hours</li>
            <li>that helped me out when using this for the first time</li>
            <li>It seems like the product will last longer than many lotions do.</li>
            <li>free to contact me directly with any questions.</li>
            <li>free to contact me directly with any questions.</li>
            <li>My skin is already pretty tanned</li>
            <li>I finally have tanned legs that match the rest of my tanned body  :)</li>
            <li>I must confess, I&#x27;m really a skeptic when it comes to sunless tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was the smell, or lack thereof.</li>
            <li>Well this really doesn&#x27;t have that smell!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m guessing if I used this in place of my regular lotion for several days I would have a nice tan!</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest review.imilar hard foot scrubber easily removes any areas that may have been missed and end up darker.</li>
            <li>This one does – not only does it not overwhelm with that ‘self-tanner’ odor, and carries a pleasant coconut smell, it is easy to apply, moisturizes, doesn’t sting or cause my skin to itch, and when applied carefully – taking particular caution with dryer patches (knees, ankles, elbows)</li>
            <li>so I apply the tanner to those spots so they aren&#x27;t such a bright white color.</li>
            <li>This all natural product feels healthy on my skin and looks like  a natural sun induced tan.  </li>
            <li>Color is very natural-looking, smells good, and smoothed out my uneven tan.</li>
            <li>Even though my skin felt instantly soft and supple, I thought for sure I would have streak marks once the tanning developed.</li>
            <li>there was no marked discoloration that makes so many of the self-tanners ‘look’ fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This self-tanner also smells really nice too - it doesn&#x27;t give off that typical chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is dry before getting dressed as it may get on your clothes.</li>
            <li>For skin areas that are much noticeably darker after sunless tanner fully develops, I&#x27;ve found that a dry and/or water-moistened magic eraser works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For skin areas that are much noticeably darker after sunless tanner fully develops, I&#x27;ve found that a dry and/or water-moistened magic eraser works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not only doesn&#x27;t over darken my freckles, it leaves me with a beautiful natural looking tan that lasts days longer than any other self tanner I have used.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it only on my legs but the color was even, not orange and the product had a slight but pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the few times that I used a sunless tanning loation and seen amazing results within hours.</li>
            <li>The very helpful tips for use recommend that the lotion be applied and left on overnight after a light exfoliation, but I bathe after four to six hours, and my skin still continues to darken overnight.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and moisturizing when applied and would make a nice everyday lotion, if it didn&#x27;t darken the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>After years of using tanning beds, she&#x27;s concerned with the dangers, but still wants to be tan.  </li>
            <li>Very embarrassed.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an even, golden coverage and looks quite natural.</li>
            <li>Followed the directions given and still came out very patchy and orange</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice...coconutty, and there&#x27;s is very of the &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I rubbed the lotion into my whole face including my eyelids, no burning or irritation.  </li>
            <li>This lotion can be applied anywhere on the body for a medium tan and moisturizers really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really alternative to frying in the sun</li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re not getting a whole lot of sun, this is an option for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to coconut oil, it smells like the tropics.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in color....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>is, it is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>any self tanner, you can look orange if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>Which looks must more real on these old white legs.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; that lasts a few days.</li>
            <li>We are so pale to begin with, and this is giving us a really nice natural golden tan.</li>
            <li>so I figured that meant it would be a light color, again pleasantly surprised by the depth (not dark, but not light).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried and it really holds its color.</li>
            <li>I first used this a week ago and still have a very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Great subtle, natural difference after one application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky and realistic about things</li>
            <li>That is a small price to pay, however, for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Very unusual to find a tanning product that has natural ingredients that are not harmful to your body.  </li>
            <li>This company has finally got it right.!</li>
            <li>It does have the mild scent that other sunless tanning products have but it is not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li>Even though they don&#x27;t capture the overall full beauty results of this sunless tanner, as noticed in person, you can still see there are differences in color, glow, tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My toenails were not painted the first time I used it, so I had tanning under the nails in some areas where the lotion seeped under which I easily fixed (hid) with a coat of nail polish.</li>
            <li>It really was just like using normal</li>
            <li>Smells great, which was one of the big concerns I&#x27;ve had with several other self tanners.  </li>
            <li>I have &#x27;old &#x27;olive skin and have spent many years in the sun which caused sun damage.</li>
            <li>it was impossible to get natural tanned color, with healthy ingredients for skin, AND a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Gentle and/or heavy exfoliating creams can help most areas of the skin that need correcting.</li>
            <li>Gentle and/or heavy exfoliating creams can help most areas of the skin that need correcting.</li>
            <li>I only put on one leg to be able to actually see the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pale as a ghost for a year and this looks natural, like a warm glowing tan.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>hopes are high in</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is like a high end skin cream; it&#x27;s tropical, with coconut and pineapple notes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li>Really like this self-tanner so far.  </li>
            <li>As it fades, I did see a few patchy spots, but could probably avoid this with better exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>So worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I was not vigilant enough when applying cream on my feet (must use very sparingly), as the skin just above my toes and on the sides of my feel close to the sole, turned much darker than the top of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on like regular lotion and leaves my skin soft and smooth and in a few hours it turned me light golden brown just like I used to get from hours in the sun when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>I wipe my hands well after full application and then wash them with soap and water then dry them,  </li>
            <li>That is just unheard of service and they have a grateful new customer</li>
            <li>It gives nice, delicate, natural looking color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a nice even, subtle tan.</li>
            <li>It is subtle, providing a nice gradual change in skin tone and color.</li>
            <li>The color is very natural.</li>
            <li>Very natural</li>
            <li>The color is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Color is buildable; ingredients leave skin soft; and the smell is light, not at all like other self-tanners w/DHA.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>This is the first sunless tanning product that I have used that actually works and doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange  </li>
            <li>not messy!</li>
            <li>Have used many self tanners in the past with issues.  </li>
            <li>Definitely exfoliate first.</li>
            <li>love the color – and expected that it would be reasonably short-lived with only 3 – 5 day lifespan, but it’s managed to work for me for 10 days before fading – and I’ve showered and swam regularly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Invoketress Sunless Tanning Lotion is made with high quality botanical, naturally derived, ORGANIC ingredients including Vitamin E, Shea Butter, and Natural Oils.</li>
            <li>The true test was wearing white running socks the next day and no stain.</li>
            <li>In my personal experience with Invoketress Beauty, one application lasts me with the sun-kissed color a full four to five days and then fading begins with tan color completely gone after eight to ten days.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face once and was very surprised how much color I had the next morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied a coat to my full face and body four times this past month and still have more than half a bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li>I believe that since it never really dried, there is a large white spot on my leg where it rubbed off on the sheets)</li>
            <li>The lotion is white when applied and does take a couple of days to notice a real difference, but the appearance is quite natural looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also Organic and Natural-</li>
            <li>Natural organic gives a natural color and there is no odor</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>look natural as well.</li>
            <li>I realized this is not as natural as I thought and will never put on my skin again.</li>
            <li>Provides a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and others claimed it was a natural glow as well</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a sunless tanner that is nontoxic, for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an all natural self tanner.</li>
            <li>We have used 3 applications so far, and our tan looks so natural.</li>
            <li>natural sunless tanning lotion gave me a bronzed sunkissed look and did not turn my skin orange.</li>
            <li>so I just wanted a natural even tan and this product did just that.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try Invoketress Beauty&#x27;s Natural Organic Sunless Tanning Lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nor really a lotion; it&#x27;s a cream that is white out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The lotion goes on white and you really need to work it in...</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I personally love that it does not have a color guide, it is just a white cream that develops in a few hours without streaks.  </li>
            <li>After I tried it on, the next morning I had a natural looking tan and there were no negative repercussions.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PURCHASING IT FROM THIS TERRIFIC COMPANY.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have any dry spots</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Endlessly sunless tanning lotion</li>
            <li>The color was so natural, and exactly the color of my skin with a slight tan.  </li>
            <li>The color lasted for a few days, not quite as long as all the other reviews are saying it lasts, but re-application will keep the color nice.  </li>
            <li>After one, full-body application, (that took less than ten minutes from start to getting dressed), my skin began to show a very light sun glow within a few hours and peaked fully developed at about 18-24 hours and NOT ONE STREAK on my body!</li>
            <li>Oh, and that odd smell most tanners have, not this one; I do not smell anything except a slight coconut scent that fades almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>Have used several others that were ok but not nearly as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I have purchased over 5 different brands of Natural Tanning lotions for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if careful, cannot tell the difference between the real tan and the applied areas.</li>
            <li>Vitamin E is an antioxidant and Shea Butter has deep moisturizing and skin rejuvenated.ts including Vitamin E, Shea Butter, and Natural Oils.</li>
            <li>The cuticles and skin surrounding my toenails were not darkened but I always take a rung, wet rag and gently wipe this area of my nails after applying any sunless tanner, as well as the bottom of my feet and palms of my hands.</li>
            <li>It looked so natural I had to stop and think if I&#x27;d actually been out in the sun somewhere.  </li>
            <li>A pumice stone or similar hard foot scrubber easily removes any areas that may have been missed and end up darker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find cruelty-free makeup let alone something like tanner, so when I read the good reviews my very pale self ordered.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly the way your skin looks after a few hours in the sun; not dark, no streaks,</li>
            <li>The active ingredient is dihydroxyacetone, which simply stains the cells in the outer layer of the skin; it is approved by the FDA for this use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using it for the first time</li>
            <li>The color on my skin lats much longer than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>self tanner, aside from the ‘orange-y’ look that happens with so many, was an option, but I just never found one that didn’t look ‘fake’ and give my skin a tan that is not close to my natural</li>
            <li>The first application wasn&#x27;t quite dark enough</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, keep in mind that all natural skin colors, types, textures, etc. are different, so sunless tanners will therefore develop differently, too.</li>
            <li>Did not dry out my skin nor leave any orange streaks.</li>
            <li>One thing I don&#x27;t really recommend it for is the face, unless you want to look dark.</li>
            <li>The creamy sunless tanning lotion provides a very even and natural-looking tan that would normally take me several weeks of daily sunbathing to achieve, but without any of the harmful effects of excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation.</li>
            <li>I had not used sunless lotions for some time because of the rub off factor so was a little skeptical, but Endlessly gave me a nice even golden look.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and other tanners have made me break out</li>
    </ol>

            <li> easy to put on!</li>
            <li> and I was able to build up to a believable, nice tan look.</li>
            <li> Overnight, the leg with the lotion applied had turn a very light brown.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent and is very smooth in application.</li>
            <li> and the color is fabulous and real! !!!!</li>
            <li> My skin not only looks good and healthy, it feels good and healthy!</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, and it gave me a beautiful, dark, natural-looking, streak free tan.  </li>
            <li> Better than promised in the advertisement.  </li>
            <li> – there is no need for me to consider another option, and keep my skin free from the damage associated with tanning beds and the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of the product from the manufacturer for purpose of honest review.</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners over the years.  </li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s all natural/organic &amp; how I could wear it overnight without the lotion staining my clothes/bed</li>
            <li> Tried so many sunless tanning products that claim everything under the sun but didn&#x27;t produce.</li>
            <li> Thank you for actually making the best sunless tanning lotion in the world! !!!!</li>
            <li> I love that I can control the depth of the color and my ankles and knees</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others that have turned my face orange.  </li>
            <li> Really love the ease of application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I stumbled across it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Your product has made it possible for me to have that “glow” in a way that looks and feels healthy, while providing wonderful moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li> I think this will be a permanent part of my beauty ritual :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no tint to it, so it can be tricky to make sure you&#x27;ve covered every bit of skin, but if you&#x27;re used to using self-tanners then you probably know how to make sure you&#x27;re getting every bit covered.  </li>
            <li> One thing to take into consideration is make sure to wash your hands immediately after applying or your palms will be tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If shaving your legs, make sure to wait for the pores to close before applying the product to avoid spotting (15-20 mins).Also if applying after shaving</li>
            <li> More like a moisturizer than a tanner.</li>
            <li> so I did one more application</li>
            <li> ✔ Has a lot of ingredients that are conducive to healthy skin.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I already have a sunless tanner that I love</li>
            <li> wonder whether those of you who want a darker tan could get that by applying more of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one you would use more to get desired color.  </li>
            <li> This product is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried several over the years.  </li>
            <li> Most family and friends noticed and complimented my tanned skin within minutes of seeing me; all wanting to know where I was, what I did, or what</li>
            <li> Works fast,  looks great and doesn&#x27;t rub on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love that it is vegan.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll love it:)</li>
            <li> so make sure you skin is moisturized</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> and I woke up with a nice light even tan.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and light.  </li>
            <li> But if those are the results you want, then go for it :).</li>
            <li> To be natural, for the price, amount you get and its looks good!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a subtle self tanner that looks good and leaves your skin happy and smooth, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I find it best to apply sunless tanners about 20-30 minutes after I shower when my skin is dry but still has that water suppleness.</li>
            <li> GREAT natural alternative!</li>
            <li> Happy that it&#x27;s natural and not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> Watch what you&#x27;re doing to be sure you&#x27;ve got the lotion evenly and lightly applied.  </li>
            <li> Oh and your skin feels silky smooth after :)</li>
            <li> Smelled nice and absorbed well.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and the golden color it provided.</li>
            <li> You really need to massage it into the skin so you are more apt to run the cream over all areas in a more even fashion.</li>
            <li> After one application I got a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li> and so far I love it!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with no streaking.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> No streaking at all gives super good coverage with nice color that looks natural, even around knees, elbows and ankles.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy...very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions to a &#x27;t&#x27;, as you can easily overdue it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily it rubbed in and disappeared into my skin.</li>
            <li> Not tested on animals, simple to apply and a beautiful result</li>
            <li> In all honesty, no sunless tanner is perfect (at least out of the numerous I&#x27;ve tried), but it&#x27;s so wonderful when you find one that works well for you and your skin.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I enjoy having a sun-kissed glow, but so many of the sunless tanning products are full of toxic chemicals and strong fragrances that bother my skin.  </li>
            <li> The key to getting a beautiful tan is to apply the lotion lightly every couple of nights, and watch the tan build.  </li>
            <li> I have used many self tanners in the past and this one is the BEST!</li>
            <li> I love that it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The company confirmed this when I asked.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, even tanning.</li>
            <li> ✔ Lightly scented.</li>
            <li> But fortunately, it&#x27;s light and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> item was provided free in exchange for an impartial review.</li>
            <li> I was provided with this free review sample I was eager to try it though nervous as well.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and creamy and feels substantial but does not leave my skin feeling sticky or mushy.  </li>
            <li> This lotion should be applied evenly and lightly.  </li>
            <li> A light buff of the nails with a file or buffer removes any discoloring on them that may have occurred, too.</li>
            <li> A light buff of the nails with a file or buffer removes any discoloring on them that may have occurred, too.</li>
            <li> Great product and lasting tan!!</li>
            <li> Turned a lovely golden brown color, not orange at all.</li>
            <li> This really gives a nice color.</li>
            <li> I like that this lotion smells really good and has lots of natural ingredients</li>
            <li> After the four hours like it said I was tanned with a real looking tan! !!</li>
            <li> Still totally worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is Perfect for prom, weddings, vacations, or everyday use!</li>
            <li> I think the fact that the product has the consistency of a cream rather than a light lotion may be a large part of why it delivers more even coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the natural ingredients and will definitely purchase again when I run out!</li>
            <li> This lotion is a light cream color and when applied rubs onto my skin where it looks like I have to keep rubbing to blend it in but then disappears rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many tanning lotions and towels and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> and I did the tanning booths because I didn’t like my very fair skin with little</li>
            <li> Ive tried soooo many self tan lotions,both high end and cheap.</li>
            <li> Great product it will give your the prefect tan, without going to tanning bed or outside in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to love this</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any friend who wants a safe tanning alternative.</li>
            <li> opening the bottle put me on a tropical beach with its light scent of fresh coconut and shea butter.</li>
            <li> but I read such good things about it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> but this one is great, no negative effects!The smell is a nice coconut like smell compared to the typical self tanners and also didn&#x27;t make my skin orange.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a mild, sweet fragrance with a hint of the shea and cocoa butters in the formula.</li>
            <li> I used it twice, a day apart from one application to the other, and it turned out great.  </li>
            <li> even more so I was excited to try something new...</li>
            <li> Thanks for marketing such a great product.</li>
            <li> If you love a fake tan like me then don&#x27;t hesitate trying this awesome lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I found this one and ordered it, although after I ordered it, I found one that has even better ingredients (Caribbean Solutions Beach Colours self tanner) than this one, so I will finish this and start using the new product.</li>
            <li> This is for sure one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> This is now my new favorite self-tanner.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not like typical sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> Anyways, the first thing I noticed from this is that is doesn&#x27;t smell like 1000 chemicals!</li>
            <li> Remembering thai I live in Ohio, and it&#x27;s December convinced me that this lotion was the reason for my great and sudden tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two standout qualities of this stuff that deserve to be repeated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, but I love how easily the lotion applies.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and resulted a light, even tan that looks absolutely natural.</li>
            <li> It was just a normal consistency that spread easily and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love how it has organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Lovely and natural.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a bottle for my 20 year old daughter, fantastic!</li>
            <li> Does not smell and does not have the orange color, looks more of a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing,like fresh coconut.</li>
            <li> Not stinky, lovely soft color, long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> False advertising at its best.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in only 2 days and was easy to use, kind to my skin and gave me a natural golden tan.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating is always in my regimen, but I make sure to always do it the couple days before I&#x27;m going to apply, especially when I want to have my sunless tan for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> I always do self tanning right before bed.</li>
            <li> dont do it right away because it will leave your legs looking stubbly.</li>
            <li> I can put my clothes on right after spreading the lotion all over, and washing my hands...</li>
            <li> used a quarter sized glob on each leg right after showering, and promptly forgot I&#x27;d used it.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight scent to it but a pleasant one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and the tan looks very natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like sun tan lotion where you have to rub it in really well for the white color to go into your skin.</li>
            <li> I NEEDED TO WORK QUICKLY SINCE IT DRIES SO FAST.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural and goes on easily with no streaking.  </li>
            <li> my forever new tanning lotion! !!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and the resulting tan is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I do like this very much and will buy again.</li>
            <li> It gave me a nice, even brown tan that was somewhat subtle but got darker with more applications.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using on whole body!</li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>
            <li> atleast 2-3 times a week and seen a difference after the first use within hours</li>
            <li> that helped me out when using this for the first time</li>
            <li> It seems like the product will last longer than many lotions do.</li>
            <li> free to contact me directly with any questions.</li>
            <li> free to contact me directly with any questions.</li>
            <li> My skin is already pretty tanned</li>
            <li> I finally have tanned legs that match the rest of my tanned body  :)</li>
            <li> I must confess, I&#x27;m really a skeptic when it comes to sunless tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was the smell, or lack thereof.</li>
            <li> Well this really doesn&#x27;t have that smell!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing if I used this in place of my regular lotion for several days I would have a nice tan!</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review.imilar hard foot scrubber easily removes any areas that may have been missed and end up darker.</li>
            <li> This one does – not only does it not overwhelm with that ‘self-tanner’ odor, and carries a pleasant coconut smell, it is easy to apply, moisturizes, doesn’t sting or cause my skin to itch, and when applied carefully – taking particular caution with dryer patches (knees, ankles, elbows)</li>
            <li> so I apply the tanner to those spots so they aren&#x27;t such a bright white color.</li>
            <li> This all natural product feels healthy on my skin and looks like  a natural sun induced tan.  </li>
            <li> Color is very natural-looking, smells good, and smoothed out my uneven tan.</li>
            <li> Even though my skin felt instantly soft and supple, I thought for sure I would have streak marks once the tanning developed.</li>
            <li> there was no marked discoloration that makes so many of the self-tanners ‘look’ fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This self-tanner also smells really nice too - it doesn&#x27;t give off that typical chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is dry before getting dressed as it may get on your clothes.</li>
            <li> For skin areas that are much noticeably darker after sunless tanner fully develops, I&#x27;ve found that a dry and/or water-moistened magic eraser works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For skin areas that are much noticeably darker after sunless tanner fully develops, I&#x27;ve found that a dry and/or water-moistened magic eraser works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not only doesn&#x27;t over darken my freckles, it leaves me with a beautiful natural looking tan that lasts days longer than any other self tanner I have used.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it only on my legs but the color was even, not orange and the product had a slight but pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few times that I used a sunless tanning loation and seen amazing results within hours.</li>
            <li> The very helpful tips for use recommend that the lotion be applied and left on overnight after a light exfoliation, but I bathe after four to six hours, and my skin still continues to darken overnight.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and moisturizing when applied and would make a nice everyday lotion, if it didn&#x27;t darken the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> After years of using tanning beds, she&#x27;s concerned with the dangers, but still wants to be tan.  </li>
            <li> Very embarrassed.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an even, golden coverage and looks quite natural.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions given and still came out very patchy and orange</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice...coconutty, and there&#x27;s is very of the &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I rubbed the lotion into my whole face including my eyelids, no burning or irritation.  </li>
            <li> This lotion can be applied anywhere on the body for a medium tan and moisturizers really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really alternative to frying in the sun</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re not getting a whole lot of sun, this is an option for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to coconut oil, it smells like the tropics.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in color....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> is, it is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> any self tanner, you can look orange if you use too much.  </li>
            <li> Which looks must more real on these old white legs.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; that lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> We are so pale to begin with, and this is giving us a really nice natural golden tan.</li>
            <li> so I figured that meant it would be a light color, again pleasantly surprised by the depth (not dark, but not light).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried and it really holds its color.</li>
            <li> I first used this a week ago and still have a very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Great subtle, natural difference after one application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky and realistic about things</li>
            <li> That is a small price to pay, however, for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Very unusual to find a tanning product that has natural ingredients that are not harmful to your body.  </li>
            <li> This company has finally got it right.!</li>
            <li> It does have the mild scent that other sunless tanning products have but it is not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Even though they don&#x27;t capture the overall full beauty results of this sunless tanner, as noticed in person, you can still see there are differences in color, glow, tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My toenails were not painted the first time I used it, so I had tanning under the nails in some areas where the lotion seeped under which I easily fixed (hid) with a coat of nail polish.</li>
            <li> It really was just like using normal</li>
            <li> Smells great, which was one of the big concerns I&#x27;ve had with several other self tanners.  </li>
            <li> I have &#x27;old &#x27;olive skin and have spent many years in the sun which caused sun damage.</li>
            <li> it was impossible to get natural tanned color, with healthy ingredients for skin, AND a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Gentle and/or heavy exfoliating creams can help most areas of the skin that need correcting.</li>
            <li> Gentle and/or heavy exfoliating creams can help most areas of the skin that need correcting.</li>
            <li> I only put on one leg to be able to actually see the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pale as a ghost for a year and this looks natural, like a warm glowing tan.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> hopes are high in</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is like a high end skin cream; it&#x27;s tropical, with coconut and pineapple notes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Really like this self-tanner so far.  </li>
            <li> As it fades, I did see a few patchy spots, but could probably avoid this with better exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> So worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I was not vigilant enough when applying cream on my feet (must use very sparingly), as the skin just above my toes and on the sides of my feel close to the sole, turned much darker than the top of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on like regular lotion and leaves my skin soft and smooth and in a few hours it turned me light golden brown just like I used to get from hours in the sun when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> I wipe my hands well after full application and then wash them with soap and water then dry them,  </li>
            <li> That is just unheard of service and they have a grateful new customer</li>
            <li> It gives nice, delicate, natural looking color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a nice even, subtle tan.</li>
            <li> It is subtle, providing a nice gradual change in skin tone and color.</li>
            <li> The color is very natural.</li>
            <li> Very natural</li>
            <li> The color is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Color is buildable; ingredients leave skin soft; and the smell is light, not at all like other self-tanners w/DHA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> This is the first sunless tanning product that I have used that actually works and doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange  </li>
            <li> not messy!</li>
            <li> Have used many self tanners in the past with issues.  </li>
            <li> Definitely exfoliate first.</li>
            <li> love the color – and expected that it would be reasonably short-lived with only 3 – 5 day lifespan, but it’s managed to work for me for 10 days before fading – and I’ve showered and swam regularly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Invoketress Sunless Tanning Lotion is made with high quality botanical, naturally derived, ORGANIC ingredients including Vitamin E, Shea Butter, and Natural Oils.</li>
            <li> The true test was wearing white running socks the next day and no stain.</li>
            <li> In my personal experience with Invoketress Beauty, one application lasts me with the sun-kissed color a full four to five days and then fading begins with tan color completely gone after eight to ten days.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face once and was very surprised how much color I had the next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied a coat to my full face and body four times this past month and still have more than half a bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li> I believe that since it never really dried, there is a large white spot on my leg where it rubbed off on the sheets)</li>
            <li> The lotion is white when applied and does take a couple of days to notice a real difference, but the appearance is quite natural looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also Organic and Natural-</li>
            <li> Natural organic gives a natural color and there is no odor</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> look natural as well.</li>
            <li> I realized this is not as natural as I thought and will never put on my skin again.</li>
            <li> Provides a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and others claimed it was a natural glow as well</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a sunless tanner that is nontoxic, for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural self tanner.</li>
            <li> We have used 3 applications so far, and our tan looks so natural.</li>
            <li> natural sunless tanning lotion gave me a bronzed sunkissed look and did not turn my skin orange.</li>
            <li> so I just wanted a natural even tan and this product did just that.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try Invoketress Beauty&#x27;s Natural Organic Sunless Tanning Lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nor really a lotion; it&#x27;s a cream that is white out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The lotion goes on white and you really need to work it in...</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> I personally love that it does not have a color guide, it is just a white cream that develops in a few hours without streaks.  </li>
            <li> After I tried it on, the next morning I had a natural looking tan and there were no negative repercussions.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PURCHASING IT FROM THIS TERRIFIC COMPANY.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have any dry spots</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Endlessly sunless tanning lotion</li>
            <li> The color was so natural, and exactly the color of my skin with a slight tan.  </li>
            <li> The color lasted for a few days, not quite as long as all the other reviews are saying it lasts, but re-application will keep the color nice.  </li>
            <li> After one, full-body application, (that took less than ten minutes from start to getting dressed), my skin began to show a very light sun glow within a few hours and peaked fully developed at about 18-24 hours and NOT ONE STREAK on my body!</li>
            <li> Oh, and that odd smell most tanners have, not this one; I do not smell anything except a slight coconut scent that fades almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Have used several others that were ok but not nearly as good as this one.</li>
            <li> I have purchased over 5 different brands of Natural Tanning lotions for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if careful, cannot tell the difference between the real tan and the applied areas.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E is an antioxidant and Shea Butter has deep moisturizing and skin rejuvenated.ts including Vitamin E, Shea Butter, and Natural Oils.</li>
            <li> The cuticles and skin surrounding my toenails were not darkened but I always take a rung, wet rag and gently wipe this area of my nails after applying any sunless tanner, as well as the bottom of my feet and palms of my hands.</li>
            <li> It looked so natural I had to stop and think if I&#x27;d actually been out in the sun somewhere.  </li>
            <li> A pumice stone or similar hard foot scrubber easily removes any areas that may have been missed and end up darker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find cruelty-free makeup let alone something like tanner, so when I read the good reviews my very pale self ordered.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly the way your skin looks after a few hours in the sun; not dark, no streaks,</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is dihydroxyacetone, which simply stains the cells in the outer layer of the skin; it is approved by the FDA for this use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using it for the first time</li>
            <li> The color on my skin lats much longer than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> self tanner, aside from the ‘orange-y’ look that happens with so many, was an option, but I just never found one that didn’t look ‘fake’ and give my skin a tan that is not close to my natural</li>
            <li> The first application wasn&#x27;t quite dark enough</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, keep in mind that all natural skin colors, types, textures, etc. are different, so sunless tanners will therefore develop differently, too.</li>
            <li> Did not dry out my skin nor leave any orange streaks.</li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t really recommend it for is the face, unless you want to look dark.</li>
            <li> The creamy sunless tanning lotion provides a very even and natural-looking tan that would normally take me several weeks of daily sunbathing to achieve, but without any of the harmful effects of excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation.</li>
            <li> I had not used sunless lotions for some time because of the rub off factor so was a little skeptical, but Endlessly gave me a nice even golden look.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and other tanners have made me break out</li>
            <li> The result is a natural looking tan though, and it was way better than a very expensive self tanner I had tried.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time from people asking if I was on vacation because of how dark it made me and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was never a huge fan of sunless tanning lotion because of all the yucky side effects but this actually worked really well without turning me orange or leaving a mess anywhere!less tanning lotion because of all the yucky side effects but this actually worked really well without turning me orange or leaving a mess anywhere!</li>
            <li> Great as a moisturizer but my quest for a natural tanner without all the nasty parabens/fragrance/dyes continues!</li>
            <li> The color does start to slowly fade after a few days, but a light application will renew the effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions say to wait 15 - 20 minutes after shaving and to put regular lotion on any dry spots.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t stain your hands as long as you wash them thoroughly after apply the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time proponent of sunless tanning products.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even wait long to get re-dressed.</li>
            <li> I am a very pale person though, so if you are very pale as well (as in, people comment on your white legs or ask if you are sick), this will work great for you!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t give this a low rating due to the scent and the timely matter it came.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very dark, so I applied daily for several days to get a shade closer to what I like.  </li>
            <li> Then, apply moisturizer to dry spots (elbows, knees, ankles, wrists, etc.)</li>
            <li> This stuff won&#x27;t dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that some tanning lotions go and make you feel dry</li>
            <li> When you apply it, it has a nice medium thick consistency that smells faintly of coconut, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Invoketress Beauty&#x27;s Natural Organic Sunless Tanning Lotion for the past month now.</li>
            <li> exfoliate first and then put on a thin layer of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Still a little splotchy if you&#x27;re not real careful.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely buy this product again down the road.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take as long to dry as some other sunless tanning products do.  </li>
            <li> , I was careful to test it on a small area, but it does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So I felt slimy and sticky basically all night, which was something I never had happen with the other not natural self tanners.</li>
            <li> IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER TO WORK WITH  AND WASN&#x27;T SO THICK!</li>
            <li> At least for my skin, lotions are usually the most tedious and more likely to leave me with streaks and dirty looking elbows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but the bottle is a lot bigger than all the others I purchased, and a little bit does cover a lot of area.</li>
            <li> For me the resulting tan could have been a little darker, and it did not last a week unless reapplied.  </li>
            <li> This smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty sunless tanning lotion smell.</li>
            <li> I am partial to to the smell of coconut which this has</li>
            <li> and hesitant because it&#x27;s a lotion (harder to see when blending equals streaks) but</li>
            <li> As it continues to work, you do NOT get that gross fake tanner smell on your skin that most products leave behind.</li>
            <li> When I was changing at the gym a few hours later, my legs looked like I&#x27;d spent a couple of days at the beach.  </li>
            <li> Gives a subtle, even tan that looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> and when I say numerous, I mean NUMEROUS!</li>
            <li> I brought another brand that was rated high at the same time and waited a week in between and tried the other and got the same unhappy results-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had results that left me with no color, little color, deep color, and the dreadful oompah loompa, burnt orange color that has left me scrubbing my skin for days more than a handful of times.</li>
            <li> In my youth all these things did was turn your skin some alien orange color, but companies have come a long long way since then.  </li>
            <li> Subtle natural color</li>
            <li> It gradually builds your tan, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> also a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not stink like all other self tanners that I used...</li>
            <li> Customer service is extremely responsive should you have any questions.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I only used a small amount.</li>
            <li> It leaves no streaks like all of the other sunless tanning products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try even though this is not exactly the season where I&#x27;m wearing shorts, and basically all I can say is that it works.</li>
            <li> To test its tanning ability I applied it to one leg but not the other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous sunless tanning products over the past decade...</li>
            <li> Other skin products, both in the shower and out contribute to the time frame range.</li>
            <li> Endlessly did...</li>
            <li> Keep it out of the eyes, mouth, and other mucous membranes.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after reading other favorable reviews.</li>
            <li> LAST NIGHT, I MIXED THE TANNING LOTION WITH SOME THIN COCOA BUTTER LOTION.  </li>
            <li> It smells like regular tanning lotion, goes on easily, is not overly greasy, and works!  </li>
            <li> leave my freckles way too dark.  </li>
            <li> , I admit I was skeptical on how something organic would really work (organic can tan?)</li>
            <li> Only negative, if you want to call it that, is that because it is creamy, it doesn&#x27;t spill out of the bottle with ease.</li>
            <li> To my surprise the color is gave me after one thin application looked extremely natural with no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> few common-sense precautions should be heeded: Be careful not to let the lotion accumulate in wrinkles or creases, as those areas will turn darker than the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking probably would get let down again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the scent/odor, though it did necome very faint, barely noticeable after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> , I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on the other,</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products over the years and have put up with the terrible smell and orange color.</li>
            <li> I have found that every single sunless tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used besides this one had a pretty bad smell.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to appear freakishly tanned, but a little pigment and glow helps.  </li>
            <li> I have pale skin and freckles and wanted to make my legs look less blotchy.</li>
            <li> My wife had noticeably darker skin within a few hours with little to no streaking.  </li>
            <li> that I hope it lasts a few days and</li>
            <li> I did mix it half &amp; half with a water base lotion to get just a mild tan.</li>
            <li> few pointers I took notice of</li>
            <li> every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Admittedly I waiting for a few days after receiving this to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, near my knee I failed to apply it evenly, and I got orange blobs around my knee.  </li>
            <li> The color seemed to deepen and after a few days it has not faded.</li>
            <li> I am pale</li>
            <li> and I was so afraid of what this new one would do to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand you can think of... fake bake, jergens, sublime glow, australian gold, spray tans etc.</li>
            <li> It usually takes 5 mins to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t put sunless tanners on my face.</li>
            <li> I usually spray tan in the versa spa</li>
            <li> The only other bad thing about this was that I never felt like it dried.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and it takes a lot for my skin to show any bronzing or color.</li>
            <li> AND TOO HARD</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t the least bit orange, there were no streaks, and no contrasting line where the lotion stopped.  </li>
            <li> but NO WAY WAS I LET DOWN! !!</li>
            <li> I mean.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that the results are subtle</li>
            <li> and I do so an increase in color - not in a way that looks fake, just a slight darkening.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t watery or thin and wasn&#x27;t too thick either.</li>
            <li> She has tried other sunless tanning lotions in past but was disappointed with the streaking, odor, and/or lack of results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very delicate and goes away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t just write a review to give false hope.</li>
            <li> Went on beautifully, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Still, it is always a bit nerve wracking to try out a new sunless tanner because things could go horribly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give dramatic color, so</li>
            <li> No streaking or weird color</li>
            <li> This product sadly did not work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m Over-the-Top Impressed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am afraid of skin cancer and refuse to lay out.</li>
            <li> Results were commonly artificial looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try this, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> so I worried that it would look very fake or orange.</li>
            <li> I went for a walk in the heat and Sun and started to sweat bad and was thinking</li>
            <li> I know; I&#x27;m as shocked as you are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, but it looks horrible!  </li>
            <li> But the product does not work for me :(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m often expecting to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t give a tan, but did get my a rash. :-(</li>
            <li> The one thing that I hated about these lotions when I had occasion to use to use off and on during the 60s and the 70s was that after applying, your hands were all greasy.</li>
            <li> My body has tendency to develop this horrible, stinky smell ...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it but it is no different than what I have gotten at the store. I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t have the smell but it does.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I mix it with my regular lotion to spread it evenly. It gives nice, delicate, natural looking color.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stink like all other self tanners that I used...and I used every brand on this planet. My body has tendency to develop this horrible, stinky smell ...This one is all good!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Smells great, which was one of the big concerns I&#x27;ve had with several other self tanners.  The true test was wearing white running socks the next day and no stain. This all natural product feels healthy on my skin and looks like  a natural sun induced tan.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Better than promised in the advertisement.  No streaking or weird color and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I don’t tan. Well – I should say – I did tan, and still can, but I tend to use SPF 50 ad end up burned after about 40 minutes in constant exposure.  Years ago I would burn, it would turn to tan and then I’d be tan for a longwhile – and I did the tanning booths because I didn’t like my very fair skin with little pigment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So – self tanner, aside from the ‘orange-y’ look that happens with so many, was an option, but I just never found one that didn’t look ‘fake’ and give my skin a tan that is not close to my natural ‘gold kissed’ color that happens with a sun-induced tan. This one does – not only does it not overwhelm with that ‘self-tanner’ odor, and carries a pleasant coconut smell, it is easy to apply, moisturizes, doesn’t sting or cause my skin to itch, and when applied carefully – taking particular caution with dryer patches (knees, ankles, elbows) there was no marked discoloration that makes so many of the self-tanners ‘look’ fake.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color – and expected that it would be reasonably short-lived with only 3 – 5 day lifespan, but it’s managed to work for me for 10 days before fading – and I’ve showered and swam regularly.  Not tested on animals, simple to apply and a beautiful result – there is no need for me to consider another option, and keep my skin free from the damage associated with tanning beds and the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of the product from the manufacturer for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and the resulting tan is very natural looking.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t stain your hands as long as you wash them thoroughly after apply the lotion.  It didn&#x27;t take as long to dry as some other sunless tanning products do.  The only reason that I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is because it does have a scent (or odor), depending upon your point of view.  I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the scent/odor, though it did necome very faint, barely noticeable after a few hours.  This product was given to me for the purpose of writing this review but I would buy it again anyway because of the beautiful glow it gives my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  I have tried many self tanners over the years.  I am fair skinned with freckles and most tanners leave my freckles way too dark.  Invoketress Beauty not only doesn&#x27;t over darken my freckles, it leaves me with a beautiful natural looking tan that lasts days longer than any other self tanner I have used.  Oh, and that odd smell most tanners have, not this one; I do not smell anything except a slight coconut scent that fades almost immediately.  I personally love that it does not have a color guide, it is just a white cream that develops in a few hours without streaks.  I have not noticed any staining on my clothes or sheets.  Try this, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I have purchased over 5 different brands of Natural Tanning lotions for my girlfriend. This one is the best. It works. It lasts. It doesn&#x27;t stink, or come off. If you are diligent in exfoliating and rubbing it in thoroughly it works great. It smells good.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but the bottle is a lot bigger than all the others I purchased, and a little bit does cover a lot of area. My girlfriend actually got upset when it ran out and begged me to order another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It is also Organic and Natural- The company confirmed this when I asked.</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;old &#x27;olive skin and have spent many years in the sun which caused sun damage. Been using tanning lotion for the last 5 years,but it always turns orange and not fond of the odor. Natural organic gives a natural color and there is no odor and it leaves my skin soft. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My bottle arrived today and the word organic is nowhere on the bottle or in the ingredient list.  False advertising at its best. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this sunless tanning lotion! It&#x27;s my new favorite. It provided a natural-looking and sun kissed glow. No streaking either. I love how it&#x27;s all natural/organic &amp; how I could wear it overnight without the lotion staining my clothes/bed sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a video review of my first-hand experience and results on my YouTube channel - here is the link for the video below if you want to check it out:&lt;br /&gt;https://youtu.be/7_DP7XsgT-E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife for mother&#x27;s day.  After years of using tanning beds, she&#x27;s concerned with the dangers, but still wants to be tan.  She has tried other sunless tanning lotions in past but was disappointed with the streaking, odor, and/or lack of results.  She had no such issues with the Invoketress lotion.  It smells like regular tanning lotion, goes on easily, is not overly greasy, and works!  My wife had noticeably darker skin within a few hours with little to no streaking.  I will definitely purchase more of this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only self tanners I have used that does not make my skin itch.  I am partial to to the smell of coconut which this has so I was happy about that. For me the resulting tan could have been a little darker, and it did not last a week unless reapplied.  The result is a natural looking tan though, and it was way better than a very expensive self tanner I had tried.</li>
            <li> Tried so many sunless tanning products that claim everything under the sun but didn&#x27;t produce. I ordered this product thinking probably would get let down again but NO WAY WAS I LET DOWN! !! After the four hours like it said I was tanned with a real looking tan! !! And when it says waterproof they aren&#x27;t kidding. ..I went for a walk in the heat and Sun and started to sweat bad and was thinking oh no I&#x27;ll have to reapply it all over again. . Well to my surprise I didn&#x27;t have to do anything! !!! Went home cooled off and I&#x27;ll be darn it didn&#x27;t streak where I had sweated and no spotty marks or anything. ... and the color is fabulous and real! !!!! Thank you for actually making the best sunless tanning lotion in the world! !!!! And thank you for actually making a product that goes beyond its claim. .. my forever new tanning lotion! !!! I&#x27;m very picky and realistic about things and I don&#x27;t just write a review to give false hope. ... if you haven&#x27;t tried this sunless lotion I STRONGLY suggest you do! !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied the lotion twice and achieved a perfect glow that looks natural without any streaks. I love that I can control the depth of the color and my ankles and knees look natural as well. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I realized this is not as natural as I thought and will never put on my skin again. I revoke my pervious review on this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Provides a natural looking tan. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This sunless tanning lotion is by far the best.  I&#x27;ve tried many others that have turned my face orange.  Not this product.  It gives a nice even, subtle tan.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not overpowering, spreads like a moisturizer.  Gives a subtle, even tan that looks very natural.  I have only used it on my legs.  I probably need to reapply every 4 or 5 days. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Smells like coconut, very pleasant and easy to use, I thought I&#x27;d get a bit more color</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, but it looks horrible!  I followed everything to a T!! I am so orange and blotchy!  Very embarrassed.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and one application gave me a nice sun-kissed glow!  I will probably apply again to get a darker shade for the beach but one application gave a beautiful color - no orange!  This self-tanner also smells really nice too - it doesn&#x27;t give off that typical chemical smell.  I&#x27;m very happy with the natural ingredients and will definitely purchase again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and used it on one leg to test it out and so far I love it!! I have very sensitive skin and other tanners have made me break out but this one is great, no negative effects!The smell is a nice coconut like smell compared to the typical self tanners and also didn&#x27;t make my skin orange. Looking forward to using on whole body!</li>
            <li> This self tanner is great. Easy to apply and the tan looks very natural. I am pale so I worried that it would look very fake or orange. Not so. Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Happy that it&#x27;s natural and not tested on animals.  I find an immediate shade darker in one application.  It helps blend my &amp;#34;farmer&#x27;s tan&amp;#34; well with the rest of my tanned body.  Just try not to cross over the tan line when applying or there will be a noticeable orange like in those areas.  Otherwise, if careful, cannot tell the difference between the real tan and the applied areas.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is a great self tanner! Easy to use with no streaking.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty sunless tanning lotion smell. Results after about 4 hours of application.</li>
            <li> Very unusual to find a tanning product that has natural ingredients that are not harmful to your body.  Color is very natural-looking, smells good, and smoothed out my uneven tan. Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery!  This lotion has a delightful fragrance, and tans so well.  Really love the ease of application.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Just a beautiful shade,  no orange at all.  Great smell!  I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to love this I guess my skin tone was not a match for this. I have orange streaks all over my knees. I won&#x27;t give this a low rating due to the scent and the timely matter it came. But the product does not work for me :(</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Thought it was impossible to get natural tanned color, with healthy ingredients for skin, AND a pleasant smell. This product has it all! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Color is buildable; ingredients leave skin soft; and the smell is light, not at all like other self-tanners w/DHA. Customer service is extremely responsive should you have any questions.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have tried what seems like every sunless tanner out there and I&#x27;m often expecting to be disappointed. Although, I&#x27;ve only done one application I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised! It&#x27;s an even, golden coverage and looks quite natural. I read the reviews and others claimed it was a natural glow as well so I figured that meant it would be a light color, again pleasantly surprised by the depth (not dark, but not light).&lt;br /&gt;My hopes are high in that I hope it lasts a few days and the color is buildable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product! I&#x27;m glad I stumbled across it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product sadly did not work for me. Followed the directions given and still came out very patchy and orange and I only used a small amount. Will not be reordering.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve tried every brand you can think of... fake bake, jergens, sublime glow, australian gold, spray tans etc. I am very pale and it takes a lot for my skin to show any bronzing or color. I am not an outdoor tanning girl... I am afraid of skin cancer and refuse to lay out. This bottle lasted me about 2 months, I also put it on every night/ every couple of nights especially after shower. Best moisturizer ever! Best color ever! I wipe my hands well after full application and then wash them with soap and water then dry them,  then I put a regular lotion on my hands and wrists to prevent any discoloration in the area &amp; works like a charm! WILL KEEP BUYING!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first sunless tanning product that I have used that actually works and doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange  This product smells great too!  I would recommend to exfoliate prior to using for maximum results.  In addition, I also recommend to use gloves when applying, as with any sunless tanning product. I love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product!  Thank you for making a sunless tanner that is nontoxic, for people with sensitive skin.  I have lupus, and I can’t be out in the sun.  I enjoy having a sun-kissed glow, but so many of the sunless tanning products are full of toxic chemicals and strong fragrances that bother my skin.  Your product has made it possible for me to have that “glow” in a way that looks and feels healthy, while providing wonderful moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li> smells great! not messy! easy to put on! I love it!!</li>
            <li> Awesome sunless tanning lotion. Best I have ever used.  It gradually builds your tan, but a little goes a long way. Smells great, not like typical sunless tanners. No streaking at all gives super good coverage with nice color that looks natural, even around knees, elbows and ankles.  This company has finally got it right.!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanner! It leaves no streaks like all of the other sunless tanning products I have tried. I have fair skin and this works great for me. This is the second time I have purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice and absorbed well. I left in on overnight for 8+ hours and did not notice any change in color in the morning. Great as a moisturizer but my quest for a natural tanner without all the nasty parabens/fragrance/dyes continues!</li>
            <li> This Organic Sunless Tanning Lotion is amazing, Just a hint of coconut and the lotion leaves your skin silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this Sunless Lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I think this is a fantastic product. I have used it twice and had perfect results both times. The color on my skin lats much longer than other products I have tried. I think this will be a permanent part of my beauty ritual :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural self tanner. I found this one and ordered it, although after I ordered it, I found one that has even better ingredients (Caribbean Solutions Beach Colours self tanner) than this one, so I will finish this and start using the new product. Anyways, the first thing I noticed from this is that is doesn&#x27;t smell like 1000 chemicals! It smells pleasant, kind of like coconut! The bottle is a good size. The tanner is white, which tells you it isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals. The thing I noticed about this was that it does take a while to rub in. It&#x27;s kind of like sun tan lotion where you have to rub it in really well for the white color to go into your skin. The only other bad thing about this was that I never felt like it dried. I always do self tanning right before bed. So I felt slimy and sticky basically all night, which was something I never had happen with the other not natural self tanners. I believe that since it never really dried, there is a large white spot on my leg where it rubbed off on the sheets) But I do have a nice tan color now! It works very well! I am a very pale person though, so if you are very pale as well (as in, people comment on your white legs or ask if you are sick), this will work great for you! lol. GREAT natural alternative! :) You will like it!</li>
            <li> Great subtle, natural difference after one application.  Great smell, doesn&#x27;t stain your hands.  Looking forward to continued use for a deeper &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  :)</li>
            <li> Very nice. I did mix it half &amp; half with a water base lotion to get just a mild tan. Which looks must more real on these old white legs. Have used several others that were ok but not nearly as good as this one. Jennifer (from this company) followed up on my order and gave me tips on this product. That is just unheard of service and they have a grateful new customer Just used the reorder with more input from the company and still good stuff</li>
            <li> As a very fair skinned guy who stays out of the sun I thought I would give this a shot. To my surprise the color is gave me after one thin application looked extremely natural with no adverse effects. I would recommend this product to any friend who wants a safe tanning alternative.</li>
            <li> To be natural, for the price, amount you get and its looks good! Smell lingers a bit for a day after but that&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s not bad. Still totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Great product .&lt;br /&gt;Before applying exfoliate, then apply it with gloves. The color is very natural. I used to get orange with auto tanners but this product gives an amazing glow. Very natural</li>
            <li> Still a little splotchy if you&#x27;re not real careful. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It works as described makes your skin soft, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Really like this self-tanner so far.  There&#x27;s no tint to it, so it can be tricky to make sure you&#x27;ve covered every bit of skin, but if you&#x27;re used to using self-tanners then you probably know how to make sure you&#x27;re getting every bit covered.  The smell is really nice...coconutty, and there&#x27;s is very of the &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; smell.  The color takes quite a while to develop...I didn&#x27;t think it was working for quite a while, but once it did, it was very nice, even, not streaky or orange.  The color lasted for a few days, not quite as long as all the other reviews are saying it lasts, but re-application will keep the color nice.  It isn&#x27;t very dark, so I applied daily for several days to get a shade closer to what I like.  Would prefer if it was darker with only one application, however.  As it fades, I did see a few patchy spots, but could probably avoid this with better exfoliation.  Haven&#x27;t tried working out after color develops to see if sweating affects it yet...will be doing that soon.</li>
            <li> My husband and I started using the sunless tanning lotion, and we love it!! We have used 3 applications so far, and our tan looks so natural. We are so pale to begin with, and this is giving us a really nice natural golden tan. I love how it has organic and natural ingredients. I have already told my mom and sister about it and they plan on purchasing a bottle as well. It is a wonderfully designed product!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. It does everything it said in the description.  No streaks, lasts 4-6 days, smells good to me. This,  IMO, is an under - marketed product that is a total winner.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few times that I used a sunless tanning loation and seen amazing results within hours. This season I decided to do sunless tanning lotions instead of going to the tanning salon. Using the loation is 1000x safer as your not exposed to uv lights and risking skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product atleast 2-3 times a week and seen a difference after the first use within hours I was darker. One thing to take into consideration is make sure to wash your hands immediately after applying or your palms will be tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This natural sunless tanning lotion gave me a bronzed sunkissed look and did not turn my skin orange. I get compliments all the time from people asking if I was on vacation because of how dark it made me and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few pointers I took notice of that helped me out when using this for the first time was Exfoliate 20-30 minutes before application. If shaving your legs, make sure to wait for the pores to close before applying the product to avoid spotting (15-20 mins).Also if applying after shaving dont do it right away because it will leave your legs looking stubbly. Thats why they say to wait. Then, apply moisturizer to dry spots (elbows, knees, ankles, wrists, etc.) For best results, apply 20-30 minutes before going to bed. Make sure your skin is dry before getting dressed as it may get on your clothes. It usually takes 5 mins to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunless tanning lotion is waterproof. Results will last about 5 days before you notice fading, thats why I try to keep up with it every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for all skin types and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;You could also get a tanning mit or gloves to rub it on to avoide getting your palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Perfect for prom, weddings, vacations, or everyday use! Plus, this self tanner is so natural-looking you will have heads turning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invoketress Sunless Tanning Lotion is made with high quality botanical, naturally derived, ORGANIC ingredients including Vitamin E, Shea Butter, and Natural Oils.Vitamin E is an antioxidant and Shea Butter has deep moisturizing and skin rejuvenated.ts including Vitamin E, Shea Butter, and Natural Oils.Vitamin E is an antioxidant and Shea Butter has deep moisturizing and skin rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is subtle, providing a nice gradual change in skin tone and color. Very easy to apply. I followed the recommended application instructions and exfoliated and didn&#x27;t apply immediately after shaving. It does have the mild scent that other sunless tanning products have but it is not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, even tanning. More like a moisturizer than a tanner. Lovely and natural. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this tanning lotion. It feels good on the body and delivers a nice even tan. I usually don&#x27;t put sunless tanners on my face. When I applied this lotion to my legs and upper body, it felt so soothing that I didn&#x27;t have second thoughts about putting it on my face. I rubbed the lotion into my whole face including my eyelids, no burning or irritation.  This lotion can be applied anywhere on the body for a medium tan and moisturizers really well. The first application wasn&#x27;t quite dark enough so I did one more application and it was perfect for me. I will definitely buy again. Thanks for marketing such a great product.</li>
            <li> I like that this lotion smells really good and has lots of natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this Natural Sunless Tanning Lotion and am so happy to have come across a vegan tanning lotion like this one! My skin tone is very fair so I just wanted a natural even tan and this product did just that. It has a nice light scent and is very smooth in application. The customer service is excellent and the tips they provided helped a lot to assure a nice, even, natural tan. It&#x27;s a really alternative to frying in the sun and I will definitely buy this product again down the road.</li>
            <li> Back when I was growing up sunless tanning lotions were sort of a joke - and everybody knew it. Results were commonly artificial looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I gave this a try even though this is not exactly the season where I&#x27;m wearing shorts, and basically all I can say is that it works. After I tried it on, the next morning I had a natural looking tan and there were no negative repercussions. Some observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ Not greasy...very easy to apply. The one thing that I hated about these lotions when I had occasion to use to use off and on during the 60s and the 70s was that after applying, your hands were all greasy. This washes off your hands easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ Lightly scented. Like lotions of 50 years ago, it has a coconut scent. But fortunately, it&#x27;s light and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ Has a lot of ingredients that are conducive to healthy skin. This stuff won&#x27;t dry out your skin and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritations or itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s winter and if you&#x27;re not getting a whole lot of sun, this is an option for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided free in exchange for an impartial review.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Endlessly sunless tanning lotion and I am pleased with the results. I had not used sunless lotions for some time because of the rub off factor so was a little skeptical, but Endlessly gave me a nice even golden look. I am very pleased and will continue using it. I have already recommended it to friends. I also like the non-chemical aspect, something I feel we should all try to avoid.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time proponent of sunless tanning products.  In my youth all these things did was turn your skin some alien orange color, but companies have come a long long way since then.  Still, it is always a bit nerve wracking to try out a new sunless tanner because things could go horribly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was provided with this free review sample I was eager to try it though nervous as well.  In the winter I look like a bottle of elmers glue.  I don&#x27;t want to appear freakishly tanned, but a little pigment and glow helps.  Admittedly I waiting for a few days after receiving this to give it a try.  I already have a sunless tanner that I love and I was so afraid of what this new one would do to me.  Well, I have used it four times now and I have to say that the results are subtle, just what I like.  I no longer look like Elmer&#x27;s but neither do I look I just returned from a month in the bahamas.  This is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliate first and then put on a thin layer of moisturizer.  Then this Sunless tanner goes on.  Thanks to coconut oil, it smells like the tropics.  It goes on smooth and creamy and feels substantial but does not leave my skin feeling sticky or mushy.  My skin feels good after a day of having this on.  I have not seen any streaking either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder whether those of you who want a darker tan could get that by applying more of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  If you are looking for a subtle self tanner that looks good and leaves your skin happy and smooth, this is a great product.  And here&#x27;s a plus....  not tested on animals!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion does indeed tan my skin when applied correctly.  To test its tanning ability I applied it to one leg but not the other.  Overnight, the leg with the lotion applied had turn a very light brown.  Continuing to apply it nightly would have brought it to as deep a tan as I might wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution, however.  This lotion should be applied evenly and lightly.  Apparently, near my knee I failed to apply it evenly, and I got orange blobs around my knee.  The key to getting a beautiful tan is to apply the lotion lightly every couple of nights, and watch the tan build.  Watch what you&#x27;re doing to be sure you&#x27;ve got the lotion evenly and lightly applied.  You&#x27;ll have a bronzed body in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOUR STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, but I love how easily the lotion applies.  I&#x27;ve noticed that some tanning lotions go and make you feel dry, however this one actually makes you feel moisturized.  It didn&#x27;t give dramatic color, so this one you would use more to get desired color.  It seems like the product will last longer than many lotions do.</li>
            <li> I have applied it twice the smell is great doesn&#x27;t leave that tan smell but I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in color....couple questions ....when i shower do i exfoliate again or no? ...and if i keep applying will it build getting darker?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find cruelty-free makeup let alone something like tanner, so when I read the good reviews my very pale self ordered. This product is FANTASTIC! It goes on better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried and it really holds its color. Terrific &amp;#34;sun tan lotion&amp;#34; fragrance, too! I&#x27;ll be buying this again and again.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried several over the years.  I can put my clothes on right after spreading the lotion all over, and washing my hands...no streaks, no marks on clothes, no problems at all!  I also purchased a bottle for my 20 year old daughter, fantastic!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in only 2 days and was easy to use, kind to my skin and gave me a natural golden tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous sunless tanning products over the past decade...and when I say numerous, I mean NUMEROUS! Creams, lotions, sprays, mists, and foams from the inexpensive to costly for use at home and in-salon. I&#x27;ve had results that left me with no color, little color, deep color, and the dreadful oompah loompa, burnt orange color that has left me scrubbing my skin for days more than a handful of times. In all honesty, no sunless tanner is perfect (at least out of the numerous I&#x27;ve tried), but it&#x27;s so wonderful when you find one that works well for you and your skin.&lt;br /&gt;When I was given the opportunity to try Invoketress Beauty&#x27;s Natural Organic Sunless Tanning Lotion, I admit I was skeptical on how something organic would really work (organic can tan?) and hesitant because it&#x27;s a lotion (harder to see when blending equals streaks) but even more so I was excited to try something new...and WOW!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Over-the-Top Impressed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just opening the bottle put me on a tropical beach with its light scent of fresh coconut and shea butter. At least for my skin, lotions are usually the most tedious and more likely to leave me with streaks and dirty looking elbows. This lotion is a light cream color and when applied rubs onto my skin where it looks like I have to keep rubbing to blend it in but then disappears rather quickly. Even though my skin felt instantly soft and supple, I thought for sure I would have streak marks once the tanning developed. After one, full-body application, (that took less than ten minutes from start to getting dressed), my skin began to show a very light sun glow within a few hours and peaked fully developed at about 18-24 hours and NOT ONE STREAK on my body! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! My clothes didn&#x27;t have any rub off or discoloration, either! Just an all-over face and body perfectly sun-kissed tan! Most family and friends noticed and complimented my tanned skin within minutes of seeing me; all wanting to know where I was, what I did, or what I used.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached before and after photos below. Even though they don&#x27;t capture the overall full beauty results of this sunless tanner, as noticed in person, you can still see there are differences in color, glow, tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Invoketress Beauty&#x27;s Natural Organic Sunless Tanning Lotion for the past month now. My skin not only looks good and healthy, it feels good and healthy! It has officially been added to my sunless tanner favorites lists! I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, keep in mind that all natural skin colors, types, textures, etc. are different, so sunless tanners will therefore develop differently, too. I find it best to apply sunless tanners about 20-30 minutes after I shower when my skin is dry but still has that water suppleness. Exfoliating is always in my regimen, but I make sure to always do it the couple days before I&#x27;m going to apply, especially when I want to have my sunless tan for a special occasion. In my personal experience with Invoketress Beauty, one application lasts me with the sun-kissed color a full four to five days and then fading begins with tan color completely gone after eight to ten days. Other skin products, both in the shower and out contribute to the time frame range. A second application on day two gives my skin a deeper tanned sun-kissed color and glow...just the perfect color for me...and lasts on the longer time frame ranges. I&#x27;ve applied a coat to my full face and body four times this past month and still have more than half a bottle of lotion. My toenails were not painted the first time I used it, so I had tanning under the nails in some areas where the lotion seeped under which I easily fixed (hid) with a coat of nail polish. The cuticles and skin surrounding my toenails were not darkened but I always take a rung, wet rag and gently wipe this area of my nails after applying any sunless tanner, as well as the bottom of my feet and palms of my hands. A pumice stone or similar hard foot scrubber easily removes any areas that may have been missed and end up darker. A light buff of the nails with a file or buffer removes any discoloring on them that may have occurred, too. Gentle and/or heavy exfoliating creams can help most areas of the skin that need correcting. For skin areas that are much noticeably darker after sunless tanner fully develops, I&#x27;ve found that a dry and/or water-moistened magic eraser works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to contact me directly with any questions. I&#x27;m always happy to help!&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: I received this product in exchange for my honest review.imilar hard foot scrubber easily removes any areas that may have been missed and end up darker.

            <li> Amazing product! Works fast,  looks great and doesn&#x27;t rub on your clothes. Best self tanner I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and the golden color it provided. I have tried many different products over the years and have put up with the terrible smell and orange color. I was really impressed with this.  I brought another brand that was rated high at the same time and waited a week in between and tried the other and got the same unhappy results- it just doesn&#x27;t seem to want to change my legs. Endlessly did... It is great, I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on the other,</li>
            <li> Have used many self tanners in the past with issues.  This product is so goes on very easily.  Does not smell and does not have the orange color, looks more of a natural glow. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ll be buying this for my tanning needs now</li>
            <li> Great product and color and love that it&#x27;s waterproof. I had been looking for something not full of chemicals. My skin is already pretty tanned but I have vitiligo so I apply the tanner to those spots so they aren&#x27;t such a bright white color.</li>
            <li> Endlessly Beautiful Sunless Tanning Lotion is just what it is suppose to be. I have pale skin and freckles and wanted to make my legs look less blotchy. It was easy to apply and resulted a light, even tan that looks absolutely natural. Plus, I love that it is vegan.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t give a tan, but did get my a rash. :-(</li>
            <li> Great product and lasting tan!! I have used many self tanners in the past and this one is the BEST! Great smell too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love it:)</li>
            <li> I love that this product is all natural. It leaves a nice &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; that lasts a few days. I always get compliments the day after I use it. It can leave streaks so make sure you skin is moisturized and it does get that musty sunless tan lotion smell after awhile. But, I think it is a great product and will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market.  It&#x27;s nor really a lotion; it&#x27;s a cream that is white out of the bottle.  The fragrance is like a high end skin cream; it&#x27;s tropical, with coconut and pineapple notes.  It&#x27;s very delicate and goes away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a quarter sized glob on each leg right after showering, and promptly forgot I&#x27;d used it.  When I was changing at the gym a few hours later, my legs looked like I&#x27;d spent a couple of days at the beach.  The color was so natural, and exactly the color of my skin with a slight tan.  My skin wasn&#x27;t the least bit orange, there were no streaks, and no contrasting line where the lotion stopped.  It looked so natural I had to stop and think if I&#x27;d actually been out in the sun somewhere.  Remembering thai I live in Ohio, and it&#x27;s December convinced me that this lotion was the reason for my great and sudden tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two standout qualities of this stuff that deserve to be repeated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not turn your skin orange.  The color is exactly the way your skin looks after a few hours in the sun; not dark, no streaks, no line where the cream leaves off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no chemical smell.  At all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with the results and would recommend this to anyone looking for a great sunless tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> Smells great! Subtle natural color</li>
            <li> The creamy sunless tanning lotion provides a very even and natural-looking tan that would normally take me several weeks of daily sunbathing to achieve, but without any of the harmful effects of excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The active ingredient is dihydroxyacetone, which simply stains the cells in the outer layer of the skin; it is approved by the FDA for this use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using it for the first time, I was careful to test it on a small area, but it does not irritate my sensitive skin. The very helpful tips for use recommend that the lotion be applied and left on overnight after a light exfoliation, but I bathe after four to six hours, and my skin still continues to darken overnight. The color does start to slowly fade after a few days, but a light application will renew the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a mild, sweet fragrance with a hint of the shea and cocoa butters in the formula. It is very soothing and moisturizing when applied and would make a nice everyday lotion, if it didn&#x27;t darken the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few common-sense precautions should be heeded: Be careful not to let the lotion accumulate in wrinkles or creases, as those areas will turn darker than the surrounding skin. Keep it out of the eyes, mouth, and other mucous membranes. Continue to use sunscreen as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invoketress Beauty provided a bottle of lotion for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> The Invoketress Beauty Sunless Tanning Lotion is the best that I have ever tried.  The first time I used it only on my legs but the color was even, not orange and the product had a slight but pleasant scent.  About a week later I used the product on my legs and my arms and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT ! I HAVE USED IT SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY, BUT I FELT THE TANNING LOTION WAS TOO CONCENTRATED AND TOO HARD TO REMOVE IF I MESSED UP. LAST NIGHT, I MIXED THE TANNING LOTION WITH SOME THIN COCOA BUTTER LOTION.  FOR ME, THIS MIXTURE MADE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE. IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER TO WORK WITH  AND WASN&#x27;T SO THICK! I USED LATEX GLOVES TO APPLY THE MIXTURE EVENLY. I NEEDED TO WORK QUICKLY SINCE IT DRIES SO FAST. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PURCHASING IT FROM THIS TERRIFIC COMPANY.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after reading other favorable reviews. I have tried many tanning lotions and towels and this is my favorite by far. When you apply it, it has a nice medium thick consistency that smells faintly of coconut, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. As it continues to work, you do NOT get that gross fake tanner smell on your skin that most products leave behind. It gave me a nice, even brown tan that was somewhat subtle but got darker with more applications. Follow their suggestions of exfoliating, moisturizing and waiting 20 min under after you shave. I already reordered and I&#x27;m happy I did. My skin is normally very fair and I was able to build up to a believable, nice tan look.</li>
            <li> Ive tried soooo many self tan lotions,both high end and cheap. This is for sure one of my new favorites. It smells amazing,like fresh coconut. The lotion goes on white and you really need to work it in...also a little goes a long way. I do my applications before bed and I woke up with a nice light even tan. The color seemed to deepen and after a few days it has not faded. If you love a fake tan like me then don&#x27;t hesitate trying this awesome lotion!!!! Oh and your skin feels silky smooth after :)</li>
            <li> Great product!  Not stinky, lovely soft color, long-lasting.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Went on beautifully, not sticky at all. Turned a lovely golden brown color, not orange at all. It has been 5 days and the color still looks great! Highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Love it! I first used this a week ago and still have a very natural looking tan. I mixed it 60/40 with lotion and didn&#x27;t get any darker spots around my ankles or knees. Definitely exfoliate first. Will continue to use this instead of laying out! What a healthy, beautiful, time saver!!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It goes on like regular lotion and leaves my skin soft and smooth and in a few hours it turned me light golden brown just like I used to get from hours in the sun when I was younger.  I&#x27;ve been pale as a ghost for a year and this looks natural, like a warm glowing tan.  I&#x27;ll be spreading the word!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. I finally have tanned legs that match the rest of my tanned body  :)</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST sunless tanner I have used!  It looks so natural and goes on easily with no streaking.  I&#x27;ve been complimented on how tan I look, which is all from this bottle.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this is, it is the real deal.  So worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lotion.  It has a nice consistency and goes on very smoothly. It smells nice and light.  The color is very natural looking.  I would recommend it and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions to a &#x27;t&#x27;, as you can easily overdue it.  I was not vigilant enough when applying cream on my feet (must use very sparingly), as the skin just above my toes and on the sides of my feel close to the sole, turned much darker than the top of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any self tanner, you can look orange if you use too much.  I used it twice, a day apart from one application to the other, and it turned out great.  Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft.  I usually spray tan in the versa spa so I wanted a lotion that will get the areas the versa spa missed.  I am very happy with this and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my upcoming wedding....did a trial run, (very easy to apply) and LOVE it!  I am very fair skinned, and it gave me a beautiful, dark, natural-looking, streak free tan.  I am thrilled with the results!!</li>
            <li> This is now my new favorite self-tanner. I think the fact that the product has the consistency of a cream rather than a light lotion may be a large part of why it delivers more even coverage. You really need to massage it into the skin so you are more apt to run the cream over all areas in a more even fashion. I do like this very much and will buy again. Only negative, if you want to call it that, is that because it is creamy, it doesn&#x27;t spill out of the bottle with ease. That is a small price to pay, however, for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product it will give your the prefect tan, without going to tanning bed or outside in the hot sun. After one application I got a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li> The tanning lotion is very good. Did not dry out my skin nor leave any orange streaks. My skin actually feels softer, too. The lotion is white when applied and does take a couple of days to notice a real difference, but the appearance is quite natural looking. I applied it to my face twice daily for a couple of days to catch up to my arms. I highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> I must confess, I&#x27;m really a skeptic when it comes to sunless tanning lotion! I have tried several and between the smells, the orange spots, the greasiness and the overall unpleasantness of it all; I&#x27;ve chosen to stop using them. I just couldn&#x27;t find a good one! I was hesitant to try this Organic Sunless Tanning Lotion but I read such good things about it, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that NONE of the things I just mentioned are an issue with this lotion! I know; I&#x27;m as shocked as you are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the smell, or lack thereof. I have found that every single sunless tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used besides this one had a pretty bad smell. If you have used them, you know the smell I mean. It&#x27;s indescribable but when you smell it, you know what it belongs to! Well this really doesn&#x27;t have that smell! It has a slight scent to it but a pleasant one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on, it didn&#x27;t seem any different than applying a regular lotion. It wasn&#x27;t watery or thin and wasn&#x27;t too thick either. It was just a normal consistency that spread easily and absorbed quickly. The directions say to wait 15 - 20 minutes after shaving and to put regular lotion on any dry spots. I didn&#x27;t really have any dry spots so I just used this in place of my regular lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily it rubbed in and disappeared into my skin. The results say they take up to four hours but I could see it even earlier than that. Here are my legs after one application. I only put on one leg to be able to actually see the difference. As you are looking at the picture, it&#x27;s the one on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing if I used this in place of my regular lotion for several days I would have a nice tan! I love that it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I didn&#x27;t even wait long to get re-dressed. This didn&#x27;t stain my clothes or leave marks anywhere. It really was just like using normal lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was never a huge fan of sunless tanning lotion because of all the yucky side effects but this actually worked really well without turning me orange or leaving a mess anywhere!less tanning lotion because of all the yucky side effects but this actually worked really well without turning me orange or leaving a mess anywhere!</li>
            <li> This really gives a nice color. I did not have any streaks, even though I did not thoroughly exfoliate every time before I used it. I have used it four times on my arms and I do so an increase in color - not in a way that looks fake, just a slight darkening. One thing I don&#x27;t really recommend it for is the face, unless you want to look dark. I used it on my face once and was very surprised how much color I had the next morning. But if those are the results you want, then go for it :).</li>
