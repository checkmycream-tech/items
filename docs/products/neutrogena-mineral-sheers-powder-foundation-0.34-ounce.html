            <li>The coverage is OK</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I loved it, it has SPF 20 and you put it on right over your face creams.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with it so far!    </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin or eyes like mine, you might be ok!!</li>

            <li>The price is definitely right!</li>
            <li>Coverage is great at first but does not last throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent much more on similar products, but at best they work comparably to this brand.  </li>
            <li>I suggest going all natural &amp; preservative &amp; animal testing free :)...</li>
            <li>If nothing else, this is a great little compact to keep in your purse to touch up!</li>
            <li>It really does work nicely though, but if you have the extra money...</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing the Neutrogena Mineral Sheers Powder Foundation, 0.34 Ounce in natural beige for several years and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I really like this powder!</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of powder foundation ...</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to using it, and wish I could leave a positive review...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nanny, so most days we fit in a walk that&#x27;s at least an hour.  </li>
            <li>I use a concealer underneath this foundation, so I can&#x27;t complain too much about that.    </li>
            <li>I use it whenever I am outdoors and it blends in really well.d</li>
            <li>I had used other minerals before, and this one was such a good buy</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to touch up without the mess.  </li>
            <li>Exact product found at my local store...</li>
            <li>Through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save, I have one foundation per month shipped directly to my doorstep.</li>
            <li>Also, I am oriental and chose Natural Beige 60.</li>
            <li>have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>The coverage is a little lighter, so if you&#x27;re someone that likes full coverage this might not be your product.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Makeup Forever available on Amazon or through Sephora.</li>
            <li>The powder is okay, but it&#x27;s a little to dark for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that it lasts longer than Clinique or Bare Minerals has ever lasted for me.  </li>
            <li>Its medium coverage and covers dark circles, acne, and redness really well.</li>
            <li>I went and bought one last week but kept the this one because in the summer, when you need less coverage, it will be fine for everyday use when you aren&#x27;t doing anything fancy or over top of liquid foundation (which I hate because it clogs my pores no matter what the bottle says) for special events.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that it wears off quickly and I seemed to use a lot of this.</li>

            <li> I have been purchasing the Neutrogena Mineral Sheers Powder Foundation, 0.34 Ounce in natural beige for several years and am very pleased with the product. Through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save, I have one foundation per month shipped directly to my doorstep. The price is great, and reliability and convenience is even better!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy from any other brand! Doesn&#x27;t cause break outs!</li>
            <li> This is a product you get what you pay for. I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot so I bought it. The coverage is OK but you still have to use a concealer underneath and it doesn&#x27;t last all day. It&#x27;s not full-coverage if you have freckles. I usually use Makeup Forever available on Amazon or through Sephora. It&#x27;s the best coverage I have found and leaves you truly looking flawless but it cost $32. I went and bought one last week but kept the this one because in the summer, when you need less coverage, it will be fine for everyday use when you aren&#x27;t doing anything fancy or over top of liquid foundation (which I hate because it clogs my pores no matter what the bottle says) for special events.</li>
            <li> I love it, it works great...but I have to give it just 2 stars because the ingredients are a bit harsh. Since I can&#x27;t afford to buy really expensive make up (not yet anyway!), I will have stick to this. It really does work nicely though, but if you have the extra money...I suggest going all natural &amp; preservative &amp; animal testing free :)...A lot of people don&#x27;t know that what you put on your skin is very similar to what you put inside your body as well because you still absorb those toxins/harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and great coverage. Flows off the brush with ease. Feels good on my skin. Light weight feeling.</li>
            <li> Coverage is great at first but does not last throughout the day.  Good if you want light even coverage and don&#x27;t mind re-applying.</li>
            <li> So I will start off by saying that I am someone who usually frequents the more expensive makeups.  I typically wear Clinique or Bare Minerals, but I&#x27;m just getting sick of shelling out so much for cosmetics.  I usually touch up my makeup midday, so I bought this one day when I had accidentally left my makeup bag at home.  I have to say, I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with it so far!    I had been using it just to touch up in the middle of the day, but the last few days I&#x27;ve started with it at the beginning of the day and I&#x27;ve found that it lasts longer than Clinique or Bare Minerals has ever lasted for me.  I say that as someone who is very active.  I&#x27;m a nanny, so most days we fit in a walk that&#x27;s at least an hour.  Even when I wasn&#x27;t a nanny, I had to walk about a mile from Union Station (downtown Chicago) to my work, so even back then I needed something that could last.    This is a great makeup, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for.  For me it&#x27;s great because it stays on and it&#x27;s easy to touch up without the mess.  The price is also hard to beat.  I&#x27;ve spent much more on similar products, but at best they work comparably to this brand.  The coverage is a little lighter, so if you&#x27;re someone that likes full coverage this might not be your product.  I use a concealer underneath this foundation, so I can&#x27;t complain too much about that.    All in all, I think it&#x27;s a great product for a great price.  If nothing else, this is a great little compact to keep in your purse to touch up!</li>
            <li> I had used other minerals before, and this one was such a good buy, that I gave it a try. I loved it, it has SPF 20 and you put it on right over your face creams. It works great, light and clean, and makes you look really nice.  It did not show the wrinkles too badly like other products. I recommend it....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the powder puff being apart from the powder.  The powder is okay, but it&#x27;s a little to dark for me.  I would like a thinner compact without the bulk.</li>
            <li> This foundation made my eyes all red and irritated. I was looking forward to using it, and wish I could leave a positive review... FYI, my skin, eyes and nasal nucous membrane are allergic to perfumes and a lot of other stuff. If you don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin or eyes like mine, you might be ok!! Also, I am oriental and chose Natural Beige 60. The color fitted me well!!</li>
            <li> Exact product found at my local store... It&#x27;s hard to find... online ordering makes it easy and I don&#x27;t have to waste trips to the store when they are out of stock.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price</li>
            <li> I really like this powder! I do not like the feeling of liquid foundation and this powder is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a powder that will not break you out or clog your pores look no further!!&lt;br /&gt;Even Sheer coverage all over.</li>
            <li> I buy these 3-4 at a time.&lt;br /&gt;They are the best all-over face makeup when you don&#x27;t have time to apply foundation.&lt;br /&gt;They cover a multitude!</li>
            <li> Was not exactly in the form that I thought I was buying, but turned out to be workable and I did like the powder look</li>
            <li> Great pressed powder, have used this product for several years now.  The price is definitely right!</li>
            <li> It is advertised as SPF20, yet has no sunscreen in it</li>
            <li> This was the perfect shade for me and it blended really well. You couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing anything. Its medium coverage and covers dark circles, acne, and redness really well. I used this alone everywhere on my face. Sometimes I used a yellow concealer under my eyes and then used this. The only negative is that it wears off quickly and I seemed to use a lot of this. One compact doesn&#x27;t last long for me maybe two months or so. Great price here, but I&#x27;ve found it on sale before in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive acne prone skin and this did not irritate it.</li>
            <li> This foundation is fabulous.  I love it.  Under the powder, it doesn&#x27;t even feel flakely or sticky.  I use it whenever I am outdoors and it blends in really well.d</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of powder foundation ... this is my favorite ... great coverage, color match and feels good on the skin (not heavy) ... love the price as well!</li>
            <li> i love this product because it covers well and its a great price on amazon. in the store it runs about 15.00 dollars and on here i actually signed up for the monthly delivery and get it for under 10.00 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;i also get the darker one for my daughter and she loves it also .</li>
