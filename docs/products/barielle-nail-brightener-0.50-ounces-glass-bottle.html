            <li>Barielle products are great</li>
            <li>They have great service.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what else woman would try to hide on their nails except for ridges, but I don&#x27;t understand the great ratings.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t paint my finger nails bright colors</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>gave my nails a great clean bright finish!  </li>
            <li>Looks nice, but it has a very strong smell!</li>
            <li>She was very pleased.</li>
            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>looks nice and glossy</li>
            <li>gives a nice polished look to my nails,helps hide flaws</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>As for the nail brightener itself, I love it.</li>
            <li>This actually works and looks really great!</li>
            <li>I love it as an every day wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooooooooo PLEASED.</li>
            <li>This is more opaque, creamy looking, and I like it.</li>
            <li>Just one coat makes my nails look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>It gives your nails a purpleish tinge - which isn&#x27;t a whitener or brightner, more of an allusion which still isn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love the polish.</li>
            <li>It almost made them stand out more.  </li>
            <li>and it gives a cleaner, brighter, more \\&quot;polished\\&quot; look, so to speak.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>Beautiful on it&#x27;s own (two coats) or works as a WONDERFUL base coat.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries in seconds.</li>
            <li>It looks very pretty on the nail, but it is so strong that I don&#x27;t think I can continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I keep this in my purse, I love it that much.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a quick pick up when I don&#x27;t have time for  a full manicure</li>
            <li>It brightens and lightens the color of your nail just a bit for a very natural, healthy look.  </li>
            <li>I used it frequently because it would not remain on the nails for more than a day.</li>
            <li>Bought this on a whim because the price was right</li>
            <li>also important, as I have a toddler and rarely have time to watch paint dry, if you will :)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>considerably more than I normally pay for polish, but worth every extra penny.</li>
            <li>so she relies on me to track down unusual products like this which she finds to be exceptional.</li>
            <li>This color didn&#x27;t look natural and after a day my nails kind of started to look yellow after wearing it.</li>
            <li>I like a more natural look for my fingernails, and mainly because I don&#x27;t have time for frequent manicures/maintenance.</li>
            <li>I would love this product if I could wear it without smelling it all day long!!!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t work for me, kind of a waste of $$.  </li>
            <li>, it gives my nails a lovely pink shine.  </li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>It also dries extremely fast...</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nada to hide my ridges.  </li>
            <li>The price isn&#x27;t crazy, either, which is very nice !  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to be my new neutral nail polish!</li>
            <li>The package was crushed when I received it, but the bottle was fine.</li>
            <li>It was nothing more than plain nail polish.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, subtle nail polish for those like me who don&#x27;t like color on their fingernails.</li>
            <li>and I keep them pretty short.</li>
            <li>This does work and I consider it to be quite inexpensive compared to the other nail brighteners that I have bought will more than likely purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li>a buffed finished instead a clear polish shine.</li>
            <li>I wear it like a sheer light pink or under nail polish color.</li>
            <li>If I use anything at all, I&#x27;ve used clear on the nails.</li>
            <li>( I wash my hands frequently)</li>
            <li>It is not like a clear polish, it gives natural nails a thin, smooth, waxy texture that looks really nice-more like</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really restain your nails back to white.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a low gloss, which I love (not into high gloss polishes), and it makes the nails look a little whiter, less dull, and a nice subtle \\&quot;glow\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I normally do not wear nail polish but from time to time I will wear clear polish.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I normally do not wear nail polish but from time to time I will wear clear polish.  I applied the product to my nails the day it arrived and I love it, it gives my nails a lovely pink shine.  Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle! It&#x27;s is fantastic. It goes on smooth and dries in seconds. It is not like a clear polish, it gives natural nails a thin, smooth, waxy texture that looks really nice-more like a buffed finished instead a clear polish shine. Hides ridges and yellowish color from dark colors. I would recommend is product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The package was crushed when I received it, but the bottle was fine. As for the nail brightener itself, I love it. It&#x27;s going to be my new neutral nail polish!</li>
            <li> This actually works and looks really great! I love it as an every day wear. I have also seen improvement in my nail color when not wearing any polish which is great too.</li>
            <li> Barielle products are great</li>
            <li> This product does NOTHING to hide my yellowed nails.  I wear polish almost always and my nails have yellowed as a result.  Even after four coats (two are suggested by the manufacturer), the yellow was still obvious.  What a waste of my time and money!</li>
            <li> It makes your nails appear whiter because it&#x27;s, in essence, simply a white pearly nail polish.  It doesn&#x27;t really restain your nails back to white.</li>
            <li> love it!  gave my nails a great clean bright finish!  I&#x27;m soooooooooo PLEASED.</li>
            <li> I certainly agree with the other review, that it was money spent on a tint of color on the nails.  It was nothing more than plain nail polish.  I used it frequently because it would not remain on the nails for more than a day. ( I wash my hands frequently) I would remove it and reapply....no different in my nails at all!!!</li>
            <li> Is one of the best nail stuff ever use!</li>
            <li> love this product!!! dries in under 5 minutes.. I wear it like a sheer light pink or under nail polish color. Am on my 3rd bottle and will keep buying this- forever!</li>
            <li> looks nice and glossy</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  It brightens and lightens the color of your nail just a bit for a very natural, healthy look.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This color didn&#x27;t look natural and after a day my nails kind of started to look yellow after wearing it. Really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> My nails tend to be thin and I keep them pretty short. Just like a short/neat look.This is a nice, subtle nail polish for those like me who don&#x27;t like color on their fingernails. If I use anything at all, I&#x27;ve used clear on the nails. This is more opaque, creamy looking, and I like it. The only negative thing is that if you leave it on too long (more than a few days...) it starts to yellow, thereby defeating the purpose.</li>
            <li> Beautiful on it&#x27;s own (two coats) or works as a WONDERFUL base coat.  I swear, polish has never lasted as long on my natural nails as it does when I use this as my base.  Officially obsessed.</li>
            <li> Item as expected.  Fast shipping.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this polish. I don&#x27;t paint my finger nails bright colors like I do my toenails. I like a more natural look for my fingernails, and mainly because I don&#x27;t have time for frequent manicures/maintenance. So for me, this is perfect. Just one coat makes my nails look shiny and healthy. It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t chip. It also dries extremely fast...also important, as I have a toddler and rarely have time to watch paint dry, if you will :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s considerably more than I normally pay for polish, but worth every extra penny. I tried a cheaper nail brightened and it was just a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t come close to doing what this brand does. I keep this in my purse, I love it that much. If you&#x27;re undecided, just go for it. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This does work and I consider it to be quite inexpensive compared to the other nail brighteners that I have bought will more than likely purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a nail brightner -- then this product isn&#x27;t it.  I really didn&#x27;t work for me, kind of a waste of $$.  It gives your nails a purpleish tinge - which isn&#x27;t a whitener or brightner, more of an allusion which still isn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, but it has a very strong smell! I would love this product if I could wear it without smelling it all day long!!! It looks very pretty on the nail, but it is so strong that I don&#x27;t think I can continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Tones down the yellow without looking blue. Perfect color balance. Five stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must among my nail care.  I garden a  lot and it&#x27;s a quick pick up when I don&#x27;t have time for  a full manicure</li>
            <li> They have great service.  Love the polish.</li>
            <li> I like it. I have dull nails and it does make my nails look brighter. I would purchase it again</li>
            <li> What a wonderful shine that lasts  Even catches the lights when you are out and about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got BAD ridges that I cannot stand.  I purchased the Barielle Nail Camouflage based on the reviews.  I don&#x27;t know what else woman would try to hide on their nails except for ridges, but I don&#x27;t understand the great ratings.  This did absolutely nada to hide my ridges.  It almost made them stand out more.  Bought this on a whim because the price was right and it is wonderful.  Hides a lot of the unsightlies on my nails and it gives a cleaner, brighter, more \\&quot;polished\\&quot; look, so to speak.  It&#x27;s a low gloss, which I love (not into high gloss polishes), and it makes the nails look a little whiter, less dull, and a nice subtle \\&quot;glow\\&quot;... don&#x27;t know how else to describe.  Anyway, it helps to do the trick, and I appreciate anything that will make my nails look nicer.  The price isn&#x27;t crazy, either, which is very nice !  Will def buy again.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry, and it does not brighten your nails</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. It&#x27;s the same nail polish they use at the salon called cotton candy. Does no brighten the nails in any way.</li>
            <li> gives a nice polished look to my nails,helps hide flaws</li>
            <li> She was very happy with it. Loves this product and does not use a computer so she relies on me to track down unusual products like this which she finds to be exceptional. She was very pleased. Shipping and condition of product all perfect.</li>
