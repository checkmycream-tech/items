            <li>Wonderful moisturizing product.  </li>
            <li>I sort of wish that they would just reduce the scent overkill on their lotions, because the formula is awesome otherwise.</li>

            <li>Oh, so good.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>

            <li>love nubian products!</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of this lotion!</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing and smells divine.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff.</li>
            <li>However, I will tell you that it is very strong.</li>
            <li>The Lavender and Wildflower scent of Nubian Heritage products are perhaps the best smelling all natural skin care products I&#x27;ve come in contact with, and I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years now.</li>
            <li>This lotion is far the best..  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>and she used the goat&#x27;s chai one, which while very strong also, does smell more tolerable.</li>
            <li>Super good for face cream at night or during the day.  </li>
            <li>The Shea butter is not diluted to the point that it is rendered ineffective like most others on the market.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell, too.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>So pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love all of Nubian&#x27;s product line and continue to purchase them over and over.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, one of the single best lotions I&#x27;ve ever found!  </li>
            <li>Love Nubian heritage, but the smell of this one was just too strong.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite :o)</li>
            <li>Perfect for my dry skin!</li>
            <li>This company makes a truly wonderful product .. just which they could do it a little cheaper?</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite scent!</li>
            <li>It was purely floral and a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing too (like the chai one).</li>
            <li>This lotion is awesome at bringing my couple-weeks-old french pedicures back to life.</li>
            <li>It is so nourishing without leaving your skin greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into  my skin.</li>
            <li>Thick and creamy lotion that is perfect for right out of the bath.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and the impact (moist healthy skin) in undeniable.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use lotion, even though I have tons of lotion.</li>
            <li>If you like fresh fruity scents, this lotion is for you.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite body lotion and has been for years.  </li>
            <li>It does smell nice, but too much for my sensitive sniffer.</li>
            <li>my face is pretty sensitive and this lotion actually works great as a face lotion for me.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes your skin, making it feel soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very nice, a little more fragrant than the other lotions I have tried from this company.</li>
            <li>The quality of the ingredients is very high, though.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thick lotion feels so good.</li>
            <li>Order came quick, definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li>I normally buy the chai flavor but decided to switch it up.</li>
            <li>It is kind of thick</li>
            <li>This is a new scent for me.</li>
            <li>I wish I still lived near the store in Brooklyn.</li>
            <li>The lavender and wild flowers scents are noticeable after hours of application.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look silky and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>My toes look fresh and pink again like I just stepped out of the soak tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this thick lotion!  </li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong and sort of nasty, unless you like VERY STRONG flowery overpowering scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so thick and rich, but not greasy, that it plumps up my skin and makes all the dryness go away.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are very pure, and the smell is absolutely unbelievable.  </li>

            <li> Smells good. Thick lotion feels so good.</li>

            <li> Love the smell, one of the single best lotions I&#x27;ve ever found!  Super good for face cream at night or during the day.  Last a very long time, use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy lotion that is perfect for right out of the bath. The scent is heavenly. You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this thick lotion!  The smell is very nice, a little more fragrant than the other lotions I have tried from this company.</li>
            <li> this is the only lotion brand i&#x27;ll buy. my face is pretty sensitive and this lotion actually works great as a face lotion for me. smells wonderful, perfect for daily use</li>
            <li> love nubian products! This is a new scent for me. Tried at my sister&#x27;s, that was all it took.</li>
            <li> I have used Nubian Heritage lotions and body washes for a decade now. The Shea butter is not diluted to the point that it is rendered ineffective like most others on the market. The ingredients are natural and the impact (moist healthy skin) in undeniable.  I wish I still lived near the store in Brooklyn.</li>
            <li> the smell is so relaxing. I love the smell of this lotion plus its great as a moisturizer. Love it</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. smells great. last a long time. I like it. will buy it again. you should try it. thanks</li>
            <li> Yowza! I&#x27;m a little annoyed that I paid $12 vs $8 on Amazon but now I know where to buy next time!&lt;br /&gt;So, I just picked this up from a local Indian market. I smelled about six scents. I normally buy the chai flavor but decided to switch it up. SO happy I did. This lotion smells delightful! It&#x27;s super moisturizing too (like the chai one). I rubbed this into my hands and arms in the car and now my car smells wonderful. I also bought the body wash and soap. This is my new favorite :o)</li>
            <li> The lavender and wild flowers scents are noticeable after hours of application.  When using this product, be uniformed and use the body wash and/or bar soap.  You will notice why later on.</li>
            <li> Great company, Great product!</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome at bringing my couple-weeks-old french pedicures back to life. It&#x27;s so thick and rich, but not greasy, that it plumps up my skin and makes all the dryness go away. My toes look fresh and pink again like I just stepped out of the soak tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this product as a body lotion, but I always have a bottle in my bag at work to apply when wearing open-toed shoes. LOVE the smell, too. It&#x27;s one of the only things my husband won&#x27;t balk at when I put on in his presence.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, and so softening!</li>
            <li> Another great lotion, but the papaya and coconut has my hi praise.  The smell is good!  Very good on your skin, leaves silky feel.  Skin remains moist for the entire day.</li>
            <li> Nubian Heritage products are great!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion a little over a year ago at a boutique in Colorado Springs. The scent is lovely. Oh, so good. However, I will tell you that it is very strong. The lotion itself is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I actually completely forgot I had this until a few weeks ago. I don&#x27;t moisturize my body. I rarely use lotion, even though I have tons of lotion. Recently, my legs have been feeling the harsh reality of winter weather. They were so beyond dry, I couldn&#x27;t stop scratching my legs because of how irritated they were, and my skin was starting to crack and get scabs.&lt;br /&gt;I remembered I had this, ran to get it, squeezed a ton onto my hands, and slathered it all over my legs. I could instantly feel the soothing sensation. I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and arms after showering every day now, and will definitely be purchasing once my current bottle gets low.</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick and moisturizing. Perfect for my dry skin! And it smells heavenly! Not very lavender-y either. If you like fresh fruity scents, this lotion is for you.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing and smells divine.</li>

            <li> I use Nubian Heritage body washes, lotions and hair products, and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. Great products, great prices!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look silky and leaves it feeling soft. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this product. Love the scent. It absorbs quickly into  my skin. It is kind of thick so I just take the cap off to use it-comes out easier. Will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this lotion! It&#x27;s thick and very moisturizing. Order came quick, definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> The Best!!!!!!! Loooove!!!!</li>

I sort of wish that they would just reduce the scent overkill on their lotions, because the formula is awesome otherwise. my gf couldn&#x27;t use this and she used the goat&#x27;s chai one, which while very strong also, does smell more tolerable.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, not that great scent. As other buyers stated, I smelled no lavender scent. It was purely floral and a bit overwhelming.</li>
