            <li>All that being said, this is one of the best bright-color semiperms I have found, and that&#x27;s saying something since I&#x27;ve run the gamut of brights, naturals, perms, semiperms, developers and non-developers.</li>

            <li>Perfect as always....I absolutely love manic panic dyes, have been using them since 2011 and not disappointed to this day :)</li>
            <li>Awesome product and a vibrant color.</li>
            <li>My favorite for sure!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this color!</li>
            <li>it was slightly more subdued...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - I color my hair all the time, and</li>
            <li>Love manic panic.</li>
            <li>More of a fuchsia purple.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand after pravana and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Its been around forever and in my opinion is still the best... bright as day intense color that lasts just as long as anything else out there and vegan too.</li>
            <li>This pink is awesome!</li>
            <li>Compared to other dyes I have used, this one lasts the longest with the best color.</li>
            <li>This color is sooo cool!</li>
            <li>It easily makes up for the price of the flash lightning bleach.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and the stuff stays on FOREVER -</li>
            <li>When the color faded it was pretty nice still.</li>
            <li>And my hair has stayed bright and vibrant for more than two weeks now which is not common with these colors of hair dye.</li>
            <li>put my hair in a shower cap and the dyeing part was over, then came clean up.</li>
            <li>Even though I used a lot of conditioner, the color was still very bright and hot pink.</li>
            <li>Bonus points because as it fades, it becomes easier to do cool gradients or ombres</li>
            <li>Normally this leaves manic panic dyes INCREDIBLY vibrant and bright.</li>
            <li>Manic Panic is so easy to use and in my hair it fades quickly but gives me a couple of days of bright pink!</li>
            <li>It does fade super quick.</li>
            <li>Love this color--keep in mind when ordering that the color comes out so vibrant it looks almost purple if you use this shade alone.</li>
            <li>I myself have gone through many different hair colors but the brand i use requires you to bleach your hair before applying dye, and i have been trying to find a product that doesn&#x27;t need hair bleach to be able to put in colorful hair dye.</li>
            <li>this is probably the best part of Tish and Snookey products, they last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to dye my dark brown hair and give it a tinge of hot pink/red-violet, and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m past my fifth wash and my hair is still bright!</li>
            <li>but the product itself is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I defiantly do not recommend this product to anyone with a nice bathroom that they want to keep white, or to anyone with dark-brown/black hair.</li>
            <li>this would be a good color if it were actually a bright pink, but it&#x27;s more of a pink based red.</li>
            <li>As long as you bleach your hair beforehand, the color will turn out amazing.</li>
            <li>The dye stays in for quite a while, and im always left with way more than I can use.  </li>
            <li>You can see this one very well!</li>
            <li>So pretty</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair first and then added the color.</li>
            <li>and wow..really hot.</li>
            <li>It stained the bottom of my shower a very BRIGHT pink which i had to get professionally cleaned and they&#x27;re still is a light pink outline.</li>
            <li>This is a great true to pink pink.</li>
            <li>applied the die easy enough</li>
            <li>So vibrant and took really well!</li>
            <li>It will pop and be very vibrant if you have blonde to a light brown color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my little pony pastel hair and one jar for this purpose will last you months and months.</li>
            <li>Pink is my favorite color</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more of a baby pink</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really like it and the picture shown is misleading.</li>
            <li>for my grand daughter, she loves pink.</li>
            <li>i noticed that the color wasn&#x27;t really showing.</li>
            <li>Works loads better than the cotton candy pink dye by manic panic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried leaving it in longer, but I will now that it&#x27;s been recommended by so many other users.</li>
            <li>This particular Manic Panic color fades slower than many of the other colors and comes out really intense.</li>
            <li>Lasts a decent length of time compared to many of the other Manic Panic products I have used.</li>
            <li>and I hoped it would be as vibrant as everyone posted</li>
            <li>The colors turn out extremely vibrant.</li>
            <li>If you have blonde hair you only have to leave it on 30-40 min at the most.</li>
            <li>This color is HOT HOT HOT PINK, very WOW!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun neon pink that glows under a black light!</li>
            <li>you love pink go for it, but use with low expectations just in case..</li>
            <li>After trying to find a hair color, I settled on manic panics hot hot pink.</li>
            <li>I tried the cotton candy pink first, and you couldn&#x27;t hardly see it unless you had a light bulb right by it.</li>
            <li>I mix a little bit of this in with Cotton Candy Pink and it toned down the purple hue and faded beautifully.</li>
            <li>Use some sort of color block or vaseline on any skin that might get colored (I&#x27;m messy, so this includes my hairline, parts of my cheeks, my ears, and pretty much my whole neck).</li>
            <li>- sometimes I color just my roots orange or something that complements the hot pink.</li>
            <li>This hot pink dye clings onto your hair for dear life.</li>
            <li>I mixed the whole tub with about double the amount in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It last a long time and really sticks out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s purple not pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde (around Level 7), and didn&#x27;t require any bleaching.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>A deep Hot pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very deep, vibrant pink.</li>
            <li>It was a little darker than the picture depicts, but I ended up really liking it.</li>
            <li>my tub is one of those cheap plastic deals, and it&#x27;s STILL pink, weeks later, no matter how hard I have scrubbed.</li>

            <li> A deep Hot pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very deep, vibrant pink.</li>
            <li> It was a little darker than the picture depicts, but I ended up really liking it.</li>
            <li> my tub is one of those cheap plastic deals, and it&#x27;s STILL pink, weeks later, no matter how hard I have scrubbed.</li>
            <li> The only thing, is that people thought it was red instead of pink.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stain any pillows or sheets and seemed to stay in my hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> the color is DULL dull dull and very light.</li>
            <li> It is a lot darker than the picture (always look up examples and swatches) and dilutes to a slightly peachy unless your hair is white pink.</li>
            <li> The dye lasts three days tops ( with 1-2 cold washes ) before it turns a light orange and almost all but washes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful about tubs, too -</li>
            <li> Ordered pink.</li>
            <li> i came in the mail quicker than expected</li>
            <li> Be careful because this dye will NOT come out of any counters even if you put a bleach wash on them.</li>
            <li> None of the color had stayed in my hair and it stained my scalp and hands pink for a week.</li>
            <li> Now I dilute it with conditioner to make a light/pastel pink dye.</li>
            <li> Not really hot pink.</li>
            <li> Med to dark browns it will add depth and highlights.</li>
            <li> then when i was in the shower i noticed that the dye was not all of the dye was going down the drain.</li>
            <li> The color, in sunlight, was an almost fluorescent pink!!  </li>
            <li> Cons: A little expensive and the quantity is small, so buy plenty (one jar and a little of a second got all of my shoulder-length bob covered); also rinses out a LOT every time you wash your hair, and stains skin like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> the color lasts me just about 3 weeks before it starts to seriously fade.</li>
            <li> The people who have trouble keeping the color in must be doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Be warned guys this does not work on people with black hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed about that.</li>

            <li> this is probably the best part of Tish and Snookey products, they last a long time.  The dye stays in for quite a while, and im always left with way more than I can use.  It easily makes up for the price of the flash lightning bleach.  The color, in sunlight, was an almost fluorescent pink!!  indoors it was slightly more subdued...some people told me it was purple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color for a while now. Compared to other dyes I have used, this one lasts the longest with the best color. I&#x27;ve bleached out my bangs and this color looks AMAZING! It&#x27;s a very deep, vibrant pink. The people who have trouble keeping the color in must be doing something wrong. I leave the dye in for 20 minutes the color lasts me just about 3 weeks before it starts to seriously fade. I&#x27;ve never tried leaving it in longer, but I will now that it&#x27;s been recommended by so many other users.</li>
            <li> This particular Manic Panic color fades slower than many of the other colors and comes out really intense. As long as you bleach your hair beforehand, the color will turn out amazing. Even when the color starts to fade, it won&#x27;t look tacky whatsoever. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This pink is awesome! I tried the cotton candy pink first, and you couldn&#x27;t hardly see it unless you had a light bulb right by it. You can see this one very well!</li>
            <li> Its been around forever and in my opinion is still the best... bright as day intense color that lasts just as long as anything else out there and vegan too. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This color is sooo cool! It&#x27;s a fun neon pink that glows under a black light! I loved it when my hair was this color and got so many complements.</li>
            <li> Pink is my favorite color and I hoped it would be as vibrant as everyone posted it was but on my bleached blonde hair ( my hair is platinum without dye in it ) the color is DULL dull dull and very light. The dye lasts three days tops ( with 1-2 cold washes ) before it turns a light orange and almost all but washes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more of a baby pink once I wash the dye out ( mind you I leave the dye in for several hours until it drys and apply heat as well before I wash it out ). Normally this leaves manic panic dyes INCREDIBLY vibrant and bright. This dye seems to be the exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second pink dye from manic panic and so far they are all disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love pink go for it, but use with low expectations just in case..</li>
            <li> this would be a good color if it were actually a bright pink, but it&#x27;s more of a pink based red. i don&#x27;t really like it and the picture shown is misleading.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this color! So vibrant and took really well! So pretty and it worked amazingly! My favorite for sure!</li>
            <li> it worked on my hair (brown) and i didnt need to bleach it and just like it said it lasted about a month. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and a vibrant color. It does fade super quick. Both my husband and I have used it and after 3 or 4 days it&#x27;s faded.</li>
            <li> for my grand daughter, she loves pink.</li>
            <li> This was not the color shown. It&#x27;s purple not pink.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I color my hair all the time, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t do any damage. The colors turn out extremely vibrant. Definitely, definitely consider the staining issue, though. Use some sort of color block or vaseline on any skin that might get colored (I&#x27;m messy, so this includes my hairline, parts of my cheeks, my ears, and pretty much my whole neck). Be careful about tubs, too - my tub is one of those cheap plastic deals, and it&#x27;s STILL pink, weeks later, no matter how hard I have scrubbed. When I&#x27;m a houseguest in someone else&#x27;s house, I just don&#x27;t wash my hair because I worry about their towels and shower.  Bonus points because as it fades, it becomes easier to do cool gradients or ombres - sometimes I color just my roots orange or something that complements the hot pink.</li>
            <li> Buen producto, lo recomiendo 100% color genial para cabellos con estilo.&lt;br /&gt;Good product, I recommend it 100% color great for hair style.</li>
            <li> This is a great true to pink pink. It is a lot darker than the picture (always look up examples and swatches) and dilutes to a slightly peachy unless your hair is white pink. It&#x27;s great for my little pony pastel hair and one jar for this purpose will last you months and months. Love manic panic.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for people that like to change up their hair color. It will pop and be very vibrant if you have blonde to a light brown color. Med to dark browns it will add depth and highlights. For hair that is darker I would recommend lighting your hair gradually to the correct color to get the effect that you want. If you have blonde hair you only have to leave it on 30-40 min at the most. This color is HOT HOT HOT PINK, very WOW! A deep Hot pink.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughter!.  I am even using it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have the staying power of Vampire Red.</li>
            <li> Not really hot pink. More of a fuchsia purple.</li>
            <li> After trying to find a hair color, I settled on manic panics hot hot pink. When I received I used it instantly. I mixed the whole tub with about double the amount in conditioner. Even though I used a lot of conditioner, the color was still very bright and hot pink. When I went swimming all the color stripped out but it was great while it lasted. It didn&#x27;t stain any pillows or sheets and seemed to stay in my hair for a long time. When the color faded it was pretty nice still. This is my favorite brand after pravana and I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this color from Sally&#x27;s and I L-O-V-E it! It last a long time and really sticks out. I bleached my hair first and then added the color. I let if on for 2 hours and wow..really hot. The only thing, is that people thought it was red instead of pink. but the product itself is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come out at all if you don&#x27;t bleach your hair don&#x27;t get it I recommend splat.</li>
            <li> Def. works great on my hair!</li>
            <li> lasts almost two months</li>
            <li> Ordered pink. Received purple. Can&#x27;t return or exchange. Disappointed. May update my review once we try this in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Love it. It was a little darker than the picture depicts, but I ended up really liking it. And my hair has stayed bright and vibrant for more than two weeks now which is not common with these colors of hair dye.</li>
            <li> Lasts a decent length of time compared to many of the other Manic Panic products I have used.</li>
            <li> Be warned guys this does not work on people with black hair!!!! I myself have gone through many different hair colors but the brand i use requires you to bleach your hair before applying dye, and i have been trying to find a product that doesn&#x27;t need hair bleach to be able to put in colorful hair dye. I had read the description on the dye and the reviews and thought i should try it myself. i came in the mail quicker than expected so i thought that, that was a good sign. then came the moment i actually used it. It didn&#x27;t come with gloves but that was no biggy so i got out a pair of my own applied the die easy enough put my hair in a shower cap and the dyeing part was over, then came clean up. Be careful because this dye will NOT come out of any counters even if you put a bleach wash on them. I was very disappointed about that. then when i was in the shower i noticed that the dye was not all of the dye was going down the drain. It stained the bottom of my shower a very BRIGHT pink which i had to get professionally cleaned and they&#x27;re still is a light pink outline. after the shower when i was drying my hair i noticed that the color wasn&#x27;t really showing. None of the color had stayed in my hair and it stained my scalp and hands pink for a week. I defiantly do not recommend this product to anyone with a nice bathroom that they want to keep white, or to anyone with dark-brown/black hair. I hope this helped.</li>
            <li> Love this color--keep in mind when ordering that the color comes out so vibrant it looks almost purple if you use this shade alone. I mix a little bit of this in with Cotton Candy Pink and it toned down the purple hue and faded beautifully. I&#x27;m a natural blonde (around Level 7), and didn&#x27;t require any bleaching.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This hot pink dye clings onto your hair for dear life. I had to bleach my hair several times to get it out. Now I dilute it with conditioner to make a light/pastel pink dye. Works loads better than the cotton candy pink dye by manic panic.</li>
            <li> She loved it. Look very nice</li>
            <li> Manic Panic is so easy to use and in my hair it fades quickly but gives me a couple of days of bright pink!</li>
            <li> Perfect as always....I absolutely love manic panic dyes, have been using them since 2011 and not disappointed to this day :)</li>
            <li> I love this product! I bought it to dye my dark brown hair and give it a tinge of hot pink/red-violet, and it worked beautifully. Pros: It&#x27;s easy to apply and the stuff stays on FOREVER - I&#x27;m past my fifth wash and my hair is still bright! Cons: A little expensive and the quantity is small, so buy plenty (one jar and a little of a second got all of my shoulder-length bob covered); also rinses out a LOT every time you wash your hair, and stains skin like nobody&#x27;s business. All that being said, this is one of the best bright-color semiperms I have found, and that&#x27;s saying something since I&#x27;ve run the gamut of brights, naturals, perms, semiperms, developers and non-developers. Also a note: if you want the color on the swatch, bleach your hair. This product doesn&#x27;t develop, it only deposits color, so pre-lightening is up to you.</li>
            <li> Love this color! Goes nice with Ultra Violet ombre!</li>
            <li> Once you know how to apply color this product works perfect</li>
