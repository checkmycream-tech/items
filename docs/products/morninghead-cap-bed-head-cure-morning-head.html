            <li>once i figured that out it, I&#x27;ve been very very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Had a towel positioned to &amp;#34;catch errant water&amp;#34; but not the best results as I almost always splashed it around and had to soak it up with the towel off the counter and sometimes the floor.  </li>

            <li>Works 100 times better!!</li>
            <li>My son now has nice hair in the morning!  </li>
            <li>This product works perfect for him! :)</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re very happy with the purchase - it&#x27;s a time saver and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Nothing works as good as a shower.  </li>
            <li>Premise is good.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>This is a really good way to fix your hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>bought it, tried it, loved it, and immediately bought one for my father-in-law... who has always gotten rid of his bedhead by washing in</li>
            <li>Generally a good product.</li>
            <li>Good concept;</li>
            <li>I even tried it and was good, but my hair is longer so</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>When he tried Morninghead, he loved it.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as taking a shower</li>
            <li>This works pretty great if you can find the perfect amount of water to put in it otherwise</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with morning head.</li>
            <li>used it this morning, and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my S.O. &amp; he was very pleased with how well it worked.</li>
            <li>This is one perfect example of a life-hack gone right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic!  </li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>Saw this item on Shark Tank and even though the sharks didn&#x27;t like it, I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>My husband is an avid watcher of Shark Tank and was very impressed when he saw your product!  </li>
            <li>Not any more!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>You no longer have to wait for the water to warm up nor do you have to worry about splashing water everywhere on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While this is a good idea it would be better if it was washable.</li>
            <li>Honest to god</li>
            <li>It felt (and kind of looks) like a diaper on my head, but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still - good for on the go maintenance of my mop top.</li>
            <li>who liked it but didn&#x27;t want  a one trick pony.</li>
            <li>This thing is definitely handy.  </li>
            <li>Was happy with the delivery, the product itself, but most importantly the integrity of the company itself!</li>
            <li>so he can re-style it without re-showering nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my cap many times and have been very pleased each time.  </li>
            <li>Saw this on sharhtank and thought it would be perfect for my 7 year old son.  </li>
            <li>With this, he gets rid of that quickly and is on his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product could not recommend it more.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price; especially if you shower at night and not each morning.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product for exactly what it does - and it works flawless each and every time - just a quick wring after each use</li>
            <li>They love using it now - it&#x27;s so easy and works so well!</li>
            <li>The kids and the pigs are happy and we are happy to have a dry couch.</li>
            <li>Perfect to use when he wants to quickly style his hair and go.  </li>
            <li>Works like it should, but if you are already dressed, make sure you drape a towel over your neck/shoulders for any runoff water.</li>
            <li>This is better then nothing.  </li>
            <li>The longer hair the better</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple uses I can say I am really glad I got this.</li>
            <li>I was then able to towel try my hair</li>
            <li>So I tried it again, with more vigorous massaging.</li>
            <li>I wrung it out, and tried it again with more water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he could get away with just wearing it, but whatever works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and it works, what more can you want?</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I think it works even better than advertised.  </li>
            <li>myself love the  product...</li>
            <li>it works so much better than just wetting your hair with a washcloth like one of the lady sharks</li>
            <li>I really love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>MH is great because it&#x27;s specifically designed for guys who are already clean but may need that quick hair rinse in the morning to get rid of bed head</li>
            <li>so is much better for adults.  </li>
            <li>I love and use it.  </li>
            <li>They love being held in this</li>
            <li>Will be buying more for gifts.</li>
            <li>My wife should have known better.  </li>
            <li>I workout after work most days and shower in the evening.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So I love the morning head.</li>
            <li>Would by again :)</li>
            <li>I love the concept that you can fix your hair in a matter of seconds or so.  </li>
            <li>The more I use this, the more I like it.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you wring it out after every use.</li>
            <li>Might have a smell after a couple of weeks, make sure to laundry.</li>

            <li>Could not have asked for better.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>Resist the urge to use more water - 1/4 cup will do it.</li>
            <li>OK execution.</li>
            <li>However it is better than just using your hands or wetting a towel.</li>
            <li>more than just rinsed with water</li>
            <li>sure you let the water soak in before putting it on your head.</li>
            <li>most of the water out after using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-materials seem okay.</li>
            <li>Was kind of an impulse purchase since it was available for prime</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>The logo on the top is a bumper sticker.  </li>
            <li>and  I am glad I was watching Shark Tank that night to learn about it.  </li>
            <li>though I have to add water twice to the cap, it is way better to use it since this way</li>
            <li>The product is definitely better than using a damp washcloth on your hair.</li>
            <li>This is one of the coolest inventions ever, and my morning routine in infinity better and easier for it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this cap; I saw it on Shark Tank and ordered it because it seemed like a great product.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Many times I wake up in the morning with no time to do anything.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>VERY COOL product.  </li>
            <li>If you hair is super super short it is not as effective, but for medium length hair it is so perfect.</li>
            <li>This is the best $11 I&#x27;ve ever spent.  </li>
            <li>and I bought 4 of them to send to my favorite friends to enjoy.</li>
            <li>Yes, I looked like I was dying my hair at the stop light, but I literally was able to get out the door in under 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Really works well when you need to get your hair in top shape for a quick video conference, so convenient and effective!</li>
            <li>Like many others, we originally saw this on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li>Cap does start getting a musty odor after a while, however that is easily resolved by throwing it in the washing machine.</li>
            <li>Convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest washing it separately to avoid lint and fuzz attaching itself to the towel portion of the cap.  </li>
            <li>I could continue to use a facecloth or to put my head under the faucet because both methods word fine.</li>
            <li>OMG my hair looks awesome without a mess.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Steve (and my son Caden thanks you more!)</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use, low price.</li>
            <li>It was a huge hassle</li>
            <li>However, this solves a huge problem that  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, this seems like a cheap, novelty product</li>
            <li>He said it fit snugly</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>The material used on the inside of the cap is really cheap.</li>
            <li>I purchased the morninghead because i occasionally shower at night, and thought this would give a great way to fix up my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Only used it a couple times, but it worked great.</li>
            <li>so I had to wad it in to fit it in the cap</li>
            <li>poured in the recommended amount of 2/3 cup and let it soak in for a few seconds then started to go to town, especially on my most affected areas.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because my 7 year hates the way my wife and I dampen his hair in the morning with a mist of warm water and a comb to get him ready for school.  </li>
            <li>I also bought one for my son whom has been using it daily with joy.</li>
            <li>so the morning head has been perfect to get his hair ready for school the next morning.</li>
            <li>After the 3rd time I heard about it I decided to do some more research and saw it got some pretty great reviews</li>
            <li>I needed a quick and easy way to do my hair.  </li>
            <li>fun product that works!</li>
            <li>but I normally use a spray bottle which is just as effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this may work for some, however for me</li>
            <li>Very simple to use, and comes in handy!</li>
            <li>saw the Morninghead on Shark Tank and was more than willing to give the product a try,  I ordered two, one for my son and one for my boyfriend</li>
            <li>They saw this product on Shark Tank and got excited about it, so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>since I know I&#x27;m already clean from the night before.</li>
            <li>if I could count on always finding a clean towel in my house, and then I can just imagine it in the&lt;br /&gt;hamper</li>
            <li>I still think it is a great idea, but not really for kids.  </li>
            <li>If you have short hair it doesn&#x27;t work so good.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased by how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a light gray or graphite color would make it look better with a smaller repeating logo incorporated into a outer design pattern would look better.</li>
            <li>So I use this, takes a second, and looks good.</li>
            <li>They love these new caps!</li>
            <li>or it starts to smell quickly.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair look fresh out of the shower without getting water on the rest of you!&lt;br /&gt;I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This cap confines the excess water and makes for a quick bedhead fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mehhhh, the thing quickly started to smell after a 5 days.</li>
            <li>when and if it wears out he will order another!!!Shark tank really missed the mark on this one should have invested this !!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised!  </li>
            <li>It works exactly how it is supposed to!</li>
            <li>So much better than dipping the comb in the faucet, pouring water on his head with my hand, and even better than the spray bottle which sends a stream into one single spot.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li>This thing works perfectly and saves so much time and mess!!</li>
            <li>Anything to help that is worth my money.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put it on your head until the water is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>so we figured this was worth a shot after seeing it on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li>which is only 80% my own).</li>
            <li>Plus, I keep my natural oils which make my hair look even better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $11 (cheaper than a couple rounds at the bar, to put it in perspective) and you&#x27;ll get far more utility out of it.</li>
            <li>but when you take it off, your hair has a distinct mildew smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It Works well- much better than my old spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>A useful tool for morning hair it needs to be</li>
            <li>I am honestly surprised more people don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li>It is nice not to feel I have to wash my hair daily -  who has time for that!  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old loves it and he looks much better.  </li>
            <li>, this is a useful  item for mom, dad and kiddo alike.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>In spite of this, it still is worth buying.</li>
            <li>I definitely differ with the Sharks on this one; in my opinion, the simple concept of putting a highly absorbent material inside a waterproof cap is brilliant!</li>
            <li>It completely absorbs the water in seconds and is super easy to wring out after you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was a fine balance at first on not putting too much water in it and waiting the right time for absorption, but</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll be damned if it doesn&#x27;t just WORK RIGHT.</li>
            <li>and he bought it right away.  </li>
            <li>I had each morning and the price was right.</li>
            <li>so i try to add the right amount of water.</li>
            <li>it right when i got it in this</li>
            <li>I saw this on shark tank, and said I am buying this RIGHT NOW and did.</li>
            <li>and I never can get it to look right unless I shower again.  </li>
            <li>So Morninghead Cap was suppose to help right?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as good as new again for the next use.</li>
            <li>Pretty useful but</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean and get ready for next use.</li>
            <li>When I first heard about this product I thought it was funny name but not practical or worth it.</li>
            <li>Morninghead helps me get ready for work quickly and allows me to not wear a baseball cap on the days</li>
            <li>what a great idea.&amp;#34;  I have short hair and sometimes (especially if I shower in the evening)</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time and was amazed.</li>
            <li>Just enough to be able to style your hair and get rid of bedhead</li>
            <li>I am most definitely not a morning person, and for that reason prefer to shower at night.</li>
            <li>The one thing I&#x27;d like to see with the next MH would be a bit more antibacterial protection in the lining of the cap.</li>
            <li>It works better on bigger heads</li>
            <li>But I do think the marketing campaign is hilarious and is what initially caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>wake up with bed head, use morning head, and am able to have the intentional &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; that I actually want!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>I found it to be exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but I personally find this more convenient.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>and it really does work!</li>
            <li>Funny, he used to not want me to bother messing with his hair...</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is, and I respect it for that reason.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I love the way the product works, though it does seem to not work as well upon multiple uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Duh if you are going to add extra water, or don&#x27;t make sure it absorbs into the material, be prepared that it&#x27;s going to leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much water at all!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-also when it is on the top of my head i am trying to move it around back and forth</li>
            <li>but i am only moving the top layer of the cap and</li>
            <li>not sure how many uses i will be able to get out of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First I noticed that no water escaped from the cap.</li>
            <li>Well, in our case, quite the contrary, but despite that fact, I added the maximum amount of water but not enough so that it would drip, and just warm enough to make it comfortable.  </li>
            <li>, I love it and it saves me a big hassle in the morning!</li>
            <li>I bought it as a lark because I thought it was a funny idea.</li>
            <li>At the time of leaving this review I am currently buying two more units of this product as gifts to my family.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better for guys&#x27; short haircuts.</li>
            <li>I had to safety pin the edge up a bit since my head is smaller than most people</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping validate my hippie lifestyle...now go recycle something!</li>
            <li>I first saw this item on Shark Tank and I was &amp;</li>
            <li>I added more water the second time.</li>
            <li>, thanks guys!</li>
            <li>it does its job very well, once you figure out the right amount of water.  </li>
            <li>Simple but useful !!</li>
            <li>Does a great job of getting my hair wet enough</li>
            <li>I saw this product on Shark Tank and even though there was no deal with the Sharks, I thought it was a good idea, not necessarily for myself but for my son who definitely has &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34; when he gets up!!  </li>
            <li>In fact, I love it so much that I bought extra so that I could give morninghead to my friends.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much it does what it says</li>
            <li>Okay that doesn&#x27;t take long, but water everywhere, shampoo in your ears, etc.</li>
            <li>Yes, there are other ways to wet your hair but this is darn easy, and most importantly, it keeps the drips off my face and shoulders - everywhere except my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope to see something a little more manly soon!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t drip at all, and it fits my big head (7-7/8 cap size) easily.</li>
            <li>Wonder if the creator has thought of this as a possible product to sell to nursing homes and/or hospital patients who don&#x27;t always find it easy to wash their hair?</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s decent and would definitely make for a good gift for someone else or yourself, if you have the extra money.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a certain family member who spills water all over the bathroom when wetting his hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>It appears this is made for a large head</li>
            <li>I was eager to use it the next day, and I thought it worked great although it slightly dripped.</li>
            <li>It is fine for moderate length hair.  </li>
            <li>Name aside, this product really does work as it says it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of use, I feel that you don&#x27;t need as much water as the product suggests.</li>
            <li>This seems to do a much cleaner job.  </li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t really leave it on, just puts it on at the sink and rubs it around.  </li>
            <li>Then I can comb it out and am ready to go, with no frizz and no bed head.</li>
            <li>It was cheap enough that i&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li>you wake up with bed head that no matter how much water you dab on your head wont go away, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and we can even take it with us when we travel.</li>
            <li>It works really well though.</li>
            <li>But it does work... and very well.  </li>
            <li>This product really works for what it is made for and I am now using every weekend.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>and it came out very tangled.  </li>
            <li>Uses it every morning and really likes it.</li>
            <li>the absorbing part does not move at all.</li>
            <li>otherwise it isn&#x27;t really needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i made the mistake of adding a bit too much water and it didn&#x27;t soak all the way in so the water still leaked</li>
            <li>/&gt;-i wonder if it would fit if you had a slightly smaller head.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and don&#x27;t add too much water, because it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>For me, it is much easier to use than sticking my head under the faucet in the tub.</li>
            <li>so this works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>and THEN I will really use it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Their hair basically sticks straight up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and he is ready for work.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need a whole cup of water in the cap.  </li>
            <li>It works, and it was cheap enough.</li>
            <li>Its really just a shower cap that retains water.</li>
            <li>my hair parts where it wants to</li>
            <li>and then style it without much fuss.</li>
            <li>Maybe my hair is just really stinky?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t hold as much water.</li>
            <li>As my headline mentions, wetting my comb was a much faster and easier way to re-wet my hair.</li>
            <li>This product did give me a good idea though just wet a microfiber towel and do the same thing.</li>
            <li>I kind of got used to it after a couple of days and now use it everyday and did it so it didn&#x27;t drip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i can see this good once in a while if you are running late or have to be something immediately.</li>
            <li>I had the exact same experience as Lucky Student.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but it would be nice if I can stretch out the use of a morninghead for as long as possible because I&#x27;m cheap and</li>
            <li>i usually wear hats 7 1/2 - 7 5/8 and this fit me fine.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he fell in love harder than he did when he saw it on TV!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s easy to use, hang up and dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and nothing about the product is exaggerated or inflated in either it&#x27;s packaging or marketing.</li>
            <li>It really depends on the person and their hair, but it works decent for me.</li>
            <li>- I highly recommend this product - it really truly works</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is supposed to last up to 3 months and for the price, I will certainly buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>He sometimes wants a quick run and go and this actually works.  </li>
            <li>It looks like a great product for white ppl and other races with similar hair texture.</li>
            <li>Clever name.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>Clever idea</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably mainly use it for the weekends.  </li>
            <li>far as it having problems with mildew, I first off I will probably get a new one of these in six months or something, it&#x27;s well built</li>
            <li>I have short hair and found a little bit less water yields the best results.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Morninghead.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is high.  </li>
            <li>Morninghead makes it easy to get up at 5am, get my hair wet, and hit the gym!  </li>
            <li>so far, we haven&#x27;t had much luck.</li>
            <li>This is a really simple and useful product.  </li>
            <li>fun gift, but definitely could live without it.</li>
            <li>Morninghead is simple and effective, and solves my bedhead problem without the time or clean-up typically associated with getting out of the house in the morning.  </li>
            <li>the only complaint i have is that the water is not as evenly distributed as i would like off the bat (i.e., it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb &amp;#34;sideways&amp;#34;); you kind of have to switch it around a bit.</li>
            <li>Honestly by the time you wet it, wear it, and clean it to keep it from smelling funny, it easier to just tussle your hair with a wet hand and wear a host for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It took a couple times using them to figure out how much water to use (which was a LOT less than they originally thought).</li>
            <li>So simple and so smart!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold enough water in the felt of the cap to wet the hair sufficiently, unless you fill it up like a bowl and just let the water dump out on top of your head.  </li>
            <li>I want to love it because I often shower at night and just need to wet my hair in the morning, but often I find myself still just washing my face and then throwing the water on my head instead of getting out the morninghead cap and fussing with the amount of water to make it work properly for my hair.</li>
            <li>Very busy schedule.  </li>
            <li>(so far) that I&#x27;ve talked into it!  </li>
            <li>Yes, the commercial is funny</li>
            <li>With this product, I&#x27;m investing around a minute, maybe less, depending on how long it takes the hot water to get to the bathroom (the pipes, of course, being routed under the house and through France), and I can clean my hair up straight away, and use styling products if I so desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After you get past the learning curve it does exactly what the inventor says it does!!!</li>
            <li>This saves time, keeps my place dry and keeps me looking fresh.</li>
            <li>sometimes I just need to wet my hair for a quick re-style before heading out.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>- so the elastic doesn&#x27;t fit around my head as tightly as it could.</li>
            <li>Really nice for the weekend when I might want to shower later, or on a hot day when I shower late and the next morning just need to fix my hair.</li>
            <li>it will most likely be dry the next time i need to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have hair that isn&#x27;t easy to tame, but using this to moisten my hair, allows me to brush it afterwards.</li>
            <li>It will also get the top level of hair very wet while the roots of the hair stay dry.</li>
            <li>I saw the inventor of this brilliant solution to &#x27;bad hair&#x27; days on Shark Tank.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the product and would look crazy in the morning without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Josh</li>
            <li>I have nearly every morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frequent night-time showerer and Morninghead saves me valuable time each morning.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old is not a morning person</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already a hassle to take a shower in the morning or throw my head under the sink every morning, a task which sucks even more</li>
            <li>I still use this once in awhile when I am busy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not to repeat their commercial, but the part about showering the night before after the gym and having a whole pain in the butt process the next morning because of bed head is what really caught my attention and convinced me to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a USB port, as far as I can tell, and I can&#x27;t tell where the batteries should go in.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my son because he gets up too early in the morning to shower again</li>
            <li>I ordered this product while watching an old episode of Shark Tank.  </li>
            <li>Very satisified.... works well with my short hair.  </li>
            <li>He had to change to another outfit - and we added water the old fashioned way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is so simple, but it saves so much time.</li>
            <li>If water is leaking out, you&#x27;re simply putting too much water in there.</li>
            <li>I have a 7 year old and he fights me every morning to brush his hair.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old LOVES it</li>
            <li>I have two boys ages 8 and 5 years old.  </li>
            <li>This product is a complete dud.</li>
            <li>But once you get it right, the water doesn&#x27;t leak out and my hair got wet.</li>
            <li>I shower at night and usually have to stick my head under the faucet then towel dry forever to be able to quickly blow dry.  </li>
            <li>I put way more than the recommended amount of water, such that I have to wear a towel around my neck to catch the dripping, and it still doesn&#x27;t get my hair wet, just barely moist, not nearly enough to fix my morning hair.</li>
            <li>Second time I tried this, my face and neck got wet but most of my hair was still dry.</li>
            <li>If you work from home and hop on video calls daily like I do, and don&#x27;t necessarily need to hop in the shower to get the real deal, morning head is a life saver!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you have the same problem.</li>
            <li>Wets hair very neatly without sloshing water everywhere, but my hair is long</li>
            <li>Gets my hair wet and ready to style!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this, none of my hair got wet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using ring the water out, like it says in the instructions, hang up inside out and it will be ready for use by the next day.[Hopefully for use 2nd day]</li>
            <li>Unique product for those cases where hair is a mess in the morning and plan on taking a shower later in the day.</li>
            <li>This is little more than a shower cap made of material that is fuzzy on one side and plastic on the other...</li>
            <li>We use this cap to quickly wet and tame our bed-head, and it works so much better than trying to throw water on with a brush.</li>
            <li>GET A SMALL CLEAN HAND-TOWEL, SEMI-SOAK IT WITH WATER, SQUEEEEEEZE OUT</li>
            <li>This allows me to tame my hairdo quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dripped just a little, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Probably a little bit, but for the simplicity, convenience, and saved time in the morning, it still makes it worth a buy.</li>
            <li>This product was nothing more than an expensive shower cap and it did nothing more than leave parts of my hair soaking wet, and other parts barely damp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a bad product, but not as great as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>After seeing this product on a recent episode of &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34;, I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I figured the product worked, but wondered if I would really choose to use it over and over in the mornings when I showered the night before, over using my hands to wet my head from the sink or putting my head under the tub spout.</li>
            <li>I used to get water all over the sink counter and never got the back of my head completely.</li>
            <li>but now their is barely any drippage.</li>
            <li>Much easier than using a spray bottle in the morning to wet his hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on figuring out the amount of water to put into this where my hair gets damp (not dripping or just barely moistened) while evenly wetting the cap all the way around</li>
            <li>It took him a few times to get it right</li>
            <li>I usually stick my head under the shower and wash my hair really quickly.</li>
            <li>It works just as it was portrayed on Shark Tank - don&#x27;t put too much water in it tho - just enough to wet it</li>
            <li>The only problem with it is that it only comes in an adult size</li>
            <li>I like this product - it works very well doing what it says it will do - getting your hair wet enough to style.</li>
            <li>well, my hair was a little wet afterwards, but didn&#x27;t give me anything more than if I took a wet brush to it.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to shower at night for a variety of reasons, and generally do not wake up with any time in the mornings before work, while my hair looks like I&#x27;ve spent too much time in the electricity section of a children&#x27;s museum.  </li>
            <li>it took the whole process down to 30-40 seconds.  </li>
            <li>When it came in the package was slightly torn, but that didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve also used it as a showercap (it&#x27;s not tight around the edges but kept my hair generally dry)</li>
            <li>/baths only to wake up to clean, yet ridiculous looking hairdos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still tweaking how much water I need and the cap isnt tight enough to prevent water from falling out when using.</li>
            <li>but this may be due to the water quality where I live.  </li>
            <li>The product works great but where it retains moisture so well, it stinks after a few days.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> A wonderful product and makes the morning head - a breeze.</li>
            <li> It takes some experimentation to find the perfect amount of water to put in.</li>
            <li> product itself works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It;s great!!</li>
            <li> it perfectly fulfills my need.</li>
            <li> Great product!  </li>
            <li> They can use it themselves, takes 30 minutes off the morning when they can shower at night and still look perfect for school.</li>
            <li> once i figured that out it, I&#x27;ve been very very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Had a towel positioned to &amp;#34;catch errant water&amp;#34; but not the best results as I almost always splashed it around and had to soak it up with the towel off the counter and sometimes the floor.  </li>
            <li> I have had it a over a month now and still am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> He said it works great!</li>

            <li> Great idea</li>
            <li> The product works as described and  I am happy I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like product in my hair, so this product was a great choice.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Works 100 times better!!</li>
            <li> My son now has nice hair in the morning!  </li>
            <li> This product works perfect for him! :)</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very happy with the purchase - it&#x27;s a time saver and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Nothing works as good as a shower.  </li>
            <li> Premise is good.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> This is a really good way to fix your hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li> bought it, tried it, loved it, and immediately bought one for my father-in-law... who has always gotten rid of his bedhead by washing in</li>
            <li> Generally a good product.</li>
            <li> Good concept;</li>
            <li> I even tried it and was good, but my hair is longer so</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li> When he tried Morninghead, he loved it.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as taking a shower</li>
            <li> This works pretty great if you can find the perfect amount of water to put in it otherwise</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with morning head.</li>
            <li> used it this morning, and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> He is very pleased.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my S.O. &amp; he was very pleased with how well it worked.</li>
            <li> This is one perfect example of a life-hack gone right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic!  </li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> Saw this item on Shark Tank and even though the sharks didn&#x27;t like it, I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> My husband is an avid watcher of Shark Tank and was very impressed when he saw your product!  </li>
            <li> Not any more!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> You no longer have to wait for the water to warm up nor do you have to worry about splashing water everywhere on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While this is a good idea it would be better if it was washable.</li>
            <li> Honest to god</li>
            <li> It felt (and kind of looks) like a diaper on my head, but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still - good for on the go maintenance of my mop top.</li>
            <li> who liked it but didn&#x27;t want  a one trick pony.</li>
            <li> This thing is definitely handy.  </li>
            <li> Was happy with the delivery, the product itself, but most importantly the integrity of the company itself!</li>
            <li> so he can re-style it without re-showering nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my cap many times and have been very pleased each time.  </li>
            <li> Saw this on sharhtank and thought it would be perfect for my 7 year old son.  </li>
            <li> With this, he gets rid of that quickly and is on his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product could not recommend it more.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price; especially if you shower at night and not each morning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product for exactly what it does - and it works flawless each and every time - just a quick wring after each use</li>
            <li> They love using it now - it&#x27;s so easy and works so well!</li>
            <li> The kids and the pigs are happy and we are happy to have a dry couch.</li>
            <li> Perfect to use when he wants to quickly style his hair and go.  </li>
            <li> Works like it should, but if you are already dressed, make sure you drape a towel over your neck/shoulders for any runoff water.</li>
            <li> This is better then nothing.  </li>
            <li> The longer hair the better</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple uses I can say I am really glad I got this.</li>
            <li> I was then able to towel try my hair</li>
            <li> So I tried it again, with more vigorous massaging.</li>
            <li> I wrung it out, and tried it again with more water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure he could get away with just wearing it, but whatever works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and it works, what more can you want?</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I think it works even better than advertised.  </li>
            <li> myself love the  product...</li>
            <li> it works so much better than just wetting your hair with a washcloth like one of the lady sharks</li>
            <li> I really love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> MH is great because it&#x27;s specifically designed for guys who are already clean but may need that quick hair rinse in the morning to get rid of bed head</li>
            <li> so is much better for adults.  </li>
            <li> I love and use it.  </li>
            <li> They love being held in this</li>
            <li> Will be buying more for gifts.</li>
            <li> My wife should have known better.  </li>
            <li> I workout after work most days and shower in the evening.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So I love the morning head.</li>
            <li> Would by again :)</li>
            <li> I love the concept that you can fix your hair in a matter of seconds or so.  </li>
            <li> The more I use this, the more I like it.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you wring it out after every use.</li>
            <li> Might have a smell after a couple of weeks, make sure to laundry.</li>

            <li> Could not have asked for better.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Resist the urge to use more water - 1/4 cup will do it.</li>
            <li> OK execution.</li>
            <li> However it is better than just using your hands or wetting a towel.</li>
            <li> more than just rinsed with water</li>
            <li> sure you let the water soak in before putting it on your head.</li>
            <li> most of the water out after using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-materials seem okay.</li>
            <li> Was kind of an impulse purchase since it was available for prime</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> The logo on the top is a bumper sticker.  </li>
            <li> and  I am glad I was watching Shark Tank that night to learn about it.  </li>
            <li> though I have to add water twice to the cap, it is way better to use it since this way</li>
            <li> The product is definitely better than using a damp washcloth on your hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the coolest inventions ever, and my morning routine in infinity better and easier for it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this cap; I saw it on Shark Tank and ordered it because it seemed like a great product.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Many times I wake up in the morning with no time to do anything.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> VERY COOL product.  </li>
            <li> If you hair is super super short it is not as effective, but for medium length hair it is so perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the best $11 I&#x27;ve ever spent.  </li>
            <li> and I bought 4 of them to send to my favorite friends to enjoy.</li>
            <li> Yes, I looked like I was dying my hair at the stop light, but I literally was able to get out the door in under 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Really works well when you need to get your hair in top shape for a quick video conference, so convenient and effective!</li>
            <li> Like many others, we originally saw this on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li> Cap does start getting a musty odor after a while, however that is easily resolved by throwing it in the washing machine.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest washing it separately to avoid lint and fuzz attaching itself to the towel portion of the cap.  </li>
            <li> I could continue to use a facecloth or to put my head under the faucet because both methods word fine.</li>
            <li> OMG my hair looks awesome without a mess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Steve (and my son Caden thanks you more!)</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use, low price.</li>
            <li> It was a huge hassle</li>
            <li> However, this solves a huge problem that  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, this seems like a cheap, novelty product</li>
            <li> He said it fit snugly</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> The material used on the inside of the cap is really cheap.</li>
            <li> I purchased the morninghead because i occasionally shower at night, and thought this would give a great way to fix up my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Only used it a couple times, but it worked great.</li>
            <li> so I had to wad it in to fit it in the cap</li>
            <li> poured in the recommended amount of 2/3 cup and let it soak in for a few seconds then started to go to town, especially on my most affected areas.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my 7 year hates the way my wife and I dampen his hair in the morning with a mist of warm water and a comb to get him ready for school.  </li>
            <li> I also bought one for my son whom has been using it daily with joy.</li>
            <li> so the morning head has been perfect to get his hair ready for school the next morning.</li>
            <li> After the 3rd time I heard about it I decided to do some more research and saw it got some pretty great reviews</li>
            <li> I needed a quick and easy way to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> fun product that works!</li>
            <li> but I normally use a spray bottle which is just as effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this may work for some, however for me</li>
            <li> Very simple to use, and comes in handy!</li>
            <li> saw the Morninghead on Shark Tank and was more than willing to give the product a try,  I ordered two, one for my son and one for my boyfriend</li>
            <li> They saw this product on Shark Tank and got excited about it, so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> since I know I&#x27;m already clean from the night before.</li>
            <li> if I could count on always finding a clean towel in my house, and then I can just imagine it in the&lt;br /&gt;hamper</li>
            <li> I still think it is a great idea, but not really for kids.  </li>
            <li> If you have short hair it doesn&#x27;t work so good.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased by how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a light gray or graphite color would make it look better with a smaller repeating logo incorporated into a outer design pattern would look better.</li>
            <li> So I use this, takes a second, and looks good.</li>
            <li> They love these new caps!</li>
            <li> or it starts to smell quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair look fresh out of the shower without getting water on the rest of you!&lt;br /&gt;I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This cap confines the excess water and makes for a quick bedhead fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mehhhh, the thing quickly started to smell after a 5 days.</li>
            <li> when and if it wears out he will order another!!!Shark tank really missed the mark on this one should have invested this !!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised!  </li>
            <li> It works exactly how it is supposed to!</li>
            <li> So much better than dipping the comb in the faucet, pouring water on his head with my hand, and even better than the spray bottle which sends a stream into one single spot.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> This thing works perfectly and saves so much time and mess!!</li>
            <li> Anything to help that is worth my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put it on your head until the water is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> so we figured this was worth a shot after seeing it on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li> which is only 80% my own).</li>
            <li> Plus, I keep my natural oils which make my hair look even better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $11 (cheaper than a couple rounds at the bar, to put it in perspective) and you&#x27;ll get far more utility out of it.</li>
            <li> but when you take it off, your hair has a distinct mildew smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It Works well- much better than my old spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> A useful tool for morning hair it needs to be</li>
            <li> I am honestly surprised more people don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> It is nice not to feel I have to wash my hair daily -  who has time for that!  </li>
            <li> My 8 year old loves it and he looks much better.  </li>
            <li> , this is a useful  item for mom, dad and kiddo alike.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> In spite of this, it still is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I definitely differ with the Sharks on this one; in my opinion, the simple concept of putting a highly absorbent material inside a waterproof cap is brilliant!</li>
            <li> It completely absorbs the water in seconds and is super easy to wring out after you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a fine balance at first on not putting too much water in it and waiting the right time for absorption, but</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll be damned if it doesn&#x27;t just WORK RIGHT.</li>
            <li> and he bought it right away.  </li>
            <li> I had each morning and the price was right.</li>
            <li> so i try to add the right amount of water.</li>
            <li> it right when i got it in this</li>
            <li> I saw this on shark tank, and said I am buying this RIGHT NOW and did.</li>
            <li> and I never can get it to look right unless I shower again.  </li>
            <li> So Morninghead Cap was suppose to help right?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as good as new again for the next use.</li>
            <li> Pretty useful but</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean and get ready for next use.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about this product I thought it was funny name but not practical or worth it.</li>
            <li> Morninghead helps me get ready for work quickly and allows me to not wear a baseball cap on the days</li>
            <li> what a great idea.&amp;#34;  I have short hair and sometimes (especially if I shower in the evening)</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time and was amazed.</li>
            <li> Just enough to be able to style your hair and get rid of bedhead</li>
            <li> I am most definitely not a morning person, and for that reason prefer to shower at night.</li>
            <li> The one thing I&#x27;d like to see with the next MH would be a bit more antibacterial protection in the lining of the cap.</li>
            <li> It works better on bigger heads</li>
            <li> But I do think the marketing campaign is hilarious and is what initially caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> wake up with bed head, use morning head, and am able to have the intentional &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; that I actually want!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> I found it to be exactly as described.</li>
            <li> but I personally find this more convenient.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> and it really does work!</li>
            <li> Funny, he used to not want me to bother messing with his hair...</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is, and I respect it for that reason.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I love the way the product works, though it does seem to not work as well upon multiple uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Duh if you are going to add extra water, or don&#x27;t make sure it absorbs into the material, be prepared that it&#x27;s going to leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much water at all!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-also when it is on the top of my head i am trying to move it around back and forth</li>
            <li> but i am only moving the top layer of the cap and</li>
            <li> not sure how many uses i will be able to get out of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First I noticed that no water escaped from the cap.</li>
            <li> Well, in our case, quite the contrary, but despite that fact, I added the maximum amount of water but not enough so that it would drip, and just warm enough to make it comfortable.  </li>
            <li> , I love it and it saves me a big hassle in the morning!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a lark because I thought it was a funny idea.</li>
            <li> At the time of leaving this review I am currently buying two more units of this product as gifts to my family.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work better for guys&#x27; short haircuts.</li>
            <li> I had to safety pin the edge up a bit since my head is smaller than most people</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Thanks for helping validate my hippie lifestyle...now go recycle something!</li>
            <li> I first saw this item on Shark Tank and I was &amp;</li>
            <li> I added more water the second time.</li>
            <li> , thanks guys!</li>
            <li> it does its job very well, once you figure out the right amount of water.  </li>
            <li> Simple but useful !!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of getting my hair wet enough</li>
            <li> I saw this product on Shark Tank and even though there was no deal with the Sharks, I thought it was a good idea, not necessarily for myself but for my son who definitely has &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34; when he gets up!!  </li>
            <li> In fact, I love it so much that I bought extra so that I could give morninghead to my friends.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much it does what it says</li>
            <li> Okay that doesn&#x27;t take long, but water everywhere, shampoo in your ears, etc.</li>
            <li> Yes, there are other ways to wet your hair but this is darn easy, and most importantly, it keeps the drips off my face and shoulders - everywhere except my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope to see something a little more manly soon!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t drip at all, and it fits my big head (7-7/8 cap size) easily.</li>
            <li> Wonder if the creator has thought of this as a possible product to sell to nursing homes and/or hospital patients who don&#x27;t always find it easy to wash their hair?</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s decent and would definitely make for a good gift for someone else or yourself, if you have the extra money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a certain family member who spills water all over the bathroom when wetting his hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> It appears this is made for a large head</li>
            <li> I was eager to use it the next day, and I thought it worked great although it slightly dripped.</li>
            <li> It is fine for moderate length hair.  </li>
            <li> Name aside, this product really does work as it says it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of use, I feel that you don&#x27;t need as much water as the product suggests.</li>
            <li> This seems to do a much cleaner job.  </li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t really leave it on, just puts it on at the sink and rubs it around.  </li>
            <li> Then I can comb it out and am ready to go, with no frizz and no bed head.</li>
            <li> It was cheap enough that i&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> you wake up with bed head that no matter how much water you dab on your head wont go away, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and we can even take it with us when we travel.</li>
            <li> It works really well though.</li>
            <li> But it does work... and very well.  </li>
            <li> This product really works for what it is made for and I am now using every weekend.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> and it came out very tangled.  </li>
            <li> Uses it every morning and really likes it.</li>
            <li> the absorbing part does not move at all.</li>
            <li> otherwise it isn&#x27;t really needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i made the mistake of adding a bit too much water and it didn&#x27;t soak all the way in so the water still leaked</li>
            <li> /&gt;-i wonder if it would fit if you had a slightly smaller head.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and don&#x27;t add too much water, because it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> For me, it is much easier to use than sticking my head under the faucet in the tub.</li>
            <li> so this works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> and THEN I will really use it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Their hair basically sticks straight up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and he is ready for work.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need a whole cup of water in the cap.  </li>
            <li> It works, and it was cheap enough.</li>
            <li> Its really just a shower cap that retains water.</li>
            <li> my hair parts where it wants to</li>
            <li> and then style it without much fuss.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is just really stinky?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t hold as much water.</li>
            <li> As my headline mentions, wetting my comb was a much faster and easier way to re-wet my hair.</li>
            <li> This product did give me a good idea though just wet a microfiber towel and do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I kind of got used to it after a couple of days and now use it everyday and did it so it didn&#x27;t drip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i can see this good once in a while if you are running late or have to be something immediately.</li>
            <li> I had the exact same experience as Lucky Student.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but it would be nice if I can stretch out the use of a morninghead for as long as possible because I&#x27;m cheap and</li>
            <li> i usually wear hats 7 1/2 - 7 5/8 and this fit me fine.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he fell in love harder than he did when he saw it on TV!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s easy to use, hang up and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and nothing about the product is exaggerated or inflated in either it&#x27;s packaging or marketing.</li>
            <li> It really depends on the person and their hair, but it works decent for me.</li>
            <li> - I highly recommend this product - it really truly works</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is supposed to last up to 3 months and for the price, I will certainly buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> He sometimes wants a quick run and go and this actually works.  </li>
            <li> It looks like a great product for white ppl and other races with similar hair texture.</li>
            <li> Clever name.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Clever idea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably mainly use it for the weekends.  </li>
            <li> far as it having problems with mildew, I first off I will probably get a new one of these in six months or something, it&#x27;s well built</li>
            <li> I have short hair and found a little bit less water yields the best results.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Morninghead.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is high.  </li>
            <li> Morninghead makes it easy to get up at 5am, get my hair wet, and hit the gym!  </li>
            <li> so far, we haven&#x27;t had much luck.</li>
            <li> This is a really simple and useful product.  </li>
            <li> fun gift, but definitely could live without it.</li>
            <li> Morninghead is simple and effective, and solves my bedhead problem without the time or clean-up typically associated with getting out of the house in the morning.  </li>
            <li> the only complaint i have is that the water is not as evenly distributed as i would like off the bat (i.e., it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb &amp;#34;sideways&amp;#34;); you kind of have to switch it around a bit.</li>
            <li> Honestly by the time you wet it, wear it, and clean it to keep it from smelling funny, it easier to just tussle your hair with a wet hand and wear a host for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It took a couple times using them to figure out how much water to use (which was a LOT less than they originally thought).</li>
            <li> So simple and so smart!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold enough water in the felt of the cap to wet the hair sufficiently, unless you fill it up like a bowl and just let the water dump out on top of your head.  </li>
            <li> I want to love it because I often shower at night and just need to wet my hair in the morning, but often I find myself still just washing my face and then throwing the water on my head instead of getting out the morninghead cap and fussing with the amount of water to make it work properly for my hair.</li>
            <li> Very busy schedule.  </li>
            <li> (so far) that I&#x27;ve talked into it!  </li>
            <li> Yes, the commercial is funny</li>
            <li> With this product, I&#x27;m investing around a minute, maybe less, depending on how long it takes the hot water to get to the bathroom (the pipes, of course, being routed under the house and through France), and I can clean my hair up straight away, and use styling products if I so desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After you get past the learning curve it does exactly what the inventor says it does!!!</li>
            <li> This saves time, keeps my place dry and keeps me looking fresh.</li>
            <li> sometimes I just need to wet my hair for a quick re-style before heading out.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> - so the elastic doesn&#x27;t fit around my head as tightly as it could.</li>
            <li> Really nice for the weekend when I might want to shower later, or on a hot day when I shower late and the next morning just need to fix my hair.</li>
            <li> it will most likely be dry the next time i need to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have hair that isn&#x27;t easy to tame, but using this to moisten my hair, allows me to brush it afterwards.</li>
            <li> It will also get the top level of hair very wet while the roots of the hair stay dry.</li>
            <li> I saw the inventor of this brilliant solution to &#x27;bad hair&#x27; days on Shark Tank.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the product and would look crazy in the morning without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Josh</li>
            <li> I have nearly every morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent night-time showerer and Morninghead saves me valuable time each morning.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old is not a morning person</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already a hassle to take a shower in the morning or throw my head under the sink every morning, a task which sucks even more</li>
            <li> I still use this once in awhile when I am busy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to repeat their commercial, but the part about showering the night before after the gym and having a whole pain in the butt process the next morning because of bed head is what really caught my attention and convinced me to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a USB port, as far as I can tell, and I can&#x27;t tell where the batteries should go in.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son because he gets up too early in the morning to shower again</li>
            <li> I ordered this product while watching an old episode of Shark Tank.  </li>
            <li> Very satisified.... works well with my short hair.  </li>
            <li> He had to change to another outfit - and we added water the old fashioned way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is so simple, but it saves so much time.</li>
            <li> If water is leaking out, you&#x27;re simply putting too much water in there.</li>
            <li> I have a 7 year old and he fights me every morning to brush his hair.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old LOVES it</li>
            <li> I have two boys ages 8 and 5 years old.  </li>
            <li> This product is a complete dud.</li>
            <li> But once you get it right, the water doesn&#x27;t leak out and my hair got wet.</li>
            <li> I shower at night and usually have to stick my head under the faucet then towel dry forever to be able to quickly blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I put way more than the recommended amount of water, such that I have to wear a towel around my neck to catch the dripping, and it still doesn&#x27;t get my hair wet, just barely moist, not nearly enough to fix my morning hair.</li>
            <li> Second time I tried this, my face and neck got wet but most of my hair was still dry.</li>
            <li> If you work from home and hop on video calls daily like I do, and don&#x27;t necessarily need to hop in the shower to get the real deal, morning head is a life saver!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Wets hair very neatly without sloshing water everywhere, but my hair is long</li>
            <li> Gets my hair wet and ready to style!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this, none of my hair got wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using ring the water out, like it says in the instructions, hang up inside out and it will be ready for use by the next day.[Hopefully for use 2nd day]</li>
            <li> Unique product for those cases where hair is a mess in the morning and plan on taking a shower later in the day.</li>
            <li> This is little more than a shower cap made of material that is fuzzy on one side and plastic on the other...</li>
            <li> We use this cap to quickly wet and tame our bed-head, and it works so much better than trying to throw water on with a brush.</li>
            <li> GET A SMALL CLEAN HAND-TOWEL, SEMI-SOAK IT WITH WATER, SQUEEEEEEZE OUT</li>
            <li> This allows me to tame my hairdo quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dripped just a little, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Probably a little bit, but for the simplicity, convenience, and saved time in the morning, it still makes it worth a buy.</li>
            <li> This product was nothing more than an expensive shower cap and it did nothing more than leave parts of my hair soaking wet, and other parts barely damp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a bad product, but not as great as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> After seeing this product on a recent episode of &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34;, I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I figured the product worked, but wondered if I would really choose to use it over and over in the mornings when I showered the night before, over using my hands to wet my head from the sink or putting my head under the tub spout.</li>
            <li> I used to get water all over the sink counter and never got the back of my head completely.</li>
            <li> but now their is barely any drippage.</li>
            <li> Much easier than using a spray bottle in the morning to wet his hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on figuring out the amount of water to put into this where my hair gets damp (not dripping or just barely moistened) while evenly wetting the cap all the way around</li>
            <li> It took him a few times to get it right</li>
            <li> I usually stick my head under the shower and wash my hair really quickly.</li>
            <li> It works just as it was portrayed on Shark Tank - don&#x27;t put too much water in it tho - just enough to wet it</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is that it only comes in an adult size</li>
            <li> I like this product - it works very well doing what it says it will do - getting your hair wet enough to style.</li>
            <li> well, my hair was a little wet afterwards, but didn&#x27;t give me anything more than if I took a wet brush to it.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to shower at night for a variety of reasons, and generally do not wake up with any time in the mornings before work, while my hair looks like I&#x27;ve spent too much time in the electricity section of a children&#x27;s museum.  </li>
            <li> it took the whole process down to 30-40 seconds.  </li>
            <li> When it came in the package was slightly torn, but that didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve also used it as a showercap (it&#x27;s not tight around the edges but kept my hair generally dry)</li>
            <li> /baths only to wake up to clean, yet ridiculous looking hairdos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still tweaking how much water I need and the cap isnt tight enough to prevent water from falling out when using.</li>
            <li> but this may be due to the water quality where I live.  </li>
            <li> The product works great but where it retains moisture so well, it stinks after a few days.</li>
            <li> If you can get past looking/feeling stupid, this product is perfect for those of us who go to the gym at night, shower, and then have to get up for work in the morning.</li>
            <li> I simply hand washed mine with dish soap and left out to completely dry in the sun.</li>
            <li> You do have to let it sit long enough though</li>
            <li> If they make a cap for long hair I will definitely buy it and give it five stars.</li>
            <li> His hair was barely even wet.  </li>
            <li> 5 days would of been me using it only twice, and letting it dry per the include instructions.</li>
            <li> and I could never get my back side wet enough and water would go everywhere.</li>
            <li> Just run it under the sink for a sec or two and throw it on your noggin, and in a few seconds I&#x27;m ready for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t long-- it doesn&#x27;t touch my shoulders, but I had a really difficult time getting most of my hair wet.</li>
            <li> I take care of it like the box says but it needs to be in a fairly dry environment to make it last as long as it says it does.</li>
            <li> it works exactly as advertised - it&#x27;s drop dead simple to use, hang it up to dry, and you&#x27;re out the door in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> water will either run down your neck if you put too much or your hair won&#x27;t get wet enough if you use too little.  </li>
            <li> Bought two thinking it would be great for my mom too, but she hated hers as well.</li>
            <li> I bought it on a late night amazon whim and wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who values every second of sleep I can get, so naturally, I sleep in as late as possible.</li>
            <li> but I was not ready for actually</li>
            <li> You can see my long lux here:</li>
            <li> I have short hair I like to wet and style in the am.</li>
            <li> it did start smelling after a few uses and also developed a reddish color</li>
            <li> I will use it after helmet head after a long sweaty summer drive before going into some restaurant to eat.  </li>
            <li> By using this, my hair gets wet enough to apply product, but not too soaked an dripping all over.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> , will probably get dingy before too long, but I&#x27;d imagine as long as you just turn it inside out, wring it out, and hang it up, you probably shouldn&#x27;t have problems with mildew.</li>
            <li> She says a wet towel does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li> Morning head cap works - gets your hair wet enough to restyle it.  </li>
            <li> Simple not much to it.  </li>
            <li> Within minutes my hair was wet enough to style.</li>
            <li> I have decently long hair and use this every morning.</li>
            <li> I have manly long curly hair, and the traditional way to wet my hair is so messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My bet is that this becomes a hit stocking stuffer or secret Santa item because of the novelty of the name, but is something people also realize is quite useful.</li>
            <li> Before Morninghead, I would either do the wet washcloth thing and deal with water running down everywhere, or use the handheld in the shower and forget to turn it off, causing my husband to yelp loudly</li>
            <li> It does work, but I find if you put too much water in the cap it leaks out and water runs down your face/neck; and if you put too little water your hair is still dry in spots.  </li>
            <li> Saw this product last night on a Sharp Tank episode.</li>
            <li> men.&lt;br /&gt;Having very thick straight hair, my hair has to have water on it after sleeping to get it back in place.  </li>
            <li> My hair was literally dry afterward.</li>
            <li> My hair was almost completely dry.</li>
            <li> let it air dry</li>
            <li> Also, I did notice that although I did ring it out after use and let it air dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It needs some way to help it dry faster.</li>
            <li> He wets it, puts it on his head and rubs it around, then hangs it to dry.  </li>
            <li> Wring it out, turn it inside out and toss it over the shower curtain pole so it gets plenty of air to dry</li>
            <li> Need to ring it out after use and hang inside out to dry between uses.  </li>
            <li> It does take a while to dry the cap, inside out even, but I don&#x27;t need or want to use it every day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a while for the cap to dry between uses, but that&#x27;s no biggie.  </li>
            <li> Flip it inside out and let it hang dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a silly fun present, serves its purpose and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> but for only 4 or 5 uses it&#x27;s not worth my money.</li>
            <li> or the water runs down your face and back!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Water dripped all the way down my son&#x27;s back - soaked through his shirt and pants.  </li>
            <li> Thank you, Now I don&#x27;t have to dry my hands after wetting my hair!</li>
            <li> A wet washcloth lets water go all over the place, including a dry shirt.</li>
            <li> Typically I keep my hair very short, but when it does start to grow out and leave me with bed head, this product has worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> possibly at some point they can make the cap in various sizes (small for me).</li>
            <li> Allows me to get my messy hair fixed within a minute or 2 without the mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, coarse and slightly curly, so it&#x27;a a big, big pain.</li>
            <li> Compared to using the sink, it uses only a little bit of water and makes no mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> has been leaving little white fuzzballs in my hair; I pick out one or two per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought, hey, a shower cap thing that will do the same job without the dripping down his neck and causing drama!  </li>
            <li> You look kind of stupid while you&#x27;re using it, but I&#x27;ve used mine every morning for a week.</li>
            <li> Also, not sure how long this thing will last.  </li>
            <li> I shower at night and every morning have to wet my hair in the sink.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get your head soaking, sopping wet.  </li>
            <li> One of the &amp;#34;sharks&amp;#34; said, &amp;#34;just use a wet washcloth.&amp;#34; What was she thinking?</li>
            <li> The Morninghead cap contains the water, and gets my hair wet without my having to wear a towel around my shoulders.</li>
            <li> then I can style it wet</li>
            <li> so I can craft it, but not so wet that I have to towel it off.</li>
            <li> Use a wet washcloth instead of this product.  </li>
            <li> Oh, I have used a cup of water or my hands or a wet comb</li>
            <li> I use it with shampoo, not just to wet my hair.</li>
            <li> we don&#x27;t want our hair to get wet in the shower unless we washing</li>
            <li> We get the cap wet, out on his head, rub around and take off cap.  </li>
            <li> Your hair gets wet, nothing else.</li>
            <li> Get it wet, put it on your head, get your hair wet, wring it out and put it on the towel rack, style your damn hair.</li>
            <li> This replaces anytime you&#x27;re running your head under the sink to wet your head.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to get my hair wet in the sink and get water everywhere.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is how stinky it gets after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> My son LOVES it as he doesn&#x27;t flood the bathroom trying to wet his hair in the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> Too, he reports that his shirts do not get wet.  </li>
            <li> , I had to use it carefully.</li>
            <li> I tried again despite the screams, and it was not much</li>
            <li> Gets my guy&#x27;s hair wet</li>
            <li> I had to fight with them to let me wet it and comb it in the morning.  </li>
            <li> This product does the trick, it lets me wet my hair</li>
            <li> Now I can sleep in for ten more minutes not having to worry about fixing my annoyingly curly</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so a pretty severe case of bed head is usually in order.</li>
            <li> My boys hate making their hair look nice for school in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it a bed head cure, but a bad dream cure as it makes me laugh whenever I use it!</li>
            <li> Although, at its longest, my hair is maybe an inch and a half long.</li>
            <li> As a guy witch horrible bed head and a ridiculous cowlick, this thing is awesome in the morning!</li>
            <li> My son typically showers at night after his evening workout, and therefore doesn&#x27;t need to shower in the morning, but his hair is a mess in the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He is 14, and always has ridiculous hair in the morning but never has time to completely take a shower (at that time).</li>
            <li> If you have short hair use a little less</li>
            <li> Wet hair you can style!</li>
            <li> ; however, I didn&#x27;t like using multiple face cloths or putting my head under the faucet which usually resulted in water on the bathroom vanity and sometimes the floor.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed it around on his head while he screamed, and when I was done, there were a few areas where the ends of his hair were damp, but the rest was dry.  </li>
            <li> I am not able to wash  my hair every day because of my scalp, but my curly hair can go flat.  </li>
            <li> I would return it, but it&#x27;s not worth the postage.</li>
            <li> Sorry I couldn&#x27;t resist the pun - this product really is a lifesaver, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a man with longer hair this has saved me from being late or looking like a slob numerous times!</li>
            <li> The water went down my neck and chest, with some this time getting into my hair too.</li>
            <li> I never notice water running down my head or the side of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and no water dripped down the sides which is what I feared.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the sharks shot this down.  </li>
            <li> Since he takes his showers the night before, I often would pat his hair down with water and drive him</li>
            <li> I take my showers in the evening and am the typical &amp;#34;stick</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s got a serious cowlick in the back too.  </li>
            <li> it is both faster and less messy hands down.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband who was always making a mess at the bathroom sink, trying to soak his hair to get rid of his bedhead.  </li>
            <li> My husband at first thought I was crazy but he loves it now.</li>
            <li> and when they pee or poo it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t make a mess in the bathroom and my hair is evenly moistened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used washcloths for years and always made a mess.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected with the Morninghead Cap.</li>
            <li> Just decided to add a little less water.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a shower cap with a polyester liner that hold a little water.  </li>
            <li> so it leaks a little.  </li>
            <li> No drips of cold water down my back and my hair is perfectly wet without being too wet.  </li>
            <li> I bought one for my son, but it&#x27;s hard to get his hair wet with it?</li>
            <li> Waste of money, does not do a thing to my hair.</li>
            <li> When my hair is messy in the morning before work or after a nap</li>
            <li> Do recommend for people who get messy hair every morning.</li>
            <li> Instead of either wetting the comb or wetting my hands and taking a few minutes to do my hair, now I just put water in the cap, put it on my head, wring it out, and comb my hair...</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> having this for a few weeks i can give it a star rating of 3.&lt;br /&gt;-i have medium length hair</li>
            <li> After about 30-45 seconds I took it off and dried my hair.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months now.</li>
            <li> the fabric keeps getting moldy after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few time at work before a shift.</li>
            <li> Wetting under faucet or in tub wastes water.  </li>
            <li> Overall, after 2 weeks with approximately 4 or 5 uses the thing was trashed.</li>
            <li> and I like that my bathroom sink is no longer drenched due to his hair wetting ways of the past!</li>
            <li> but then there is never a good way to not jump in in the mornings to get my hair wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say this is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little brother!</li>
            <li> A lot of convenience for very little money.</li>
            <li> No more morning head.  </li>
            <li> I usually end the day with exercise and a shower...</li>
            <li> I bought 2 morning head caps for my sons who both are lazy about doing their hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old wakes up with crazy bed-head every day.  </li>
            <li> I also think it&#x27;s sort of weird how the product name is simply a sticker stuck to a shower cap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll usually shower in the morning, but a couple days a week</li>
            <li> Most of the time they go to school looking awful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a damn shower everyday!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a little difficult to hang and dry out.</li>
            <li> There are very few interlocking parts.</li>
            <li> With medium length hair (just over the ears) it has a hard time wetting all the way through.</li>
            <li> My hair is crazy after a short nap or when I awake after showering the night before.</li>
            <li> Common sense.  </li>
            <li> not just when I wake up - but any time I feel like sprucing up - be it afternoon or even late evenings before going out</li>
            <li> two days after it arrived I woke up late for work.</li>
            <li> Keeps you from being late to work.</li>
            <li> Every negative I see on this thread could be avoided if the person read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cmon</li>
            <li> people use common sense.</li>
            <li> I bought two at the same time because I will be cutting my hair shorter soon</li>
            <li> I mean, it works.</li>
            <li> but it seriously changes the way I prepare for work each and every day.</li>
            <li> It seriously does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> It was just ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> My little guy goes to school looking a bit questionable every morning.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but I feel a little silly paying this price.</li>
            <li> My hair comes down past my collar, and is very difficult to get under the cap.</li>
            <li> I was sooooooo disappointed that the people on Shark Tank were so clueless to the problem of daily bed head for both women and</li>
            <li> Finally have a solution to my stupid hair that always sticks up.</li>
            <li> It works, but not great.  </li>
            <li> That way it wouldn&#x27;t become so nasty fast.</li>
            <li> Total crap.</li>
            <li> I get terrible bedhead, and typically I have to make a mess or take another shower just trying to get it under control.  </li>
            <li> But I feel like an idiot with this wet shower cap on my head.</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want stale water setting it and getting smelly and mildewy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often, but it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li> Some Alzheimer patients are afraid of water but would tolerate a damp cap to organize their hair.  </li>
            <li> I could relate to the bad hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> The product name is kinda stupid</li>
            <li> The worst part of my day is the morning.</li>
            <li> It does get nasty after a while</li>
            <li> bought one for my father as well, he has to use a CPAP his sleep apnea and he&#x27;s been waking up with a terrible cowlick because of the mask.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought two after seeing it on Sharktank.  Did not work that well, my hair was a little wet afterwards, but didn&#x27;t give me anything more than if I took a wet brush to it.  Bought two thinking it would be great for my mom too, but she hated hers as well.</li>
            <li> Works like it should, but if you are already dressed, make sure you drape a towel over your neck/shoulders for any runoff water.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, does not do a thing to my hair.</li>
            <li> Saw it on Shark Tank.  Works as advertised. A wonderful product and makes the morning head - a breeze.</li>
            <li> This thing was made for me. I shower at night and every morning have to wet my hair in the sink. You look kind of stupid while you&#x27;re using it, but I&#x27;ve used mine every morning for a week. No signs of wear (yet).</li>
            <li> It works, but not great.  Nothing works as good as a shower.  This is better then nothing.  If you have short hair it doesn&#x27;t work so good.  The longer hair the better it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I saw this on shark tank and thought what a great idea. My hair is crazy after a short nap or when I awake after showering the night before. I would soak my head in the shower and I could never get my back side wet enough and water would go everywhere. It was a huge hassle and I wanted to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple uses I can say I am really glad I got this. It takes some experimentation to find the perfect amount of water to put in. But once you get it right, the water doesn&#x27;t leak out and my hair got wet. I was then able to towel try my hair and it was like getting out of the shower. This saves time, keeps my place dry and keeps me looking fresh. Great idea, way to go.</li>
            <li> VERY COOL product.  Have used it several times and it works excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Shark Tank lost out on this one!</li>
            <li> I had the exact same experience as Lucky Student. My hair is short. I followed the directions exactly. My hair was literally dry afterward. The water simply did not transfer to my hair at all. So I tried it again, with more vigorous massaging. My hair was almost completely dry. I wrung it out, and tried it again with more water. The water went down my neck and chest, with some this time getting into my hair too. I want this to work. Am I doing something wrong? Are some of them defective?</li>
            <li> Pretty much it does what it says - you put a bunch of water in it in the sink, maybe let some drip out if needed, and then rub it on your head. Voila! No more morning head.  Squeeze it out and you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> Name aside, this product really does work as it says it does. I used mine this morning. The worst part of my day is the morning. Anything to help that is worth my money. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I saw this product mentioned on Shark Tank and immediately ordered it. The product looked great on TV but I was not ready for actually how well it would work. I take my showers in the evening and am the typical &amp;#34;stick my head under the sink in the morning to get my hair ready&amp;#34; person. This product saves me an immense amount of time each morning. You no longer have to wait for the water to warm up nor do you have to worry about splashing water everywhere on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of use, I feel that you don&#x27;t need as much water as the product suggests. I have short hair and found a little bit less water yields the best results. I never notice water running down my head or the side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works wonderfully. It completely absorbs the water in seconds and is super easy to wring out after you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this seems like a cheap, novelty product but it seriously changes the way I prepare for work each and every day. This is one perfect example of a life-hack gone right.</li>
            <li> It works just as it was portrayed on Shark Tank - don&#x27;t put too much water in it tho - just enough to wet it</li>
            <li> I mean, it works. But I feel like an idiot with this wet shower cap on my head. Honestly by the time you wet it, wear it, and clean it to keep it from smelling funny, it easier to just tussle your hair with a wet hand and wear a host for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time and was amazed. It is such a simple idea, and it is well executed. Dump some water in, swish it around, put it on your head, and rub it in. The perfect cure for the terrible bed head I have nearly every morning.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband who was always making a mess at the bathroom sink, trying to soak his hair to get rid of his bedhead.  This seems to do a much cleaner job.  He doesn&#x27;t really leave it on, just puts it on at the sink and rubs it around.  I&#x27;m sure he could get away with just wearing it, but whatever works.  He likes it, and there&#x27;s not a ton on water being splashed all over, so I&#x27;m happy.  Good idea!</li>
            <li> He loved it!  He sometimes wants a quick run and go and this actually works.  He said it fit snugly and no water dripped down the sides which is what I feared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fun product that works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent night-time showerer and Morninghead saves me valuable time each morning. It&#x27;s affordable and it works, what more can you want?</li>
            <li> I love this product.  When I saw it on Shark I knew I had to have it.  Sometimes I just don&#x27;t have time for a shower and this product gets me out the door in a hurry, like to walk the dog without scaring the neighbors.  I think it works even better than advertised.  The woman on Shark said a washcloth works just as well but I don&#x27;t agree.  There&#x27;s something about the way the moisture is evenly distributed within the product that makes it work as well as it does.  Just enough to be able to style your hair and get rid of bedhead and you don&#x27;t have to use a blow dryer.  I&#x27;ve used my cap many times and have been very pleased each time.  A lot of convenience for very little money.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. As described. Clever name. Get one for yourself or do what I did and send one to your lady to give to you. Hello, lady!</li>
            <li> Ordered the morning head cap after the airing on Shark Tank.  I&#x27;m sorry to say this is a total waste of money. The material used on the inside of the cap is really cheap. I tried using it twice and it left white cotton all over my head. This product did give me a good idea though just wet a microfiber towel and do the same thing. Works 100 times better!!</li>
            <li> The second I saw this product on Shark Tank I went to Amazon and ordered it... so did my sister and now I have 4 cousins and three friends (so far) that I&#x27;ve talked into it!  It&#x27;s like magic!  I have loooong curly hair and am not supposed to wash it daily.  I could never figure out what to do with it.  I simply use my Morninghead Cap and OMG my hair looks awesome without a mess.  Brilliant invention.  You can see my long lux here: [...]</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  Doesn&#x27;t get your head soaking, sopping wet.  Super easy to clean and get ready for next use.</li>
            <li> It works.  Period.  Just follow the instructions.  Don&#x27;t put it on your head until the water is absorbed.  Common sense.  I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with morning head. It works as advertised. I have short hair I like to wet and style in the am. When I shower at night I don&#x27;t like to shower again the next morning. Gets my hair wet and ready to style!</li>
            <li> This product was nothing more than an expensive shower cap and it did nothing more than leave parts of my hair soaking wet, and other parts barely damp.  I would return it, but it&#x27;s not worth the postage.</li>
            <li> I saw this item on Shark Tank, and immediately looked it up and ordered one. It&#x27;s terrific! One of the &amp;#34;sharks&amp;#34; said, &amp;#34;just use a wet washcloth.&amp;#34; What was she thinking? A wet washcloth lets water go all over the place, including a dry shirt. The Morninghead cap contains the water, and gets my hair wet without my having to wear a towel around my shoulders. Then I can comb it out and am ready to go, with no frizz and no bed head. Great invention.</li>
            <li> This thing is essential.  I prefer to shower at night for a variety of reasons, and generally do not wake up with any time in the mornings before work, while my hair looks like I&#x27;ve spent too much time in the electricity section of a children&#x27;s museum.  With this product, I&#x27;m investing around a minute, maybe less, depending on how long it takes the hot water to get to the bathroom (the pipes, of course, being routed under the house and through France), and I can clean my hair up straight away, and use styling products if I so desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever showered the night before, or taken a nap, or worn a hat, you need this.  Probably.</li>
            <li> I saw you on the Sharks..I think they made a mistake..I thought it was something to look into so I ordered from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;I myself love the  product...it works so much better than just wetting your hair with a washcloth like one of the lady sharks said&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to wash my  hair as often... npw about every third day compared to every day as it is short &amp; when I get up In the morning&lt;br /&gt;it looks like a train wreck..I pour water into the cap...put it on my head squash it around my head my hair get saturated enough&lt;br /&gt;&amp; not dripping all over the place...then I can style it wet let it air dry &amp; I&#x27;m on  my way &amp; my hair looks shiny &amp; like I just&lt;br /&gt;washed &amp; styled it.  I think men women with short hair should consider buying one!</li>
            <li> Saves me from having to stick my head under the faucet every morning. Does a great job of getting my hair wet enough so I can craft it, but not so wet that I have to towel it off.</li>
            <li> Morninghead makes it easy to get up at 5am, get my hair wet, and hit the gym!  Great product, easy to use, low price.</li>
            <li> I am most definitely not a morning person, and for that reason prefer to shower at night. After seeing this product on a recent episode of &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34;, I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. Typically I keep my hair very short, but when it does start to grow out and leave me with bed head, this product has worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old is not a morning person so he likes to shower at night before bed. He always has the wackiest hair in the morning as a result so we figured this was worth a shot after seeing it on Shark Tank. Using it is now part of his morning routine on school days!</li>
            <li> This is the best $11 I&#x27;ve ever spent.  I get terrible bedhead, and typically I have to make a mess or take another shower just trying to get it under control.  Morninghead is simple and effective, and solves my bedhead problem without the time or clean-up typically associated with getting out of the house in the morning.  I highly recommend it if you have the same problem.</li>
            <li> When I saw the somewhat fratty name, I didn&#x27;t think I would ever use it, but lo and behold...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do MMA at nights so I come home and take a shower every night since I&#x27;d rather not baste in sweat (which is only 80% my own). It&#x27;s already a hassle to take a shower in the morning or throw my head under the sink every morning, a task which sucks even more since I know I&#x27;m already clean from the night before. That&#x27;s when I started using MH.  MH is great because it&#x27;s specifically designed for guys who are already clean but may need that quick hair rinse in the morning to get rid of bed head and/or helmet hair (if you ride a bike or segway to work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Plus, I keep my natural oils which make my hair look even better. The one thing I&#x27;d like to see with the next MH would be a bit more antibacterial protection in the lining of the cap. I take care of it like the box says but it needs to be in a fairly dry environment to make it last as long as it says it does. Not a big deal, but it would be nice if I can stretch out the use of a morninghead for as long as possible because I&#x27;m cheap and lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witty name, solid product. My routine is now shower at night so I can morninghead it when I get up.</li>
            <li> This works pretty great if you can find the perfect amount of water to put in it otherwise water will either run down your neck if you put too much or your hair won&#x27;t get wet enough if you use too little.  Also, I did notice that although I did ring it out after use and let it air dry it did start smelling after a few uses and also developed a reddish color but this may be due to the water quality where I live.  I still use this once in awhile when I am busy but I normally use a spray bottle which is just as effective.</li>
            <li> I figured the product worked, but wondered if I would really choose to use it over and over in the mornings when I showered the night before, over using my hands to wet my head from the sink or putting my head under the tub spout. Well after about 30+ mornings I can tell you - YES!  it is both faster and less messy hands down. I used to get water all over the sink counter and never got the back of my head completely. This is a really simple and useful product.  It does get nasty after a while and you MUST wash it.  As the directions say, wash it with antibacterial soap, or machine wash on delicates.&lt;br /&gt;  I will get another to keep in the wind jammer of my motorcycle - knowing I will use it after helmet head after a long sweaty summer drive before going into some restaurant to eat.  Simple but useful !!</li>
            <li> Save yourself some money.  Use a wet washcloth instead of this product.  It works, but just costly for what it is.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a certain family member who spills water all over the bathroom when wetting his hair in the morning. He loves it and his wife is even happier.</li>
            <li> I usually end the day with exercise and a shower... but then there is never a good way to not jump in in the mornings to get my hair wet. Oh, I have used a cup of water or my hands or a wet comb but water is getting on my shirt and everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Morninghead cap takes care of all of that. I add the water, rub it on my head, turn it inside out and ring out. Im off after styling my hair.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about this product I thought it was funny name but not practical or worth it. After the 3rd time I heard about it I decided to do some more research and saw it got some pretty great reviews so I figured what the heck $10 bucks I might as well try it out and I DO NOT regret that decision at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for minimizing water getting all over the bathroom or your clothes. When my hair is messy in the morning before work or after a nap and I don&#x27;t have time to shower I just fill it up and throw the cap on and it works great. Where I used to put my hand or head under the sink water would get everywhere but now their is barely any drippage.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on Shark Tank and even though there was no deal with the Sharks, I thought it was a good idea, not necessarily for myself but for my son who definitely has &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34; when he gets up!!  I still think it is a great idea, but not really for kids.  It works better on bigger heads so is much better for adults.  You do have to let it sit long enough though or the water runs down your face and back!!  After you get past the learning curve it does exactly what the inventor says it does!!! Go ahead and buy it - you know you want to!!</li>
            <li> great product just what my grandson needed!!(15) He uses it every morning.He has said he will never be without it,it works like a charm!! when and if it wears out he will order another!!!Shark tank really missed the mark on this one should have invested this !!It;s great!!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 morning head caps for my sons who both are lazy about doing their hair in the morning. They love these new caps! It took a couple times using them to figure out how much water to use (which was a LOT less than they originally thought). It makes clean-up so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I had to take deface the label (as my kids are pre-teens and I didn&#x27;t feel it was age-appropriate). But I do think the marketing campaign is hilarious and is what initially caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> I saw them on Shark Tank and bought one.  I love and use it.  In fact, I love it so much that I bought extra so that I could give morninghead to my friends.  It works just as described.</li>
            <li> Works great. My husband at first thought I was crazy but he loves it now. Got one for all my sons and brothers too</li>
            <li> Solves the problem without putting your head under the faucet.  Much simpler way to fix the messy hair you wake up with.</li>
            <li> I use it with shampoo, not just to wet my hair. So, it is a 2 step process - shampoo then rinse. It works well. My wife just doesn&#x27;t get it ....</li>
            <li> I saw this on Shark Tank. It looks like a great product for white ppl and other races with similar hair texture. I can&#x27;t imagine Blk ppl using it bc we don&#x27;t want our hair to get wet in the shower unless we washing it.&lt;br /&gt;Dry is what we expect.</li>
            <li> While this is a good idea it would be better if it was washable. That way it wouldn&#x27;t become so nasty fast.</li>
            <li> I saw the inventor of this brilliant solution to &#x27;bad hair&#x27; days on Shark Tank.  I was sooooooo disappointed that the people on Shark Tank were so clueless to the problem of daily bed head for both women and men.&lt;br /&gt;Having very thick straight hair, my hair has to have water on it after sleeping to get it back in place.  Water all over the bathroom was a daily deal.  This cap does the job and I bought 4 of them to send to my favorite friends to enjoy.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised... it perfectly fulfills my need. Thank you and bless you for a great product that you have provided.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My son now has nice hair in the morning!  We get the cap wet, out on his head, rub around and take off cap.  No drips!!  We love it!</li>
            <li> We saw this on Shark Tank and ordered it for our Guinea  pigs.  They love being held in this and when they pee or poo it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  The kids and the pigs are happy and we are happy to have a dry couch.</li>
            <li> getting three kids out the door in the morning is no longer a struggle! They can use it themselves, takes 30 minutes off the morning when they can shower at night and still look perfect for school.</li>
            <li> They have these at the hospital where I work. Except those have shampoo in them. It was cheap enough that i&#x27;ll keep it. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says. I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with curly hair and it&#x27;s always been a nightmare to deal with in the mornings. Now I can sleep in for ten more minutes not having to worry about fixing my annoyingly curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my father as well, he has to use a CPAP his sleep apnea and he&#x27;s been waking up with a terrible cowlick because of the mask. With this, he gets rid of that quickly and is on his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product could not recommend it more. Will be buying more for gifts.</li>
            <li> It seriously does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Your hair gets wet, nothing else. Style and go. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length curly hair.  I am not able to wash  my hair every day because of my scalp, but my curly hair can go flat.  By using this, my hair gets wet enough to apply product, but not too soaked an dripping all over.  There was a fine balance at first on not putting too much water in it and waiting the right time for absorption, but once i figured that out it, I&#x27;ve been very very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the sharks shot this down.  It&#x27;s a great invention.  Does what I am looking for in a couple minutes, and not one drip of water on my shirt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that does what it says it does. On days that I&#x27;m in a rush, I turn to morning head</li>
            <li> It was just ridiculous.  My wife should have known better.  It doesn&#x27;t hold enough water in the felt of the cap to wet the hair sufficiently, unless you fill it up like a bowl and just let the water dump out on top of your head.  It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> ...to have hair this fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It literally does what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wake up with bed head, use morning head, and am able to have the intentional &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; that I actually want!</li>
            <li> Saw this item on Shark Tank and even though the sharks didn&#x27;t like it, I love it!  I shower at night and usually have to stick my head under the faucet then towel dry forever to be able to quickly blow dry.  This thing works perfectly and saves so much time and mess!!</li>
            <li> GET A SMALL CLEAN HAND-TOWEL, SEMI-SOAK IT WITH WATER, SQUEEEEEEZE OUT SOME IF IT&#x27;S OVER DRIPPING, THAN MOUNT ON YOUR HEAD AND MASSAGE HEAD THOROUGHLY, AND TAH-DAH!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the morninghead because i occasionally shower at night, and thought this would give a great way to fix up my hair in the morning.  it does its job very well, once you figure out the right amount of water.  the only complaint i have is that the water is not as evenly distributed as i would like off the bat (i.e., it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb &amp;#34;sideways&amp;#34;); you kind of have to switch it around a bit.</li>
            <li> I workout after work most days and shower in the evening. Before getting this product  I was pouring water over my head using a plastic cup while bending over the sink. Had a towel positioned to &amp;#34;catch errant water&amp;#34; but not the best results as I almost always splashed it around and had to soak it up with the towel off the counter and sometimes the floor.  Not anymore! Morninghead Cap allows me to have NO SPLASHING! And it takes about a third of the time. This is a great product. I have had it a over a month now and still am very happy with it. (Purchased it after seeing it on Shark Tank. Sharks screwed up on this one in my opinion.)</li>
            <li> Sorry I couldn&#x27;t resist the pun - this product really is a lifesaver, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to repeat their commercial, but the part about showering the night before after the gym and having a whole pain in the butt process the next morning because of bed head is what really caught my attention and convinced me to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it works exactly as advertised - it&#x27;s drop dead simple to use, hang it up to dry, and you&#x27;re out the door in a few minutes. I love it. If you&#x27;re reading this review to decide whether or not to buy it, do it. It&#x27;s $11 (cheaper than a couple rounds at the bar, to put it in perspective) and you&#x27;ll get far more utility out of it.</li>
            <li> The product is great. It does exactly what it sets out to do. Just run it under the sink for a sec or two and throw it on your noggin, and in a few seconds I&#x27;m ready for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the products seems like it will hold up for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wake up with bed head that no matter how much water you dab on your head wont go away, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> My 12-year-old son likes to shower at night so the morning head has been perfect to get his hair ready for school the next morning. We were using a spray bottle but my son seem to get all the water on just one part of his head and water all over the walls.  So I love the morning head.</li>
            <li> The product works great but where it retains moisture so well, it stinks after a few days. The worst are days where it doesn&#x27;t seem to smell but when you take it off, your hair has a distinct mildew smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs some way to help it dry faster.</li>
            <li> My husband saw this on shark tank &amp; since he always sticks his head in the kitchen sink (yuk) I love this!  He said it works great!</li>
            <li> If you work from home and hop on video calls daily like I do, and don&#x27;t necessarily need to hop in the shower to get the real deal, morning head is a life saver!  Really works well when you need to get your hair in top shape for a quick video conference, so convenient and effective! GREAT PRODUCT! Would by again :)</li>
            <li> Great product!  My oldest son loves it!  Can you make a kids size?  My little guy goes to school looking a bit questionable every morning.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty cool. If you hair is super super short it is not as effective, but for medium length hair it is so perfect. I use it all the time now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this may work for some, however for me it just didn&#x27;t work.  I love the concept that you can fix your hair in a matter of seconds or so.  I just don&#x27;t have time to take a shower in the morning when I head off to work, however this just isn&#x27;t the solution for me but I&#x27;m hoping there will be one.</li>
            <li> The more I use this, the more I like it.  Even if I am going to shower &amp; shampoo later, I use it before I go on my morning walk so I don&#x27;t look a fright.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised. Just make sure you wring it out after every use. Might have a smell after a couple of weeks, make sure to laundry.</li>
            <li> My son and I saw this on Shark Tank and I had to buy it.  This really works!  He wets it, puts it on his head and rubs it around, then hangs it to dry.  Now he can go to school without looking like he just rolled out of bed (which he did).</li>
            <li> I found it to be exactly as described. I like the fact that it&#x27;s easy to use, hang up and dry. I know some people use microfiber cloths but I personally find this more convenient. I have 3 residences and bought one for each.</li>
            <li> My husband is an avid watcher of Shark Tank and was very impressed when he saw your product!  We decided to give it to him for Fathers Day and he was very happy with it!</li>
            <li> The cap is as advertised. It Works well- much better than my old spray bottle.  I wish I had invented it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after seeing it on Shark Tank.  My husband actually likes it! It took him a few times to get it right but now he uses it without difficulty.</li>
            <li> I saw the product on shark tank! I bought it as a gift for my husband and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Premise is good. I bought one for my son, but it&#x27;s hard to get his hair wet with it? Followed all directions and hoped we could use it on the way to school....so far, we haven&#x27;t had much luck.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued when I recently saw Mornighead on Chronicle.  My husband showers at night and always struggles with his hair in the morning.  We tried Morninghead and it works great!  The price is reasonable and we can even take it with us when we travel.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised!  For my husband and teenaged son it&#x27;s the perfect solution to morning bed head and helmet head.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product for exactly what it does - and it works flawless each and every time - just a quick wring after each use and it&#x27;s as good as new again for the next use. I find myself&lt;br /&gt;Using morning head not just when I wake up - but any time I feel like sprucing up - be it afternoon or even late evenings before going out - I highly recommend this product - it really truly works</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to. The length of your hair does make a difference. It works really well though. Would defiantly reccomend to anyone that wakes up with a bird nest on their head.</li>
            <li> As every review for this product says...  you open this thing up and think &amp;#34;I paid $10 for this?&amp;#34;.  But it does work... and very well.  No drips of cold water down my back and my hair is perfectly wet without being too wet.  Wring it out, turn it inside out and toss it over the shower curtain pole so it gets plenty of air to dry and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Top 10 coolest inventions</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not talking rocket science here. There are very few interlocking parts. No flux capacitor. It doesn&#x27;t have a USB port, as far as I can tell, and I can&#x27;t tell where the batteries should go in. But I&#x27;ll be damned if it doesn&#x27;t just WORK RIGHT. Get it wet, put it on your head, get your hair wet, wring it out and put it on the towel rack, style your damn hair. Repeat the next time you don&#x27;t have a morning shower. And so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo, Morninghead folks. You nailed it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works exactly as promised. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a joke for my brother&#x27;s birthday. Honest to god two days after it arrived I woke up late for work. This thing saved my ass. I grabbed a bottle of water and the Morninghead thingy and did it in the car on my way to work. Yes, I looked like I was dying my hair at the stop light, but I literally was able to get out the door in under 30 seconds. Now I have to buy another one for my brother. I&#x27;m keeping this one lol.</li>
            <li> This is a really good way to fix your hair in the morning.  I bought it for my son because he gets up too early in the morning to shower again plus he&#x27;s not a morning person.  He loves this and it really does work!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the morninghead cap.  It has let me get an additional 30 minutes of sleep in the morning not having to shower.  Keep up the good work!  I hope to see something a little more manly soon!</li>
            <li> Only used it a couple times, but it worked great.</li>
            <li> This replaces anytime you&#x27;re running your head under the sink to wet your head. Compared to using the sink, it uses only a little bit of water and makes no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it, tried it, loved it, and immediately bought one for my father-in-law... who has always gotten rid of his bedhead by washing in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like wearing a hat to cover up bedhead when I get up to go running, run errands, get the mail, or water the yard. This allows me to tame my hairdo quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it looks like a big, white shower cap when you wear it. But as the packaging says... you&#x27;re not supposed to wear it out of the house anyway!</li>
            <li> Keeps you from being late to work.</li>
            <li> It works exactly how it is supposed to! Open the cap, pour in the water, put cap on head, rub the cap around your head, and BOOM! Wet hair you can style! Turn it inside out and ring out the excess water after you are finished using the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it this morning, and I was very satisfied. I didn&#x27;t have to get my hair wet in the sink and get water everywhere. Very simple to use, and comes in handy!</li>
            <li> This is a great product I saw on shark tank, so I bought it. When it came in the package was slightly torn, but that didn&#x27;t really matter. I was eager to use it the next day, and I thought it worked great although it slightly dripped. I kind of got used to it after a couple of days and now use it everyday and did it so it didn&#x27;t drip. Do recommend for people who get messy hair every morning.</li>
            <li> Very nice product! It does what it needs to do.  I strongly suggest washing it separately to avoid lint and fuzz attaching itself to the towel portion of the cap.  Spoke with customer service and they sent me a replacement no questions asked.  Could not have asked for better.</li>
            <li> It should come in sizes.  I&#x27;m a woman and I end up drenched everytime I use it. It&#x27;s too big for my head</li>
            <li> I ordered this product while watching an old episode of Shark Tank.  This product really works for what it is made for and I am now using every weekend.&lt;br /&gt;Great Job;;;;;;</li>
            <li> Wets hair very neatly without sloshing water everywhere, but my hair is long so I had to wad it in to fit it in the cap and it came out very tangled.  If they make a cap for long hair I will definitely buy it and give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Shark Tank and had to get one.  My boyfriend loves it.  Perfect to use when he wants to quickly style his hair and go.  Would recommend this to anyone looking to do the same.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> My 10 year old wakes up with crazy bed-head every day.  He&#x27;s got a serious cowlick in the back too.  Since he takes his showers the night before, I often would pat his hair down with water and drive him nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves the product and has been using it every morning.  Funny, he used to not want me to bother messing with his hair...but he&#x27;s got some great hair and is a good looking kid! :)  But now that he has Morninghead, he&#x27;s all about his &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Steve (and my son Caden thanks you more!)</li>
            <li> My husband loves it!! It really does work! It dripped just a little, but worth it. Just decided to add a little less water.</li>
            <li> Was watching shark tank with the hubby when this product came on.  The product name is kinda stupid but he wouldn&#x27;t stop giggling and he bought it right away.  Uses it every morning and really likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who values every second of sleep I can get, so naturally, I sleep in as late as possible. Instead of either wetting the comb or wetting my hands and taking a few minutes to do my hair, now I just put water in the cap, put it on my head, wring it out, and comb my hair... it took the whole process down to 30-40 seconds.  Now that&#x27;s efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as it having problems with mildew, I first off I will probably get a new one of these in six months or something, it&#x27;s well built but it&#x27;s still just a shower cap with fabric in it, will probably get dingy before too long, but I&#x27;d imagine as long as you just turn it inside out, wring it out, and hang it up, you probably shouldn&#x27;t have problems with mildew.</li>
            <li> Generally a good product. My husband loves it. What I don&#x27;t like is how stinky it gets after only a few uses. I simply hand washed mine with dish soap and left out to completely dry in the sun. I also think it&#x27;s sort of weird how the product name is simply a sticker stuck to a shower cap. The sticker peels off and doesn&#x27;t promote the product anymore. Otherwise though, very good product for the money. I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> The product fills a need you didn&#x27;t even know you had, which counts as a win in my book. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and nothing about the product is exaggerated or inflated in either it&#x27;s packaging or marketing. It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is, and I respect it for that reason.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as stated. Finally have a solution to my stupid hair that always sticks up.</li>
            <li> Very satisified.... works well with my short hair.  Suggest wearing a bathrobe or towel around your neck in case of drips.  Resist the urge to use more water - 1/4 cup will do it. Cap does start getting a musty odor after a while, however that is easily resolved by throwing it in the washing machine.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> My son typically showers at night after his evening workout, and therefore doesn&#x27;t need to shower in the morning, but his hair is a mess in the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the Morninghead on Shark Tank and was more than willing to give the product a try,  I ordered two, one for my son and one for my boyfriend (although he has yet to try his).  My son LOVES it as he doesn&#x27;t flood the bathroom trying to wet his hair in the bathroom sink.  Too, he reports that his shirts do not get wet.  He pours the water inside, places on his head, rubs it around, removes it, styles his hair, and is out the door in record time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is supposed to last up to 3 months and for the price, I will certainly buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Got one for my son after seeing it on shark tank. He is very pleased. Much easier than using a spray bottle in the morning to wet his hair.  Need to ring it out after use and hang inside out to dry between uses.  Should come in a two pack as we&#x27;ll to save on shipping.</li>
            <li> Good concept; OK execution. I&#x27;m still tweaking how much water I need and the cap isnt tight enough to prevent water from falling out when using. However it is better than just using your hands or wetting a towel.</li>
            <li> It works, but could just use a towel to get the same result.  Also, not sure how long this thing will last.  It&#x27;s basically a shower cap with some porous towel material on the inside.</li>
            <li> A useful tool for morning hair it needs to be more than just rinsed with water otherwise it&#x27;ll start smelling. It will also get the top level of hair very wet while the roots of the hair stay dry. It really depends on the person and their hair, but it works decent for me. For the price it&#x27;s decent and would definitely make for a good gift for someone else or yourself, if you have the extra money.</li>
            <li> As a guy witch horrible bed head and a ridiculous cowlick, this thing is awesome in the morning!</li>
            <li> This would work for someone with shorter hair, something I did not consider before purchasing. My hair comes down past my collar, and is very difficult to get under the cap.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very happy with the purchase - it&#x27;s a time saver and easy to use.  Not something we tell our friends about... so an online review seems apropos.</li>
            <li> It felt (and kind of looks) like a diaper on my head, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fun gift, but definitely could live without it. Still - good for on the go maintenance of my mop top.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says. I am honestly surprised more people don&#x27;t use this. As a man with longer hair this has saved me from being late or looking like a slob numerous times!</li>
            <li> Really only works on short hair.  With medium length hair (just over the ears) it has a hard time wetting all the way through. Plus you need to rinse and wash it out or it starts to smell quickly.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Now I don&#x27;t have to dry my hands after wetting my hair! Great time saver!</li>
            <li> I love the way the product works, though it does seem to not work as well upon multiple uses. However, this solves a huge problem that  I had each morning and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Was drawn in by Shark Tank.  I thought, what a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, this did NOT work as advertised.  Followed all the directions as noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water dripped all the way down my son&#x27;s back - soaked through his shirt and pants.  The worst part?  His hair was barely even wet.  He had to change to another outfit - and we added water the old fashioned way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy this.  Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Saw the product on Shark Tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s see,&lt;br /&gt;We had two Baldies who panned it.Wonder why.&lt;br /&gt;Mark who liked it but didn&#x27;t want  a one trick pony. Makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;Robert who probably never skipped a morning shower in 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;Finally Barbara, in her ivory palace with maids to do her wash. She says a wet towel does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah if I could count on always finding a clean towel in my house, and then I can just imagine it in the&lt;br /&gt;hamper making everything moldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some suggestions&lt;br /&gt;1. Read the instructions&lt;br /&gt;2. Work the water into it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Read the instructions. Every negative I see on this thread could be avoided if the person read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cmon people use common sense. Put a 1/2 cup of water in [Like it says in the instructions] and knead it around until it absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duh if you are going to add extra water, or don&#x27;t make sure it absorbs into the material, be prepared that it&#x27;s going to leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using ring the water out, like it says in the instructions, hang up inside out and it will be ready for use by the next day.[Hopefully for use 2nd day]</li>
            <li> Works like it says, great timesaver in the mornings.</li>
            <li> This thing is so simple, but it saves so much time. Doesn&#x27;t take much water at all!</li>
            <li> Like many others, we originally saw this on Shark Tank. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he fell in love harder than he did when he saw it on TV! He used to shower every morning so he could part his hair properly and now he can finally shower at night before bed and use this in the morning. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> i essentially bought a shower cap with absorbent padding in it. It does the job, but I feel a little silly paying this price.</li>
            <li> edit 01/01/14&lt;br /&gt;after having this for a few weeks i can give it a star rating of 3.&lt;br /&gt;-i have medium length hair so i try to add the right amount of water. every time i do it the water would come pouring out the cap.&lt;br /&gt;-also when it is on the top of my head i am trying to move it around back and forth but i am only moving the top layer of the cap and the absorbing part does not move at all. rather annoying.&lt;br /&gt;-i rather just put water on my head from the sink and towel off than putting the water in the cap, using it, taking it off and wring it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can see this good once in a while if you are running late or have to be something immediately. otherwise it isn&#x27;t really needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;used it right when i got it in this morning.&lt;br /&gt;-make sure you let the water soak in before putting it on your head. i made the mistake of adding a bit too much water and it didn&#x27;t soak all the way in so the water still leaked everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;-get most of the water out after using it. i wring it out the best i can and hang it inside out. it will most likely be dry the next time i need to use it.&lt;br /&gt;-materials seem okay. not sure how many uses i will be able to get out of it.&lt;br /&gt;-i wonder if it would fit if you had a slightly smaller head. i usually wear hats 7 1/2 - 7 5/8 and this fit me fine.</li>
            <li> Saw this product on Shark Tank.  Had to have it!  Very busy schedule.  Works well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll usually shower in the morning, but a couple days a week I&#x27;ll go running after work and need to shower afterwards. Then it doesn&#x27;t make sense to shower again the next morning. I have thick hair, so a pretty severe case of bed head is usually in order. I usually stick my head under the shower and wash my hair really quickly. Okay that doesn&#x27;t take long, but water everywhere, shampoo in your ears, etc. It&#x27;s just a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I poured in the recommended amount of 2/3 cup and let it soak in for a few seconds then started to go to town, especially on my most affected areas. First I noticed that no water escaped from the cap. That&#x27;s because of the layer of the inner absorbent material that holds up to 6x it&#x27;s weight. If water is leaking out, you&#x27;re simply putting too much water in there. After about 30-45 seconds I took it off and dried my hair. Just like I took my head out from underneath the shower faucet! I would recommend (as the manufacturer does) to wring it out thoroughly. You don&#x27;t want stale water setting it and getting smelly and mildewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak about the durability of the product, since I&#x27;m just getting started with it but I will update over time. I&#x27;ll only use it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it overpriced? Probably a little bit, but for the simplicity, convenience, and saved time in the morning, it still makes it worth a buy.</li>
            <li> This thing is definitely handy.  Was kind of an impulse purchase since it was available for prime and I looked it up while the Shark Tank episode was airing.  Ordered it, and I have used it several times since then.  Follow the directions and don&#x27;t add too much water, because it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I have a 7 year old and he fights me every morning to brush his hair. It&#x27;s thick, coarse and slightly curly, so it&#x27;a a big, big pain. I saw this on shark tank, and said I am buying this RIGHT NOW and did. It arrived yesterday and I made my son try it and it WORKS! I do not care what the people on shark tank said. I love it. I don&#x27;t care about the price, cause I can&#x27;t use a needle and thread. I even tried it and was good, but my hair is longer so, I had to use it carefully. i love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my 7 year hates the way my wife and I dampen his hair in the morning with a mist of warm water and a comb to get him ready for school.  I thought, hey, a shower cap thing that will do the same job without the dripping down his neck and causing drama!  Well, in our case, quite the contrary, but despite that fact, I added the maximum amount of water but not enough so that it would drip, and just warm enough to make it comfortable.  I rubbed it around on his head while he screamed, and when I was done, there were a few areas where the ends of his hair were damp, but the rest was dry.  I tried again despite the screams, and it was not much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shower cap with a polyester liner that hold a little water.  The logo on the top is a bumper sticker.  Total crap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often, but it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. I use it after a nap sometimes. I pour about 6 ounces of water in, and squeeze the cap so the water spreads evenly. I will then wear the cap, and massage my hair a bit. It doesn&#x27;t drip at all, and it fits my big head (7-7/8 cap size) easily. I have hair that isn&#x27;t easy to tame, but using this to moisten my hair, allows me to brush it afterwards. This has saved me a lot of time and hassle already.</li>
            <li> Was happy with the delivery, the product itself, but most importantly the integrity of the company itself! Highly recommend Morninghead. My 13 year old LOVES it and I like that my bathroom sink is no longer drenched due to his hair wetting ways of the past!</li>
            <li> I saw this on Shark Tank. I thought it would work for me and my short curly hair. So I ordered it. I was pleased by how fast it arrived. I used it the next morning. For me, it is much easier to use than sticking my head under the faucet in the tub.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use. Perfect for those days you don&#x27;t want to shower.  Solves bed head at a great price point</li>
            <li> My hair curls when damp or humid so this works very well for me.  Leaves me with curly hair and I am good to go.  It does take a while to dry the cap, inside out even, but I don&#x27;t need or want to use it every day.  I just hang it on the doorknob.  Clever idea and  I am glad I was watching Shark Tank that night to learn about it.  I bought two at the same time because I will be cutting my hair shorter soon and THEN I will really use it.  It is nice not to feel I have to wash my hair daily -  who has time for that!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have manly long curly hair, and the traditional way to wet my hair is so messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have to add water twice to the cap, it is way better to use it since this way I don&#x27;t make a mess in the bathroom and my hair is evenly moistened.</li>
            <li> Saw the product advertised on The Shark Tank and took a chance. Great product, great price; especially if you shower at night and not each morning.</li>
            <li> This product works just like it&#x27;s advertised, I love it and it saves me a big hassle in the morning! Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Hilarious name too)</li>
            <li> This is being used by a man who has lots of rooster tails in the morning.  Really nice for the weekend when I might want to shower later, or on a hot day when I shower late and the next morning just need to fix my hair.</li>
            <li> Saw this product on Shark Tank. I could relate to the bad hair in the morning. Thought I would give it a try. To my amazement, it works great. Allows me to get my messy hair fixed within a minute or 2 without the mess. I also bought one for my son whom has been using it daily with joy. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months now. Works efficiently and does the job, though I find you still have to remain bent over the sink to keep it from dripping all over you.</li>
            <li> This is little more than a shower cap made of material that is fuzzy on one side and plastic on the other... but it works beautifully to do what it promises.  Gets my guy&#x27;s hair wet so he can re-style it without re-showering nicely.</li>
            <li> Could this work for .... ?  Saw this product last night on a Sharp Tank episode. Wonder if the creator has thought of this as a possible product to sell to nursing homes and/or hospital patients who don&#x27;t always find it easy to wash their hair?</li>
            <li> I use my morninghead cap almost every day! We even use it for our toddler in the morning and it works like a champ!</li>
            <li> Morninghead is a simple idea for unruly hair and a potential benefit to patients and aging residents of care facilities.assistance.  Some Alzheimer patients are afraid of water but would tolerate a damp cap to organize their hair.  This is not a substitute for washing but makes daily grooming easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for camping and biking trips and travel.  It is fine for moderate length hair.  The price is high.  I would like to see two caps per box. The product is definitely better than using a damp washcloth on your hair.</li>
            <li> I saw this on shark tank and knew I wanted one, even if they didn&#x27;t!  Yes, there are other ways to wet your hair but this is darn easy, and most importantly, it keeps the drips off my face and shoulders - everywhere except my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while for the cap to dry between uses, but that&#x27;s no biggie.  Note;  off label use - I&#x27;ve also used it as a showercap (it&#x27;s not tight around the edges but kept my hair generally dry)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little brother! He is 14, and always has ridiculous hair in the morning but never has time to completely take a shower (at that time). This product works perfect for him! :)</li>
            <li> Morning head cap works - gets your hair wet enough to restyle it.  If you have short hair use a little less then 2/3 cups of water.  Flip it inside out and let it hang dry.  Simple not much to it.  I&#x27;ll probably mainly use it for the weekends.  If the cap looked cooler than a white shower cap I would give it 5 stars.  Perhaps a light gray or graphite color would make it look better with a smaller repeating logo incorporated into a outer design pattern would look better.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an anniversary present for my husband after seeing it on Shark tank. I bought it as a lark because I thought it was a funny idea. My husband was tickled to get it after seeing the sales pitch on the show. He has used it, and it works. It&#x27;s a silly fun present, serves its purpose and works as advertised. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased morning head after seeing it on Shark Tank.  I have two boys ages 8 and 5 years old.  This product is PERFECT for them.  They take baths or showers at night so every morning they have &amp;#34;morning head&amp;#34;.  Their hair basically sticks straight up in the morning.  I had to fight with them to let me wet it and comb it in the morning.  Most of the time they go to school looking awful.  Not any more!  Morning head works great.  My 8 year old loves it and he looks much better.  The only problem with it is that it only comes in an adult size so it leaks a little.  If it came in child sizes it would be absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> My boys hate making their hair look nice for school in the mornings.  They saw this product on Shark Tank and got excited about it, so I ordered it.  They love using it now - it&#x27;s so easy and works so well!</li>
            <li> Yes, the commercial is funny and my husband thoroughly enjoys referring to this product by it&#x27;s name. All jokes aside, this is a useful  item for mom, dad and kiddo alike. My toddler and I are both prone to evening showers/baths only to wake up to clean, yet ridiculous looking hairdos. We use this cap to quickly wet and tame our bed-head, and it works so much better than trying to throw water on with a brush. My bet is that this becomes a hit stocking stuffer or secret Santa item because of the novelty of the name, but is something people also realize is quite useful.</li>
            <li> At the time of leaving this review I am currently buying two more units of this product as gifts to my family. This is one of the coolest inventions ever, and my morning routine in infinity better and easier for it.</li>
            <li> Saw this on sharhtank and thought it would be perfect for my 7 year old son.  This works great! So much better than dipping the comb in the faucet, pouring water on his head with my hand, and even better than the spray bottle which sends a stream into one single spot.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it and now uses it himself every morning.</li>
            <li> It does work, but I find if you put too much water in the cap it leaks out and water runs down your face/neck; and if you put too little water your hair is still dry in spots.  I want to love it because I often shower at night and just need to wet my hair in the morning, but often I find myself still just washing my face and then throwing the water on my head instead of getting out the morninghead cap and fussing with the amount of water to make it work properly for my hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this cap; I saw it on Shark Tank and ordered it because it seemed like a great product. My hair isn&#x27;t long-- it doesn&#x27;t touch my shoulders, but I had a really difficult time getting most of my hair wet. Maybe it would work better for guys&#x27; short haircuts. I have been thinking about getting my hair cut short, so I guess I&#x27;ll keep it to see if it would work for me. I also might try leaving it on for a while to see if the water would eventually soak into my hair.</li>
            <li> This product couldn&#x27;t be easier. Pour some water in, put it on your head, let it sit, take it off, and voila. Within minutes my hair was wet enough to style. If you can get past looking/feeling stupid, this product is perfect for those of us who go to the gym at night, shower, and then have to get up for work in the morning.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Morninghead. He showers at night so in the morning he uses the Morninghead to fix his hair and he is ready for work.</li>
            <li> I have short hair so I don&#x27;t need a whole cup of water in the cap.  I had to safety pin the edge up a bit since my head is smaller than most people but that took care of any leakage.  This is the perfect solution for a morning rush or for travelling.</li>
            <li> I love it!  :)  I&#x27;m a girl with very short hair, and this invention is a lifesaver.  Before Morninghead, I would either do the wet washcloth thing and deal with water running down everywhere, or use the handheld in the shower and forget to turn it off, causing my husband to yelp loudly when he turns on the shower in the evening and the handheld gets him in the face.  ;)  I definitely differ with the Sharks on this one; in my opinion, the simple concept of putting a highly absorbent material inside a waterproof cap is brilliant!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother because he was constantly using our kitchen sink to fix his bed head and water would get all over the floor and all over him. When he tried Morninghead, he loved it. If you have bed head and want a faster, easier way to get rid of it, buy Morninghead!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair look fresh out of the shower without getting water on the rest of you!&lt;br /&gt;I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This works great for my husband who always showers at night. For years, he would go into work and come home and I would notice a big divot of hair on the side or back of his head. This product eliminates that issue.</li>
            <li> I have decently long hair and use this every morning. I take showers in the evenings so my hair is horrible in the mornings, so I use it. It is not as good as taking a shower but it does its job. I am happy with the product and would look crazy in the morning without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Josh</li>
            <li> Simple and effective. It does exactly what it says it will. What else can you ask for in a product?</li>
            <li> I like this product - it works very well doing what it says it will do - getting your hair wet enough to style. I have one suggestion, possibly at some point they can make the cap in various sizes (small for me). It appears this is made for a large head - so the elastic doesn&#x27;t fit around my head as tightly as it could. In spite of this, it still is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on figuring out the amount of water to put into this where my hair gets damp (not dripping or just barely moistened) while evenly wetting the cap all the way around so I don&#x27;t have patches that stay dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, has been leaving little white fuzzballs in my hair; I pick out one or two per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad product, but not as great as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Great idea, it&#x27;s just a little difficult to hang and dry out.</li>
            <li> Pretty useful but the fabric keeps getting moldy after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and my hair is quite short.  I have multiple reasons for wetting my hair including because (i) I use a lot of product on my hair and I like to get the product out before going to bed, (ii) sometimes I shower at night and, like others, wake with bedhead and (iii) sometimes I just need to wet my hair for a quick re-style before heading out.&lt;br /&gt;Now I could continue to use a facecloth or to put my head under the faucet because both methods word fine.; however, I didn&#x27;t like using multiple face cloths or putting my head under the faucet which usually resulted in water on the bathroom vanity and sometimes the floor.  So I decided to buy the Morninghead Cap.  The product works as described and  I am happy I bought it.  It doesn&#x27;t leak and can be used even after having applied makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few time at work before a shift. It works, and it was cheap enough. Its really just a shower cap that retains water.</li>
            <li> Morninghead helps me get ready for work quickly and allows me to not wear a baseball cap on the days I don&#x27;t take a shower.  Wetting under faucet or in tub wastes water.  Thanks for helping validate my hippie lifestyle...now go recycle something!</li>
            <li> I first saw this item on Shark Tank and I was &amp;#34;Wow, what a great idea.&amp;#34;  I have short hair and sometimes (especially if I shower in the evening) my hair parts where it wants to and I never can get it to look right unless I shower again.  I am always in a rush and short on time.  This product does the trick, it lets me wet my hair and then style it without much fuss. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I needed a quick and easy way to do my hair.  I don&#x27;t like product in my hair, so this product was a great choice.  Many times I wake up in the morning with no time to do anything.  So I use this, takes a second, and looks good.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! I bought it on a late night amazon whim and wasn&#x27;t expecting much but it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve used washcloths for years and always made a mess. This cap confines the excess water and makes for a quick bedhead fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. My vanity (pride, fear, ego, whatever) has not allowed me to wear it around another human being yet.</li>
            <li> Definitely works as advertised. Easy to use. Unique product for those cases where hair is a mess in the morning and plan on taking a shower later in the day.</li>
            <li> Worked just like the video described.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Not only is it a bed head cure, but a bad dream cure as it makes me laugh whenever I use it! So simple and so smart!</li>
            <li> Might work if you have really short hair like an inch or two but anything longer it does not work at all and it also spills water all over</li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected with the Morninghead Cap. I have hair that won&#x27;t do what I want unless it gets showered. I don&#x27;t need a damn shower everyday! So Morninghead Cap was suppose to help right? Mehhhh, the thing quickly started to smell after a 5 days. 5 days would of been me using it only twice, and letting it dry per the include instructions. Maybe my hair is just really stinky?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the stink set it it didn&#x27;t hold as much water. It also didn&#x27;t seem to be as malleable when mashing on my head. Overall, after 2 weeks with approximately 4 or 5 uses the thing was trashed. I know it&#x27;s a replaceable product, but for only 4 or 5 uses it&#x27;s not worth my money.</li>
            <li> I put way more than the recommended amount of water, such that I have to wear a towel around my neck to catch the dripping, and it still doesn&#x27;t get my hair wet, just barely moist, not nearly enough to fix my morning hair. This product is a complete dud.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I wish it had. The first time I tried this, none of my hair got wet. Not kidding. I put the water in the cap, let it absorb, then nothing. Second time I tried this, my face and neck got wet but most of my hair was still dry. I added more water the second time. Hoping that I have the &#x27;longer&#x27; hair the box is talking about. Although, at its longest, my hair is maybe an inch and a half long. As my headline mentions, wetting my comb was a much faster and easier way to re-wet my hair.</li>
            <li> Saw it on the SHARKS. Great product. Love it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my S.O. &amp; he was very pleased with how well it worked.</li>
            <li> It just makes me giggle, thanks guys!</li>
