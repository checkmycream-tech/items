    <ol>
            <li>This works perfectly.</li>
            <li>; The sex was almost perfect for me</li>
            <li>Good luck ladies!</li>
            <li>Great contraceptive.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I heard the Today Sponge worked great (and maybe it does, I&#x27;m paranoid</li>
            <li>I think the sponge is great if used as a back-up method.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but not the greatest, either.</li>
            <li>Good except the yeast infection.  </li>
            <li>THE GOOD</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t like the pill, condoms don&#x27;t feel good and used to use Conceptrol but didn&#x27;t like having to reapply every time before sex...</li>
            <li>I loved the way it worked</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great :)</li>
            <li>That kind of put me off of them.</li>
            <li>This birth control method is not as effective as condoms statistically.  </li>
            <li>You put it in and it&#x27;s good for as many times as you want to do it in a 24-hour period.</li>
            <li>sponge is very easy to insert after putting under water and squiz.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the sponge isn&#x27;t more popular.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how easy these were to use and that you can&#x27;t feel them (despite the fact that they look intimidatingly large).</li>
            <li>They sound like a great idea &amp; seem easy to use.</li>
            <li>Got married in December and didn&#x27;t want to go on the pill because of the hormone problems it causes, I was waiting for my Femcap to arrive in the mail after the honeymoon (great product, you should check it out).  </li>
            <li>Very smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love these.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend a better method.</li>
            <li>Not noticeable this is my favorite method.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>but I was like 76% percent sure it had flipped over when I put it in</li>
            <li>But most child-free 17 - 25 years olds will not be thinking of the consequences -</li>
            <li>It is appealing because it allows for spontaneity, but beware-</li>
            <li>Maybe they have been better designed since 1985.</li>
            <li>I plan to use it again; in fact I bought more.</li>
            <li>when we were doing it more than once in a day :)</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>What I love about the sponge is you can put it in an hour before</li>
            <li>I do love the product &amp; will continue to use it, of corse looking for discounts along the way.</li>
            <li>I just feel better protected and not worried about getting PG and just gives me peace of mind to actually enjoy sex</li>
            <li>and the most important is you don&#x27;t feel it inside (for both of partners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I do have two kids already and get pregnant very easily).</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions and it is easy to insert and remove.</li>
            <li>It was surprisingly easy to insert and provides 24 hrs of protection.</li>
            <li>They are easy to put in and easy to take out.</li>
            <li>and I got pregnant using the sponge when I was 23!</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of being able to have a 24 hour time period between using a new one.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>These babies are cheap.. way cheaper than condoms</li>
            <li>I make sure we are both ready to have a lot of sex. :-)</li>
            <li>: It was very easy to put in and neither of us noticed much difference during intercourse.  </li>
            <li>I thought, &amp;#34;Okay, cool, whatever-</li>
            <li>It was kinda cool though --</li>
            <li>If you absolutely cannot have more kids and believe abortion is tantamount to murder(you</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any burning or itching like other women have reported.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant.  </li>
            <li>The first time, it took me like 40 minutes to realize whether or not I was grabbing the sponge or part of my insides!</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t feel it at all and the fun part was that we could take a break and then go at it again without having to find another condom or think about pulling out.</li>
            <li>I liked that you could put them in ahead of time without a short window like contraceptive film.</li>
            <li>I have to laugh...</li>
            <li>(It DOES NOT protect against STD&#x27;s, so to be honest, for use outside a committed, monogamous relationship</li>
            <li>You should be able to reach the removal loop with no trouble.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use, but the price was quite high in my opinion as well as the shipping &amp; handling I got charged when the package came wrapped in brown paper bag material &amp; said it cost $2.</li>
            <li>I sit on the toilet to do it, like I&#x27;m removing a tampon... just be sure not to drop it in, or if you do DON&#x27;T flush it!</li>
            <li>and they are (in my humble opinion) much better than condoms!!</li>
            <li>I was a little worried because I&#x27;d never used these before, only taken the pill, but it worked great!</li>
            <li>but this is a great option for my least fertile</li>
            <li>Finally I was able to get it out.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t get scared off if the first time takes you awhile.</li>
            <li>You will know what to feel for after that first time.</li>
            <li>Properly inserted, (and you want to make sure of this</li>
            <li>According to the paperwork that comes with the sponge, some women report that when they use it regularly that they are more susceptible to yeast</li>
            <li>We have been using the today sponge for the last four months and love it.</li>
            <li>No weird taste or smell.. can&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li>The first one split while i was lathering it up</li>
            <li>These work pretty well, easy to insert just carefully push in and fit it up around the cervix.</li>
            <li>I noticed a lot of other reviews point out that this product is not as effective as condoms or birth-control pills, which was a moot point for me.</li>
            <li>This is really the only way that you can almost avoid accidental pregnancy :)</li>
            <li>We read the instructions (huge turn on by the way) and watched a few YouTube videos to get comfortable with the steps to insert it and what to expect afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather the guy use a condom, but just try to get a guy to do that...</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to remove, even after I accidentally put the first one I used in upside down.</li>
            <li>They are effective enough, but not worth the side effects.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to forget about, which is good and bad.</li>
            <li>I...might...try it one more time to give it another chance and see if I can put it in correctly, but I&#x27;ve gotta say it&#x27;s a really lame feeling when you feel helpless with a product that claims to be easy and</li>
            <li>I...might...try it one more time to give it another chance and see if I can put it in correctly, but I&#x27;ve gotta say it&#x27;s a really lame feeling when you feel helpless with a product that claims to be easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>; Eventually, I went home to watch a new live stream of the RT Podcast when the time came for me to take it out.</li>
            <li>It went in fine, but after Intercourse it ended up flipping upside down so that the string was no longer there to pull it out.</li>
            <li>Its better than condoms male and female for many reasons including comfort but all barrier methods have a high failure rate(anything above .1%).</li>
            <li>/&gt;You know alot of people will think I&#x27;m crazy, especially since I involved my 10 year old but honestly at about $3.50 a piece I can&#x27;t afford to &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; with too many of these sponges for show and tell.</li>
            <li>I loved these at first, but after realizing that they make everyone numb, I will not be using these anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve adopted a whole new standard.</li>
            <li>We love that it can stay in for up to 30 hours for numerous &amp;#34;encounters&amp;#34; without having to mess with changing anything.</li>
            <li>You can push condoms till your blue in the face, but after people are in a healthy monogamous relationship they dont want to mess with condoms.</li>
            <li>It probably was less a problem for him, though, since I did clean up.</li>
            <li>I had no problems getting it in and out so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my 20 yr old made me a grandma this year</li>
            <li>No little ones growing inside me yet</li>
            <li>And yes most grown folks know that if you mess around cause you &amp;#34;dont feel like using a condom&amp;#34; that there will be LIFE LONG consequences.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, not a new customer to this product.</li>
            <li>How funny, and hey, my boyfriend and I are curious, why not, let&#x27;s buy some on Amazon!</li>
            <li>They are so simple to use that my 10 yr old understood how do use it.</li>
            <li>Make sure the round indentation goes in up against your cervix, and the removal loop is facing down.</li>
            <li>It took me more than 30 minutes of efforts to take it out with some internal small damages (nails scratches because the sponge is very slippery and not easy to catch without the string).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband and I used it on our honeymoon because we didn&#x27;t want to mess with condoms for our first time.</li>
            <li>these bad boys are great, especially when you have your lady monthly time.</li>
            <li>The spermicide is quite strong, bitter and gives a strange impression of slight anaesthetic feeling in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The spermicide is quite strong, bitter and gives a strange impression of slight anaesthetic feeling in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, the first time taking it out can be confusing.</li>
            <li> It caused me no major inconvenience while it was in--I even showered with one in.  </li>
            <li> Considering the emergency bill and the cost of the actual sponge, this was the most expensive birth control I&#x27;ve ever paid for!</li>
            <li> I will buy contraceptives for ANYONE regardless of age as long as they let me know they need them.</li>
            <li> That helps me too know when I need to be extra careful so as to not cause a pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I had big troubles because during intercourse it has probably turned upside down</li>
            <li> Also I guess I got it too wet before insertion &amp; then had it leaking out during intercourse.</li>
            <li> and she told me that&#x27;s how I was conceived so be careful.</li>
            <li> have read where several women had trouble with removal.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with the other two.</li>
            <li> well...I don&#x27;t know what to say, but I&#x27;ve got a baby due in October.  </li>
            <li> and I am looking for a other non chemical methods.</li>
            <li> and I felt swollen down there.</li>
            <li> While doing this, push down like you&#x27;re trying to push out a baby (or a bowel movement.)</li>
            <li> Pushing down like that, I&#x27;ve even had one pop out before I could get my fingers on</li>
            <li> You need something with a very low failure rate.</li>
            <li> but I could feel a slight discomfort when my boyfriend was all the way in.</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable enough that I threw the third one away.</li>
            <li> It was a mess</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have an infection, but it did feel like it for just a little while.</li>
            <li> Little misleading.</li>
            <li> I had no problems getting it back out (which seems to be another common complaint).  </li>
            <li> It was a bit messy going in</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not EXTREMELY comfortable or anything when it comes to digging around downstairs.</li>
            <li> I usually got an infection after using this</li>
            <li> The only critique is that it can be difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Plus I only use it during my fertile times, and because it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Using this contraceptive was the dumbest, most horrible idea I&#x27;ve ever come up with!</li>
            <li> I usually have to go in with a couple of fingers (or my index finger and thumb) on my dominant hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The biggest con: He did mention that during oral he could taste it a bit, and that it left his tongue feeling a little numb.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they can be a little difficult to get out, however if you beat down it helps.</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable to insert and it made love making very painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure if I am going to use it again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moreover, the failure rate with this contraceptive method is 15%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a failure rate of about 10 %.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Except the fact that you have to leave it in place for at least 6 hours after intercourse, it is very hard to remove!  </li>
            <li> It only took him about 5 minutes of digging but it made me feel so worthless that I couldn&#x27;t do it myself</li>
            <li> It was discouraging and frustrating.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m already not happy that I have to dig around for the stupid thing, and because it did what I had expected, The string wasn&#x27;t on the side I could reach to pull the darn thing out.</li>
            <li> : It was inconvenient to have to leave it in for at least 6 hours after sex.  </li>
            <li> I had darker than usual discharge with an unpleasant smell after I took it out that lasted for about a day.  </li>
            <li> My partner was a little alarmed :(</li>
            <li> I felt panicked, frustrated, upset and totally defeated. :(</li>
            <li> It drains a bit which is uncomfortable, but with it just being in for 24 hours</li>
            <li> Now, maybe I&#x27;m weird</li>
            <li> I put it in wrong somehow).  </li>
            <li> Gross and terrible and painfully itchy/burning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to break something or hurt myself.</li>
            <li> The man&#x27;s penis will become numb, as well as the woman&#x27;s mouth if she gives him oral sex after he has been inside of her.</li>
            <li> Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> I dont care if their parents or spouses get mad.</li>
            <li> Condoms fail and break ALL the time!</li>
            <li> YES, I SERIOUSLY DID SHOW AND TELL WITH CONTRACEPTIVES!!!</li>
            <li> I felt so bad</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t help that when I was waiting for him to come over I had read the bad review about the girl who had to go to the emergency room.</li>
            <li> THE BAD</li>
            <li> These sponges contains nonoxynol 9, which makes everything NUMB!</li>
            <li> (the pill made me absolutely crazy!)</li>

            <li> They sound like a great idea &amp; seem easy to use. However I had several tear while trying to insert. Also I guess I got it too wet before insertion &amp; then had it leaking out during intercourse. My partner was a little alarmed :(</li>
            <li> I usually got an infection after using this</li>
            <li> Ow watch these hurt!!!</li>
            <li> It went in fine, but after Intercourse it ended up flipping upside down so that the string was no longer there to pull it out. After an hour of struggling, we finally got it out in pieces. It was a mess and I wouldn&#x27;t recommended.</li>
            <li> Easy. convenient, (and a bit pricy) these bad boys are great, especially when you have your lady monthly time. Huzzah!</li>
            <li> Great contraceptive.  I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love these.  Sometimes they can be a little difficult to get out, however if you beat down it helps.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to the product.</li>
            <li> Nope. Never again. I gave it a shot to see what the buzz was all about, but, nope. Gross and terrible and painfully itchy/burning. Nope, nope, nope.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well, easy to insert just carefully push in and fit it up around the cervix. We love that it can stay in for up to 30 hours for numerous &amp;#34;encounters&amp;#34; without having to mess with changing anything. And of course my husband likes not having to wear a condom. I do not do well on hormones so I track my cycle and we use condoms during my fertile times but this is a great option for my least fertile times.&lt;br /&gt;My husband says sometimes he can feel it but it&#x27;s not bad, I think he&#x27;s feeling the string. I can also sometimes feel it and that&#x27;s the only thing I didn&#x27;t like. I had no problems getting it in and out so far. Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend a better method. Follow the instructions and it is easy to insert and remove. Not noticeable this is my favorite method.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly. The only critique is that it can be difficult to remove. So sometimes I have to wait awhile before I can get it out.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because I&#x27;d never used these before, only taken the pill, but it worked great! No little ones growing inside me yet (I do have two kids already and get pregnant very easily). It drains a bit which is uncomfortable, but with it just being in for 24 hours and I don&#x27;t have to take the pill anymore, I&#x27;m ok with it. Plus I only use it during my fertile times, and because it&#x27;s so expensive I make sure we are both ready to have a lot of sex. :-)</li>
            <li> I only found out about the sponge through the &amp;#34;sponge-worthy&amp;#34; episode of Seinfeld. How funny, and hey, my boyfriend and I are curious, why not, let&#x27;s buy some on Amazon! We read the instructions (huge turn on by the way) and watched a few YouTube videos to get comfortable with the steps to insert it and what to expect afterwards. It was a bit messy going in and I wasn&#x27;t sure but I was like 76% percent sure it had flipped over when I put it in but I had no luck moving it or flipping it around so I said, &amp;#34;Hose it.&amp;#34; The sex was almost perfect for me but I could feel a slight discomfort when my boyfriend was all the way in. He didn&#x27;t feel it at all and the fun part was that we could take a break and then go at it again without having to find another condom or think about pulling out. So after we were done, you&#x27;re instructed to leave it in for six hours before then removing it. I thought, &amp;#34;Okay, cool, whatever- it&#x27;s my day off we&#x27;ll go out.&amp;#34; Eventually, I went home to watch a new live stream of the RT Podcast when the time came for me to take it out. Now, maybe I&#x27;m weird but I&#x27;m not EXTREMELY comfortable or anything when it comes to digging around downstairs. I don&#x27;t know why, I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to break something or hurt myself. So I&#x27;m already not happy that I have to dig around for the stupid thing, and because it did what I had expected, The string wasn&#x27;t on the side I could reach to pull the darn thing out. I felt panicked, frustrated, upset and totally defeated. :( I felt so bad, I had to call my boyfriend in the middle of his RPG and ask him to drive over to help me take it out. It only took him about 5 minutes of digging but it made me feel so worthless that I couldn&#x27;t do it myself and it didn&#x27;t help that when I was waiting for him to come over I had read the bad review about the girl who had to go to the emergency room. :/ Anyways, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with the other two. Oh, and because I had it flipped around, we didn&#x27;t want to risk it, so we ended up buying Plan B anyways which was annoying and another expense. Yeah...only do this method if you have someone who can help you pull it out if you end up in my predicament. I...might...try it one more time to give it another chance and see if I can put it in correctly, but I&#x27;ve gotta say it&#x27;s a really lame feeling when you feel helpless with a product that claims to be easy and convenient.dn&#x27;t want to risk it, so we ended up buying Plan B anyways which was annoying and another expense.

            <li> I was impressed with how easy these were to use and that you can&#x27;t feel them (despite the fact that they look intimidatingly large). I liked that you could put them in ahead of time without a short window like contraceptive film. Got an infection, though. That kind of put me off of them.</li>
            <li> You can push condoms till your blue in the face, but after people are in a healthy monogamous relationship they dont want to mess with condoms. And yes most grown folks know that if you mess around cause you &amp;#34;dont feel like using a condom&amp;#34; that there will be LIFE LONG consequences. But most child-free 17 - 25 years olds will not be thinking of the consequences - that&#x27;s where non hormonal contraceptive like the Today sponge come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these and when they got here I had all my kids (age 20-10) and the oldest one&#x27;s girlfriend and we all went into the kitchen sink. After I read the directions I opened the package and proceeded to get the product &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; for use. Then I made all of them touch it and then answered any questions they had. YES, I SERIOUSLY DID SHOW AND TELL WITH CONTRACEPTIVES!!! lol They are so simple to use that my 10 yr old understood how do use it. Open the box and grab out a package, tear open the package, hold the sponge under running water &amp; squeeze a couple times till it gets sudsy, fold &amp; insert. Now you can have protected sex for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know alot of people will think I&#x27;m crazy, especially since I involved my 10 year old but honestly at about $3.50 a piece I can&#x27;t afford to &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; with too many of these sponges for show and tell. It was kinda cool though -- I had never seen a sponge before. (neither had my husband - he was in the next room holding our grandson so he looked at it afterwards)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my 20 yr old made me a grandma this year and I&#x27;m only 34 I&#x27;ve adopted a whole new standard. I will buy contraceptives for ANYONE regardless of age as long as they let me know they need them. I dont care if their parents or spouses get mad. This is a difference of life &amp; death - babies are a gift for the parents who want them and can take care of them.</li>
            <li> I have to laugh...because...yeah.  I&#x27;m pregnant.  Got married in December and didn&#x27;t want to go on the pill because of the hormone problems it causes, I was waiting for my Femcap to arrive in the mail after the honeymoon (great product, you should check it out).  I heard the Today Sponge worked great (and maybe it does, I&#x27;m paranoid I put it in wrong somehow).  I bought two boxes of these, just to use temporarily...and well...I don&#x27;t know what to say, but I&#x27;ve got a baby due in October.  I guess take your chances with this one.</li>
            <li> Increases chances of urinary tract infection.</li>
            <li> Good except the yeast infection.  Grrrrrrr.  Read online it is in fact a side effect that can be caused by the spermicide.</li>
            <li> This is not a multipack. It&#x27;s a box of 3 sponges, the same box that is sold at WalMart for $10.</li>
            <li> These sponges contains nonoxynol 9, which makes everything NUMB! The man&#x27;s penis will become numb, as well as the woman&#x27;s mouth if she gives him oral sex after he has been inside of her. I loved these at first, but after realizing that they make everyone numb, I will not be using these anymore. They also have a soapy consistency. They are effective enough, but not worth the side effects.</li>
            <li> This birth control method is not as effective as condoms statistically.  It is appealing because it allows for spontaneity, but beware- it can be difficult to remove!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. In Sweden this item isn&#x27;t for sale at all since 1996 or so. I&#x27;m so tankfull for amazon.com so I can get hold of these again</li>
            <li> Using this contraceptive was the dumbest, most horrible idea I&#x27;ve ever come up with! My husband and I used it on our honeymoon because we didn&#x27;t want to mess with condoms for our first time. I liked the idea of being able to have a 24 hour time period between using a new one. This thing was horrible! It was uncomfortable to insert and it made love making very painful and when it came time for removal we couldn&#x27;t get it out! We tried several times to remove it but with no luck. It was discouraging and frustrating. After about two days of trying to remove it we finally had to go to the emergency room. I was starting to cramp up and I felt swollen down there. I was so relieved when it was finally removed!!!! I WILL NOT recommend this product to ANYBODY!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Considering the emergency bill and the cost of the actual sponge, this was the most expensive birth control I&#x27;ve ever paid for!</li>
            <li> I think the sponge is great if used as a back-up method. I use it and my partner uses a condom as well. I just feel better protected and not worried about getting PG and just gives me peace of mind to actually enjoy sex more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the first time taking it out can be confusing. The first time, it took me like 40 minutes to realize whether or not I was grabbing the sponge or part of my insides! Finally I was able to get it out. Second time, it took me 10 minutes. Third time, it took me about 5 minutes. So don&#x27;t get scared off if the first time takes you awhile. You will know what to feel for after that first time. Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed w/these though is some cracking/breaking of the material even before I insert it. I plan to write a letter to them and let them know that it started to tear in the middle of it even before I used it. Good luck ladies! Oh and also download one of those menstrual cycle apps to help you keep track of when you are ovulating or not ovulating. That helps me too know when I need to be extra careful so as to not cause a pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because I stopped hormonal contraception and I am looking for a other non chemical methods. There is no product of that type in Switzerland where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is very easy to insert after putting under water and squiz. Very smooth. The convenient thing is you don&#x27;t have to wait to use it  and the most important is you don&#x27;t feel it inside (for both of partners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except the fact that you have to leave it in place for at least 6 hours after intercourse, it is very hard to remove!  I had big troubles because during intercourse it has probably turned upside down and I couldn&#x27;t access the string. It took me more than 30 minutes of efforts to take it out with some internal small damages (nails scratches because the sponge is very slippery and not easy to catch without the string).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another drawback is the taste. The spermicide is quite strong, bitter and gives a strange impression of slight anaesthetic feeling in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the failure rate with this contraceptive method is 15%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I am going to use it again!</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of other reviews point out that this product is not as effective as condoms or birth-control pills, which was a moot point for me. I actually chose this product as a back-up method in case the condoms we use leak or break.  THE GOOD: It was very easy to put in and neither of us noticed much difference during intercourse.  I had no problems getting it back out (which seems to be another common complaint).  It caused me no major inconvenience while it was in--I even showered with one in.  THE BAD: It was inconvenient to have to leave it in for at least 6 hours after sex.  I ended up keeping it in for close to 20 hours.  I had darker than usual discharge with an unpleasant smell after I took it out that lasted for about a day.  I wish I had known to expect that, so I could have put in a panty liner instead of having to change underwear.  EDIT:  After using the second one,  I had a problem with a burning sensation. (My partner was using a condom, so he had no problems). It was uncomfortable enough that I threw the third one away.</li>
            <li> I asked my mom about the sponge and she told me that&#x27;s how I was conceived so be careful. Maybe they have been better designed since 1985.</li>
            <li> You can feel the sponge in place and it causes a yeast infection every time I use it (and anytime I use any spermicidal product).&lt;br /&gt;It has a failure rate of about 10 %. Its better than condoms male and female for many reasons including comfort but all barrier methods have a high failure rate(anything above .1%). If you absolutely cannot have more kids and believe abortion is tantamount to murder(you would if you&#x27;ve ever observed an abortion) then this is not for you. You need something with a very low failure rate. Condoms fail and break ALL the time! and I got pregnant using the sponge when I was 23!</li>
            <li> Like all forms of birth control, the Today Sponge has its pros and cons. (It DOES NOT protect against STD&#x27;s, so to be honest, for use outside a committed, monogamous relationship I&#x27;d much rather the guy use a condom, but just try to get a guy to do that... YEAH, RIGHT!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the pros of the Today Sponge are that it is indeed non-hormonal (the pill made me absolutely crazy!) and that it does allow for spontaneity. The Today Sponge can be put in place well in advance, and IT DOES STAY IN PLACE, so it doesn&#x27;t have to interrupt the moment. You put it in and it&#x27;s good for as many times as you want to do it in a 24-hour period. Properly inserted, (and you want to make sure of this so it DOES indeed work!) neither partner can feel it. My guy and I talked about it afterwards...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con: He did mention that during oral he could taste it a bit, and that it left his tongue feeling a little numb. Same for me when I did oral after he&#x27;d been inside. It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but not the greatest, either. I&#x27;d expect me to have that problem, but I thought that maybe he wouldn&#x27;t since I got a shower after inserting it. (You can do that! It probably was less a problem for him, though, since I did clean up. DON&#x27;T douche, or you&#x27;ll wash away all the spermicide!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to leave it in place for six hours after the last time you have intercourse in that 24-hour period, but you do have to take it out no later than 30 hours after insertion. It&#x27;s easy to forget about, which is good and bad. One time I forgot it and left it in 36 hours. I didn&#x27;t have any problems, but you can get toxic shock syndrome if you do leave it in too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to remove, even after I accidentally put the first one I used in upside down. Make sure the round indentation goes in up against your cervix, and the removal loop is facing down. (Still worked -- no pregnancy, though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.) One time after taking it out, though, I did have a feeling like I had a yeast infection for just a couple hours afterward. I didn&#x27;t have an infection, but it did feel like it for just a little while. According to the paperwork that comes with the sponge, some women report that when they use it regularly that they are more susceptible to yeast infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read where several women had trouble with removal. My advice to them is this:  I sit on the toilet to do it, like I&#x27;m removing a tampon... just be sure not to drop it in, or if you do DON&#x27;T flush it! I usually have to go in with a couple of fingers (or my index finger and thumb) on my dominant hand. While doing this, push down like you&#x27;re trying to push out a baby (or a bowel movement.) You should be able to reach the removal loop with no trouble. Pushing down like that, I&#x27;ve even had one pop out before I could get my fingers on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with it. I plan to use it again; in fact I bought more.</li>
            <li> We have been using the today sponge for the last four months and love it. It was surprisingly easy to insert and provides 24 hrs of protection. We don&#x27;t like the pill, condoms don&#x27;t feel good and used to use Conceptrol but didn&#x27;t like having to reapply every time before sex...when we were doing it more than once in a day :)</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I don&#x27;t know why the sponge isn&#x27;t more popular. These babies are cheap.. way cheaper than condoms and they are (in my humble opinion) much better than condoms!! You can defend condoms until you are blue in the face.. but the truth is, condoms kill the mood. Plain and simple. What I love about the sponge is you can put it in an hour before so there is no &amp;#34;Oh, wait. Where&#x27;s a condom?!?&amp;#34;, moment that ends in you ransacking the house. They are easy to put in and easy to take out. I haven&#x27;t experienced any burning or itching like other women have reported. My partner gives it two thumbs up as well. No weird taste or smell.. can&#x27;t feel it. I haven&#x27;t had any yeast infections or anything of the sort and I have gone through two packs. HOWEVER, I feel like I need to mention that this should not be your only form of birth control. You should ALWAYS use TWO kinds of contraception.. Even if you are on the pill, you should be using a second form of protection. This is really the only way that you can almost avoid accidental pregnancy :)</li>
            <li> I loved the way it worked and it&#x27;s easy to use, but the price was quite high in my opinion as well as the shipping &amp; handling I got charged when the package came wrapped in brown paper bag material &amp; said it cost $2. and change to ship it! The first one split while i was lathering it up and I can&#x27;t afford to waist one at $17.99 plus tax and s&amp;h costing $8.00. I do love the product &amp; will continue to use it, of corse looking for discounts along the way.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, not a new customer to this product. It&#x27;s great :)</li>
            <li> Little misleading. This is 1 box with 3 sponges, not 3 boxes each containing 3 sponges.</li>
