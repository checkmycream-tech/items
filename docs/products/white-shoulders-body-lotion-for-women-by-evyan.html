            <li>The lotion itself is great and my wife uses it sparingly.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my mother, I bought a gift pack for Christmas and she had ran out of lotion so this is a great gift.</li>
            <li>I love the lotion and the wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>I received the shipment in a timely manner and my aunt loved her gift.</li>
            <li>Have always loved this perfume, including the body lotion.  </li>
            <li>Received in good time in good condition.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it because the parfum is my favorite.</li>
            <li>love the feel!</li>
            <li>To make a good deal even better I found that with the purchase of two tubes I got free shipping!!  </li>
            <li>and so now I think of her, and her amazing heart, everytime I dab on some of this.</li>
            <li>I am loving it.</li>

            <li>So glad to see a place to purchase .  </li>

            <li>I am satisfied with this purpose.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product since I was 16 and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this site.</li>

            <li>I will not purchase this again--but maybe some might enjoy this product because it does work well to replenish over-dry skin.</li>
            <li>I gave it &amp;#34;three stars&amp;#34;  because the lotion is smooth and creamy rich and does work very well on over-dried hands.  </li>

            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>It was readily available at most named department stores until this past year.</li>
            <li>My wife loves White Shoulders and was thrilled with her assortment of White Shoulders as gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li>My aunt loved the other White Shoulders products so much I decided to get her some lotion.</li>
            <li>While the Eau de Parfum and Eau de Cologne are crap, this lotion is pleasant smelling, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>a little too heady and sweet.</li>
            <li>Having used Amazon for other purchases I decided to check with Amazon for the lotion and found it first try.  </li>

            <li> Not only was it in stock but the price was just about half of what we had been paying locally.  </li>
            <li> Not having to pay the S &amp; H charges made the second tube like half price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder and harder to find even online.</li>
            <li> We have been unable to locate the product at other than Ulta Cosmetics, and they are generally out of stock.  </li>

            <li> I started giving White Shoulders body lotion a &amp;#34;two-star&amp;#34; rating, because the scent of White Shoulders was not captured in this lotion.  I gave it &amp;#34;three stars&amp;#34;  because the lotion is smooth and creamy rich and does work very well on over-dried hands.  I will not purchase this again--but maybe some might enjoy this product because it does work well to replenish over-dry skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!  will be back for more.  Thank You :)</li>
            <li> I like matching body powder, body lotion, and cologne.  This fills the bill.  Scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for thias product (bath powder by Evian) for several years.  So glad to see a place to purchase .  The price was excellent also.</li>
            <li> I purchased as a gift. My aunt loved the other White Shoulders products so much I decided to get her some lotion. I ran every where trying to find it to no avil. I had no problem finding the products on Amazon. I received the shipment in a timely manner and my aunt loved her gift. Amazon makes shopping a lot easier.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that this cream existed.  I was so happy to find it because the parfum is my favorite. My grandmother wore it all the time and so now I think of her, and her amazing heart, everytime I dab on some of this.</li>
            <li> Love the scent...love the feel!</li>
            <li> My wife loves White Shoulders and was thrilled with her assortment of White Shoulders as gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has been a favorite of mine for years. I have NEVER seen it in lotion form before. I am loving it.</li>
            <li> Gift for my Mom. She loves it!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purpose.</li>
            <li> It has become quite edifficult to find the lotion for White Shoulders.  I love the lotion and the wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> I love it.  This was the only place my husband could find just the lotion.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Lovely light scent for summer. Very pleased with my quick service.</li>
            <li> Best body lotion ever. Been buying this for years, Always get many compliments on the fragrance and makes my skin so soft. A good price and super fast delivery time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was 16 and love it. It&#x27;s harder and harder to find even online. I&#x27;m glad I found this site.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like it used to 50 years ago....a little too heady and sweet.</li>
            <li> have worn this fragrance along with the body cream for years.  Always complimented by co-workers stating that it smells like I just took a bath!!</li>
            <li> This is not made by Evyan. Evyan never made a cream body lotion. The fragrance was designed by Evyan and purchased by EA Fragrances (Elizabeth Arden) and re-released in a cheaper formulation. While the Eau de Parfum and Eau de Cologne are crap, this lotion is pleasant smelling, absorbs nicely. I will purchase this again.</li>
