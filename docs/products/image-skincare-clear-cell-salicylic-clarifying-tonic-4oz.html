            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>the seller packaged it nicely and the product works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Nice product, yes I recommend you try using this product for yourself.</li>
            <li>The Clear line by Image is great!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30s and tend to have more oily skin, for anyone trying to determine if this product might work for them.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of this product as I continue to make the switch to this brand.</li>
            <li>Also, my bottle was sealed with plastic but had an additional top that was not pictured.</li>
            <li>I love this product line...</li>
            <li>I bought it for my daughter too, and she love it.</li>
            <li>It can cause skin flaking if used too much without a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I like the product and was delivered in good timing but the bottle was open so most of the product was spilled inside the box.  </li>
            <li>This helped clean up my skin significantly.</li>
            <li>It does dry out your skin so have some great moisturizer to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I tend to have dry skin, this is great for the summer when my skin gets oily .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Image Skincare line.  </li>
            <li>The product had leaked during shipping so it arrived with the bottle about 3/4 full and</li>
            <li>Just what I needed and at such a good price.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates super well even though it has no grit.  </li>
            <li>Wish it would do away with the scent and camphor so it would be more friendly for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have really oily skin and need  to dry it up this is a great product for that purpose...</li>
            <li>Overall nice product.  </li>
            <li>This toner will keep your skin free of blackheads, but be certain to use it sparingly as it can be very drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid fan of the Image cosmetic line.  </li>
            <li>sure to use a white wash cloth, towel, pillowcase, and anything else.</li>
            <li>otherwise, for regular or dry skin it may not be a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I do make sure and moisturize right after using the tonic or else it will dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>I have tried their Clear Cell line and to be honest, I like the products when used individually but used together</li>
            <li>I have been using the toner for a few months now and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how strong the smell is, because I have used imagine clear cell before and never had such a strong odor.</li>
            <li>Works really well at warding off breakouts and minimizing oil.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say how this product works on my skin</li>
            <li>the whole box smelled.</li>
            <li>Image Skincare has really helped with my rosacea.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different skin care items and this brand is the only stuff that works!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Important to note: this does dry your skin out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the tonic a few days now, but so far it&#x27;s kept my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li>When I first received this product in the mail, I was very suspicious of its outside packaging.</li>
            <li>, they are a little to strong.  </li>
            <li>I think this is better suited to extreme acne prone skin types that are not sensitive.</li>
            <li>I use this clarifying tonic every morning after the Image Skincare Clear Cell Salicylic Gel Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My waxer suggested this product to help clear up my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I am 33 years old and have been breaking out for about 3 years.  </li>
            <li>It complete prevents ingrown</li>
            <li>The benzoyl peroxide will completely remove color out of your clothing, towels, and sheets.</li>
            <li>I like Image products, but I will be very suspect of future Amazon retailers of this product, from this day forward.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by my skin specialist to clearup small breakouts and it does the job of drying out the breakout pretty fast and often times you can put it on when it first appears and it clears it up by the next day...</li>
            <li>The only thing that works to clear my skin.  </li>
            <li>At first it did irritate my skin by drying out and giving a slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li>The first week I used it I started seeing results, I have less pimples.</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every product, been to multiple dermatologists and happened to stumble upon Image Clear Cell while watching someone else&#x27;s youtube video about their struggle with acne.</li>
            <li>I would recommend use starting once a day or every other day for normal to oily skin.</li>

            <li> I use this toner daily but the other products I only use when I am experiencing massive breakouts.  </li>

            <li> Combined with the other lines, this product does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had issues with burning like the other reviewer had, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  </li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t use a toner for my face because it just seems like an extra, unnecessary step to my daily skin routine, but I use this toner after getting a wax or shaving.</li>
            <li> It stings a little after shaving (underarms), but works miracles if used after a waxing (no sting), especially on the bikini area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also smells good, unlike other toners that smell like a horrible chemical.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it really helps my skin, which, sadly, is sometimes acne-prone.  </li>
            <li> Is a little drying as other reviews have said, so I went down to using it once.</li>
            <li> Holds the little zips at bay.</li>
            <li> If you are a Black woman with hyper-pigmentation this product will work for you!</li>
            <li> I only had about half of the bottle left.  :(</li>
            <li> and my skin is very tight.</li>
            <li> Although it was shrink-wrapped with plastic, the fading on the silver part of the label on the outside made me suspect it was a fake Image skincare product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne since my teenage years and hate still breaking out like one!</li>
            <li> I am always amazed at how dirty the cotton ball is in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My fears were realized when I opened the product and under the safety seal, I found a disgusting rust-colored film under the &amp;#34;safety seal.&amp;#34; The entire toner appeared to be contaminated (it smelled awful).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin says Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like the product and was delivered in good timing but the bottle was open so most of the product was spilled inside the box.  I only had about half of the bottle left.  :(</li>
            <li> Very good face product.</li>
            <li> I accidently ordered this instead of the daily wash.  Big mistake.  This toner burns my skin a great deal and I cannot use it.  Will be ordering the wash instead.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works wonders for my acne.  I&#x27;m a repeat buyet.</li>
            <li> I use this clarifying tonic every morning after the Image Skincare Clear Cell Salicylic Gel Cleanser.  I started using it after it was recommended to me by an esthetician to remove any residual bacteria following use of the cleanser.  It is great and I feel like it really helps my skin, which, sadly, is sometimes acne-prone.  I do make sure and moisturize right after using the tonic or else it will dry my skin out.  I haven&#x27;t had issues with burning like the other reviewer had, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  I&#x27;m in my 30s and tend to have more oily skin, for anyone trying to determine if this product might work for them.</li>

I&#x27;ve only been using the tonic a few days now, but so far it&#x27;s kept my skin feeling good. As I continue my use, I&#x27;ll update this review!</li>
            <li> I only use this tonic on my blemishes. It dries them out and stops any discomfort/itchiness. Works really well at warding off breakouts and minimizing oil.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my skin specialist to clearup small breakouts and it does the job of drying out the breakout pretty fast and often times you can put it on when it first appears and it clears it up by the next day...I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product after cleansing, for residual cleansing and exfoliation properties. I would recommend use starting once a day or every other day for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! Is a little drying as other reviews have said, so I went down to using it once. Will be buying more of this product as I continue to make the switch to this brand.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Image Skincare line.  From the Ageless line I use the cleanser and the repair cream, from the C line I get the Vitamin C serum (I prefer the cream over the gel based one).  I have tried their Clear Cell line and to be honest, I like the products when used individually but used together, they are a little to strong.  I use this toner daily but the other products I only use when I am experiencing massive breakouts.  I use it at night until there is no trace of dirt and then again in the morning.  I am always amazed at how dirty the cotton ball is in the morning.  Combined with the other lines, this product does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff! The only thing that works to clear my skin.  I am 33 years old and have been breaking out for about 3 years.  I have tried many different skin care items and this brand is the only stuff that works!  I also use their cleanser! Thank you!</li>

It complete prevents ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells good, unlike other toners that smell like a horrible chemical.</li>
            <li> My waxer suggested this product to help clear up my ingrown hairs. After a year of struggling with various product combos that worked for my corse hair and skin type, I finally discovered something that works. I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say how this product works on my skin but I can tell you it smells like mouthwash. I was very surprised at how strong the smell is, because I have used imagine clear cell before and never had such a strong odor. Also, my bottle was sealed with plastic but had an additional top that was not pictured. The product had leaked during shipping so it arrived with the bottle about 3/4 full and the whole box smelled. This makes me wonder if I made a mistake by ordering this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid fan of the Image cosmetic line.  This toner will keep your skin free of blackheads, but be certain to use it sparingly as it can be very drying.</li>
            <li> Image Skincare has really helped with my rosacea. This toner helps when I have flare-ups.</li>
            <li> I love this product line... the seller packaged it nicely and the product works as advertised. Important to note: this does dry your skin out! I can only use it sparingly otherwise I feel like I have a clay mask on and my skin is very tight. If you have really oily skin and need  to dry it up this is a great product for that purpose...otherwise, for regular or dry skin it may not be a great purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great</li>
            <li> Overall nice product.  It works well at clearing acne caused by blocked pores.  Wish it would do away with the scent and camphor so it would be more friendly for sensitive skin.  It exfoliates super well even though it has no grit.  It can cause skin flaking if used too much without a good moisturizer.  I think this is better suited to extreme acne prone skin types that are not sensitive.</li>
            <li> The Clear line by Image is great! Just what I needed and at such a good price. This helped clean up my skin significantly.

The benzoyl peroxide will completely remove color out of your clothing, towels, and sheets.</li>
            <li> I love this product! At first it did irritate my skin by drying out and giving a slight burning sensation. My esthetician did say that this was going to happen and just use it once a day until my skin gets used to it. After my skin did, I started using it twice daily. My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long time. I&#x27;m so happy that my estheician recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily regiment&lt;br /&gt;1) cleanser&lt;br /&gt;2) tonic&lt;br /&gt;3) lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weekly&lt;br /&gt;1) masque</li>
            <li> Nice product, yes I recommend you try using this product for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have been using the toner for a few months now and I am very pleased with the results. I use this in the morning before moisturizing and it has a pleasant spearmint like smell.

My fears were realized when I opened the product and under the safety seal, I found a disgusting rust-colored film under the &amp;#34;safety seal.&amp;#34; The entire toner appeared to be contaminated (it smelled awful). I contacted Amazon and they assured me the seller would refund me for the product. I am still waiting to see if I get the refund or not in my account. I would not order from this seller again; it&#x27;s just all too fishy. I like Image products, but I will be very suspect of future Amazon retailers of this product, from this day forward.</li>
            <li> Holds the little zips at bay.</li>
            <li> everyone of my kids use it!</li>
            <li> Although I tend to have dry skin, this is great for the summer when my skin gets oily . I use it once a day and it appears to control the oil and breakouts I get in the summer.</li>
            <li> If you are a Black woman with hyper-pigmentation this product will work for you! It does take some time but you will notice remarkable results in 4-6 weeks! My esthetician recommended this for me 2 years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since! Great product!</li>
