            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT FAIR TO LOYAL CUSTOMERS.&lt;br /&gt;*sorry</li>
            <li> The only reason why I am giving it 4 starts is because I wish the bottle would had come sealed (like I have always purchased it in other places).</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so for me it isn&#x27;t oily at all.  </li>
            <li> but when I got it was not what I expected it is like a bottle of oil.</li>
            <li> I mix a bit of other oils in (specifically tea tree oil, vitamin e, and vitamin a) and it helps keep my acne under control.</li>
            <li> BUT, it&#x27;s not as greasy as some other removers I&#x27;ve run into.</li>
            <li> removes the toughest of waterproof mascara and all other makeup with ease.  </li>
            <li> and I am very careful with skin care.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complains!</li>
            <li> Sadly it burns my sensitive eyes just like the Lancome product.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S HARD TO FIND.</li>
            <li> A WEEK AT LEAST) ELSEWHERE</li>
            <li> i like this product, not amazing</li>
            <li> Too bad it is not easy to find it in the US.</li>
            <li> Now I have to go to weird places to get my hands on it, like Amazon or eBay.</li>
            <li> sad face</li>

            <li> i like this product, not amazing but it does get the job done, however i do have to go over my face about 2 times with this, sooo not too shabby. :p</li>
            <li> I curse the day Pond&#x27;s discontinued this elixir of awesomeness. As a life-long acne sufferer, this product was a godsend to me. I mix a bit of other oils in (specifically tea tree oil, vitamin e, and vitamin a) and it helps keep my acne under control. Now I have to go to weird places to get my hands on it, like Amazon or eBay. Why, Ponds, whyyyyyy?</li>
            <li> Gentle yet thorough eye make up remover. Gently sweeps off eye make up without pulling or dragging the skin. My eyes feel refreshed after I finish using it! Would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I really like this make up remover. It&#x27;s better than any other that I&#x27;ve tried. The price is good and it really removes water proof mascara.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. Is great for taking off any kind of mascara. I love it. Too bad it is not easy to find it in the US. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does not irritate eyes, leaves skin feeling fresh and soft, does not dry skin and does not remain too greasy after use.</li>
            <li> BUT, it&#x27;s not as greasy as some other removers I&#x27;ve run into. If you have impossible-to-remove makeup, this is your remover. Just be aware you&#x27;ll to give your face a good wash afterwards to get the greasy feel off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face cleaning/hydratante for a long time, I hope to continue buying it through Amazon, highly recommended, it works for me.</li>
            <li> On time, and everything ok</li>
            <li> I got sensitive skin and I am very careful with skin care. This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores while doing its job, also it smells great.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m overall very happy with my purchase. The only reason why I am giving it 4 starts is because I wish the bottle would had come sealed (like I have always purchased it in other places). Other than that, no complains!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I thought it would have a thicker consistency but when I got it was not what I expected it is like a bottle of oil. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I adore it and I have bought it THREE times now this year,removes even my super waterproof eyeliner/mascara that soap doesn&#x27;t even smear..let alone remove it. Here&#x27;s my problem. AMAZON,PLEASE STOP TAKING MY STAPLE PRODUCTS AND FORCING ME TO SPEND $25 JUST TO GET THEM. I&#x27;VE ORDERED THIS THREE TIMES *ALONE* AND IT&#x27;S HARD TO FIND. NOW I TRIED TO REORDER IT AND IT&#x27;S AN ADD-ON ITEM. I AM A PRIME MEMBER 2 YEARS FOR TWO YEARS NOW, BUT I MAY AS WELL TAKE MY BUSINESS(5 ORDERS A WEEK AT LEAST) ELSEWHERE IF YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP DOING THIS. IT&#x27;S NOT FAIR TO LOYAL CUSTOMERS.&lt;br /&gt;*sorry everyone else for that and again,this is a super amazing eyemakeup remover so you&#x27;d better remember to grab it when you&#x27;re placing an order or else you&#x27;ll pay royally fot it. *sad face*</li>
            <li> I love this, easy to use, keep buying it !&lt;br /&gt;Cotton balls and a slash of water - your done !</li>
            <li> A few swipes of this wonderful product are all you need to remove the stubbornest of waterproof mascaras. I love the feel of the product and it makes it super easy to clear off all my makeup at night. I have very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had a problem with this at all.</li>
            <li> This is identical to Lancome makeup remover! Sadly it burns my sensitive eyes just like the Lancome product. I do like the Almay makeup remover pads. They are much gentler for me. If you love lancome buy this instead and save some $$![[ASIN:B0049S5DFG Almay Oil-free Eye Makeup Remover Pads, 120-Count (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> Después d hacer la orden con un cupón d redimir q aceptaron, el producto llegó con la factura sin el descuento. Me están cobrando todo. Eso molesta.</li>
            <li> This is great to use as a toner after cleansing.  I have dry skin so for me it isn&#x27;t oily at all.  Leaves the skin silky.</li>
            <li> Very effective, cheap and a great makeup remover. It works perfectly when you are wearing waterproof makeup.&lt;br /&gt;This is my go to eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it but a couple of times since I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often. I&#x27;m an older lady and don&#x27;t use a lot either but it removes what little I do put on easy...A piece of advice for all you younger ladies, always take your makeup off before going to bed at night, it&#x27;s much better for your skin.</li>
