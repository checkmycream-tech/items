            <li> This particular one is a little watery though.  </li>
            <li> A little on the thin side so would advise using 2 or more coats.  </li>
            <li> The color was undefinable; neither salmon, pink or red.  </li>
            <li> Not too orangy and not too pink.  </li>
            <li> It seems thinner than other colors I have</li>
            <li> but the colors never are the same as they appear online, usually darker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to find nail polish collections at my local Ulta</li>
            <li> Definitely need at least two coats, though!</li>
            <li> - my nail lady had to put 4 coats on and it was still a little streaky.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this nail polish a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> This color is a little brighter than I would usually wear on my fingers, but when I wore it I got some compliments.</li>
            <li> I hate pink.  </li>
            <li> I mean ... HATE.  </li>
            <li> I do use a base coat.</li>

            <li> The color is beautiful!! But beware this is not like the normal OPI wear one to two coats looks good - my nail lady had to put 4 coats on and it was still a little streaky. But I am willing to deal w/ that b/c the color is gorgeous - got tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> This color is a little brighter than I would usually wear on my fingers, but when I wore it I got some compliments. I do love it for toes, however. It&#x27;s a bright pinky-coral color perfect for summer.</li>

            <li> I always find OPI to be the best nail polish to use.  This particular one is a little watery though.  It seems thinner than other colors I have and I need more coats.  It may just be the color is lighter.  That being said, I love the color, it goes on nicely, and doesn&#x27;t chip off.</li>
            <li> Perfect Pinky/Peachy color, which would look great on any color tone. I used 2 coats and the color was very saturated. Very pleased.</li>

            <li> I had gotten this nail polish a few days ago.  It looked like a lighter color then I am use to. Went to a salon and had them done today and may I tell you what a beautiful pink this is not to light  just right.  THANK YOU!!!!</li>

            <li> I hate pink.  I mean ... HATE.  This was gorgeous.  I think it&#x27;s one of those shades that flatter all skin tones.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this color great for the summer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to find nail polish collections at my local Ulta so I went this route. Very happy with this purchase.
