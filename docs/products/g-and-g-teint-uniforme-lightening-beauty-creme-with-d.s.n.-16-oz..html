            <li>Love it ..</li>
            <li>so I cannot give any meaningful feedback yet.</li>
            <li>I will update after I find out if the company will refund my money but a company that doesn&#x27;t bother to update their postage meter or make sure their product is still usable...</li>
            <li>the smell is ok, not bad.  </li>
            <li>I brought this product not to be light skin.</li>
            <li>so far good</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and soft, my complexion is even and my son and husband say my fair skin is pretty.  </li>
            <li>I figure by the end of the year I will achieve the full body results I am seeking.</li>
            <li>Clears skin up quickly</li>
            <li>: Fast acting, Quantity, pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li>Its a bit pricy but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>For me it penetrates better for some reason and it is working for me so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind when a product takes a while to work because the longer a product takes to lighten me, the more natural my lightening looks.</li>
            <li>The first week I started using it, I could notice some of lighter spots were fading.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember if the change amount is exact but it holds 17.6 ounces.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first week of using it.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I didn&#x27;t see any visible signs of lightning.</li>
            <li>too early to tell if product works but it a nice big jar really get your monies worth.</li>
            <li>I also use a Kojic Acid soap every other day, bought right here on Amazon :)</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft, even, lighter and brighter.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, seems to be clearing up the marks on my arms, it applies well</li>
            <li>but i really recommend you switch to a safer product like Raphe phamaceuticals.</li>
            <li>opened on arrival and the product seemed used, with a very pungent smell.</li>
            <li>It helped immediately and very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see much difference, didn&#x27;t go darker or lighter.</li>
            <li>although this cream gave me a more growing facial tone, it did not brighten my other parts of the body as i was expecting, and just so you know, this product will leave your nails looking brown, however its worth a try.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than twice the amount for half the price.</li>
            <li>I use it with my cocoa butter lotion though because using it by itself is a little too strong.</li>
            <li>My lower body is naturally darker</li>
            <li>and my whole body will be the same color.</li>
            <li>used this product for nearly two months.  </li>
            <li>my skinned lighten and it looks natural</li>
            <li>People who don&#x27;t know me can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m lightening because it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I gave the manufacturers of this product credit for keeping it natural.  </li>
            <li>Because the cream is acidic based, it&#x27;s just the dry layer that is ready to flake or peel off to reveal fresher skin.</li>
            <li>Important note: When you start using this cream, your skin will appear a little darker, but don&#x27;t worry this is expected and normal.</li>
            <li>Arrived defective; it is so old that it has hardened into a solid mass that you can literally jab your finger at and still not break the surface, I tried several times.</li>

            <li> Lightens but it&#x27;s a little slow which is not a bad thing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this but don&#x27;t use it for a long period of time like months.</li>
            <li> Maybe it worked years ago but that time has long since passed.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used it for very long</li>
            <li> I was using the fade cream for dry skin from the Floclaire website and it is $32.</li>

            <li> The trouble with acne scars and sun spots/discolorations has been life long.  </li>
            <li> however i wated something to even out my skin tone since my arms and feet are darker than my other part of the body.</li>
            <li> Fades away dark spots and so on.</li>
            <li> my skin has a glow to it and also the dark spot on my checks where I had my piercing is gone already and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot give this product five stars because it can be very drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> so I had to wait half an hour in line at the post office</li>
            <li> Consisting of uneven skin tone and dark spots.</li>
            <li> you can see results in as little as 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> brown skinned, like chilli from TLC, I was not really exfoliated during the time of G&amp;G usage, and I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly cause it has a lot of acids in it that can thin your skin</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive name brand creams, Avon, Mary Kay, etc.  </li>
            <li> Could it be a fake one?</li>
            <li> sorry :-(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain hydroquinone which is bad for the skin.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Shipping was fast, seems to be clearing up the marks on my arms, it applies well but the smell isn&#x27;t so wonderful, will be ordering again</li>
            <li> did nothing but only moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gradually but it get cleared up my skin within a month, I will get this product again</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin. (I&#x27;m Irish &amp; Swedish)  The trouble with acne scars and sun spots/discolorations has been life long.  I have tried expensive name brand creams, Avon, Mary Kay, etc.  This stuff finally did the trick!  I am on my second jar now.  I use it on my face, arms, and chest to get rid of pink/brown discolorations and acne scars.  The first week I started using it, I could notice some of lighter spots were fading.  As the weeks went by, my skin was evening out. It&#x27;s been a couple months now and my acne scars are GONE!  Sun spots/discolorations are GONE!  My skin is smooth and soft, my complexion is even and my son and husband say my fair skin is pretty.  I don&#x27;t even wear foundation anymore!  It&#x27;s wonderful!  I also use a Kojic Acid soap every other day, bought right here on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> Clears skin up quickly</li>
            <li> Its okay but i really recommend you switch to a safer product like Raphe phamaceuticals. Its a bit pricy but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> this broke me out and only got me darker, left some scars dont buy!!</li>
            <li> Wish it had better seal of protection. opened on arrival and the product seemed used, with a very pungent smell.</li>
            <li> I used this cream with a serum to combat my suntan. It helped immediately and very well. Almost too well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. This is my first time trying it and I was truly amazed. My skin is super soft, even, lighter and brighter. I love how it has the sun protecting agents in it. I added four tubes of Neoprosone gel to give it a boost. Now you have to remember I was a medium/light brown which is what they call &amp;#34;redbone&amp;#34; but I had gotten tanned from being in the sun and just not using any products to maintain. I was using the fade cream for dry skin from the Floclaire website and it is $32. For it to only be 8 ounces(oz) it does not last long. I paid $15.48. I don&#x27;t remember if the change amount is exact but it holds 17.6 ounces. That&#x27;s more than twice the amount for half the price. There is a God. Combined with the Neoprosone gel I lightened within one month. My lower body is naturally darker so you can imagine by August I wont have to use the gel anymore and my whole body will be the same color. When I get to that point I will only be using this miracle cream because Neoprosone gel contains steroids and that is how the lightening is accelerated with that product. At that point I&#x27;ll be using my trusty Diana Stalder papaya kojic acid soap. I am grateful to the makers of this product. This is ideal to use after you shower for best absorption but the only thing I wish is that it smelled a tad better but hey if you shower before you sleep and apply it and then wake up and apply it again, by the time you go about your day, not only have you followed the directions but the smell will have faded.</li>
            <li> used this product for nearly two months.  I can&#x27;t see much difference, didn&#x27;t go darker or lighter. It just maintained my colour.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think i will be using it again.  If you want to go lighter i recommend not to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t contain hydroquinone which is bad for the skin. This cream is very good. Fades away dark spots and so on. I bought it because I want go have a toner complexion. I use it with my cocoa butter lotion though because using it by itself is a little too strong. It came on time, way before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> It works, and amazing size</li>
            <li> I am  trying to figure out if this product has aloe barbadensis in it ingredients</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for more than 8 months now. i always had a beautiful skin however i wated something to even out my skin tone since my arms and feet are darker than my other part of the body. although this cream gave me a more growing facial tone, it did not brighten my other parts of the body as i was expecting, and just so you know, this product will leave your nails looking brown, however its worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great smell and it works wonders!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a good difference with in a week my skin has a glow to it and also the dark spot on my checks where I had my piercing is gone already and the jar is very big for the price their asking I would recommend this it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with the tub and still no difference.Could it be a fake one?</li>
            <li> This is perfect for exfoliation as well. I use this for a week than after I start using my creams. For me it penetrates better for some reason and it is working for me so far. My skin is even complexion. I do recommend this but don&#x27;t use it for a long period of time like months. Use it sparingly cause it has a lot of acids in it that can thin your skin but for me I don&#x27;t have that problem but some skins are different.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again cause I love this.</li>
            <li> Let me say I finally found a product that works. I saw results within the first week of using it. My skin tone has lighten up about 3 shades after 3 months of use. I have battle with skin issues for years. Consisting of uneven skin tone and dark spots. For the first time in many years, I am proud to show off my beautiful even skin. My lower body is still about a shade darker than my upper body. I figure by the end of the year I will achieve the full body results I am seeking. I brought this product not to be light skin. But to even out my beautiful brown skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Fast acting, Quantity, pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;Con: Breif and minor skin peeling and irritation in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;Other Products used : Kojie San Acid Soap, and Caro White cream and oil</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I didn&#x27;t see any visible signs of lightning. So I threw it in the back of my closet somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, I kept hearing ppl talking about the amazing results they&#x27;ve received with this product. Bc of that, I ended up giving it another try, using the &amp;#34;occlusial&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product ended up lightening me 2 1/2 shades within 2 weeks, when I occluded day and night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m brown skinned, like chilli from TLC, I was not really exfoliated during the time of G&amp;G usage, and I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Takes a lot of time but it works but one problem I&#x27;ll be more confident if bottle was sealed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, at all would not recommend it,tota waist of money</li>
            <li> the smell is ok, not bad.  it works!! but gradually.  use with exfoliating soap to see better and faster results.  you can see results in as little as 2 weeks.  skin will peel.</li>
            <li> so far good my skinned lighten and it looks natural</li>
            <li> Love it ..I will always buy this</li>
            <li> Lightens but it&#x27;s a little slow which is not a bad thing in my opinion. I don&#x27;t mind when a product takes a while to work because the longer a product takes to lighten me, the more natural my lightening looks. It&#x27;s like losing weight, you don&#x27;t want it to happen rapidly or overnight. People who don&#x27;t know me can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m lightening because it looks so natural. Unfortunately I cannot give this product five stars because it can be very drying to the skin. After applying this product to my skin after three days, I have to take a break and apply regular lotion because it&#x27;s so drying! Someone suggested that I should wait for the cream to absorb, then apply moisturizer, which I will definitely try when I apply the cream later. This product doesn&#x27;t contain hydroquinone or steroids which is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars. I gave the manufacturers of this product credit for keeping it natural.  Important note: When you start using this cream, your skin will appear a little darker, but don&#x27;t worry this is expected and normal. Because the cream is acidic based, it&#x27;s just the dry layer that is ready to flake or peel off to reveal fresher skin. This cream used with kojie sans will lead amazing results.</li>
            <li> too early to tell if product works but it a nice big jar really get your monies worth. arrive on time. no problem.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used it for very long so I cannot give any meaningful feedback yet. Seems to be working and there is no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I just used it once and it irritated my skin.. sorry :-(</li>
            <li> Worthless. Arrived defective; it is so old that it has hardened into a solid mass that you can literally jab your finger at and still not break the surface, I tried several times. This is NOT A CREME - IT IS A SOLID MASS! Maybe it worked years ago but that time has long since passed. And, the company has not adjusted their postage meter so I had to wait half an hour in line at the post office so I could pay the $0.35 postage due bill - which was all fine until I opened the jar and encounter a stinky hard mass that can no longer be described as a creme (or anything spreadable). I will update after I find out if the company will refund my money but a company that doesn&#x27;t bother to update their postage meter or make sure their product is still usable...</li>
