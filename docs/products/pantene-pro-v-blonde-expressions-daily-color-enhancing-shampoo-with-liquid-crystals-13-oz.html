            <li> I have gray hair and have been using it for sometime.. I think it keeps my hair brighter and I like the texture it leave me with.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think it is a good product.</li>

            <li> Shampoo for Blonde hair is great, it doesn&#x27;t dull it. I&#x27;m always looking for products that work with blonde hair</li>
            <li> My wife was very pleased that I could find this item.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used several Pantene products and was always satisfied with the results. That may be why I was so surprised at the difference in ths product.&lt;br /&gt;I had to use much more just get a lather. It never made my hair look or behave as Pantene products usually do. Also, it never had that clean, just-washed feel. That it what I get for choosing a lower priced product. From now on, I will stick with higher quality. Pantene must still have a few of them. I hope so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pantene Pro-V Blonde Expressions for at least 3 years and love the way it treats my hair...which is colored and permed.  It leaves it soft and not frizzy.  That&#x27;s why I ordered 5 bottles of it because it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores anymore.  Would definitely recommend it to friends/family.</li>
            <li> Product came as advertised. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find this product in stores, not sure why, didn&#x27;t see it discontinued. Arrived in 2 days.</li>

            <li> I love this shampoo, but cannot find it in our stores anymore.  It is perfect for bringing out highlights in light blonde hair and works best when used with Pantene Blonde Expressions Color Enhancing Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Shampoo. Hardly an exciting porduct to write about, but one I dare say few of us would be willing to do without! Shampoo, like mouthwash or deordorant is highly personal and subjective. What the needs are of one individual are may not be those of someone else&#x27;s. I am very particular about my personal hygene products, including my choice of shampoo. What I like about Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Blonde Expressions is that it&#x27;s specifically formulated for blondes (or those who want to be). It has a very mild pleasing smell to it and doesn&#x27;t require much to do the job. It lathers up nicely and rinses out without leaving any &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; feel to it, which is something I want. Combing it afterwards is great; no tangles, and my wife likes the smell afterwards (and we all know how important that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value for size. My only complaint is that only the Highlighting Expressions Shampoo seems to be available. Be sure to try the Pro-V Blonde Expressions Conditioner too!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my colored hair! Adds some zip to fading color. I can no longer find this in area retail stores, so I was thrilled to find it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!! It makes your hair so shimmery, enhancing your highlights and creating new ones. I just ordered the conditioner, as well. Great product! :-)</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for the last year.  I decided to quit coloring my hair and see what color it would be.  There was some gray but as I used this product the gray went more silver.  My beautician told me that she would never be able to give me the beautiful streaks that I have.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent and perfect for blonde hair.  It lathers nicely, has a nice fragrance, and creates a light shine.</li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde hair but I dye it blonder and usually have highlights. So a color shampoo specifically for blonds sounded great! I however, don&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair after using this shampoo. Its hard to tell when I use a color conditioner as well. It smells great though but is a lot cheaper at the drug store! its only like $6 at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Pantene product. I tried to order directly from Pantene but was advised it has been discontinued.  THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for blondes. It doesn&#x27;t leave any strange color in your hair&lt;br /&gt;and leaves your hair looking great. Nice scent to it too.</li>
            <li> The product has not been opened yet but I trust everything is fine since it is sealed in a package.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair the colour blond I want it to be.  A friend told me about it and am I ever glad.  The condition is very good to.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo; makes my hair shine and sparkle.</li>
