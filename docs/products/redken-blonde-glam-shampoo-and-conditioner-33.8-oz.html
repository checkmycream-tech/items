            <li>It has a nice fragrance that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  </li>
            <li>Rinses clean and does a great job with my color.</li>
            <li>I have very light hair with a great deal of grey and this the best I have used.</li>
            <li>Most important to me, using this shampoo and conditioner has greatly reduced the split ends in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally bought this brand in my salon and loved it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner, leaves my hair silky.</li>
            <li>Love the feel, smell, and shine of my hair</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and wouldn&#x27;t switch.</li>
            <li>It keeps my blond hair healthy and it shines.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, like grapefruit/oranges.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE...</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo...</li>
            <li>Things you need to know about my hair - it&#x27;s multi textured, multi toned, and is more stubborn than any mule some mornings.</li>
            <li>Better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>this conditioner just lays on top,</li>
            <li>I just  love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair looks after I use this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my hair</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and it has been discontinued by Redken...</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo ever.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair silky and my color is always brighter.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner, hair is ultra shiny and condition great, I swim most days and have high lift colour all over.</li>
            <li>It is unbelievably effective in helping my hair do its thing, looks shiny, healthy and full of volume.</li>
            <li>Makes easy hairdo.</li>
            <li>Has a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I use a hair dryer and curling iron and my hair always looks fantastic when I use this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Redken, but rarely can afford it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several months now, and i am happy with the result.</li>
            <li>The conditioner protects my hair well, giving relatively smooth feel to it.</li>
            <li>The product is packaged in bottles with printed plastic labels on them (authentic Redken prints right on the bottle.)</li>
            <li>Takes all the impurities out of my hair and leaves it so soft and smooth, and I love the way it smells :)</li>
            <li>This stuff smells sweet, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any HUGE difference with using it -- either in the longevity of my highlights or the quality (softness, breakage, etc.) of my hair.</li>
            <li>product as described, shipping was great, but extended use caused my hair to dry out.</li>
            <li>Perfect products for my natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Because I now have the perfect shampoo and conditioner that defies logic and my hard water.</li>
            <li>The conditioner not only smells wonderful, but leaves your hair totally untangled, smooth, and lustrous.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on many reviews by others that this product is the \\&quot;real deal.\\</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>As promised, my natural blond hair has lightened up nicely.</li>
            <li>Redken Blonde Glam shampoo and conditioner is the best for blonde hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only shampoo that keeps my colors looking fresh and bright.</li>
            <li>These really keep your hair color strong for many weeks, works great on fragile bleached blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Is a nice mid grade product if you want decent product but don&#x27;t wish to spend the money on TOP salon quality.</li>
            <li>I definitely will buy more!</li>
            <li>So far, this shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I used to buy it at the salon, but it is a far better deal to get this online.  </li>
            <li>This has made my hair look like its soft and has made my color look so much better</li>
            <li>the shampoo is really thick and rich and makes hair feel and smell great.</li>
            <li>it was so clean, my hair appeared more blonde than I&#x27;ve seen it in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband is a very light very curly and very fine blonde that is naturally soft.</li>
            <li>I color my hair and have for years this product works great and no yellow fade back.</li>
            <li>My hair is not dry any more and it took about a nickel size drop to cover my head.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely shiny and soft and styles great.</li>
            <li>On a whim I bought this at her last haircut and it is nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li>The smell was slightly different than the authentic Blond Glam.</li>
            <li>Bought  it 3 times and I really like it!</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, smooth and yet controlled.</li>
            <li>first wash</li>
            <li>It makes it soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>It really keeps my hair feeling soft, manageable and smooth.</li>
            <li>Plus, you need to by the pumps, but they are easily found and rather cheap -- just a little &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; you have to tack onto the price.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes in the large bottles</li>
            <li>Also Amazon has 2 bottles for 40.00 or so versus 1 bottle for 29.99 at salon for large bottle</li>
            <li>A little back story I have used redken before on my daughter&#x27;s hair to great results.</li>
            <li>The smell really makes me want to wake up and energizes me.</li>
            <li>This seller also sells the real deal.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real stuff</li>
            <li>The seller was very prompt with sending out my products as well.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my hair look and feel.  </li>
            <li>she really loves the quality of this product ...</li>
            <li>I can wash and condition my whole head of hair - not just the ends -</li>
            <li>However, it has really improved the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the hair soft and the fragrance is fresh.</li>
            <li>of volume and shine.&lt;br /&gt;Price was very good.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>no way this is the real product.</li>
            <li>The beauty salon used it on my hair and it left it smooth and silky after I had my hair colored.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and it arrived way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>im starting to think this isnt even autentic Redken, ive used the brand before and it has never ruined my hair the way this has, i am asking for a full refund now becasue</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo for my blonde in the spring and summer and this price simply can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I love Blonde Glam, especially because of the smell.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>and because this product is infused with some form of a citric acid, it is full of life and volume and soft, pliable - just amazingly clean soft and holds a style without being weighed down.</li>
            <li>but my mistake i switched backed to my old shampoo for a few days, and what a huge difference!</li>
            <li>This product is either very old or counterfeit.</li>
            <li>this is my first time purchasing it outside of a salon.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so shine and so soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde and this really brings out my highlights!</li>
            <li>It really brings out the highlights in your blonde hair</li>
            <li>On them, redken prints directly on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Epic pain for her and me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want it to work because I didn&#x27;t want to feel obligated to make it my regular shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I will be spending the extra few bucks to buy an authentic product from an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to hate buying another bottle, but this stuff is really great!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and almost entirely blond from the highlights (my hair is naturally brown).</li>
            <li>I especially like that I didn&#x27;t have to make a special trip to the salon and risk them only having smaller bottles for sale (a joke when you have long hair that soaks up conditioner like a dry sponge).</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner dried my hair out within the first week</li>
            <li>My shampoo and conditioner was thick and it did the job better than any other product I&#x27;ve used in my quest for hair repair and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Not only did I find it in the large size, the price was so much less than salon prices.</li>

            <li> My hair is extremely shiny and soft and styles great.</li>
            <li> On a whim I bought this at her last haircut and it is nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> The smell was slightly different than the authentic Blond Glam.</li>
            <li> Bought  it 3 times and I really like it!</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, smooth and yet controlled.</li>
            <li> first wash</li>
            <li> It makes it soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> It really keeps my hair feeling soft, manageable and smooth.</li>
            <li> Plus, you need to by the pumps, but they are easily found and rather cheap -- just a little &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; you have to tack onto the price.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes in the large bottles</li>
            <li> Also Amazon has 2 bottles for 40.00 or so versus 1 bottle for 29.99 at salon for large bottle</li>
            <li> A little back story I have used redken before on my daughter&#x27;s hair to great results.</li>
            <li> The smell really makes me want to wake up and energizes me.</li>
            <li> This seller also sells the real deal.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real stuff</li>
            <li> The seller was very prompt with sending out my products as well.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my hair look and feel.  </li>
            <li> she really loves the quality of this product ...</li>
            <li> I can wash and condition my whole head of hair - not just the ends -</li>
            <li> However, it has really improved the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the hair soft and the fragrance is fresh.</li>
            <li> of volume and shine.&lt;br /&gt;Price was very good.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> no way this is the real product.</li>
            <li> The beauty salon used it on my hair and it left it smooth and silky after I had my hair colored.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and it arrived way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> im starting to think this isnt even autentic Redken, ive used the brand before and it has never ruined my hair the way this has, i am asking for a full refund now becasue</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for my blonde in the spring and summer and this price simply can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I love Blonde Glam, especially because of the smell.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> and because this product is infused with some form of a citric acid, it is full of life and volume and soft, pliable - just amazingly clean soft and holds a style without being weighed down.</li>
            <li> but my mistake i switched backed to my old shampoo for a few days, and what a huge difference!</li>
            <li> This product is either very old or counterfeit.</li>
            <li> this is my first time purchasing it outside of a salon.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so shine and so soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde and this really brings out my highlights!</li>
            <li> It really brings out the highlights in your blonde hair</li>
            <li> On them, redken prints directly on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Epic pain for her and me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want it to work because I didn&#x27;t want to feel obligated to make it my regular shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I will be spending the extra few bucks to buy an authentic product from an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to hate buying another bottle, but this stuff is really great!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and almost entirely blond from the highlights (my hair is naturally brown).</li>
            <li> I especially like that I didn&#x27;t have to make a special trip to the salon and risk them only having smaller bottles for sale (a joke when you have long hair that soaks up conditioner like a dry sponge).</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner dried my hair out within the first week</li>
            <li> My shampoo and conditioner was thick and it did the job better than any other product I&#x27;ve used in my quest for hair repair and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Not only did I find it in the large size, the price was so much less than salon prices.</li>
            <li> I used to only teach three days a week for long periods.</li>
            <li> I could never use conditioner because my hair would lie helplessly flat</li>
            <li> I prefer thick shampoo and conditioner because I think it feels like it is higher quality...</li>
            <li> but the natural waves that are more visible when bad oils or residue chemicals are in my hair were lengthened out.</li>
            <li> My hair never really gets rested or moisturizer, no matter what I use, from leave in tonics to deep conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only bought it here due to it being discontinued...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a very long time since I&#x27;ve seen my hair so shiny.</li>
            <li> Only started buying on line because I could not fine the formal at my local beauty parlor.</li>
            <li> I have rather thin, mostly naturally blonde hair and while it leaves my hair with fewer tangles than regular store bought shampoo/conditioner, it didn&#x27;t WOW me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically blow dry either, but I did this time, and not only was my hair not frizzy (</li>
            <li> I have naturally very thick dark blonde straight hair that borders on dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> Left hair severely dried out.</li>
            <li> My hair devoured it - not as in, soaked it up, but the experience was indulgent, and even wet</li>
            <li> same product as the pricey stores and salons but half the price!!</li>
            <li> My hair is now down to my bottom.</li>
            <li> So let down after spending money on these.</li>
            <li> These big bottles are a little hard to pore.</li>
            <li> less watered down etc.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this (knock off) priduct would restore the shine she from previous bottles of redken.</li>
            <li> Redken dried out my hair so bad and made it feel like it wasnt even clean at all, i am dissapointed because</li>
            <li> My daughters colored hair was looking dull and dry.</li>
            <li> I also use the redken heavy cream once per week</li>
            <li> There is some chemical in this shampoo that wreaks havoc on my head like few others have ever done.</li>
            <li> conditioner actually dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> It took a few days</li>
            <li> But, really, for the price, this stuff isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just not phenomenal, either.</li>
            <li> (I usually do this when purchasing salon shampoo online).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> it was not worth the 50 i paid for just a poor item.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is thick and is a shimmery gold color.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick and a yellowish gold color.</li>
            <li> ( my hair is very thick and to my waist.)</li>
            <li> This product is a fake.</li>
            <li> Product was fake.</li>
            <li> How wrong was I had to give her two baths on a school night.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive for shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry to report that this shampoo conditioner combo makes my scalp have sores.</li>
            <li> Makes my head itch something crazy.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, but 100 % vegan.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out it was discontinued and went online to find it.</li>
            <li> this shampoo AND conditoner is horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One of the best product when you have a damage hair and you need to repair it... Love it</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner, leaves my hair silky. I can&#x27;t tell if tips helping my color stay but he smell is great and so is the price.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Love the feel, smell, and shine of my hair I&#x27;m a natural blonde and this really brings out my highlights!</li>
            <li> Redken Blonde Glam shampoo and conditioner is the best for blonde hair. It really brings out the highlights in your blonde hair no matter what shade of blonde you have. My hair is extremely shiny and soft and styles great. I use a hair dryer and curling iron and my hair always looks fantastic when I use this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner is great for softening my hair.  I bought another bottle of each one!</li>
            <li> this is great shampoo and conditioner! the shampoo is really thick and rich and makes hair feel and smell great. the conditioner smells awesome and works great. will definately buy again</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and wouldn&#x27;t switch. It keeps my blond hair healthy and it shines.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo and conditioner. I love the way it smells, like grapefruit/oranges. The smell really makes me want to wake up and energizes me. The shampoo is thick and is a shimmery gold color. The conditioner is thick and a yellowish gold color. I prefer thick shampoo and conditioner because I think it feels like it is higher quality... less watered down etc. I have heavily processed hair from intense highlighting. My hair is naturally curly and almost entirely blond from the highlights (my hair is naturally brown). I&#x27;ve used Redkin for the last 5 years and blond glam for the last 1.5 years. My hair has grown past my shoulders for the first time since I started using Redkin. My hair is now down to my bottom. So far, this shampoo is my favorite. It really keeps my hair feeling soft, manageable and smooth. This seller also sells the real deal. I had some left over from the salon and I compared the two just in case (I usually do this when purchasing salon shampoo online). This stuff is the real stuff and it is sold at a great price. I especially like that I didn&#x27;t have to make a special trip to the salon and risk them only having smaller bottles for sale (a joke when you have long hair that soaks up conditioner like a dry sponge). Item arrived on time and packaged well. Would recommend this item and seller.</li>
            <li> product as described, shipping was great, but extended use caused my hair to dry out. Recently made the switch to Pureology NanoWorks. Very expensive, but 100 % vegan.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a pleasure to use.  The conditioner not only smells wonderful, but leaves your hair totally untangled, smooth, and lustrous.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE... this is probably the best purchase you can make. It&#x27;s way cheaper than anything you can get at a salon and just as good quality.</li>
            <li> I use these products to help retian and brighten my color.  This size is a breat buy by the ounce from salon prices.  Quality products, great price.</li>
            <li> Been using Redken products for years.  Only started buying on line because I could not fine the formal at my local beauty parlor.</li>
            <li> This was one of the easiest and best purchases I have done. The seller was very prompt with sending out my products as well. This shampoo and conditioner makes your hair feel just like silk. I will definitely order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candace</li>
            <li> I color my hair and have for years this product works great and no yellow fade back. I have very light hair with a great deal of grey and this the best I have used.</li>
            <li> Makes my head itch something crazy. Didn&#x27;t care for the smell either. Does NOT beat the purple shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo... I have been using it for over a year.  This stuff is amazing. These big bottles are a little hard to pore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on many reviews by others that this product is the \\&quot;real deal.\\&quot; I have been using Redken Blonde Glam for the last year and this is my first time purchasing it outside of a salon. I instantly noticed the difference in my hair. The product is packaged in bottles with printed plastic labels on them (authentic Redken prints right on the bottle.) The shampoo and conditioner dried my hair out within the first week I started using it. The smell was slightly different than the authentic Blond Glam. I learned my lesson this time. I will be spending the extra few bucks to buy an authentic product from an authorized dealer. Haircare is one area not to bargain shop for...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how bright Redken makes my hair. Takes all the impurities out of my hair and leaves it so soft and smooth, and I love the way it smells :)</li>
            <li> Bought  it 3 times and I really like it! Makes my hair so shine and so soft! Makes easy hairdo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for my blonde in the spring and summer and this price simply can&#x27;t be beat. Way to go amazon!</li>
            <li> My daughter actually likes Redken. I bought this set in 2013 for $46.90 and again in 2014 for $41.50. They now want $159.99 amid reports from many that they believe this product is a fake knockoff. We won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my hair look and feel.  My hair feels soft, smooth and yet controlled.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake. These bottles have a sticker with the redken info. On them, redken prints directly on the bottle. BEWARE!!!!</li>
            <li> Product was fake. Has a strong chemical smell. Left hair severely dried out. Will be contacting Amazon for a refund. If they can give it. A little back story I have used redken before on my daughter&#x27;s hair to great results. Currently using herbal essence shampoo and conditioner. Was hoping this (knock off) priduct would restore the shine she from previous bottles of redken. How wrong was I had to give her two baths on a school night. Epic pain for her and me. Under bo circumstances would I purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter .....she really loves the quality of this product ...she says this is the only brand she will use for her hair it gives her the best results.</li>
            <li> Things you need to know about my hair - it&#x27;s multi textured, multi toned, and is more stubborn than any mule some mornings. I&#x27;m a swim instructor, and I&#x27;m in chlorine water 5-10 times a week for typically several hours at a time. I used to only teach three days a week for long periods. Now I teach five days a week for somewhat shorter periods. My hair never really gets rested or moisturizer, no matter what I use, from leave in tonics to deep conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first wash I already felt a difference when the conditioner went on. My hair devoured it - not as in, soaked it up, but the experience was indulgent, and even wet I knew it was working. I don&#x27;t typically blow dry either, but I did this time, and not only was my hair not frizzy (HUZZAH) but the natural waves that are more visible when bad oils or residue chemicals are in my hair were lengthened out. It&#x27;s been a very long time since I&#x27;ve seen my hair so shiny. it was so clean, my hair appeared more blonde than I&#x27;ve seen it in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s some confusion on whether it&#x27;s a diverted product with a masquerading label. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Redken, but rarely can afford it. My shampoo and conditioner was thick and it did the job better than any other product I&#x27;ve used in my quest for hair repair and moisturizing. Whether it&#x27;s diverted or not, I will buy again, and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it would be. Perfect products for my natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells sweet, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any HUGE difference with using it -- either in the longevity of my highlights or the quality (softness, breakage, etc.) of my hair. I have rather thin, mostly naturally blonde hair and while it leaves my hair with fewer tangles than regular store bought shampoo/conditioner, it didn&#x27;t WOW me. Plus, you need to by the pumps, but they are easily found and rather cheap -- just a little &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; you have to tack onto the price. But, really, for the price, this stuff isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just not phenomenal, either.</li>
            <li> Awesome. It&#x27;s the only shampoo that keeps my colors looking fresh and bright. I&#x27;ve heard that Redkin has stopped making it. This is upsetting. I hope they change their mind because why change something that is so perfect.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine,straight hair and have to style it every day with a process that includes blowdrying and curling to get volume. Add to that the mousse and hairspray to build support at the roots and finish the style; my hair goes through a lot. I could never use conditioner because my hair would lie helplessly flat and I would have to employ herculean efforts to get it airborne away from my scalp................UNTIL I TRIED THIS. It is unbelievably effective in helping my hair do its thing, looks shiny, healthy and full of volume. I can wash and condition my whole head of hair - not just the ends - and because this product is infused with some form of a citric acid, it is full of life and volume and soft, pliable - just amazingly clean soft and holds a style without being weighed down. I don&#x27;t know who concocted this product&#x27;s ingredients, but I hope they win some sort of prize. Because I now have the perfect shampoo and conditioner that defies logic and my hard water.</li>
            <li> This product is either very old or counterfeit. So let down after spending money on these. The conditioner is not water soluble...go figure?? I always mix some conditioner in a spray bottle with water...this conditioner just lays on top, won&#x27;t mix. I have used Blonde Glam for several years always purchased at a salon. Only bought it here due to it being discontinued... Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> These really keep your hair color strong for many weeks, works great on fragile bleached blonde hair. I also use the redken heavy cream once per week</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive for shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t really want it to work because I didn&#x27;t want to feel obligated to make it my regular shampoo and conditioner.  However, it has really improved the health of my hair.  My hair is softer, silkier, and shinier.  Most important to me, using this shampoo and conditioner has greatly reduced the split ends in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to hate buying another bottle, but this stuff is really great!</li>
            <li> I am sorry to report that this shampoo conditioner combo makes my scalp have sores. I went off it for a couple weeks and tried something else. After one usage, again i had the sores on my scalp. There is some chemical in this shampoo that wreaks havoc on my head like few others have ever done. What a shame. Great idea though.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brand in my salon and loved it. I was disappointed to find out it was discontinued and went online to find it. Not only did I find it in the large size, the price was so much less than salon prices.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITONER!! It smells so good first of all, lathers up nicely and makes my hair with damage look great!</li>
            <li> I just  love this shampoo and conditioner. They make my hair feel silky and smell great. The blonde glam helps me retain my blonde highlights longer.</li>
            <li> Wow! My daughters colored hair was looking dull and dry. On a whim I bought this at her last haircut and it is nothing short of amazing! The color looks shiny and bright again... And it&#x27;s been 6 months since the last color treatment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using redken blonde glam since it came out which was around 10 years ago. To my dismay when I went to purchase it at the beauty supply they told me it was being discontinued. I am extremely happy to have found it at amazon and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the real deal. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and it arrived way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair looks after I use this shampoo and conditioner. I only use this once a week and I use a purple shampoo once a week as well..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  It leaves my hair shiny and has a great scent.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> same product as the pricey stores and salons but half the price!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner, hair is ultra shiny and condition great, I swim most days and have high lift colour all over.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It leaves the hair soft and the fragrance is fresh. It smells like grapefruit and I love it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner should only be used once a week, and once a week it will give you shiny hair and brighten the blonde. Used more than once a week and your hair will be breaking off! The grapefruit in it which is used to brighten the hair also dries the hair and hair becomes brittle and falls off!!!</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair feel.&lt;br /&gt;Can go for two days before I have to wash again.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of volume and shine.&lt;br /&gt;Price was very good.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean and does a great job with my color. I like that it comes in the large bottles so I am not constantly ordering.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair stylist. Great product, feels good and I&#x27;ll buy it again..... .......... ............ ......... buy it you will like it</li>
            <li> This shampoo is to die for!. There is definetly something said for a shampoo made for blondes, and not just one type of blonde hair all. I have naturally very thick dark blonde straight hair that borders on dry at the ends. My husband is a very light very curly and very fine blonde that is naturally soft. This shampoo makes both of our hair look and feel amazing. My hair is not dry any more and it took about a nickel size drop to cover my head. ( my hair is very thick and to my waist.) It was a bit pricey but I will definetly be buying again!</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo - excellent for blonde hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it has been discontinued.  Hope I can still get this product for some time to come~  Works wonders on my highlights.</li>
            <li> My hairdresssor recommended this to me as I was having highlights in my hair. It makes it soft &amp; smooth. Also Amazon has 2 bottles for 40.00 or so versus 1 bottle for 29.99 at salon for large bottle</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I used to buy it at the salon, but it is a far better deal to get this online.  I am 56 y.o., and people will comment on how I get my hair to shine!  This is the only shampoo/conditioner I will ever use!</li>
            <li> junk. no way this is the real product. conditioner actually dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> The beauty salon used it on my hair and it left it smooth and silky after I had my hair colored.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is great for color-treated hair!  This set makes my hair feel silky and shiny.  It has a nice fragrance that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  I definitely will buy more!</li>
            <li> I should still be receiving the shampoo???? The product says shampoo and conditioner set yet I only received the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and it has been discontinued by Redken...so stock up!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. Especially love that grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li> As always great service and product!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> It took a few days but i just received my shipment, i havent opened the package yet but i cant wait to try these!&lt;br /&gt;Will update after i try them tomorrow before work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE*****&lt;br /&gt;OK this shampoo AND conditoner is horrible it dries out your hair so much,&lt;br /&gt;my hair started to look like straw so i assumed it was my leave in conditoner and was thinking about returning that, but my mistake i switched backed to my old shampoo for a few days, and what a huge difference! Redken dried out my hair so bad and made it feel like it wasnt even clean at all, i am dissapointed because im starting to think this isnt even autentic Redken, ive used the brand before and it has never ruined my hair the way this has, i am asking for a full refund now becasue it was not worth the 50 i paid for just a poor item.</li>
            <li> This has made my hair look like its soft and has made my color look so much better and the conditioner is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now, and i am happy with the result. As promised, my natural blond hair has lightened up nicely. The conditioner protects my hair well, giving relatively smooth feel to it. While re-ordering the set, i also ordered the set of pumps for the bottles - i am very happy with tchem - having pumps makes the use of both, shampoo and conditioner, easier.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are great. They leave my hair so smooth and they both smell great! I will continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, and leaves my hair feeling so nice afterwards. Will definitely buy this again. Is a nice mid grade product if you want decent product but don&#x27;t wish to spend the money on TOP salon quality.</li>
            <li> O love it! it&#x27;s a very good product!</li>
            <li> I love Blonde Glam, especially because of the smell.  They have changed it, why do they do that to good stuff???</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my hair silky and my color is always brighter. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
