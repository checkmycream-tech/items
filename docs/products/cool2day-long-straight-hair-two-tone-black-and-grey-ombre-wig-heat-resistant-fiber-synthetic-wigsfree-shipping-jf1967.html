            <li>WOULD LIKE MORE OF YOUR WIGS.</li>
            <li>but over all I love it and would buy again ❤</li>
            <li>️ Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Nice wig for cheap.  </li>
            <li>Love this wig.</li>
            <li>It has a nice shine to it but not overly shiny as cheap costume wigs.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>and i love the length and style of the hair</li>
            <li>but it is an okay wig.....</li>
            <li>It is great and very durable.</li>
            <li>It look a lot better than I could have ever imagined.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and lovely, the color is great, and I love the bangs.</li>
            <li>Length is good, and color is a bright red.</li>
            <li>This was a very cool wig.  </li>
            <li>The synthetic fibers are soft and of great quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and is a great shade.</li>
            <li>If red hair looks good on your complexion (which it doesn&#x27;t on every1) give this wig a try!</li>
            <li>no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
            <li>Wig doesn&#x27;t tangle too easily, it&#x27;s soft, light, and easy to maintain and looks great.</li>
            <li>but after dealing with customer service I am very pleased with how things turned out...will be buying from this company again very soon</li>
            <li>Its was really nice looked so real !</li>
            <li>The color is a teensy bit lighter than it is in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The hair is a beautiful shade of wine red, just as shown &amp; described.</li>
            <li>but it was fine.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>...feels very comfortable and looks real!!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed getting this fun style wig.</li>
            <li>also it is very shinnyyy!!!</li>
            <li>VERY WORTH THE WAIT.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like picture, doesn&#x27;t tangle or lose hair, overall very good wig.</li>
            <li>Came quick tangles easy</li>
            <li>This wig was dirt cheap and took only a couple weeks to get, which is really good since it came all the way from china.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and believable !</li>
            <li>True to color and length.  </li>
            <li>Its more curled than the photo and very hefty.  </li>
            <li>I got compliments all night and many thought it was my REAL hair.  </li>
            <li>iah like golin to the qwgs shop pcking out bgs full and s lkl,i nv as  lcl</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same good quality as the rest of Cool2Day&#x27;s wigs.</li>
            <li>it isnt as full as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li>especially if worn with a good hat.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THE HAIR, ITS NOT TO THICK BEAUTIFUL COLOR, AND</li>
            <li>Its a true wine red color, and while I was hoping for more of a cherry red, this is still absolutely beautiful and very pretty wig.  </li>
            <li>Definitely reminds me of a perfect wine red.</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty and accurately shown.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more &amp;#34; red&amp;#34; in person which is just fine with me :) I suggest shaking it out ( or hit it on cool with a hair dryer)</li>
            <li>Good looking wig- a litlte thin in the back but very good for the price.  </li>
            <li>Great wig, just cut off a few inches</li>
            <li>but well worth the 8 bucks.</li>
            <li>The curls are really nice when they are brushed out</li>
            <li>it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brought its own hair net too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the bangs.</li>
            <li>right now its on my couch cant wear it</li>
            <li>Mine also came with a wig cap and a little package of bobby-pins, which was a nice surprise seeing as I lost all of mine!</li>
            <li>finally have it shaped up and suitable fornwear.</li>
            <li>All my friends just loved it The fun of being a spunky redhead without the damageto your natural hair (red is the harshest color u can dye your hair with)</li>
            <li>Like it very much, soft to touch, blows in lite breezy days like real hair, very comfortable regardless of time waiting for delivery</li>
            <li>The wig seems pretty high quality given how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>Because they are so cheap if I ruin one I just order a new one.</li>
            <li>I felt like this was a good wig but slightly less quality</li>
            <li>This is fun and looks pretty real if styled right.....</li>
            <li>The wig is very soft to the touch and is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I got this exactly when it said it would be in the mail, it even came with a wig cap too</li>
            <li>The hairs are really tangled and falling out, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>You know what you want, but it may not be exactly what you get.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the color.</li>
            <li>I LIKE THE STYLE AND WINE RED, IF YOU HAVE MORE WINERED WIGS .I  </li>
            <li>The waves on mine were a bit more short and wavy than pictured</li>
            <li>the color is exactly as pictured....</li>
            <li>it looks like my real hair!</li>
            <li>not fake plastic shine Its a deep purple red color and looks amazing!</li>
            <li>It feels natural and light.</li>
            <li>Thick and managable and the color was great</li>
            <li>and i will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute wig, but the bangs are too short.</li>
            <li>This is overall a good wig, but it is RED!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have a scalp condition which made me lose a bunch of hair hence my need for a wig, and its very hot weather where i live.</li>
            <li>And for such a fantastic price I&#x27;m definitely going to get more colors.</li>
            <li>(Out of the package it was pretty intense)</li>
            <li>loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head,</li>
            <li>I wear them full time and was very delighted at the above average quality considering the low price.</li>
            <li>is that in the back there is a spot that seems like (easily fixable with some styling, though)</li>
            <li>Hours later, i filled a whole wastebasket  with excess hair  </li>
            <li>and I was told today while wearing it that it looked extremely real.</li>
            <li>Not the color I was looking for but a really well made wig.  </li>
            <li>so brush it gently</li>
            <li>Very unprofessional business practice.</li>
            <li>for the price it just makes the whole thing a knockout.  </li>
            <li>It will help tremendously to fluff up the fibers and make it look more flattering.  </li>
            <li>real looks shinny but</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this wig.</li>
            <li>I really like this wig...</li>
            <li>My wig was not a wine red color but more of a pink/purple bright color with very slight red undertones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too small to fit any adult head and the quality is very cheap.</li>
            <li>Very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>The bang area was a little bit more shiny than the rest of the hair, but I assume that will go away after the first washing.</li>
            <li>i never expected something this good for such a low price!!!</li>
            <li>then the last one I bought from cool 2</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a dark purple blood like color.</li>
            <li>I totally recommend this wig for people who want a nice, natural looking red haired wig.</li>
            <li>The color is little mermaid red but it looks really good</li>
            <li>I thought from the picture it would be more of a deep burgundy or auburn color, but it is red.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a really crappy wig for this price and was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t be happier and I would highly recommend buying this wig.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get them to swoop over, but I just cut them into straight bangs (that&#x27;s how I wear my hair naturally).</li>
            <li>I will reccommend this wigs to anyone who wants the professional look.</li>
            <li>It not bad, but not natural looking either.</li>
            <li>Rinse in cool water before wearing (and fluff/air dry -</li>
            <li>The cut is weird too as it makes my head on top and the sides look like they are huge.  </li>
            <li>It looks a lot more natural if its a bit messy..</li>
            <li>No one can tell it&#x27;s not my natural hair!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s so natural looking</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s better than overly thick to the point where you can&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>Color was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>The red is much brighter and the bangs are different.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that it&#x27;s kind of thin</li>
            <li>very well - most wigs are a little small</li>
            <li>I would reccomend for anyone looking for a vivid red.</li>
            <li>I feel so pretty with such long hair!</li>
            <li>Other than that it does not tangle easily like some of the other wigs I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Fit more like a Mullet wig.  :(</li>
            <li>The material looks cheap and the hair fall after a couple times of trying (just a few minutes, not wearing for long time).</li>
            <li>It is soft and the wig cap sorta fits my big fat head...</li>
            <li>And the cut was not tapered at all, solid and blunt right down to the ends.</li>
            <li>A truly professional business would send the correct product as soon as possible at no extra charge.</li>
            <li>If you wanted this for halloween or some other dressup event its fine, but for everyday wear, I dont recommend it</li>
            <li>, I did expect a bit more, but for the price I only really set myself up for disappointment.</li>
            <li>It fit over my thick long hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice wig for cheap.  </li>
            <li> Love this wig.</li>
            <li> It has a nice shine to it but not overly shiny as cheap costume wigs.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> and i love the length and style of the hair</li>
            <li> but it is an okay wig.....</li>
            <li> It is great and very durable.</li>
            <li> It look a lot better than I could have ever imagined.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and lovely, the color is great, and I love the bangs.</li>
            <li> Length is good, and color is a bright red.</li>
            <li> This was a very cool wig.  </li>
            <li> The synthetic fibers are soft and of great quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and is a great shade.</li>
            <li> If red hair looks good on your complexion (which it doesn&#x27;t on every1) give this wig a try!</li>
            <li> no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
            <li> Wig doesn&#x27;t tangle too easily, it&#x27;s soft, light, and easy to maintain and looks great.</li>
            <li> but after dealing with customer service I am very pleased with how things turned out...will be buying from this company again very soon</li>
            <li> Its was really nice looked so real !</li>
            <li> The color is a teensy bit lighter than it is in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually pretty nice.</li>
            <li> The hair is a beautiful shade of wine red, just as shown &amp; described.</li>
            <li> but it was fine.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> ...feels very comfortable and looks real!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed getting this fun style wig.</li>
            <li> also it is very shinnyyy!!!</li>
            <li> VERY WORTH THE WAIT.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like picture, doesn&#x27;t tangle or lose hair, overall very good wig.</li>
            <li> Came quick tangles easy</li>
            <li> This wig was dirt cheap and took only a couple weeks to get, which is really good since it came all the way from china.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and believable !</li>
            <li> True to color and length.  </li>
            <li> Its more curled than the photo and very hefty.  </li>
            <li> I got compliments all night and many thought it was my REAL hair.  </li>
            <li> iah like golin to the qwgs shop pcking out bgs full and s lkl,i nv as  lcl</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same good quality as the rest of Cool2Day&#x27;s wigs.</li>
            <li> it isnt as full as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> especially if worn with a good hat.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THE HAIR, ITS NOT TO THICK BEAUTIFUL COLOR, AND</li>
            <li> Its a true wine red color, and while I was hoping for more of a cherry red, this is still absolutely beautiful and very pretty wig.  </li>
            <li> Definitely reminds me of a perfect wine red.</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty and accurately shown.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more &amp;#34; red&amp;#34; in person which is just fine with me :) I suggest shaking it out ( or hit it on cool with a hair dryer)</li>
            <li> Good looking wig- a litlte thin in the back but very good for the price.  </li>
            <li> Great wig, just cut off a few inches</li>
            <li> but well worth the 8 bucks.</li>
            <li> The curls are really nice when they are brushed out</li>
            <li> it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brought its own hair net too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the bangs.</li>
            <li> right now its on my couch cant wear it</li>
            <li> Mine also came with a wig cap and a little package of bobby-pins, which was a nice surprise seeing as I lost all of mine!</li>
            <li> finally have it shaped up and suitable fornwear.</li>
            <li> All my friends just loved it The fun of being a spunky redhead without the damageto your natural hair (red is the harshest color u can dye your hair with)</li>
            <li> Like it very much, soft to touch, blows in lite breezy days like real hair, very comfortable regardless of time waiting for delivery</li>
            <li> The wig seems pretty high quality given how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> Because they are so cheap if I ruin one I just order a new one.</li>
            <li> I felt like this was a good wig but slightly less quality</li>
            <li> This is fun and looks pretty real if styled right.....</li>
            <li> The wig is very soft to the touch and is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I got this exactly when it said it would be in the mail, it even came with a wig cap too</li>
            <li> The hairs are really tangled and falling out, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> You know what you want, but it may not be exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the color.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE STYLE AND WINE RED, IF YOU HAVE MORE WINERED WIGS .I  </li>
            <li> The waves on mine were a bit more short and wavy than pictured</li>
            <li> the color is exactly as pictured....</li>
            <li> it looks like my real hair!</li>
            <li> not fake plastic shine Its a deep purple red color and looks amazing!</li>
            <li> It feels natural and light.</li>
            <li> Thick and managable and the color was great</li>
            <li> and i will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute wig, but the bangs are too short.</li>
            <li> This is overall a good wig, but it is RED!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a scalp condition which made me lose a bunch of hair hence my need for a wig, and its very hot weather where i live.</li>
            <li> And for such a fantastic price I&#x27;m definitely going to get more colors.</li>
            <li> (Out of the package it was pretty intense)</li>
            <li> loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head,</li>
            <li> I wear them full time and was very delighted at the above average quality considering the low price.</li>
            <li> is that in the back there is a spot that seems like (easily fixable with some styling, though)</li>
            <li> Hours later, i filled a whole wastebasket  with excess hair  </li>
            <li> and I was told today while wearing it that it looked extremely real.</li>
            <li> Not the color I was looking for but a really well made wig.  </li>
            <li> so brush it gently</li>
            <li> Very unprofessional business practice.</li>
            <li> for the price it just makes the whole thing a knockout.  </li>
            <li> It will help tremendously to fluff up the fibers and make it look more flattering.  </li>
            <li> real looks shinny but</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this wig.</li>
            <li> I really like this wig...</li>
            <li> My wig was not a wine red color but more of a pink/purple bright color with very slight red undertones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small to fit any adult head and the quality is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> The bang area was a little bit more shiny than the rest of the hair, but I assume that will go away after the first washing.</li>
            <li> i never expected something this good for such a low price!!!</li>
            <li> then the last one I bought from cool 2</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a dark purple blood like color.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this wig for people who want a nice, natural looking red haired wig.</li>
            <li> The color is little mermaid red but it looks really good</li>
            <li> I thought from the picture it would be more of a deep burgundy or auburn color, but it is red.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a really crappy wig for this price and was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t be happier and I would highly recommend buying this wig.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get them to swoop over, but I just cut them into straight bangs (that&#x27;s how I wear my hair naturally).</li>
            <li> I will reccommend this wigs to anyone who wants the professional look.</li>
            <li> It not bad, but not natural looking either.</li>
            <li> Rinse in cool water before wearing (and fluff/air dry -</li>
            <li> The cut is weird too as it makes my head on top and the sides look like they are huge.  </li>
            <li> It looks a lot more natural if its a bit messy..</li>
            <li> No one can tell it&#x27;s not my natural hair!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s so natural looking</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s better than overly thick to the point where you can&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Color was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> The red is much brighter and the bangs are different.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it&#x27;s kind of thin</li>
            <li> very well - most wigs are a little small</li>
            <li> I would reccomend for anyone looking for a vivid red.</li>
            <li> I feel so pretty with such long hair!</li>
            <li> Other than that it does not tangle easily like some of the other wigs I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Fit more like a Mullet wig.  :(</li>
            <li> The material looks cheap and the hair fall after a couple times of trying (just a few minutes, not wearing for long time).</li>
            <li> It is soft and the wig cap sorta fits my big fat head...</li>
            <li> And the cut was not tapered at all, solid and blunt right down to the ends.</li>
            <li> A truly professional business would send the correct product as soon as possible at no extra charge.</li>
            <li> If you wanted this for halloween or some other dressup event its fine, but for everyday wear, I dont recommend it</li>
            <li> , I did expect a bit more, but for the price I only really set myself up for disappointment.</li>
            <li> It fit over my thick long hair</li>
            <li> In due time I will get enough dry shampoo to make it decent enough to wear in public.</li>
            <li> The bangs are blunt and perfectly straight across the front, they were a little long, but we didn&#x27;t cut them.  </li>
            <li> i ordered the hair the only problem was the long wIt</li>
            <li> A little thin, but for the price it couldn&#x27;t be much better.</li>
            <li> This hair is cheap and fake</li>
            <li> The bangs were REALLY long</li>
            <li> The only gripe I have, in my opinion, is that I expected for it to be a bit longer as shown.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as long as the picture makes them out to be (unless I just have a gigantic head).</li>
            <li> Not recommended if you&#x27;re wearing it for a long period of time!</li>
            <li> bangs were LONG!  </li>
            <li> do not heat style or blow dry) to get rid of the \\&quot;just out of the package\\</li>
            <li> Some people got the actual color, and some people got some super crazy red color......</li>
            <li> I got this wig because I wanted a deep red one to wear out when I get tired of my short deep red hair.</li>
            <li> felt the blonde wig I bought was less prone to tangling and didn&#x27;t have any smell</li>
            <li> Be careful if you&#x27;re looking for a wig that&#x27;s this dark red.</li>
            <li> I even looked at the other pictures provided by other customers of them in their wigs and mine was not the same color as any images.</li>
            <li> I can only give a 4 out of 5 for this item because it was a little messed up when i got it....</li>
            <li> , it does not hold the style it was given and you cannot style it yourself as the hair is not real.</li>
            <li> but considering it came from china that length of time is to be expected.</li>
            <li> This wig came out just not like what  have expected.</li>
            <li> I just received this wig yesterday and it is not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The wig is all I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not REAL shiny like a doll&#x27;s hair would be.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a Poison Ivy costume and was blown away by the quality - I bought/have several others that pale in comparison.  </li>
            <li> the only complaint was it took so long to get.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care so much for the blunt bangs because they&#x27;re a little hard to style and have a tendency to hang INTO my eyes, but a little brushing</li>
            <li> And its still way thicker than what the pic shows and what was described in other customer rviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though as other&#x27;s have said.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a bit short, even though my forehead is small.</li>
            <li> A little snug, but I have very thick hair naturally.</li>
            <li> We looked at a few other wigs but decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li> Too bad - I like cool stuff I guess  I won&#x27;t be ordering from this vendor again .</li>
            <li> Just took a little work</li>
            <li> My daughter thinks it&#x27;s the little mermaids hair.</li>
            <li> I wore it a couple times for a mermaid costume, and the hair is getting a little tangled at the ends....</li>
            <li> The color looks like the color of Ariel&#x27;s hair from the Little Mermaid.  </li>
            <li> Started getting knotted and a little frizzy towards the end of the day though.</li>
            <li> When EVERY hair is in its place, it is a dead give away as a wig.</li>
            <li> I wear their wigs on a everyday basis.</li>
            <li> I got one with bangs that was sloppily cut and really short..</li>
            <li> It came in a black loose plastic bag by itself and not even a box which was a little weird</li>
            <li> cos its small on my head.</li>
            <li> The one i got is excessively  thick, wavy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Wore it for Storybook parade to be Fiona from Shrek.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied after about one month waiting...</li>
            <li> Wig cap is too small, wig is very shiny and fake looking, poor quality, difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> It does tangle a bit but not as bad as some other long wigs.</li>
            <li> but whatever at least it didnt take months.</li>
            <li> I had to go at it like crazy with scissors and thinning shears especially towards the ends to make it workable.</li>
            <li> and it looks incredibly fake because of the pink orange color.</li>
            <li> I was the hit of the parade!</li>
            <li> but this is not okay!</li>
            <li> But I assume the model is very small</li>
            <li> This is not good business practice.</li>
            <li> False advertising on the Sellers part and poor lack of effort to correct problem!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just looked weird on me for some reason.</li>
            <li> , This one had a weird almost gasoline smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> The $3.65 does me no good!!</li>
            <li> &quot; awkward bends and kinks.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with it since it looks terrible on my skin tone</li>
            <li> You sent me the wrong color!</li>
            <li> the Sea.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The quality kinda sucks,what with being painfully shiny.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the quality of this wig given it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed ...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the color.</li>
            <li> hair was mangled horribly in the bag and was falling out all over the piece.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t look especially fake either.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> if you can tell me how to go about the cap so i can be using it cos right now its on my couch cant wear it cos its small on my head.</li>
            <li> This wig was dirt cheap and took only a couple weeks to get, which is really good since it came all the way from china. It came in a black loose plastic bag by itself and not even a box which was a little weird but whatever at least it didnt take months. I was very impressed with the color, its a perfect gorgeous burgundy red tone. The synthetic fibers are soft and of great quality. Also comes with a nice mesh stocking cap. Scored an awesome buy, no doubt. However, i dont think what they sent me was same wig in this picture or in any of the review pics. The one i got is excessively  thick, wavy and heavy. And the cut was not tapered at all, solid and blunt right down to the ends. I have a scalp condition which made me lose a bunch of hair hence my need for a wig, and its very hot weather where i live. No way could i rock this massive Chaka Khan-like hairdo as it was without aggravating my scalp. I had to go at it like crazy with scissors and thinning shears especially towards the ends to make it workable. Hours later, i filled a whole wastebasket  with excess hair  finally have it shaped up and suitable fornwear. And its still way thicker than what the pic shows and what was described in other customer rviews. But now iit feels comfortable and looks killer! Just took a little work but well worth the 8 bucks.</li>
            <li> This was a very cool wig.  Wore it for Storybook parade to be Fiona from Shrek.  I was the hit of the parade!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more &amp;#34; red&amp;#34; in person which is just fine with me :) I suggest shaking it out ( or hit it on cool with a hair dryer) a couple times, put it on and then style it as you&#x27;re wearing it. It looks a lot more natural if its a bit messy.. When EVERY hair is in its place, it is a dead give away as a wig. This is fun and looks pretty real if styled right..... And for such a fantastic price I&#x27;m definitely going to get more colors. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE HAIR, ITS NOT TO THICK BEAUTIFUL COLOR, AND VERY WORTH THE WAIT. THE PRICE IS PERFECT. I JUST LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Agh! It looked more like Ariel than Wine. NOT what I was looking for! Good quality for the price, but the color didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed ... The picture shows longer bangs . I got one with bangs that was sloppily cut and really short.. It was inexpensive so I guess I got what I paid for... Too bad - I like cool stuff I guess  I won&#x27;t be ordering from this vendor again .</li>
            <li> Like it very much, soft to touch, blows in lite breezy days like real hair, very comfortable regardless of time waiting for delivery</li>
            <li> Nice I liked it the color is nice the length is awesome I really liked it nice wig ! !</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for. It not bad, but not natural looking either. It just looked weird on me for some reason. But looks ok on my daughter&#x27;s head. She is only 3.</li>
            <li> Great wig, just cut off a few inches and it was great. I would purchase again.  it took a while to get here but it was fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small to fit any adult head and the quality is very cheap. Not recommended if you&#x27;re wearing it for a long period of time!</li>
            <li> I got this exactly when it said it would be in the mail, it even came with a wig cap too so I did not have to go out and buy one. The quality is great too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely be ordering from here again!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a really crappy wig for this price and was pleasantly surprised!  Looks beautiful, great fit on my head, and no itching whatsoever!  I will buy more!</li>
            <li> Very soft and pretty. The perfect wine red colour and the curls at the bottom are elegant looking and I was told today while wearing it that it looked extremely real. Only problem is that it&#x27;s kind of thin but that&#x27;s better than overly thick to the point where you can&#x27;t care for it. So 5/5 stars!</li>
            <li> This hair is cheap and fake, it does not hold the style it was given and you cannot style it yourself as the hair is not real. The hairs are really tangled and falling out, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This wig was all tangled when it arrived. It needed to be trimmed and tamed before I could wear it.</li>
            <li> this is a really nice piece, thought it would easly get tangled and matted, it did not. love it you can see it on a model on  facebook/ourlovemagazine.</li>
            <li> I can only give a 4 out of 5 for this item because it was a little messed up when i got it....but after dealing with customer service I am very pleased with how things turned out...will be buying from this company again very soon</li>
            <li> Nice wig great quality surprisingly the cap is adjustable.</li>
            <li> The hair doesnt look like it does on the manican but the color is gorgeous:) i am happy i ordered the hair the only problem was the long wIt</li>
            <li> The wig is very soft to the touch and is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Its was really nice looked so real ! Came quick tangles easy but when you brush it it stays curled👍</li>
            <li> hair was mangled horribly in the bag and was falling out all over the piece.  bangs were LONG!  Fit more like a Mullet wig.  :(</li>
            <li> Well the picture is well and all, but damn this wig is RED! So red that I&#x27;m sittin&#x27; here at my laptop humming &amp;#34;Under the Sea.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The quality kinda sucks,what with being painfully shiny. It is soft and the wig cap sorta fits my big fat head... I will admit though, I did expect a bit more, but for the price I only really set myself up for disappointment. In due time I will get enough dry shampoo to make it decent enough to wear in public. But before ordering, imagine it&#x27;s like a slot machine... You know what you want, but it may not be exactly what you get. Some people got the actual color, and some people got some super crazy red color...... Eh.</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I have with this is that in the back there is a spot that seems like (easily fixable with some styling, though) Overall, I love the color. Definitely reminds me of a perfect wine red. The curls are really nice when they are brushed out (Out of the package it was pretty intense) The bangs were REALLY long and I couldn&#x27;t get them to swoop over, but I just cut them into straight bangs (that&#x27;s how I wear my hair naturally). The bang area was a little bit more shiny than the rest of the hair, but I assume that will go away after the first washing. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and will be buying more. Mine also came with a wig cap and a little package of bobby-pins, which was a nice surprise seeing as I lost all of mine!</li>
            <li> This is overall a good wig, but it is RED!!!!! I thought from the picture it would be more of a deep burgundy or auburn color, but it is red. It still looks good. Good quality wig for the price.</li>
            <li> Good looking wig- a litlte thin in the back but very good for the price.  Color was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> this wig was too reddish but the price was a steal I will try a different color. will recommend to others</li>
            <li> is a beautiful wig. love the color.  the only complaint was it took so long to get.  but considering it came from china that length of time is to be expected.</li>
            <li> loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head, no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
            <li> Not the color I was looking for but a really well made wig.  I would reccomend for anyone looking for a vivid red.</li>
            <li> This wig came out just not like what  have expected. The material looks cheap and the hair fall after a couple times of trying (just a few minutes, not wearing for long time). While trying to return the product, the international shipping became a big headache so it was kept just a a toy in my draw. Not satisfied after about one month waiting...</li>
            <li> I always order from &amp;#34;Cool2day&amp;#34;. I wear their wigs on a everyday basis. All of their wigs are a great quality. Because they are so cheap if I ruin one I just order a new one.</li>
            <li> I felt like this was a good wig but slightly less quality then the last one I bought from cool 2 day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt the blonde wig I bought was less prone to tangling and didn&#x27;t have any smell, This one had a weird almost gasoline smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still happy.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy these for myself persay.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to dismantle for rerooting my Bratzillaz Meygana doll.&lt;br /&gt;And it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though as other&#x27;s have said. It&#x27;s more of a dark purple blood like color. Like a mix of red and purple.</li>
            <li> i like the color. I thought it was longer in length. it looks wigy but i can work with it.it is truley red wine!</li>
            <li> I got this wig because I wanted a deep red one to wear out when I get tired of my short deep red hair. The wig I received is not read. It&#x27;s actually more of a  medium pink-red-orange. Very disappointed in the color. Not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with it since it looks terrible on my skin tone and it looks incredibly fake because of the pink orange color.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE STYLE AND WINE RED, IF YOU HAVE MORE WINERED WIGS .I  WOULD LIKE MORE OF YOUR WIGS.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed getting this fun style wig. Length is good, and color is a bright red. My daughter thinks it&#x27;s the little mermaids hair. The bangs are a bit short, even though my forehead is small. But it still a good do. Brought its own hair net too.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! It looks natural and believable ! For the price, I think it&#x27;s great. It gets tangled so brush it gently but over all I love it and would buy again ❤️ Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The wig I received was NOT the same as the one in the picture. The red is much brighter and the bangs are different. However, I gave 4 stars because I don&#x27;t dislike the wig I received. Be careful if you&#x27;re looking for a wig that&#x27;s this dark red.</li>
            <li> Nice wig for cheap.  True to color and length.  The waves on mine were a bit more short and wavy than pictured but that&#x27;s no such a problem for me.  It does tangle a bit but not as bad as some other long wigs.</li>
            <li> Love this! Don&#x27;t care so much for the blunt bangs because they&#x27;re a little hard to style and have a tendency to hang INTO my eyes, but a little brushing and they&#x27;re fine. Wig doesn&#x27;t tangle too easily, it&#x27;s soft, light, and easy to maintain and looks great. No one can tell it&#x27;s not my natural hair!</li>
            <li> The product I received was not the product shown in the picture. My wig was not a wine red color but more of a pink/purple bright color with very slight red undertones. I even looked at the other pictures provided by other customers of them in their wigs and mine was not the same color as any images. I contacted the seller and informed them of the mistake and was only offered a refund of $3.65. This is not acceptable!  Very unprofessional business practice. False advertising on the Sellers part and poor lack of effort to correct problem!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m sorry but this is not okay! I paid $7.29 (wig) + $22.00 (shipping/expedited)&#x3D;$29.29 total. To offer a refund of only $5.50 is unacceptable. Plus you actually only gave me a credit for $3.65. I understand you don&#x27;t think you should refund shipping costs but I only agreed to pay the additional shipping charge because I needed the wig in time for Halloween for my costume. You sent me the wrong color! Now I am out my money and still don&#x27;t have the correct wig. This is not good business practice. A truly professional business would send the correct product as soon as possible at no extra charge. The $3.65 does me no good!!</li>
            <li> I love this wig! I was not expecting something  so beautiful for this price. The quality is excellent. I would definitely purchase again and recommend. Please don&#x27;t hesitate to make this purchase....the color is exactly as pictured....just beautiful!</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my friend&#x27;s 30th birthday party! I loved it! it looks like my real hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s halloween costume, but it&#x27;s nicer than a costume wig.  The color is really pretty and accurately shown.  The bangs are blunt and perfectly straight across the front, they were a little long, but we didn&#x27;t cut them.  The cap inside has straps with hooks to adjust the size.</li>
            <li> Really beautiful wig...for the price it just makes the whole thing a knockout.  Purchased for a Poison Ivy costume and was blown away by the quality - I bought/have several others that pale in comparison.  Its a true wine red color, and while I was hoping for more of a cherry red, this is still absolutely beautiful and very pretty wig.  Its more curled than the photo and very hefty.  TIP:  Rinse in cool water before wearing (and fluff/air dry - do not heat style or blow dry) to get rid of the \\&quot;just out of the package\\&quot; awkward bends and kinks.  It will help tremendously to fluff up the fibers and make it look more flattering.  I got compliments all night and many thought it was my REAL hair.  Very awesome product.</li>
            <li> iah like golin to the qwgs shop pcking out bgs full and s lkl,i nv as  lcl the buggy nd keek on going and gking</li>
            <li> I love this wig I just received it today very quickly might i add! it feels real looks shinny but not fake plastic shine Its a deep purple red color and looks amazing! I had to trim the bangs alittle but nothing that you couldn&#x27;t do yourself. This is amazing and great for the price im going to be ordering more of these :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this wig. With wigs I feel you get what you pay for though. If you wanted this for halloween or some other dressup event its fine, but for everyday wear, I dont recommend it</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Love this wig. It&#x27;s soft and lovely, the color is great, and I love the bangs. A little thin, but for the price it couldn&#x27;t be much better. It fit over my thick long hair very well - most wigs are a little small but this one was comfy.</li>
            <li> The color is a teensy bit lighter than it is in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually pretty nice. The wig seems pretty high quality given how cheap it is. I feel so pretty with such long hair! And it doesn&#x27;t look especially fake either. I wore it a couple times for a mermaid costume, and the hair is getting a little tangled at the ends....but keeping in the price point, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> The hair is a beautiful shade of wine red, just as shown &amp; described. It&#x27;s the same good quality as the rest of Cool2Day&#x27;s wigs. It has a nice shine to it but not overly shiny as cheap costume wigs. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s so natural looking but it&#x27;s pretty great for the price. I totally recommend this wig for people who want a nice, natural looking red haired wig. The only gripe I have, in my opinion, is that I expected for it to be a bit longer as shown. But I assume the model is very small so that doesn&#x27;t bother me; the wig is still amazing~</li>
            <li> I just love it. It feels natural and light. It is not as wavy as in the picture, but it is beautiful anyway.</li>
            <li> Better than the ones you get in a Halloween store or party store! Thick and managable and the color was great</li>
            <li> i never expected something this good for such a low price!!! The color is little mermaid red but it looks really good and i love the length and style of the hair...feels very comfortable and looks real!! would buy from here again (^_^)</li>
            <li> this is such a great wig for a great price. the quality and the color is on point. you can wear this wig in different styles. i like to braid the hair to the side and have the bang going across. this wig is so awesome and i will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute wig, but the bangs are too short. They&#x27;re not as long as the picture makes them out to be (unless I just have a gigantic head).</li>
            <li> I just received this wig yesterday and it is not at all what I expected.  The color looks like the color of Ariel&#x27;s hair from the Little Mermaid.  The cut is weird too as it makes my head on top and the sides look like they are huge.  This makes for a great Halloween wig though.</li>
            <li> I tried the wig on. A little snug, but I have very thick hair naturally. The color is excellent and the curls are beautifully crafted. The wig is all I expected.</li>
            <li> very nice picture of the wig is all i can say</li>
            <li> Not as manageable as i would like for regular use but the color is brilliant It&#x27;s so fun being a red head If red hair looks good on your complexion (which it doesn&#x27;t on every1) give this wig a try! All my friends just loved it The fun of being a spunky redhead without the damageto your natural hair (red is the harshest color u can dye your hair with)</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like picture, doesn&#x27;t tangle or lose hair, overall very good wig. I am very pleased and do not regret getting this.</li>
            <li> great wig for the price! Got a ton of compliments. Started getting knotted and a little frizzy towards the end of the day though.</li>
            <li> Wig cap is too small, wig is very shiny and fake looking, poor quality, difficult to brush. Do not recommend, even for costume use</li>
            <li> hello, so i got my wig today and it wasnt what i thought...it isnt as full as i thought it would be. also it didnt have great waves like the pic did. also it is very shinnyyy!!! i am currently washing it and drying it and maybe after that it will be alright but it is an okay wig.....</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my wife for Halloween. It is great and very durable. We looked at a few other wigs but decided to go with this one. We couldn&#x27;t be happier and I would highly recommend buying this wig.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this wig, and the quality is great. I am not crazy about the bangs. I wish it were all one length. Other than that it does not tangle easily like some of the other wigs I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I liked it. It fits well. Great quality.</li>
            <li> This was a nice full good quality wig. I wear them full time and was very delighted at the above average quality considering the low price. Delivery time was very good as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this wig...especially if worn with a good hat.  My friends compliment it on me.  I would suggest this - especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this wig the color is amazing and I will order this wig in the future.  It look a lot better than I could have ever imagined.  I will reccommend this wigs to anyone who wants the professional look.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the quality of this wig given it&#x27;s price. I have a large head and this wig covers beautifully. Not a lot of hair fell out when I brushed it. It&#x27;s not REAL shiny like a doll&#x27;s hair would be. It&#x27;s soft and is a great shade. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
