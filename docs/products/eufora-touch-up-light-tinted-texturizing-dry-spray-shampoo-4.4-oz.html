            <li>Best way to prolong getting your retouch!</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be great for touchup between coloring</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>easy and looks great!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go...</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Quick and easy touch up with a perfect color match as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>and now my hair seems to be better.</li>
            <li>Like a lot of the euphora &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I do wish they had more of a color selection.  </li>
            <li>Great product, really saves me from getting hair done every 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>This is the best way I have found  to cover grey roots between salon appointments.</li>
            <li>It does a really good job of hiding gray at the scalp and it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of product to do it.  </li>
            <li>It is great for extending the time till the next color.  </li>
            <li>I lightly spray the root area and &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it with hair spray.  </li>
            <li>My hair is light auburn and since description said for blond to light brown hair</li>
            <li>A couple quick spurts and my scalp is covered and my hair looks thicker.</li>
            <li>use this product to cover the grey growth the last week before my color, very happy my sister told me about this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the tint on this product to get me by until the next color.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough spray to easily keep touched up between hair coloring or extend the life of a color job.</li>
            <li>I think I was using to much of it</li>
            <li>Spraying is much easier than those wands.</li>
            <li>Especially when you just need a quick cover up for your grays and you do not have time to color your hair</li>
            <li>My Wife owns a high end Hair salon and gets this for me.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to thicken up my receding Power alleys on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I order the light, but it is still a little darker than I would like.</li>
            <li>As far as the product</li>
            <li>/&gt;To direct it</li>

            <li> I have gone an extra 6 weeks without having my hair done - just a little touch up on the gray where it is showing through on the part with this</li>
            <li> Sprays outward can&#x27;t direct spray to small area  Eufora  firm mist shampoo.</li>
            <li> Be very careful.</li>
            <li> but IT COMES OUT DARK BROWN.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of euphoria products, this is the first one to fail to work at all!  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get on my pillowcase like other products did!!</li>
            <li> Wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking both greasy and yet frizzy and dry :(</li>
            <li> I can delay having my hair colored by at least two weeks with this product.  </li>
            <li> I also think the tint is a very weird color.</li>

            <li> I use a lot of euphoria products, this is the first one to fail to work at all!  It left my hair looking both greasy and yet frizzy and dry :(</li>
            <li> Use it to cover gray regrowth between color.  Works just great!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Covers all the bald spots on my scalp.  I love it!</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle sputtered all over my face, clothes !!! Looked like I had freckles!! Figures I had to get a defective nozzle.  As far as the product it&#x27;s okay.  My hair does feel thicker, but you can still notice that I sprayed my scalp!! I like that it doesn&#x27;t get on my pillowcase like other products did!!</li>
            <li> I had gastric bypass and my hair is thinning.  This product is amazing!  A couple quick spurts and my scalp is covered and my hair looks thicker. Best product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing for thinning hair.  It was a Godsend for me.</li>
            <li> Sprays outward can&#x27;t direct spray to small area  Eufora  firm mist shampoo. I don&#x27;t know what to do&lt;br /&gt;To direct it</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Especially when you just need a quick cover up for your grays and you do not have time to color your hair</li>
            <li> My Wife owns a high end Hair salon and gets this for me.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to thicken up my receding Power alleys on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Great Stuff to thicken hair, but noticed I was losing hair from using it so I stopped immediately and now my hair seems to be better. I think I was using to much of it but it definitely clogs the pores and will cause hair loss. Be very careful. They stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> use this product to cover the grey growth the last week before my color, very happy my sister told me about this product.  Her hairdresser told her about it.</li>
            <li> I have gone an extra 6 weeks without having my hair done - just a little touch up on the gray where it is showing through on the part with this and I&#x27;m good to go... easy and looks great!</li>
            <li> Like a lot of the euphora &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products the smell is overwhelming. I also think the tint is a very weird color.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product.  It is great for extending the time till the next color.  It does a really good job of hiding gray at the scalp and it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of product to do it.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I can delay having my hair colored by at least two weeks with this product.  It works for me!  I lightly spray the root area and &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it with hair spray.  I do wish they had more of a color selection.  I order the light, but it is still a little darker than I would like.</li>
            <li> This is the best way I have found  to cover grey roots between salon appointments. Spraying is much easier than those wands. However I wish it were non- aerosol.</li>
            <li> Love the tint on this product to get me by until the next color.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy touch up with a perfect color match as well. There&#x27;s enough spray to easily keep touched up between hair coloring or extend the life of a color job.</li>
