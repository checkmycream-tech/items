            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Pretty good wig for the price!!</li>
            <li>and i love it!</li>
            <li>Nice quality, nicely layered</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m in love with it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s damaged at the top</li>
            <li>but honestly I love it when I need to trim my Cosplay wigs.</li>
            <li>so much, it&#x27;s like, beautiful and full of layers..</li>
            <li>the best part: it came with a super cute key chain of a fish skeleton for I-don&#x27;t-even-know-</li>
            <li>Really easy to mess up and make tidy again, does whatever I want it to, and it was incredibly affordable.</li>
            <li>That was so sweet of them!</li>
            <li>It looks natural and it is really nice!</li>
            <li>shipped fast beautiful wig, very natural.</li>
            <li>This wig is also identical to a wig I paid $30 for of a different color which just goes to show it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very poofy, just make sure poofy is what you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is good quality, especially for the price, it&#x27;s just not what I was expecting to get and</li>
            <li>This wig arrived quickly (within 2 weeks), it arrived with a cardboard frame around its packaging, and the wig was turned inside out.</li>
            <li>A $15 wig on amazon of this quality is totally worth your money if you&#x27;re a beginning cosplayer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The netting inside is very nice quality like some of my more expensive wigs.</li>
            <li>I needed a spiky black wig kind of quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shaggy short hair, I was expecting a more medium length.</li>
            <li>It definitely needs styling; one problem i had was that the shorter hairs on top like to stick up as if theres</li>
            <li>Its not the most amazing wig in existence, but its certainly one thatll last a little while.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very realistic; it&#x27;s floppy like real hair and not stiff.</li>
            <li>Fit as described, and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li>Mine has the longer hairs curling up right above my shoulders.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very nice wig that ill definitely be using a couple times, thank you!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great wig, the only bad thing about it is that it can be a little bit shiny when in lots of light or on a camera with flash on.</li>

            <li> Its thick enough so that you dont see the netting, and only sheds a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> it also looks very natural with a little shine ^~^ I recommend this wig!!</li>
            <li> It needs a little bit of a trim but it came from China and only took 8 days to receive.</li>

            <li> it needs a little trim</li>
            <li> The hairs do go down over the neck though!</li>
            <li> Also it came with a wig cap, not to mention they also gave me a little gift !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my head, but the wig doesn&#x27;t look anything like what the pictures look like.  :(</li>
            <li> what I hate is..</li>

            <li> I needed a spiky black wig kind of quickly and I didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar. This wig arrived quickly (within 2 weeks), it arrived with a cardboard frame around its packaging, and the wig was turned inside out. This wig is also identical to a wig I paid $30 for of a different color which just goes to show it&#x27;s good quality. The netting inside is very nice quality like some of my more expensive wigs. A $15 wig on amazon of this quality is totally worth your money if you&#x27;re a beginning cosplayer. It came with a wig cap (I have a ton but I can always use more!) The hair is very soft, the layers are beautiful, and it&#x27;s perfect for spiking! Warning! it&#x27;s very poofy, just make sure poofy is what you&#x27;re going for. This wig needs a little trimming but it has plenty of length for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part: it came with a super cute key chain of a fish skeleton for I-don&#x27;t-even-know-what reason! I love it! It was instantly on my phone case!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Just like Hiro and can be used for Zuko as well.</li>
            <li> My mom ordered me this wig and it is the best wig ever and perfect for Hiro from Big Hiro 6</li>
            <li> I got this for my Hiro Hamada (Big Hero 6) cosplay and it was absolutely perfect! Really easy to mess up and make tidy again, does whatever I want it to, and it was incredibly affordable. SUPER happy!!!</li>
            <li> The images of this wig make it seem like it&#x27;s a little longer than what I received. It&#x27;s shaggy short hair, I was expecting a more medium length. I wish the measurements had been posted in the description. The wig itself is good quality, especially for the price, it&#x27;s just not what I was expecting to get and doesn&#x27;t quiet have the look I wanted.</li>
            <li> This wig was a little shorter than I expected but i&#x27;m in love with it &amp;#60;3 it also looks very natural with a little shine ^~^ I recommend this wig!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good wig for the price!! Its not the most amazing wig in existence, but its certainly one thatll last a little while. Its thick enough so that you dont see the netting, and only sheds a tiny bit. Don&#x27;t expect to wear it out of the box tho! It definitely needs styling; one problem i had was that the shorter hairs on top like to stick up as if theres static cling on them LOL. The hairs do go down over the neck though! Mine has the longer hairs curling up right above my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;A very nice wig that ill definitely be using a couple times, thank you!</li>
            <li> I love it, so much, it&#x27;s like, beautiful and full of layers.. what I hate is.. It&#x27;s damaged at the top, I think it&#x27;s heat.. Or something. It said it was heat resistance. I just wish it&#x27;d not been damaged. It worked great for my kankri cosplay. But the damage was a bit noticable</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Hak Son cosplay (Yona of the Dawn) and i love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my head, but the wig doesn&#x27;t look anything like what the pictures look like.  :(</li>
            <li> I used this wig for my sasuke cosplay and it&#x27;s honestly really good. Styling will take a lot of effort but it&#x27;s worth it. It has a lot of wefts, and this wig can even work for Yuichiro Hyakuya. I might buy another one, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> shipped fast beautiful wig, very natural.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, nicely layered</li>
            <li> Amazing! it needs a little trim but honestly I love it when I need to trim my Cosplay wigs. It looks natural and it is really nice! It doesn&#x27;t shed at all! Also it came with a wig cap, not to mention they also gave me a little gift ! That was so sweet of them! I will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> This wig has very high quality fake hair and it&#x27;s very realistic; it&#x27;s floppy like real hair and not stiff. It needs a little bit of a trim but it came from China and only took 8 days to receive. 10/10, buy this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great wig, the only bad thing about it is that it can be a little bit shiny when in lots of light or on a camera with flash on.</li>
            <li> This wig is great! I trimmed and styled it for my Kirito cosplay.</li>
