            <li>For a $7 toothbrush, I&#x27;m just happy to be able to brush my kids teeth.  </li>

            <li>good, cheap and useful, very good for gift to kids</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to hold, very cool looking toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my almost three year old!  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old  son loves it and knows how to operate it, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Getting any toddler to brush is a challenge, and a colorful electric toothbrush is a great tool to help.  </li>
            <li>Worked great right out of the box, but on switch/toggle broke after a week of use.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for more than 3 months, so i&#x27;m at a 50/50</li>
            <li>love cannot get in stores</li>
            <li>Works great yet gentle for me to brush my 1 year olds teeth.</li>
            <li>price is also ok.</li>
            <li>Using for my toddler who is refusing, for the most part, teeth brushing.  </li>
            <li>My children love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Kids love it</li>
            <li>I KNOW MY GRANDSON WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>My kids love Jake and the neverland pirates.</li>
            <li>We just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Bro</li>
            <li>The kids love using it as well so</li>
            <li>What more can you ask to make it easier to brush a kid in the morning...</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll be excited that he will want to brush his teeth many times a day!  :)</li>
            <li>I am glad I made the switch from manual to battery-powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Grandson will love it.</li>
            <li>My sons love it.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>This brush works great for my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>but it easy to just place on the tooth and just let this do the work.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and they rush to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>Had it for a couple of months and battery still going strong.</li>
            <li>Replaced it and good as new.  </li>
            <li>Fine otherwise.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought other characters before and are very happy that the kids get excited to brush their teeth with their favourite character.</li>
            <li>My children love them and they serve their purpose but the motor dies fairly quickly</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is easy for him to hold and not too heavy, and I give it 5 stars for being awesome.</li>
            <li>Perfect for any little Jake fan out there.</li>
            <li>Cute and colorful.</li>
            <li>and was very good comparing to other sites</li>
            <li>I love this for my 2 year old, the turn head of the toothbrush gets more brushing done when he doesn&#x27;t allow me to brush his teeth easily.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s much more willing to brush his teeth along with us after each meal.</li>
            <li>Son loves the toothbrush and makes him excited to brush his teeth which has always been a challenge.</li>
            <li>He is going to be so excited.</li>
            <li>was great while it lasted, son loved it, but don&#x27;t expect to last very long.</li>
            <li>This is just the right size that he can do it himself and he doesn&#x27;t fuss about having to brush his teeth, win-win!</li>
            <li>overall good purchase</li>
            <li>He loves his toothbrush &amp;#34;like mommy&#x27;s&amp;#34; and wants to use it more than twice a day.  </li>
            <li>We weren&#x27;t sure if he&#x27;d like the sensation of a powered toothbrush, so we did not want to spend too much money on a powered toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My son is fascinated with my electric toothbrush, but I am not interested in spending a ton of money on something he will grow out of and probably lose interest in, so I was happy when I found this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>He is still learning, so anything to try to make it fun, is worth trying!</li>
            <li>My kids love their new electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Works super for his sized mouth.  </li>
            <li>The lovely image, convenient operation, the boys and girls like it so much and are willing to brush teeth now.</li>
            <li>Kids are so funny!</li>
            <li>Long life, Good looking, battery operated which can be recharged / changed, very fast circular movement.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush but arrived with dead battery.  </li>
            <li>A simple timer function would be a nice addition, but again, not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>Better than a manual toothbrush by far</li>
            <li>He has a regular brush he likes to brush with on his own, and I sneek this in while he&#x27;s brushing</li>
            <li>The construction is good enough that they are ok after already being dropped on tile floor several times.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush for my son because he is a 2 yrs old who don&#x27;t like to brush his teeth,so we do get him to brush with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and works properly</li>
            <li>brush seems to do a better job of cleaning his teeth than the other toddler toothbrushes we&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s also held up better (a month of use now</li>
            <li>It helps clean his teeth better than a regular brush - recommend!!</li>
            <li>it works right out the box üëç</li>
            <li>I do wish the brush head was replaceable, but that would surely drive up the price, so I am willing to live with it as is, given that at least the battery is replaceable (I use rechargeable batteries with it and it works great).  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have powered toothbrushes, so naturally my 4 year old wanted his own.  </li>
            <li>All of my friends&#x27; kids like it very much.</li>
            <li>This works exactly as stated, we have no issues.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cleans his teeth really well!</li>
            <li>and he thinks it&#x27;s funny and let&#x27;s me get a few good brushes in.  </li>
            <li>First time I saw the toothbrushes so had to buy them.</li>
            <li>Great all-around, particularly for reluctant little tooth-brushers.</li>
            <li>Really good toothbrush to help little ones along who don&#x27;t brush very well yet, and the characters encourage them to want to.</li>
            <li>My son doesn&#x27;t enjoy brushing his teeth, and this cartoon, electric toothbrush adds enough fun to make the experience bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its not as good as a Sonicare, but my little boy loves it and will hold still long enough for me to get a good brushing in &amp; then he wants to do it himself too.</li>
            <li>My son is into Jake now &amp; loved this brush when it arrived so I usually don&#x27;t have a problem getting him to brush.</li>
            <li>It makes my son feel independent as he does the first brush on his own, and we know that it gets most of the built up from the day, and then we do a second brush making sure we reach the hard to get places.  </li>
            <li>Just wish the on/off buttons were easy enough for him to use.</li>
            <li>Head is a bit large for his mouth.</li>
            <li>,  our little boy wanted he&#x27;s own ..  </li>
            <li>I read reviews on other electric toothbrushes stating that they had similar problems, but this one seemed to get pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Perfect speed: fast and serious enough to be effective, but not so intense it scares off small children.  </li>
            <li>too much noise and shakeÔºåit</li>
            <li>I have the same brand/model but with the princess characters on it and that one works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier cleaning my twin toddlers teeth with electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference in their teeth.</li>
            <li>She actually WANTS to brush her teeth</li>
            <li>He flips out over using this toothbrush every day and wants to brush his teeth every night now too üòÇ</li>
            <li>I wanted to keep it at our house for sleepovers, but he really wanted to take it home with him</li>
            <li>Now in the mornings and evenings she asks to brush her teeth and really looks forward to it.</li>
            <li>Very good,my son loves it.</li>
            <li>A nice thing is that the round tip if the brush is easy to reach the backs of the mouth without having the child from opening their mouth too wide.  </li>
            <li>The motion is a little weaker than the Spinbrush I bought for my other son with Thomas &amp; Friends, but it still brushes great.</li>
            <li>When on, the brushes are supposed to move back and forth very quickly, but mine often barely spun.  </li>
            <li>My 2 and 4 year old use this toothbrush and their teeth are kept white and clean since the bristles brush all their teeth well and dont miss a spot.</li>
            <li>The brush head is the right size for her teeth and, given her imperfect brushing skills, definitely helps get her teeth cleaner than manual brushing.  </li>
            <li>But then again I got it for essentially free so no real complaints!  </li>
            <li>It might even be a little more sensitive on his gums because of it.</li>
            <li>We get new ones every six months, so</li>
            <li>Not gonna break the bank to buy a new one when the head wears out.</li>
            <li>and it still looks like new).  </li>
            <li>The head isn&#x27;t replaceable and I would certainly spend a little more to have this as an option instead of throwing the entire toothbrush in the garbage and getting a new one.</li>
            <li>The brush is a prefect size for little hands to easily grasp and the heads consist of round rotating bristles on top and standard non rotating bristles on bottom, the handle has an on and off switch made of a rubber material and a battery is included with every brush making it ready to use immediately.</li>
            <li>but my almost 1 year old son loves this thing.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 1 year old son.</li>
            <li>My son dislike brushing his teeth, as any 2 year old</li>
            <li>loves this toothbrush, making my life a whole lot easier, especially on mornings!&lt;br</li>
            <li>for boys only thanks</li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter loves this brush.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of getting one for my two-year old and she&#x27;s freaked out by it.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my 4 year old son.  </li>
            <li>We bought this for our 3.5 yr old for his stocking.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush fits well in 3 year old sons hand and mouth.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my 3 year old and he loves to use it.</li>
            <li>And my six year old loves it.  </li>
            <li>These were purchased for my 5 year old twins.</li>
            <li>I use this with all natural toothpaste and it works well for us.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a whole lot for the price, but I expected more than just a few weeks use.  </li>
            <li>Her teeth are clean and mommy is less stressed out!</li>
            <li>MY SON LOVES HIS NEW TOOTHBRUSH, HE HAS HAD IT FOR 6 MONTHS, USING IT AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE</li>
            <li>The head was a bit too small, getting me worried that my 3 year old would poke himself at the back of the throat, but he seems to manage it fine.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that after 2-3 months you have to throw it away because the head of the toothbrush is fixed</li>
            <li>so he can get use to using electric tooth brush so much better less work for your childs little hands.</li>
            <li>She ignored the other much more expensive gifts and carried this around the whole day.  </li>
            <li>The rotating half of the brush head rotates too fast and the overall size of the brush head is too big for a toddler mouth.</li>
            <li>Takes a little too much force.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A simple timer function would be a nice addition, but again, not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Better than a manual toothbrush by far</li>
            <li> He has a regular brush he likes to brush with on his own, and I sneek this in while he&#x27;s brushing</li>
            <li> The construction is good enough that they are ok after already being dropped on tile floor several times.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush for my son because he is a 2 yrs old who don&#x27;t like to brush his teeth,so we do get him to brush with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and works properly</li>
            <li> brush seems to do a better job of cleaning his teeth than the other toddler toothbrushes we&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s also held up better (a month of use now</li>
            <li> It helps clean his teeth better than a regular brush - recommend!!</li>
            <li> it works right out the box üëç</li>
            <li> I do wish the brush head was replaceable, but that would surely drive up the price, so I am willing to live with it as is, given that at least the battery is replaceable (I use rechargeable batteries with it and it works great).  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have powered toothbrushes, so naturally my 4 year old wanted his own.  </li>
            <li> All of my friends&#x27; kids like it very much.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as stated, we have no issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleans his teeth really well!</li>
            <li> and he thinks it&#x27;s funny and let&#x27;s me get a few good brushes in.  </li>
            <li> First time I saw the toothbrushes so had to buy them.</li>
            <li> Great all-around, particularly for reluctant little tooth-brushers.</li>
            <li> Really good toothbrush to help little ones along who don&#x27;t brush very well yet, and the characters encourage them to want to.</li>
            <li> My son doesn&#x27;t enjoy brushing his teeth, and this cartoon, electric toothbrush adds enough fun to make the experience bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not as good as a Sonicare, but my little boy loves it and will hold still long enough for me to get a good brushing in &amp; then he wants to do it himself too.</li>
            <li> My son is into Jake now &amp; loved this brush when it arrived so I usually don&#x27;t have a problem getting him to brush.</li>
            <li> It makes my son feel independent as he does the first brush on his own, and we know that it gets most of the built up from the day, and then we do a second brush making sure we reach the hard to get places.  </li>
            <li> Just wish the on/off buttons were easy enough for him to use.</li>
            <li> Head is a bit large for his mouth.</li>
            <li> ,  our little boy wanted he&#x27;s own ..  </li>
            <li> I read reviews on other electric toothbrushes stating that they had similar problems, but this one seemed to get pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Perfect speed: fast and serious enough to be effective, but not so intense it scares off small children.  </li>
            <li> too much noise and shakeÔºåit</li>
            <li> I have the same brand/model but with the princess characters on it and that one works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier cleaning my twin toddlers teeth with electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference in their teeth.</li>
            <li> She actually WANTS to brush her teeth</li>
            <li> He flips out over using this toothbrush every day and wants to brush his teeth every night now too üòÇ</li>
            <li> I wanted to keep it at our house for sleepovers, but he really wanted to take it home with him</li>
            <li> Now in the mornings and evenings she asks to brush her teeth and really looks forward to it.</li>
            <li> Very good,my son loves it.</li>
            <li> A nice thing is that the round tip if the brush is easy to reach the backs of the mouth without having the child from opening their mouth too wide.  </li>
            <li> The motion is a little weaker than the Spinbrush I bought for my other son with Thomas &amp; Friends, but it still brushes great.</li>
            <li> When on, the brushes are supposed to move back and forth very quickly, but mine often barely spun.  </li>
            <li> My 2 and 4 year old use this toothbrush and their teeth are kept white and clean since the bristles brush all their teeth well and dont miss a spot.</li>
            <li> The brush head is the right size for her teeth and, given her imperfect brushing skills, definitely helps get her teeth cleaner than manual brushing.  </li>
            <li> But then again I got it for essentially free so no real complaints!  </li>
            <li> It might even be a little more sensitive on his gums because of it.</li>
            <li> We get new ones every six months, so</li>
            <li> Not gonna break the bank to buy a new one when the head wears out.</li>
            <li> and it still looks like new).  </li>
            <li> The head isn&#x27;t replaceable and I would certainly spend a little more to have this as an option instead of throwing the entire toothbrush in the garbage and getting a new one.</li>
            <li> The brush is a prefect size for little hands to easily grasp and the heads consist of round rotating bristles on top and standard non rotating bristles on bottom, the handle has an on and off switch made of a rubber material and a battery is included with every brush making it ready to use immediately.</li>
            <li> but my almost 1 year old son loves this thing.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 1 year old son.</li>
            <li> My son dislike brushing his teeth, as any 2 year old</li>
            <li> loves this toothbrush, making my life a whole lot easier, especially on mornings!&lt;br</li>
            <li> for boys only thanks</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter loves this brush.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of getting one for my two-year old and she&#x27;s freaked out by it.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my 4 year old son.  </li>
            <li> We bought this for our 3.5 yr old for his stocking.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush fits well in 3 year old sons hand and mouth.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my 3 year old and he loves to use it.</li>
            <li> And my six year old loves it.  </li>
            <li> These were purchased for my 5 year old twins.</li>
            <li> I use this with all natural toothpaste and it works well for us.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a whole lot for the price, but I expected more than just a few weeks use.  </li>
            <li> Her teeth are clean and mommy is less stressed out!</li>
            <li> MY SON LOVES HIS NEW TOOTHBRUSH, HE HAS HAD IT FOR 6 MONTHS, USING IT AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE</li>
            <li> The head was a bit too small, getting me worried that my 3 year old would poke himself at the back of the throat, but he seems to manage it fine.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that after 2-3 months you have to throw it away because the head of the toothbrush is fixed</li>
            <li> so he can get use to using electric tooth brush so much better less work for your childs little hands.</li>
            <li> She ignored the other much more expensive gifts and carried this around the whole day.  </li>
            <li> The rotating half of the brush head rotates too fast and the overall size of the brush head is too big for a toddler mouth.</li>
            <li> Takes a little too much force.</li>
            <li> I am giving it three stars because it does actually clean teeth, but the design is poor.</li>
            <li> I love electronic toothbrushes for little kids as they do such a poor job of brushing.</li>
            <li> Batteries and bristles last a long time...</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time in it &amp; my son likes using it.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know how long it will hold up.  </li>
            <li> My son is really getting into brushing but can be a little rough with he brush head, so it is showing some wear after only a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I feel like his teeth are getting cleaner because he is excited about brushing his teeth now and usually uses it for at least 2 minutes while I am brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd mechanical toothbrush we&#x27;ve purchased for my son and it&#x27;s a little big for him.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t  bulky and fits in small hands, but it has taken several drops and generally feels sturdy.  </li>
            <li> My disappointment is in the fact that it states the product origin is USA, which I was so excited about I ordered two.  </li>
            <li> HE INTERCHANGES WITH HIS OTHER TOOTH BRUSH</li>
            <li> We just received this today and it appears to be just like any other power brush.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use it all the time (switch between other brushes)</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have noted, it&#x27;s a shame that we can&#x27;t replace the heads and will have to throw this out once the bristles wear out.</li>
            <li> She was initially scared of the vibration, but after a few uses, she loves it!</li>
            <li> For a mom who has been quite frustrated with attempting to brush her 2-year old&#x27;s teeth, this clever spinbrush has been a blessing!</li>
            <li> My son use it only a month, twice  daily , the brush head is broken.</li>
            <li> would, with conventional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> He just didn&#x27;t seem to get manual brushing down, so we thought we&#x27;d give him a little help with a battery operated one.  </li>
            <li> My little guy loves it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a few again.</li>
            <li> Batteries were dead on arrival.</li>
            <li> but I did have to change the batteries once without excessive use.</li>
            <li> There are several spots where mold can accumulate, so beware of how you store the brush and take a glance at it before your little one scrubs their mouth with mold. :(</li>
            <li> I really wish that wasn&#x27;t the case, because it seems awfully wasteful.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be used when you have a broken tooth.</li>
            <li> Needless to say i wasn&#x27;t going to brush my toddlers teeth with it</li>
            <li> We got this for my son who was having a difficult time getting all the plaque off his teeth.</li>
            <li> These brushes are expensive since you have to replace so often, but I guess we&#x27;re paying for the rights to the cartoons.</li>
            <li> So basically once the brush looks bad, I need to toss this.  </li>

            <li> This is the 2nd mechanical toothbrush we&#x27;ve purchased for my son and it&#x27;s a little big for him.  But then again I got it for essentially free so no real complaints!  It&#x27;s worked well for him, he loves turning it on and off.  I&#x27;m just hoping it lasts longer than the last one we bought in the store that only lasted a couple of months!</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> Well done ,and convenient</li>
            <li> This works exactly as stated, we have no issues. My 3 year old  son loves it and knows how to operate it, which is awesome. Recommended!!</li>
            <li> too much noise and shakeÔºåit can not be a kid&#x60;s toothbrushÔºåi worry about it wil hurt my kid&#x60;s tooth„ÄÇ</li>
            <li> Worked great right out of the box, but on switch/toggle broke after a week of use.  I have the same brand/model but with the princess characters on it and that one works fantastic.  I have had it for more than 3 months, so i&#x27;m at a 50/50 and that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> love cannot get in stores</li>
            <li> Works great yet gentle for me to brush my 1 year olds teeth. He won&#x27;t let me brush with a standard toothbrush but it easy to just place on the tooth and just let this do the work.</li>
            <li> I know this says for 3+, but my almost 1 year old son loves this thing.  He is teething, and I think this helps with it.  He uses it once a day without toothpaste (just water), and rubs it along his gums.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 1 year old son. Just as described. He loves it. Good price. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Its not as good as a Sonicare, but my little boy loves it and will hold still long enough for me to get a good brushing in &amp; then he wants to do it himself too.</li>
            <li> Getting any toddler to brush is a challenge, and a colorful electric toothbrush is a great tool to help.  My son is really getting into brushing but can be a little rough with he brush head, so it is showing some wear after only a few weeks.  The head isn&#x27;t replaceable and I would certainly spend a little more to have this as an option instead of throwing the entire toothbrush in the garbage and getting a new one.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> bought for my friedn,and the mother is satified for her son.</li>
            <li> My son dislike brushing his teeth, as any 2 year old would, with conventional toothbrushes. He would twist, turn and run away when that time came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves this toothbrush, making my life a whole lot easier, especially on mornings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans his teeth really well!</li>
            <li> my son loves it.so I ordered a few again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these a couple of times.  My children love them and they serve their purpose but the motor dies fairly quickly</li>
            <li> beware - you can not replace the brush head. Only one use device....</li>
            <li> very good my daughter liked it . and was very good comparing to other sites&lt;br /&gt;recommended for boys only thanks</li>
            <li> my toothbrush arrived with no plastic covering the bristles. Needless to say i wasn&#x27;t going to brush my toddlers teeth with it so i returned it.</li>
            <li> The head was a bit too small, getting me worried that my 3 year old would poke himself at the back of the throat, but he seems to manage it fine. The only improvement i can suggest is the ability to replace the head when the bristles are chewed up by my kid.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my almost three year old!  He loves brushing his teeth with &amp;#34;Jake&amp;#34;!  It helps clean his teeth better than a regular brush - recommend!!</li>
            <li> My kids love their new electric toothbrush! Only problem is that after 2-3 months you have to throw it away because the head of the toothbrush is fixed and you can not renew it.</li>
            <li> We got this for my son who was having a difficult time getting all the plaque off his teeth. He just didn&#x27;t seem to get manual brushing down, so we thought we&#x27;d give him a little help with a battery operated one.  The one thing I wish I knew before I got this is that although the battery can be changed, you cannot change the brush.  So basically once the brush looks bad, I need to toss this.  I really wish that wasn&#x27;t the case, because it seems awfully wasteful.  I am giving it three stars because it does actually clean teeth, but the design is poor.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are a favorite of my 2 and 3 year olds! The brush is a prefect size for little hands to easily grasp and the heads consist of round rotating bristles on top and standard non rotating bristles on bottom, the handle has an on and off switch made of a rubber material and a battery is included with every brush making it ready to use immediately. It&#x27;s a must have for any Jake fan!</li>
            <li> very good, both my son and my wife like it,</li>
            <li> It is so much easier cleaning my twin toddlers teeth with electric toothbrushes. I really notice a difference in their teeth. My son is into Jake now &amp; loved this brush when it arrived so I usually don&#x27;t have a problem getting him to brush. The motion is a little weaker than the Spinbrush I bought for my other son with Thomas &amp; Friends, but it still brushes great. It might even be a little more sensitive on his gums because of it.

            <li> Great toothbrush but arrived with dead battery.  Replaced it and good as new.  We get new ones every six months, so overall good purchase</li>
            <li> My son is learning how to brush his teeth, and he loves his electric toothbrush, just like mama&#x27;s and dada&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This brush works great for my 7 year old.  The brush head is the right size for her teeth and, given her imperfect brushing skills, definitely helps get her teeth cleaner than manual brushing.  I do wish the brush head was replaceable, but that would surely drive up the price, so I am willing to live with it as is, given that at least the battery is replaceable (I use rechargeable batteries with it and it works great).  A simple timer function would be a nice addition, but again, not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Mom and I have electric toothbrushes ..  as you may understand if you are reading this,  our little boy wanted he&#x27;s own ..  well now he have one and he&#x27;s much more willing to brush his teeth along with us after each meal.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter&#x27;s stocking for Christmas, she loved it!  She ignored the other much more expensive gifts and carried this around the whole day.  Kids are so funny!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter loves this brush.  She actually WANTS to brush her teeth so she can use her Jake toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These work great.  I made the mistake of getting one for my two-year old and she&#x27;s freaked out by it.  I thought she&#x27;d like it for the teeth coming it, but the vibrations make her nervous.  My son loves his though!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for any little Jake fan out there.</li>
            <li> loves brushing his teeth got 2 of them so he can get use to using electric tooth brush so much better less work for your childs little hands.</li>
            <li> Better than a manual toothbrush by far</li>
            <li> MY SON LOVES HIS NEW TOOTHBRUSH, HE HAS HAD IT FOR 6 MONTHS, USING IT AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE COS HE INTERCHANGES WITH HIS OTHER TOOTH BRUSH BUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD AND WELL MADE AND WORKING PERFECTLY TOO</li>
            <li> My husband and I have electric toothbrushes and my son, 2 1/2 tried to use one, but it was just too big.  This is just the right size that he can do it himself and he doesn&#x27;t fuss about having to brush his teeth, win-win!</li>
            <li> very cute looking toothbrush. very cute looking toothbrush. My kid loves it. My kid loves it. price is also ok. recommended.</li>
            <li> Works well. Did the trick and convinced my kid brushing isn&#x27;t torture. Just wish the on/off buttons were easy enough for him to use. Takes a little too much force.</li>
            <li> Using for my toddler who is refusing, for the most part, teeth brushing.  He has a regular brush he likes to brush with on his own, and I sneek this in while he&#x27;s brushing and he thinks it&#x27;s funny and let&#x27;s me get a few good brushes in.  Plus he likes to play with it.  Has worked great since we got it!</li>
            <li> I love electronic toothbrushes for little kids as they do such a poor job of brushing. I do wish the head can be replaced when the bristles start to get worn. There are several spots where mold can accumulate, so beware of how you store the brush and take a glance at it before your little one scrubs their mouth with mold. :(</li>
            <li> This is the only way my toddler will brush without a fight!</li>
            <li> The handle is too big</li>
            <li> My children love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Anything that helps longer toothbrushing is a good thing!  Kids love it and so do I!  I Would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Batteries and bristles last a long time...even when kids leave it on.</li>
            <li> Son loves the toothbrush and makes him excited to brush his teeth which has always been a challenge. Head is a bit large for his mouth.</li>
            <li> LOOKS GOOD‚Ä¶. I KNOW MY GRANDSON WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> We just received this today and it appears to be just like any other power brush.  My disappointment is in the fact that it states the product origin is USA, which I was so excited about I ordered two.  Upon receiving it I find it is actually made in China.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 4 year old son.  Works well.  Batteries last a long time in it &amp; my son likes using it.  Win :)</li>
            <li> The brush head not replaceable. My son use it only a month, twice  daily , the brush head is broken.</li>
            <li> 98% Of all of my toddlers belongings is jake and the neverland pirates. He flips out over using this toothbrush every day and wants to brush his teeth every night now too üòÇüòÇ it works right out the box üëç</li>
            <li> All of my friends&#x27; kids like it very much. The lovely image, convenient operation, the boys and girls like it so much and are willing to brush teeth now.</li>
            <li> My toddler now loves to brush. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Batteries were dead on arrival. Fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> My nephew loved it. The brush is sturdy and well constructed,</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 3.5 yr old for his stocking.  Now he LOVES to brush his teeth. It&#x27;s not a chore anymore!!!</li>
            <li> Really good toothbrush to help little ones along who don&#x27;t brush very well yet, and the characters encourage them to want to. Good price and does well.</li>
            <li> My kids love Jake and the neverland pirates. First time I saw the toothbrushes so had to buy them. We&#x27;ve bought other characters before and are very happy that the kids get excited to brush their teeth with their favourite character.</li>
            <li> sooooo cute excellent</li>
            <li> My little guy loves it.  Works great, easy to hold, very cool looking toothbrush.  I personally do not care at all that you cannot replace the head.  For a $7 toothbrush, I&#x27;m just happy to be able to brush my kids teeth.  Not gonna break the bank to buy a new one when the head wears out.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush fits well in 3 year old sons hand and mouth.  Looks good.  We don&#x27;t use it all the time (switch between other brushes) so don&#x27;t know how long it will hold up.  Had it for a couple of months and battery still going strong.</li>
            <li> My son loves Jake &amp; we got the Jake toothpaste too!  Perfect stocking stuffer!  He must brush his teeth 4-5 times a day now!</li>
            <li> Works well my child loves jake. It works oh so perfectly.  We just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Bro do you even lift?</li>
            <li> Got this for my 3 year old and he loves to use it. Says it tickles his teeth!!</li>
            <li> Loved the toothbrush but I did have to change the batteries once without excessive use.</li>
            <li> good, cheap and useful, very good for gift to kids</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> bought 2 of these for the kids...going on a month of use now, and works the same as day 1.</li>
            <li> My 2 and 4 year old use this toothbrush and their teeth are kept white and clean since the bristles brush all their teeth well and dont miss a spot. The kids love using it as well so brushing teeth is no longer a fight with the kids.</li>
            <li> Long life, Good looking, battery operated which can be recharged / changed, very fast circular movement. Can&#x27;t be used when you have a broken tooth.</li>
            <li> grandson loves this.  Works super for his sized mouth.  I wanted to keep it at our house for sleepovers, but he really wanted to take it home with him so he could use it every day.</li>
            <li> Head lasted about 6 months and had to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Perfect speed: fast and serious enough to be effective, but not so intense it scares off small children.  Cute and colorful. And my six year old loves it.  It isn&#x27;t  bulky and fits in small hands, but it has taken several drops and generally feels sturdy.  Great all-around, particularly for reluctant little tooth-brushers.</li>
            <li> I love this for my 2 year old, the turn head of the toothbrush gets more brushing done when he doesn&#x27;t allow me to brush his teeth easily. Dentist appt said we&#x27;re doing a good job. I&#x27;d recommend this for toddlers.</li>
            <li> My son loves it. Does what it does. Brushes his teeth with his fav. character in front. What more can you ask to make it easier to brush a kid in the morning...</li>
            <li> The motor on this doesn&#x27;t work well.  I read reviews on other electric toothbrushes stating that they had similar problems, but this one seemed to get pretty good reviews.  When on, the brushes are supposed to move back and forth very quickly, but mine often barely spun.  If I shook the whole brush vigorously, the spinning would sometimes go faster for a few seconds, leading me to believe it&#x27;s a wiring/connection problem.  Replacing the batteries didn&#x27;t help.  I didn&#x27;t expect a whole lot for the price, but I expected more than just a few weeks use.  Stick with a manual toothbrush for your kids.  No need to fill the landfill with junk like this.</li>
            <li> My 4-year-old son LOVES Jake. I can&#x27;t wait to give this great toothbrush to him for Christmas. He is going to be so excited. And I&#x27;ll be excited that he will want to brush his teeth many times a day!  :)</li>
            <li> My son is fascinated with my electric toothbrush, but I am not interested in spending a ton of money on something he will grow out of and probably lose interest in, so I was happy when I found this electric toothbrush.  He loves Jake and the Neverland Pirates, so that made this tooth brush a no-brainer.  He loves his toothbrush &amp;#34;like mommy&#x27;s&amp;#34; and wants to use it more than twice a day.  I feel like his teeth are getting cleaner because he is excited about brushing his teeth now and usually uses it for at least 2 minutes while I am brushing my teeth.  The toothbrush is easy for him to hold and not too heavy, and I give it 5 stars for being awesome.</li>
            <li> My son doesn&#x27;t enjoy brushing his teeth, and this cartoon, electric toothbrush adds enough fun to make the experience bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush seems to do a better job of cleaning his teeth than the other toddler toothbrushes we&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s also held up better (a month of use now and it still looks like new).  As some other reviewers have noted, it&#x27;s a shame that we can&#x27;t replace the heads and will have to throw this out once the bristles wear out.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have powered toothbrushes, so naturally my 4 year old wanted his own.  We weren&#x27;t sure if he&#x27;d like the sensation of a powered toothbrush, so we did not want to spend too much money on a powered toothbrush.  Hence, the Oral-B option is wonderful.  It makes my son feel independent as he does the first brush on his own, and we know that it gets most of the built up from the day, and then we do a second brush making sure we reach the hard to get places.  A nice thing is that the round tip if the brush is easy to reach the backs of the mouth without having the child from opening their mouth too wide.  Thank you for the product!</li>
            <li> My kids are loving this toothbrush to pieces! They want to brush their teeth every time they eat something so they can feel the movement of the bristles in their mouth. I am glad I made the switch from manual to battery-powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The rotating half of the brush head rotates too fast and the overall size of the brush head is too big for a toddler mouth.</li>
            <li> These were purchased for my 5 year old twins. They are so easy to manipulate. The construction is good enough that they are ok after already being dropped on tile floor several times.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush for my son because he is a 2 yrs old who don&#x27;t like to brush his teeth,so we do get him to brush with this.</li>
            <li> My child loves this toothbrush, when I can get him to brush his teeth. He is still learning, so anything to try to make it fun, is worth trying!</li>
            <li> For a mom who has been quite frustrated with attempting to brush her 2-year old&#x27;s teeth, this clever spinbrush has been a blessing! She was initially scared of the vibration, but after a few uses, she loves it! Now in the mornings and evenings she asks to brush her teeth and really looks forward to it. I use this with all natural toothpaste and it works well for us. Her teeth are clean and mommy is less stressed out!</li>
            <li> was great while it lasted, son loved it, but don&#x27;t expect to last very long.</li>
            <li> Grandson will love it.</li>
            <li> My son loves this toothbrush!! Going to purchase the princess one for my daughter too.</li>
            <li> My sons love it. I got one for each of them. It is easy to use and they rush to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and works properly</li>
            <li> Too big for a kids tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it, brushing more.</li>
            <li> Very good,my son loves it.</li>
