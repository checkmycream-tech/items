            <li>Love being able to see the color on the model&#x27;s hands before purchasing.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a coral.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>pretty color, good quality polish</li>
            <li>Awesome color, just as expected.</li>
            <li>OPI makes the best nail polishes, I would not use any other polish.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty color and for summer it is a nice change....</li>
            <li>fantastic colour.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really a true coral, that&#x27;s what I was going for...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great pink for summer!</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li>It does require two coats but the end product is pretty!</li>
            <li>&amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I got it right away</li>
            <li>nice long wearing polish.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the color is cute and lasted about a week.</li>
            <li>Goes a little more hot pink than coral on me, but still super cute on my toes!</li>
            <li>I am learning that OPI products are pure quality, and at reasonable prices!</li>
            <li>The color is more hot pink than it is coral as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>They are real OPI.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter.</li>
            <li>Ok so this is PINK</li>
            <li>Item as described, fast postage.</li>
            <li>I really like this color.</li>
            <li>Love OPI polishes, but I think I was expecting more of a raspberry tint with a little shimmer than a bright-flat pink for the &amp;#34;Suzi&#x27;s Hungary Again&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li>It looks nothing like the pretty coral color shown in the picture, however, it is a pretty pink color.</li>
            <li>Way more pink than I expected.  </li>
            <li>A little lighter than the shade presented but as the bottle was extremely hot from shipping when it arrived, Im not sure whether the lighter color is accurate or due to extremely high temperatures during shipment.  </li>

            <li> Great price and shipped fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not the pink I was looking for. I&#x27;ll probably give it away.</li>
            <li> Love OPI polishes, but I think I was expecting more of a raspberry tint with a little shimmer than a bright-flat pink for the &amp;#34;Suzi&#x27;s Hungary Again&amp;#34; color. Overall, the color is cute and lasted about a week.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be such a bright and happy color.
