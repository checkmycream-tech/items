            <li> I love this brand of nail liquid. My nails last about 3 weeks without lifting. With other brands, my nails would usually start lifting after a week! I also use the CND acrylic powder so that may help as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for acrylics.</li>
            <li> As always CND makes the best acrylic nail products. Worth the price to get a perfect professional look</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s what I wanted. I got what the seller advertised. No bait and switch. No problem with shipping.  Price was great. I&#x27;m 100% happy with the seller and product.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! With the CND acrylic and primer, there is virtually no lifting! my clients love it!</li>
            <li> This Retention+ liquid requires the retention+ powder.  Outstanding product when used as directed.  Love it!! Cant go wrong with any CND products. Highly recommended. 5++</li>
            <li> This product is the really deal perfect size and provided me with the quality I needed. My nails look lovely.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Have used this product for years.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. product as described.</li>
            <li> It was sealed and is a good product.</li>
            <li> great product. the only one I trust and use.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best monomer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have loved this stuff for years, and it&#x27;s still the best. It doesn&#x27;t yellow or crystallize as long as it&#x27;s protected from contaminates. It doesn&#x27;t need a primer, so you spend less time working on the nails. Not only that, it holds on better than product that requires primer! My hat&#x27;s off to CND.</li>
            <li> let me start by saying the product works for its intended use.  I&#x27;ve used it many times as a nail tech and salon owner,&lt;br /&gt;However my problem is with the seller...  on the website it was described as a 16 oz .CND liquid for the price I paid and when it actually arrived it was 8 oz of that same liquid..  THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING ON STEROIDS</li>
            <li> The best ever ...good quality if only offered in 32 oz i would  buy . Very pleased n happy</li>
            <li> This was received in a timely manner and was as described.</li>
            <li> i will forever use CND monomer. i love this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s purple.  If you use clear powder, it leaves a funny tint.</li>
            <li> Awesome liquid for acrylics. Easy to apply, long lasting and no lifting. Will buy again when it runs out!</li>
