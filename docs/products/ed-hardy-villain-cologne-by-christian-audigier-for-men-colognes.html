            <li>&gt;:]  A++++</li>
            <li>This smells ok by itself.</li>
            <li>(Another Ed Hardy cologne and one of my favorite)</li>
            <li>I got many compliments mixing the two colognes together.</li>
            <li>And it lasts for a while, so the citrus top notes stick with you for a while.  </li>
            <li>, go with Ed Hardy Love and Luck.  </li>
            <li>I have worn both, and get more compliments when I wear Love and Luck.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many colognes from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Ed Hardy Villain is in my top 5.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments from others when I wear this.</li>
            <li>Also, I am so happy with how fast I recived my order.</li>
            <li>Love this a lot.  </li>
            <li>Great value fast shipping</li>
            <li>Love this smell.  </li>
            <li>I liked it because it was a clean smell.....</li>
            <li>Smelled Pretty Good To Me.</li>
            <li>I recommend a sample first as it does not smell good on all skin types.</li>
            <li>I smelled it at the store and figured it smelled pretty good</li>
            <li>A+ Got my favorite cologne at a great low price!</li>
            <li>Shipping box was fine</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and it&#x27;s just the smell I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Ed Hardy products for men are worth buying and seem to have a better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>When I saw that they had this cologne here for 40 bucks cheaper with free shipping, I thought why not?</li>
            <li>I ordered this with another Ed Hardy cologne, fantastic price, not an imposter, and delivered overnight .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light and seductive for all occasions.</li>
            <li>I dont really think its all that great alone but mixed with Love &amp; Luck</li>
            <li>When I found out that they didn&#x27;t have the original cologne I wanted there, I figure I&#x27;d search around here to find it.</li>
            <li>The scent is unique.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to find a bottle this large for so cheap.</li>
            <li>I bought the male and female versions of this brand because they both smell awesome.</li>
            <li>super price for a name brand product.</li>
            <li>Packaged well, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I Own The Female Version Of This Scent</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;Big bottle and cheap price&lt;br /&gt;Smell last most of the day</li>
            <li>you like Ed Hardy, and are looking for something more mature</li>
            <li>I think the scent is better, is more consistent, and lasts just as long.  </li>
            <li>And for the price, it was completely worth it.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time and  I enjoyed the new Sense of the cologne.</li>
            <li>will be ordering more as gifts to other for sure.</li>
            <li>It also came in a very large quantity.  </li>
            <li>I first smelled this product at a Macy&#x27;s for a quick second and pleasantly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Nice but not as unique as the Love and Daggers and the other one with similar bottle design.  </li>
            <li>sometimes the samples smell better than the full bottles for some strange reason.</li>
            <li>Its comes in a fun tin can and has a plastic thing on the top of the actual bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  long lasting and the price was great.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like this the first time I smelled it in the mall, but I bought a travel pack of three different Ed Hardy colonges and this smell alot better after you have it</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>if you didn&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The top notes when it first go on smell like orange blossom (which smells just like Fruit Loops), and they are very present.  </li>
            <li>Can keep the date straight now!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Timex!</li>
            <li>When I wore it for the first time I noticed it has mellow sweetness to it.</li>
            <li>Fruity and sweet but masculine.</li>
            <li>The product came as described and seems to be the real deal.  </li>
            <li>This was the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for any one who wants to save on a premium item</li>
            <li>spray too much it is concentrated.</li>
            <li>Ed Hardy has several nice smelling colonges that are relatively inexspensive</li>
            <li>while in no way the price is comparable to Pacco Rabanne&#x27;s One Million (love that immensely) to me this fragrance has that equally distinguishable level of sophistication and charm.</li>
            <li>It smells super sugary and musky at the same time, and the smell makes me nauseous.</li>
            <li>Very Classy!  </li>
            <li>Comes Out Hard, But Softens Down With A Nice, Sweet, Mellow Smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Young man&#x27;s scent, like Fruit Loops young.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend for the young and the old.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cologne after looking in all of the local stores where I live.  </li>
            <li>It smells great for casual affairs but doesn&#x27;t last as long as i would like it to.</li>

            <li> buy it if you want and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Ive been wearing this for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Big Enough For Everyday Use.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> If you last through that, the base notes are very nice left behind, sandalwood and cedar come through and stick around for a while.  </li>
            <li> i only bought this because i was desperate for cologne since i was running low on my normal supply.</li>
            <li> I have other Ed Hardy colognes...</li>
            <li> Found this product for $30 less than Walmart.</li>
            <li> I Knew I Would Find It Here For Half The Price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I only smelled it for a second in store, but now that I&#x27;ve actually smelled it on me, it smells bad.</li>
            <li> Not Sure Which One Im Going To Give It</li>
            <li> and I know that I cannot go wrong with Ed Hardy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PERFECT for Casual Use!</li>
            <li> Fake, it smells like crap...</li>
            <li> Buy it, you will not be disappointed, I promise!</li>
            <li> It smells terrible.</li>
            <li> The Price Was Outrageous!</li>

            <li> smells like the sample I had and was a great price when I bought it. sometimes the samples smell better than the full bottles for some strange reason.</li>
            <li> The product came as described and seems to be the real deal.  The cologne smells okay, but would choose love and luck over this one. I would buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> I Own The Female Version Of This Scent So I Purchased As A Gift For Dad or Boyfriend. Not Sure Which One Im Going To Give It To Yet But I Smelled It Before Wrapping &amp; It Smelled Pretty Good To Me. Can&#x27;t Argue With The Price For The Size Of The Bottle!</li>
            <li> the container was severely banged up when it was received.  Shipping box was fine so it must have been sent this way.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves how it smells and so do I. It&#x27;s  long lasting and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely fashion great product</li>
            <li> Came in time and is one of my favorites :)</li>

            <li> I liked it because it was a clean smell.....if you didn&#x27;t use too much! It isn&#x27;t a memorable aroma, but it will do.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and besides the amazing smell, the price is unbeatable. I give this product 5 stars based on not only its quality but the insanely low price. Buy it, you will not be disappointed, I promise!</li>
            <li> Good clean scent. Fruity and sweet but masculine. Would recommend to others. I had seen this cologne for sale before for about 30 dollars so I was very excited to find a bottle this large for so cheap. I ordered and received it in about a week</li>
            <li> I bought the male and female versions of this brand because they both smell awesome. I actually combine them together for a unisex fragrance I call &amp;#34;Super Villain.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that smells great ! Ed Hardy products for men are worth buying and seem to have a better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cologne.  The smell is great and it last for a long time.  My grandson smelled it and now I will have to get him a bottle.</li>
            <li> bought 3 of these already... because other&#x27;s were impressed with the awesome scent.. while in no way the price is comparable to Pacco Rabanne&#x27;s One Million (love that immensely) to me this fragrance has that equally distinguishable level of sophistication and charm. love it love it love it... would unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone. will be ordering more as gifts to other for sure.</li>
            <li> super price for a name brand product. I recommend it for any one who wants to save on a premium item</li>
            <li> Found this product for $30 less than Walmart. Great price! Walmart advertised the 1 oz for $25.00ish and found this one for the same price but for a 4.6 oz bottle! You cannot beat that! My Husband loved it and he smells delicious! &gt;:]  A++++</li>
            <li> Always great service and the real genuine product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on this scent! I recommend a sample first as it does not smell good on all skin types.</li>
            <li> i only bought this because i was desperate for cologne since i was running low on my normal supply. I decided to risk buying Villain by Ed Hardy off of amazon. Its comes in a fun tin can and has a plastic thing on the top of the actual bottle. This smells ok by itself. I dont really think its all that great alone but mixed with Love &amp; Luck (Another Ed Hardy cologne and one of my favorite) it smells great! I got many compliments mixing the two colognes together. This cologne by itself smells sort of like cookies. buy it if you want and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Young man&#x27;s scent, like Fruit Loops young.  The top notes when it first go on smell like orange blossom (which smells just like Fruit Loops), and they are very present.  And it lasts for a while, so the citrus top notes stick with you for a while.  If you last through that, the base notes are very nice left behind, sandalwood and cedar come through and stick around for a while.  That&#x27;s where you will get the compliments on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Ed Hardy, and are looking for something more mature, go with Ed Hardy Love and Luck.  I think the scent is better, is more consistent, and lasts just as long.  I have worn both, and get more compliments when I wear Love and Luck.  I would like to try Hearts and Daggars soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he loves it!!</li>
            <li> I am always getting attention from women saying how well I smell. They like it and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked all the Ed Hardy fragrances I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great,  Getting it for almost half the price was awesome.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this product at a Macy&#x27;s for a quick second and pleasantly enjoyed it. When I found out that they didn&#x27;t have the original cologne I wanted there, I figure I&#x27;d search around here to find it. When I saw that they had this cologne here for 40 bucks cheaper with free shipping, I thought why not? It smells terrible. Maybe it&#x27;s because I only smelled it for a second in store, but now that I&#x27;ve actually smelled it on me, it smells bad. It smells super sugary and musky at the same time, and the smell makes me nauseous. Since I&#x27;ve already used it, I can&#x27;t return it back to Amazon, I&#x27;m stuck with 4.2 ounce of cr*p smelling cologne. DON&#x27;T BUY.</li>
            <li> I Smelled This Cologne In A Department Store. In Macy&#x27;s, It Was $69.99. The Price Was Outrageous! I Knew I Would Find It Here For Half The Price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I Paid $34 For This Cologne. It .. Is .. Beautiful! Comes Out Hard, But Softens Down With A Nice, Sweet, Mellow Smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT for Casual Use! Big Enough For Everyday Use.&lt;br /&gt;Buy It .. You Wont Regret It.</li>
            <li> Nice but not as unique as the Love and Daggers and the other one with similar bottle design.  Good light day fragrance in my opinion..</li>
            <li> Great product smell great and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Dont spray too much it is concentrated.</li>
            <li> Ive been wearing this for a long time now. It smells great for casual affairs but doesn&#x27;t last as long as i would like it to.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves the stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many colognes from Amazon. Ed Hardy Villain is in my top 5. The scent is unique. I get so many compliments from others when I wear this. I ordered this with another Ed Hardy cologne, fantastic price, not an imposter, and delivered overnight .&lt;br /&gt;All my friends wear this.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this cologne for a gift she liked The way it&#x27;s smeled. I tried it for the first time and  I enjoyed the new Sense of the cologne. I would recommend this Cologne to anybody That does not like a overpowering Cologne.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband for Christmas. I  hope he like it. Also, I am so happy with how fast I recived my order.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome gift for guys. The cologne smells great and the packaging is fun too. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Fake, it smells like crap... Literally!</li>
            <li> Very Classy!  Love this a lot.  Can keep the date straight now!  Like my T2H381 a lot too!  Thanks Timex!</li>
            <li> Perfect Xmas gift! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne after looking in all of the local stores where I live.  Amazon had this for a fraction of the price... and it smells great. My wife loves when I wear it, so I know I made a good decision.  I have other Ed Hardy colognes... and I know that I cannot go wrong with Ed Hardy.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and it&#x27;s just the smell I was expecting. And for the price, it was completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local retailer for around the same price. I smelled it at the store and figured it smelled pretty good so I bought it. When I wore it for the first time I noticed it has mellow sweetness to it. Gave it to my sister.</li>
            <li> Great value fast shipping</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, I get a lot of nice feedback on the cologne, fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li> A+ Got my favorite cologne at a great low price! Packaged well, arrived quickly. Will definitely use you again!</li>
            <li> Love this smell.  A lot of people compliment me and ask what it is.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a christmas gift and he gets compliments from men and women! It is light and seductive for all occasions. I would buy it again from this seller when he runs out. Ed Hardy is the best cologne for my husband and your man too!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling fragrance for the price.  It also came in a very large quantity.  I&#x27;d recommend for the young and the old.</li>
