    <ol>
            <li>PERFECT for in between teeth.  </li>
            <li>The best tooth &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; out there</li>
            <li>This is one of the best Dental Products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best scrubber for your teeth!</li>
            <li>Great just as advertised .</li>
            <li>This a great item.</li>
            <li>Very effective</li>
            <li>These things are amazing.</li>
            <li>After trying all the go-betweens and in-betweens and little christmas tree brushes,  I find these are the best for a good cleaning and for removing food particles.</li>
            <li>Love them and will continue ordering.</li>
            <li>These are nice...wish they were a bit more sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I could no longer purchase these at the local King Soopers, so was very happy to see they were available via Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>easily remedied by taking it easy.  </li>
            <li>I got these Scrub Betweens from the dentist and in my experience they are sturdier than the Easy Brushes, which have a metal wire that tends to bend.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those really tight places between teeth.</li>
            <li>These are fabulous for cleaning on the go</li>
            <li>Nothing much to complain about --the transaction went smoothly, was delivered on time, and the product is the best I&#x27;ve used so far--it seems the bristles are more sturdy than the previous ones I used which were made of a softer material.</li>
            <li>cons, they bend super easy</li>
            <li>And when my Dentist praised me for how clean areas were</li>
            <li>I will sometimes use these instead of flossing, or in conjunction with flossing for a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>THEM FEEL CLEAN AFTER YOU BRUSH.</li>
            <li>but if you are gentle/ careful with them then they work great.</li>
            <li>pretty great, actually.</li>
            <li>My dentist actually asked me what I had been doing because my teeth were looking so good.</li>
            <li>Really removes food particles and handle is built better than the Gum line,</li>
            <li>so luckily you get a ton of them because I probably go through 3 or 4 everytime</li>
            <li>The scrubbing end has a sort of gripping quality to it without causing any discomfort, which is the reason it cleans better than other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I knew I was using the right product.</li>
            <li>It can get into areas that keep your teeth cleaner because the tiny bristles of the brush scrub away plaque better.</li>
            <li>just take your time when using this at first until your gums build up to it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li>although I do recognize there are certain things floss</li>
            <li>Got a whole bunch</li>
            <li>These are reasonably priced and work well.</li>
            <li>The do a much better job cleaning between teeth than other dental scrub picks that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I like these a lot better than the picks sold under other brands.</li>
            <li>I cannot get the same clean.</li>
            <li>The giant package you get from amazon is a better deal than buying them individually from the store.</li>
            <li>I was buying this product at a local store until it became unavailable in stores and only available online.</li>
            <li>very soft while getting in there (so to speak).</li>
            <li>This product is inferior to the ones I was buying in the store even though it is the same exact product.</li>
            <li>These small dental picks are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Simply gently push the little brushes between your teeth.</li>

            <li> PERFECT for in between teeth.  Love them and will continue ordering.</li>
            <li> The best tooth &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; out there</li>
            <li> After trying all the go-betweens and in-betweens and little christmas tree brushes,  I find these are the best for a good cleaning and for removing food particles. I abhor using floss and prefer these scrub-betweens any day. . . . although I do recognize there are certain things floss can do that these can&#x27;t do, like getting below the gum line.  The scrubbing end has a sort of gripping quality to it without causing any discomfort, which is the reason it cleans better than other products I&#x27;ve used.  I did find it necessary to be gentle, or the tip can be a little sharp and you can poke yourself . .  easily remedied by taking it easy.  Got a whole bunch and my husband now prefers these to toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I could no longer purchase these at the local King Soopers, so was very happy to see they were available via Amazon Prime.  The do a much better job cleaning between teeth than other dental scrub picks that I have tried.  They are 5 star in my book.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Mother who has very small gaps in between her teeth. She swears by them and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Dental Products I have ever used. It can get into areas that keep your teeth cleaner because the tiny bristles of the brush scrub away plaque better. And when my Dentist praised me for how clean areas were I knew I was using the right product. I have used Dentek Scrubs for quite a while but hard to find in the stores. Amazon always has what I need.</li>
            <li> Great just as advertised . I had been using them prior to finding them on Amazon</li>
            <li> These things are amazing. My dentist actually asked me what I had been doing because my teeth were looking so good. Some people have complained that these bend but if you are gentle/ careful with them then they work great. Simply gently push the little brushes between your teeth. I will sometimes use these instead of flossing, or in conjunction with flossing for a deeper clean. The giant package you get from amazon is a better deal than buying them individually from the store.</li>
            <li> This a great item. I even recommended them to my dental hygenist. They don&#x27;t bend like the brushes do between the teeth. and the deal with Amazon cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> I preferred them when they were purple rubber scrubby things.  These new GreenMicroScrubbyGumTicklerThingyBobs are sorta crap in comparison.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous for cleaning on the go and I have a lower glued in retainer.  cons, they bend super easy so luckily you get a ton of them because I probably go through 3 or 4 everytime</li>
            <li> These are nice...wish they were a bit more sturdy.  It gets in-between my braces&#x27; nooks and crannies.  Lettuce especially is a hard one to get untangled from the wire...this has tiny bristles that make a quick job of cleaning every difficult food, reaches every angle.  Some say that it&#x27;s rough on gums...just take your time when using this at first until your gums build up to it.  I never had a problem.  The tips have a rough, fuzzy coating and a spiral underneath to capture and hold what needs to be cleaned.  I have a supply of these in my brace&#x27;s arsenal pack.</li>
            <li> GETS IN BETWEEN MY TEETH AND GETS  THE FOOD OUT AND SCRUBS THE TEETH IN  BETWEEN MAKES  THEM FEEL CLEAN AFTER YOU BRUSH.</li>
            <li> I was buying this product at a local store until it became unavailable in stores and only available online. This product is inferior to the ones I was buying in the store even though it is the same exact product. The pics break, bend, the bristles come off and it is more difficult to use them I cannot get the same clean. they cause trauma to the gums which should not happen and did not happen when I was using the ones bought from the store.they are packed the same they look the same but they are not the&lt;br /&gt;same quality as the store bought ones. My daughter-in-law is a dental hygienist and she agrees with my complaints of this product. She recommended the use of these to her patients and is now researching The product before continuing to recommended to her patients.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot better than the picks sold under other brands. Not  quite as flexible as some but that&#x27;s no problem for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to complain about --the transaction went smoothly, was delivered on time, and the product is the best I&#x27;ve used so far--it seems the bristles are more sturdy than the previous ones I used which were made of a softer material.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unuseable as a dental pick, it cuts my gums.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it.  I wonder if it&#x27;s meant for another use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Cleans between spaces without abrasiveness.</li>
            <li> I got these Scrub Betweens from the dentist and in my experience they are sturdier than the Easy Brushes, which have a metal wire that tends to bend. I have a tooth bridge I need to get underneath, and a receding gumline behind a moler so I need to floss after every meal, and I like these a lot! Very effective and I think these are a bit cheaper, too. (Less garbage, too, without the plastic cap)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these anywhere else. Perfect for those really tight places between teeth. Carry them around in my briefcase, too.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended dental picks at a recent appointment. These are reasonably priced and work well. I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
            <li> pretty great, actually. the only picks i can use. very soft while getting in there (so to speak). also not exorbitantly priced.</li>
            <li> Best scrubber for your teeth! Really removes food particles and handle is built better than the Gum line,</li>
            <li> These small dental picks are comfortable to use. I keep them with me all the time, and my friends always ask for them!</li>
