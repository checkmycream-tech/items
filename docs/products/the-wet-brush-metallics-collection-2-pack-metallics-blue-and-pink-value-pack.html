            <li>These brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing brush&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>She says the brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I even use it now on my own hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine every buying another kind.  </li>
            <li>In fact it combed through my hair so effectively and painlessly that I couldn&#x27;t believe that my tangles were gone.  </li>
            <li>These are absolutely the best brushes ever.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I have these in my car,  purse,  beach bag,  and all of the kids have their own.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have any problems brushing the tangles out of her own hair now.  </li>
            <li>Best brush I have, really helps with detangling.  </li>
            <li>Now they brush their own and the us</li>
            <li>but some how they manage to not hurt when they go through tangles and still manage to brush your hair effectively.</li>
            <li>Own four of these.</li>
            <li>This two pack allows them to each have their own.</li>
            <li>The packaging made sure the product arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush set so each of my daughters could have their own brush.</li>
            <li>I remember well my own mother ripping through the tangles, bottles of No-More-Tangles</li>
            <li>With these brushes, the kids brush their own hair every morning.</li>
            <li>but I just found it amusing that after I found these online accidentally, they appear in Toys R Us.</li>
            <li>And the metallic colors are nice too.</li>
            <li>The bristles are flimsy and they are not as effective in detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Best brush ever for those with sensitive scalp or snarls !!!</li>
            <li>I bought the frist one at a salon and was excited to learn that AMAZON sells them!!</li>
            <li>look cheap, but they&#x27;re amazing!</li>
            <li>i saw the good reviews and decided to go for it, and im more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Brushes work great; quick delivery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had battles with hair brushing for years, my girls now insist on doing it themselves with these very easy to use brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also VERY light, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Love how they don&#x27;t snag at knots and makes hair real smooth for blow drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Great purchase for kids (and adults) with fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>and wow, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li>- they work best in the shower but do a good job dry as well.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>, of course, I ran to Amazon to buy one and was so happy to find I could get a 2-pack at a very reasonable</li>
            <li>My girls can even brush their own hair easily after a shower and get the tangles out.</li>
            <li>My 2 granddaughters love having their own specially colored brushes, though!</li>
            <li>Loved at first use!</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll review what the brush is like, once I&#x27;m able to USE them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using them, if I&#x27;m able to and if the smell comes out.</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t magic or powered by &amp;#34;nano technology&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>These brushes are magic.</li>
            <li>Works fabulous!</li>
            <li>Great brush, I LOVE it, thanks</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re officially my daughters favorite hairbrush.</li>

            <li>My daughters (6 and 8) do not complain when I brush their hair with this one.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would say that they don&#x27;t yank tangles because the bristles seem to be a bit more flexible, so they give instead of pull.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes and they manage to remove a lot of lint from my hair (eww).</li>

            <li>and we have tried so many hair brushes that we end up throwing away.  </li>
            <li>I must work from the bottom to the top -</li>
            <li>And they are not in a drawer tucked away but out on a counter top exposed to air.</li>
            <li>My two oldest daughters love these brushes</li>
            <li>My brush from dollar tree is actually better and has a better quality handle as well.</li>

            <li>Help my tween more easily care for her own very sensitive head!</li>
            <li>Hands down best brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>They looked fine despite the packing job, but the SMELL out of the box and ON the brushes, was like they&#x27;d been in a smoker&#x27;s household or salvaged from a housefire.</li>
            <li>Does incredibly well on dry hair too</li>
            <li>These works just fine</li>
            <li>I have a lot of baby fine curly hair...</li>

            <li>This brush is very gentle on my hair and would recommend it to anyone I loved it so much I bought 4</li>
            <li>but with this brush it brushes right thru it and untangles it-- its amazing and a good buy for long hair</li>

            <li>So worth the money!</li>

            <li>I thought it was original U.S. products.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Cheep Brush Set, Came Apart The First Day, Returned, Ordered Better Brush.</li>

            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>These work great on my daughter&#x27;s long hair</li>
            <li>There is nothing visibly unique about it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had long hair and finding a good detangling brush was never an easy task.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as the original only sparkly.</li>
            <li>Best on wet hair but also amazing on dry hair.</li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>These brushes glide right through our hair without pulling!</li>
            <li>I have stick straight, baby fine hair that rats up easily and</li>
            <li>It is a great brush for easing the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of detangling your wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Brush works great on wet and tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>works great on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>They are soft, and nicely shaped.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush and loved it so much, I bought three more for my teenage girls.  </li>
            <li>Even more upsetting to think that these brushes are being foisted off on unsuspecting purchasers as the real thing.</li>
            <li>It does the same job as any good brush does.  </li>
            <li>and I kept one in my room for myself because we love them so much.</li>
            <li>Cool colors too.</li>
            <li>so I checked Amazon and got a 2-pack for $12.95 and free shipping because I am an Amazon Prime Member (also worth every penny).</li>
            <li>THE BEST BRUSHES FOR KIDS WITH DELICATE SCALPS.</li>
            <li>The reviews are really true.</li>
            <li>Best brush for thick wavy hair .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about these</li>
            <li>Makes brushing me hair so much easier and leaves my hair feeling silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>it is a good brush that should last a while.</li>
            <li>But every time I replace the old one with a new one I am amazed all over again how great the brush is.</li>
            <li>Love love love the wet brush!</li>
            <li>The issue I&#x27;m having is that they smell pretty strongly...</li>
            <li>This is my second personal brush I have bought for myself because I love it so much, I also got one for my mom and best friend.</li>
            <li>originally bought this from my hairdresser for $13.95 and thought it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>they leave my hair full of static, don&#x27;t work so awesome as others had said in their reviews... not true!!!!!</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best brushes for little tender heads.  </li>
            <li>They have earned loyal fan for life.</li>
            <li>Brushes arrived so quickly and they were well packaged.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my daughter who has a lot of hair and super curly.  </li>
            <li>Quick ship (amazon prime).</li>
            <li>Luckily, the smell wears off after time.</li>
            <li>It sure helps with my new found curly hair and at my age my right foot grew, I need all her smiles!  </li>
            <li>I tried the wet brush on a whim, and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>The wet brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>Bought these two for my parents after falling in love with my own wet brush!  </li>
            <li>Not a miracle, but definitely better than a normal hairbrush you would buy at a retail store.  </li>
            <li>The metallic color is also very pretty.  </li>
            <li>so you may have to brush their hair a number of times more than the normal brush.</li>
            <li>Perfect solution for weak, colored and fine hair ( that exactly what I have).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought them as gifts for 2 young girls with very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>They really make it easy to get through the tangles.</li>
            <li>but mine is straight and hers is curly and gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>Gift to grand daughters with long hair and don&#x27;t want anyone touching hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s said to do!</li>
            <li>These are the first hairbrushes that don&#x27;t hurt my daughters while I brush their hair!  </li>
            <li>they were happy to get their own and these do work well getting the tangles out of long wet hair.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how easy it is to brush my wet hair with these brushes, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have long, fine hair which tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>Made brushing my processed fine hair after a shower much faster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a life saver when brushing my 2 year old&#x27;s hair, but warning it does have a plastic smell that is very strong when it first arrives.</li>
            <li>I feel this product is probably ideal for parents who have to brush their children&#x27;s&#x27; hair, since you cant tell when you might be tugging too hard.</li>
            <li>Gets through my wet long baby fine hair with amazing speed and no damage! !</li>
            <li>I could see how young girls would love the variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the brush is well worth it.</li>
            <li>good for wet hair.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the investment</li>
            <li>This is my second order of Wet Brushes, they work incredibly well!  </li>
            <li>This is a good hairbrush for wet hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It controls the most wild and knotted hair no problem.</li>
            <li>I was ready to cut my daughters hair off because of all the tangles that would take so much time and so many tears brush out.  </li>
            <li>Now they brush their hair on their own, allow me to brush when necessary</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>You need to make sure you move your hair around and brush out the layers of your hair because the Wet Brush is flexible and won&#x27;t get all the knots out if you just brush the top layer of hair.</li>
            <li>TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>Every person with hair to be brushed should own this product.</li>
            <li>Quite frankly, leaving the View, I gave it a 10% chance of success.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t needed to help my 7 year old brush through her morning tangled hair since she started using this, and many tears have been avoided as a result.</li>
            <li>I would say its worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have children and dread brushing their hair full of knots!</li>
            <li>Works good on dry hair too!!</li>
            <li>I have been using these on my two girls&#x27; hair with very positive results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine brush, but honestly does not seem special to me and does not work any better than other brushes I have that look similar.</li>
            <li>I bought the 2 pack (one for me and one for my daughter) due to the good reviews.</li>
            <li>problem is that the product arrived in a box without any padding for the brushes, just the packages the brushes would come in, right off the shelf.</li>
            <li>Went right through mine and my daughter&#x27;s tangles.  </li>
            <li>I would rate this brush 5 stars coming right out of the box.</li>
            <li>If you have any tangles in your hair, buy this right now.  </li>
            <li>This brush goes right through my hair without any pulling or pain.</li>
            <li>Goes right through the tangles in one stroke with no pulling or breakage.</li>
            <li>For brushing long wet hair this brush is the best.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really nothing special for me.</li>
            <li>Excellent for brush childrens hair, wet or dry, they can brush by themself</li>
            <li>Excellent product on wet and dry hair!</li>
            <li>This brush not only doesn&#x27;t hurt when brushing through even huge tangles, but eliminates the static that normally comes with paddle brushes!</li>
            <li>This brush is awesome, especially if you have little girls..</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my young niece who has a tender head and hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I have long fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best brushes that pull the least on my two daughters hair.</li>
            <li>Got these for my two granddaughters that have naturally curly, easily tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>We have long, fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has SUPER thick hair and is always a struggle to brush, these have been amazing!</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair very much and yet it gets out the tangles.  </li>
            <li>Love these brushes, waited my whole life to find a brush that combs through my wet hair easily.</li>
            <li>The tangles come right out  when wet and does a very good job when dry  </li>
            <li>Both my husband and daughter have long, wavy hair that knios and tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>After that I just kept brushing because the brush has long bristles w/ little balls on the end that feel great on your scalp!  </li>
            <li>but so far we love them and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Works amazing for wet tangly hair</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>My grand daughter no longer cries or fights getting her haired brushed after I bought this for my daughter in law to try.</li>
            <li>that probably makes sense to the ladies reading this ;)</li>
            <li>They really help with tangly hair!  </li>
            <li>she tries to take mine even though she has her own...</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it the first night.  </li>
            <li>We only had to buy more because of a lost brush.</li>
            <li>It cuts through tangles like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>last week, since I&#x27;ve been using the brushes, I have had so many people compliment my hair and tell me they never knew my hair was so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So first let me tell you</li>
            <li>Please be aware -</li>
            <li>It has helped with knots and such with no pain!  : )  </li>
            <li>The ease of brushing my hair wasnt exactly a shocker.</li>
            <li>This brush really does the trick!</li>
            <li>but my grand daughter HATES to have her hair brushed.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li>I love these brushed.  </li>
            <li>and it worked better since I was using it on smaller sections of hair and, again, it did not pull/hurt when I had to brush through a tangle</li>
            <li>since bought them as gifts and have raved about them to other families who have all purchased the brushes and love them too!</li>
            <li>Just be aware.)</li>
            <li>Works great on my daughters short hair, not so much on my long hair.</li>
            <li>This brush has made my life so much easier!  </li>
            <li>Love the brush although I can&#x27;t figure out why it is so different from others....</li>
            <li>My girls don&#x27;t love their hair brushed - until this brush!  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle brush for you or your kids!</li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>It definitely works better on the finer hair.</li>
            <li>These brushes seem to be doing nothing at first</li>
            <li>The whole family likes it!</li>
            <li>Prices were pretty comparable</li>
            <li>The first brushes that don&#x27;t hurt to use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thinning and it tangles more than when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>they really work!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them to everyone!!</li>
            <li>I first was introduced to the brush at my salon.  </li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t get it, because it just seems like a regular brush with more pliable bristles, but I am a believer.</li>
            <li>First, my sister used it after a shower.  </li>
            <li>and this was unnerving at first.  </li>
            <li>i have super long hair that gets easily tangled</li>
            <li>I have long, curly, fine hair (and lots of it!).  </li>
            <li>They are colorful, sturdy and run through my hair just great, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>It detangles my hair wet or dry, and leaves it smooth after a fair number of strokes.</li>
            <li>For my nieces … fine for their needs … have super long hair …works for them.</li>
            <li>When I was ready to head to work, I&#x27;d simply brush the top and the ends of my hair and balled it up in a bun.  </li>
            <li>They are a little better at brushing through wet hair and that is good for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Cut through knots with fair ease and cause very little stress on the hair for my daughter during brushing.  </li>
            <li>I just had no idea, at the time, how positive that feedback would be!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am normally a HUGE fan of these wet brushes and I own several of them.  </li>
            <li>granddaughters both have long hair and they love these brushes because they made brushing their hair</li>
            <li>3 girls in the house with long hair and all 3 of us just love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes I won one at a bridal shower and thought it was a strange gift.</li>
            <li>I use nice fragrance products (e.g. leave-in conditioners) in my hair, only to be accosted by this smell as I brush it - or even if applying makeup or putting in contacts in the general area!</li>
            <li>I dont understand how a seemingly normal brush can go right through snarls and knots as if they were never there.  </li>
            <li>ok for dry</li>
            <li>The best ever hairbrush i&#x27;ve ever used on my 3 granddaughters who have long thick hair  </li>
            <li>Works great for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>These brushes work great on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>they work great on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li>They work great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>and it works great wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>and it works great on wet or dry</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and it works great for both wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It works great on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It works fine as a regular brush</li>
            <li>I bought a total of ten and would love to buy another 10 to give away to friends and family!</li>
            <li>It works fine as a regular brush</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My whole life I have struggled with knotted curly hair.  </li>
            <li>is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I now don&#x27;t have to use any conditioner or detangler in my hair thanks to this brush.</li>
            <li>Very upsetting that I have to hassle with a return.  </li>
            <li>both of my granddaughters have looong hair which gets very tangled in the shower.  </li>
            <li>really pays to read and compare product before you spend your money</li>
            <li>Now she brushes her hair with no fuss, both in the shower and any time she wants with no pain.  </li>
            <li>All because of the too much ironing.</li>
            <li>and I was really upset that it stunk of cigarette.</li>
            <li>this has made my daughters hair much nicer looking it is not spliting as much</li>
            <li>anymore she is much happier</li>
            <li>but it is very misleading that it is supposed to be a detangling brush.</li>
            <li>because I am very tender headed</li>
            <li>She is 12 and loves it; it really helps with her knotts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how to Express how much my family loves these brushes.</li>
            <li>They both really love these wet brushes.</li>
            <li>fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>These work very well to get tangle out without too much pulling.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo/Condition then section out hair and gently brush from ends up.</li>
            <li>I have a very tender scalp and am growing my hair out (longer than ever).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This helped so much with the frizz.</li>
            <li>really good&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>I felt like I was going bald because of how much hair I was pulling out.</li>
            <li>It was an absolute chore to brush her hair each day.  </li>
            <li>Thank you, magic Wet Brush.</li>
            <li>Every time she comes to my house now she wants to take my brush home with her.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My niece would refuse to brush her hair because it hurt so much.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tangle and pull on their hair even when straight out of the pool.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>These brushes have made it so much easier.</li>
            <li>They really work to take out knots.</li>
            <li>I saw it advertised on a health show and it really helps tangled hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I &amp; my daughter have a very tender scalp.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Elsie</li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it is very misleading that it is supposed to be a de-tangling brush.</li>
            <li>Both my kids -- one with curly hair, one straight</li>
            <li>Really, who&#x27;d a thought?</li>
            <li>Kids can be very picky</li>
            <li>Far fewer strands pulled out when de-tangling freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li>They really work.</li>
            <li>Goes through fairly smooth compared to a regular brush that would get stuck at every night.  </li>
            <li>We were very sceptical that it could deal with her hair.  </li>
            <li>These are great for thin hair as they don&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li>Note that the points are very flexible</li>
            <li>Gentle, they take the angst our of hair brushing.</li>
            <li>This brush really works.</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>POst shower, I used it and agreed with my sister that you really feel like it&#x27;s just floating over the hair.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t necessary as my hair was, in fact, free of tangles.  </li>
            <li>This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>My oldest daughter has mixed hair, and she can actually do her own hair in the morning with these.  </li>
            <li>Probably takes a few more passes to get deeper into the hair, but still worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the magic, looks like a normal brush but brushing long hair is a breeze.</li>
            <li>I loved the one I received as a gift initially, which introduced The Wet Brush to me.  </li>
            <li>One of them actually kept coming back because she liked the scalp massage it gives.  </li>
            <li>Next time I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it, was after washing my hair, and I was able to brush through my mass of usual tangles so easily!</li>
            <li>Her hair is very wavy and tangles easily wet or dry, this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son who has long curly hair that mats easily.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this brush for my granddaughter who has long hair that tangles easily - won&#x27;t purchase this again</li>
            <li>My hair is long and gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>No detangler required, and it works better than any other brush.</li>
            <li>so I was beyond excited when my stylist used this brush on my hair during my last salon visit.</li>
            <li>Both my girls like them much better than any other brushes we have tried.</li>
            <li>No more tears for sure!  </li>
            <li>Now Excited my daughter finally.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t untangle any better than her other brushes</li>
            <li>They look like many other brushes out there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still wondering how and why is it that this hair brush works better than all other hair brushes I&#x27;ve ever tried before...</li>
            <li>Still, to be sure, I felt the need to take one of my other hair brushes through it.  </li>
            <li>If you have thin long hair, this is the perfect brush for you.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>And the amazing this was I lost very little hair.  </li>
            <li>Wet or dry, these brushes feel good in their hair.</li>
            <li>A friend told me it was fantastic on long, tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how smoothly it went through my hair and left it so soft!  </li>
            <li>(she would go days without running as much as her fingers through normally)</li>
            <li>In a house full of girls, these are the only brushes my daughters will let me brush their hair with.  </li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers about the odor, it is like a diesel smell and very strong when you first open the packaging, however it did not leave the odor in my hair and after about a month the odor is almost gone.</li>
            <li>so I can have one for home and give one to my new stylist to try!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that snags easily with combs and other brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price on Amazon is amazing for two of them as I paid almost the same for one wet brush at my salon.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but these really do work great</li>
            <li>A good friend told me about this brush and how it only took a few strokes to get through a tangled head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Awesome brush to detangle wet thin hair.</li>
            <li>They work great for my hair and for my poor old dog&#x27;s hair as well...</li>
            <li>This brush is so gentle and magically combs thru my hair in a few strokes.</li>
            <li>I have the biggest tangled mess on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tear your hair,  very soft but gets the tangles out!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have tangly hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those who have that problem.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought them for my little granddaughters too and they really love them.  </li>
            <li>Also, some of the little beads at the top started to come off, making the bristles scratch your scalp</li>
            <li>this brush, I can completely untangle all my hair within minutes!!  </li>
            <li>so i wanted to invest in something a little bit more then a minimum cost hair brush.</li>
            <li>Still makes the other daughter more willing to sit and have her hair brushed, however!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely like a hot knife going through butter, I didn&#x27;t believe it until it worked for my hair!</li>
            <li>My little girls love them.</li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t exactly work like I thought it would and doesn&#x27;t glide as easy as it apparently does on other people.</li>
            <li>My oldest daughter is 16 and wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m also ordering a few more for myself to stockpile)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great brush for long thick hair.</li>
            <li>The brush is great for tangles, specically that my hair is very long and thick.</li>
            <li>I bought these to go in my office at work and in my gym bag and each kid has their own wet dry brush</li>
            <li>I have long super tangly hair</li>
            <li>We use it both for wet hair and it works amazingly well on dry hair too!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stress free on my hair and combs through tangles without breakage like other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I live with them and am like their nanny.</li>
            <li>We had a tangle teezer brush before and it worked Ok, but was hard to hold onto when I was brushing their hair; it doesn&#x27;t have a handle and eventually the bristles didn&#x27;t get through the tangles very well</li>
            <li>Ok as a dry brush but made me very nervous the way it was pulling on my wet hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick, straight hair and LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li>Hairbrush is fine,but has a odd ,strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li>My long hair gets so tangly, and this brush helps so much!!</li>
            <li>The first few Wet Brushes I purchased were awesome, but this set was not the same as my previous purchases.</li>
            <li>Leaves it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Ok, I fell for the promise this brush was somehow different and almost magic at getting thru long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>But when I followed with my wide tooth pick it slid right through my hair!  </li>
            <li>This was usually followed by a healthy dousing of detangler and/or leave-in conditioner after I got out.</li>
            <li>It did pull slightly and I had to readjust the brush, but that&#x27;s probably because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how this works, since it looks like all the others, but WOW!</li>
            <li>For the first time, our kids don&#x27;t scream when they have their long/thick/wavy/super-curly hair brushed.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>My child has the thickest hair and these are the only brushes that we can use that brush gently and thoroughly through her hair!</li>
            <li>this brush makes my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li>they all look all pretty the same!</li>
            <li>when using this brush on my wet hair - out of the shower - I still remove a hand full cluster of hair.</li>
            <li>I had to use so much product in her gorgeous, thick, curly, Irish red hair that it not only took forever, but required more patience than any child should be expected to have.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely flexible and soft and the rounded tips are very small which I think also helps make brushing more comfortable--especially for a 1.5 year old with baby fine hair and a tender little head :)</li>
            <li>The Wet Brush:&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first Wet Brush at a Sally&#x27;s and was just AMAZED at how easily it moved through my hair.</li>
            <li>Typically when it gets washed at the salon it is a huge labor for the stylist to detangle.</li>
            <li>Gently going over the spot will free the tangles usually.  </li>
            <li>Not super important for me, but</li>
            <li>Brushing wet--or dry--hair is not nearly the chore it used to be as they really do detangle hair gently.</li>
            <li>They brush the hair out smooth with less snagging and pulling hair out.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair that tangles pretty much by just breathing on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard raves from a friend about a wet brush and though I&#x27;ve had long hair most of my days</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because I was taught to never brush wet hair, but these brushes are gentle as can be.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and a super sensitive scalp this brush did not hurt at all</li>
            <li>They take a little more patience in working through long, tangled hair but the brush also does not break off as much hair in the process.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it: I need conditioner AND a little after-shower serum to work a pick through my hair and it takes awhile.  </li>
            <li>It allows me to easily brush through wet hair without damaging it, and no longer leaves me embarrassed at the hairdresser when I come in with massive knots.</li>
            <li>This brush makes it so easy to comb through wet hair, especially after adding conditioner.</li>
            <li>And after your hair is washed/conditioned, all you have to do is towel dry and brush right through itagain.  </li>
            <li>It works great on super thick hair and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t rip out my hair even if I tried like a regular brush did.</li>
            <li>so I finally go smart and ordered a second one.</li>
            <li>These brushes work great on wet hair that is very hard to brush (tangled).  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 7 year old niece to brush her hair.</li>
            <li>They both have traded in their old brushes for these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come across so far for brushing tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>Bought these to brush our young daughters&#x27; hair because they are sensitive to tangle yanks.  </li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spend more than I can remember on all different shapes and sizes of boar hair bristle brushes, from cheap to expensive.  </li>
            <li>My old brushes would pull out hair as they went through the tangles.  </li>
            <li>My 8-year old LOVES this brush.  </li>
            <li>if you are sensitive to smell - this will be an issue for you.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter would complain, cry, squirm and avoid brushing her hair every day.  </li>
            <li>no crying from having their hair pulled.</li>
            <li>I had always used a comb and it took nearly 30 mins to comb it out...</li>
            <li>My niece who has a sensitive head like me loves this brush also.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t disturb her natural curl.  </li>
            <li>and it was completely combed out in 4 strokes.</li>
            <li>No crying or screaming.</li>
            <li>They work very well and actually beyond my expectation.</li>
            <li>This brush has completely changed that.</li>
            <li>I have to her use to how soft it is in my hair..</li>
            <li>My 95 year old mother-in-law appreciates the tenderness of her&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>One with wavy hair and a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>Got one for me and one for my 7 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the 4 and 5 year old a mini which was easier for them to use by theirselves.</li>
            <li>The color is a soft metallic.</li>
            <li>Even my 5 yr old is brushing her hair herself.</li>
            <li>Near all baths and showers.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair and my hair is always in tangles when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft but still untangles my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in my life that I have had really long hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that has gotten extremely tangled my entire life.</li>
            <li>what its worth, the first brush I bought had a raised logo (same color as brush) where these have a black sticker/stamp (not raised).  </li>
            <li>They go right through tangled wet hair.</li>
            <li>This brush just goes right through wet hair.</li>
            <li>Wet: neither of us found this brush to detangle our hair better than any other brush we have used.</li>
            <li>It really untangles both wet and dry hair quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>We usually have to pick through her hair witj a comb and by the time we are done her skalp is red and the brush is full of hair even though I was very gentle.  </li>
            <li>As a girl with thick, tangly hair from it being dyed so much, this brush saved my hair&#x27;s life pretty much.</li>
            <li>The brushes in the package are actually labeled Wet Brush Pro and while they look similar to the other, actual, wet brushes that I own, they are neither soft nor pull free.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair but a ton of it and usually brushes break my hair because I get a lot of tangles.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve tried so many brushes that don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it&#x27;s a cheap enough brush that I don&#x27;t mind replacing it when it gets worn down.</li>
            <li>Grandchild and I have searched high and low for brush for tangles.</li>
            <li>Glides right through curly, straight, dry or wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thick wavy hair, my older daughter has straight, fine hair and my other daughter has naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought these brushes for my 2 daughters who both have tender heads but both like their hair long and straight.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was this brush comes in wide selection of colors and designs.  </li>
            <li>These brushes work great on my daughter long hair, no more crying.</li>
            <li>I just used it the first time tonight on my wet hair</li>
            <li>I have not used another brush since I bought my first wet brush 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I spent time to read the review and compare with other similar product (on TV commerical a lot).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My son wears his hair a little long and this brush works perfectly clearing snags and styling his &amp;#34;boy-band&amp;#34; style but not so on my long, thick, curly locks!  </li>
            <li>The Wet Brush is the only one she has liked and it works well wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Since I purchased the Wet Brush her hair looks so much better---not so wild.</li>
            <li>Fantastic hair brush that doesn&#x27;t pull my long hair much at all when I brush it no matter wet or dry!!!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but after using them on my self and multiple children, the results are magical.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain how these brushes can brush through wet hair so smoothly, but I don&#x27;t care and I will never use a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush on my wet hair again!</li>
            <li>It is fabulous on wet, tangled hair, as well as for use as a regular brush on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Based on all the other positive reviews here I decided to buy four brushes.</li>
            <li>Everyone with long hair, young and old should have one of these.</li>
            <li>I have a kid who wants to have long hair, but hates having it brushed.</li>
            <li>He loves it and frequently forgets to bring it on his visits home, so I ordered the two pack to have an extra on hand.  </li>
            <li>A couple of weeks later, I used my old brush because of proximity and my eyes widened at the pain.  </li>
            <li>Make fast work of wet tangled hair</li>
            <li>This is the only brush my 6 year old will let me use on her hair.</li>
            <li>Bought for my young teen girls because their friend had one that &amp;#34;worked</li>
            <li>Much gentler on wet hair.</li>
            <li>My four year old finally let&#x27;s me brush his hair and does not cry while I&#x27;m doing it!</li>
            <li>this brush really works on kids wet hair.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old used to cry and scream when I brushed her hair, now she lets me and doesn&#x27;t hurt her at all.</li>
            <li>A gentle way to brush that curly and/or wet hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush for difficult hair.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea what the secret is, but I&#x27;m glad it works.</li>
            <li>I bought this new pack to replace my 2-year old Wet Brush and the bristle flexibility difference between the two</li>
            <li>wash your hair lightly brush with this miracle of a brush and taraaa in less than 2 minutes your hair will be detangled, with minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how this brush is different from any other brush -</li>
            <li>Having used the &#x27;other&#x27; detangling brushes on the market for my daughters hair and given up because they just couldn&#x27;t get the tangles out without breaking hair and causing tears, these have made my life and theirs so much happier.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t pull out as much hair from the brushes as I used to with the other brushes.  </li>
            <li>the other straight.</li>
            <li>She is very tender headed and screams when I use any other brush.</li>
            <li>thanks The Wet Brush team!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how smoothly it went through very thick hair.</li>
            <li>particular Wet Brush:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My 10 yr old has the most difficult hair to brush.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a MAGIC brush where you can start at the top of the head and just start pulling down...</li>
            <li>the reality it&#x27;s if you buy one,you never will use other brush&lt;br /&gt;Great for adult and for my 4 years old girl</li>
            <li>I have a 12 year old with long hair and a tender head.</li>
            <li>Apparently, there are legit features of this brush that create actual benefits.</li>
            <li>At first it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s brushing out the tangles at all but a few seconds in</li>
            <li>I was using a normal brush when I traveled and missed my Wet Brush</li>
            <li>My hair is thick but long and baby fine.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is baby fine, yet thick and somewhat wavy - buy with confidence!  </li>
            <li>Brushes arrived new, on time and as expected.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old has very long curly hair.</li>
            <li>One of my friends used it on her 4 year old niece (who has very long hair) and she didn&#x27;t wiggle or cry at all</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I have thin long hair, and we have no problems with this brush pulling our hair out, or creating more tangles.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have thin hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s super thick</li>
            <li>With this brush, it goes right through my hair (which is thick and wavey) and right through my daughter&#x27;s hair (which is thin and straight).</li>
            <li>brushes good for dry and wet hair and delivered what I expected for my daughter&#x27;s long and thick tangled</li>
            <li>Made for wet hair, don&#x27;t really like to use it on my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair tangles so easily when it is wet and usually requires three-four combing sessions to set angle, but this brush works miracles!</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t believe how it just brushes right through wet hair, and reports that she is noticing much less hair loss in the shower and in the brush.</li>
            <li>We did not use any other new products.</li>
            <li>, I still loose hair regardless of the brush - this one no less than others.</li>

            <li> Amazing .</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just an amazing invention.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> She says the brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I even use it now on my own hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine every buying another kind.  </li>
            <li> In fact it combed through my hair so effectively and painlessly that I couldn&#x27;t believe that my tangles were gone.  </li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best brushes ever.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I have these in my car,  purse,  beach bag,  and all of the kids have their own.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have any problems brushing the tangles out of her own hair now.  </li>
            <li> Best brush I have, really helps with detangling.  </li>
            <li> Now they brush their own and the us</li>
            <li> but some how they manage to not hurt when they go through tangles and still manage to brush your hair effectively.</li>
            <li> Own four of these.</li>
            <li> This two pack allows them to each have their own.</li>
            <li> The packaging made sure the product arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush set so each of my daughters could have their own brush.</li>
            <li> I remember well my own mother ripping through the tangles, bottles of No-More-Tangles</li>
            <li> With these brushes, the kids brush their own hair every morning.</li>
            <li> but I just found it amusing that after I found these online accidentally, they appear in Toys R Us.</li>
            <li> And the metallic colors are nice too.</li>
            <li> The bristles are flimsy and they are not as effective in detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever for those with sensitive scalp or snarls !!!</li>
            <li> I bought the frist one at a salon and was excited to learn that AMAZON sells them!!</li>
            <li> look cheap, but they&#x27;re amazing!</li>
            <li> i saw the good reviews and decided to go for it, and im more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Brushes work great; quick delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had battles with hair brushing for years, my girls now insist on doing it themselves with these very easy to use brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also VERY light, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Love how they don&#x27;t snag at knots and makes hair real smooth for blow drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for kids (and adults) with fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> and wow, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> - they work best in the shower but do a good job dry as well.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> , of course, I ran to Amazon to buy one and was so happy to find I could get a 2-pack at a very reasonable</li>
            <li> My girls can even brush their own hair easily after a shower and get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> My 2 granddaughters love having their own specially colored brushes, though!</li>
            <li> Loved at first use!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review what the brush is like, once I&#x27;m able to USE them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using them, if I&#x27;m able to and if the smell comes out.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t magic or powered by &amp;#34;nano technology&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> These brushes are magic.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous!</li>
            <li> Great brush, I LOVE it, thanks</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re officially my daughters favorite hairbrush.</li>
            <li> : I use the brush most exclusively now and its so fast!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have bought more as gifts for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> but it is like magic.  </li>
            <li> One of the rare instances where you can believe the hype and all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I guess I need to buy more.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!</li>
            <li> This brush does magic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She calls these her MAGIC BRUSHES!!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> My daughters (6 and 8) do not complain when I brush their hair with this one.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I would say that they don&#x27;t yank tangles because the bristles seem to be a bit more flexible, so they give instead of pull.  </li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and they manage to remove a lot of lint from my hair (eww).</li>
            <li> My toddlers love the no tears hair combing</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love wetbrushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even brush my hair with anything but one now! :)</li>
            <li> The curly days are when my hair gets the most tangled.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so amazed by this brush that I bought more for my friends.  </li>
            <li> i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It combs through even her most tangled and sweaty hair without pulling.  </li>
            <li> It detangles my hair like magic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magical powers start to wear off.</li>
            <li> This brush is magical.  </li>
            <li> It was impressive if I actually ran a brush through all my hair more than twice a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we have tried so many hair brushes that we end up throwing away.  </li>
            <li> I must work from the bottom to the top -</li>
            <li> And they are not in a drawer tucked away but out on a counter top exposed to air.</li>
            <li> My two oldest daughters love these brushes</li>
            <li> My brush from dollar tree is actually better and has a better quality handle as well.</li>
            <li> but this one is OUTSTANDING -</li>
            <li> I can say from personal experience, this is the best brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> so they stay in a better condition longer.</li>
            <li> My girls love this style of brush.  </li>
            <li> They LOVE them.</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself and had to buy 2 more to share with my girls.</li>
            <li> This brush is ok, I have Corkskrew curls</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;m so glad I went with the ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush!  </li>
            <li> I bought three of these and all three people love them.</li>
            <li> Glad we got these.</li>
            <li> and - Ok, I have no idea why we needed this brush or</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> This brush gets the tangles out like  magic.</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> I think, maybe, if the bristles were longer, the brush would work better on thicker hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush.</li>
            <li> My boys both love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Have bought more for family members as well.</li>
            <li> The second day she and her best friend sat there brushing her hair all morning</li>
            <li> I love that there is two.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> so I there wasn&#x27;t any more stress over who had the brush.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they like it better</li>
            <li> I will probably buy more to have on hand for me and my daughter.  </li>
            <li> this brush has made our mornings tear free!</li>
            <li> when I brush most ends up in the brush.  </li>

            <li> These are the best, I brush, blow dry, and style my hair with this brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of witch craft these are made with, but brushing hair is no longer cringe worthy.</li>

            <li> These are wonderful for brushing wet hair.</li>

            <li> Yes, it really is THAT good.</li>
            <li> very nice to have new colors and patterns available.</li>

            <li> It brushes out your hair SO easily.  </li>

            <li> This brush went through my hair so easily, it was like brushing my hair with conditioner in it, but it didn&#x27;t have any on it.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve made sure  to keep them clean</li>
            <li> painless.&lt;br /&gt;the brush removed tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> Did not detangle as easily as described.  </li>
            <li> works on my daughter&#x27;s hair which knots easy.</li>
            <li> This brush works easily to detangle after washing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> and the tangles come out so easily.  </li>
            <li> Detangling has never been so easy.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and effective.</li>

            <li> I have fine, colored hair that gets easily tangled then breaks off.  </li>
            <li> Normally, it takes me a good 15 minutes to brush out her hair, section by seciton.</li>
            <li> Thought it was just a bunch of hype, but my 4.5 year old can brush her own hair now!</li>
            <li> Help my tween more easily care for her own very sensitive head!</li>
            <li> Hands down best brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> They looked fine despite the packing job, but the SMELL out of the box and ON the brushes, was like they&#x27;d been in a smoker&#x27;s household or salvaged from a housefire.</li>
            <li> Does incredibly well on dry hair too</li>
            <li> These works just fine</li>
            <li> I have a lot of baby fine curly hair...</li>
            <li> but it still worked fine.</li>
            <li> My hair always tangled easily and the brush really smooth things out.</li>
            <li> My niece had no problems with it on her fine hair.</li>

            <li> These brushes are best used on wet hair, they detangle so quickly.</li>
            <li> most fought over brush...not really a fight more like a strong debate.</li>

            <li> These brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Pulls through my curly hair with no fuss and leaves my hair smooth and detangled.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how much the brush had eased my own tangle issues.  </li>
            <li> They are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Our mornings before school have been tear free with this brush.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great brush to tackle wet/dry tangles.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> With these brushes her hair is fantastic.</li>
            <li> gets the tangles out pain free.</li>
            <li> This brush truly works and it worked even after swimming in a hotel pool when no conditioner was available</li>
            <li> This brush is great for scuba divers, especially after a dive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with these, I&#x27;ll never go back or use anything else.</li>
            <li> this brush is honestly one of the best brushes if not the best for easily brushing through tangled long hair wet or dry!!!</li>

            <li> Works great for medium to long, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush is very gentle on my hair and would recommend it to anyone I loved it so much I bought 4</li>
            <li> but with this brush it brushes right thru it and untangles it-- its amazing and a good buy for long hair</li>
            <li> Nice, useful, practical, light weight, easy care, pretty, great, delightful, beautifying, snappy, classic, modern, cool, awesome, fearfully efficient  snarl smoother.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome, however, I will say, for my hair, I still have to put a little product in it to brush through without ripping my hair out!</li>
            <li> Untangles knots easily, makes hair nice &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> So worth the money!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Has enough hair to have her own now!</li>
            <li> I thought it was original U.S. products.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Cheep Brush Set, Came Apart The First Day, Returned, Ordered Better Brush.</li>

            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> These work great on my daughter&#x27;s long hair</li>
            <li> There is nothing visibly unique about it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had long hair and finding a good detangling brush was never an easy task.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as the original only sparkly.</li>
            <li> Best on wet hair but also amazing on dry hair.</li>
            <li> She was right!</li>
            <li> These brushes glide right through our hair without pulling!</li>
            <li> I have stick straight, baby fine hair that rats up easily and</li>
            <li> It is a great brush for easing the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of detangling your wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Brush works great on wet and tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> works great on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> They are soft, and nicely shaped.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush and loved it so much, I bought three more for my teenage girls.  </li>
            <li> Even more upsetting to think that these brushes are being foisted off on unsuspecting purchasers as the real thing.</li>
            <li> It does the same job as any good brush does.  </li>
            <li> and I kept one in my room for myself because we love them so much.</li>
            <li> Cool colors too.</li>
            <li> so I checked Amazon and got a 2-pack for $12.95 and free shipping because I am an Amazon Prime Member (also worth every penny).</li>
            <li> THE BEST BRUSHES FOR KIDS WITH DELICATE SCALPS.</li>
            <li> The reviews are really true.</li>
            <li> Best brush for thick wavy hair .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about these</li>
            <li> Makes brushing me hair so much easier and leaves my hair feeling silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> it is a good brush that should last a while.</li>
            <li> But every time I replace the old one with a new one I am amazed all over again how great the brush is.</li>
            <li> Love love love the wet brush!</li>
            <li> The issue I&#x27;m having is that they smell pretty strongly...</li>
            <li> This is my second personal brush I have bought for myself because I love it so much, I also got one for my mom and best friend.</li>
            <li> originally bought this from my hairdresser for $13.95 and thought it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> they leave my hair full of static, don&#x27;t work so awesome as others had said in their reviews... not true!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best brushes for little tender heads.  </li>
            <li> They have earned loyal fan for life.</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived so quickly and they were well packaged.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter who has a lot of hair and super curly.  </li>
            <li> Quick ship (amazon prime).</li>
            <li> Luckily, the smell wears off after time.</li>
            <li> It sure helps with my new found curly hair and at my age my right foot grew, I need all her smiles!  </li>
            <li> I tried the wet brush on a whim, and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> The wet brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> Bought these two for my parents after falling in love with my own wet brush!  </li>
            <li> Not a miracle, but definitely better than a normal hairbrush you would buy at a retail store.  </li>
            <li> The metallic color is also very pretty.  </li>
            <li> so you may have to brush their hair a number of times more than the normal brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for weak, colored and fine hair ( that exactly what I have).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought them as gifts for 2 young girls with very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> They really make it easy to get through the tangles.</li>
            <li> but mine is straight and hers is curly and gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> Gift to grand daughters with long hair and don&#x27;t want anyone touching hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s said to do!</li>
            <li> These are the first hairbrushes that don&#x27;t hurt my daughters while I brush their hair!  </li>
            <li> they were happy to get their own and these do work well getting the tangles out of long wet hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how easy it is to brush my wet hair with these brushes, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long, fine hair which tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> Made brushing my processed fine hair after a shower much faster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a life saver when brushing my 2 year old&#x27;s hair, but warning it does have a plastic smell that is very strong when it first arrives.</li>
            <li> I feel this product is probably ideal for parents who have to brush their children&#x27;s&#x27; hair, since you cant tell when you might be tugging too hard.</li>
            <li> Gets through my wet long baby fine hair with amazing speed and no damage! !</li>
            <li> I could see how young girls would love the variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the brush is well worth it.</li>
            <li> good for wet hair.</li>
            <li> Very much worth the investment</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Wet Brushes, they work incredibly well!  </li>
            <li> This is a good hairbrush for wet hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It controls the most wild and knotted hair no problem.</li>
            <li> I was ready to cut my daughters hair off because of all the tangles that would take so much time and so many tears brush out.  </li>
            <li> Now they brush their hair on their own, allow me to brush when necessary</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> You need to make sure you move your hair around and brush out the layers of your hair because the Wet Brush is flexible and won&#x27;t get all the knots out if you just brush the top layer of hair.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Every person with hair to be brushed should own this product.</li>
            <li> Quite frankly, leaving the View, I gave it a 10% chance of success.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t needed to help my 7 year old brush through her morning tangled hair since she started using this, and many tears have been avoided as a result.</li>
            <li> I would say its worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have children and dread brushing their hair full of knots!</li>
            <li> Works good on dry hair too!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these on my two girls&#x27; hair with very positive results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine brush, but honestly does not seem special to me and does not work any better than other brushes I have that look similar.</li>
            <li> I bought the 2 pack (one for me and one for my daughter) due to the good reviews.</li>
            <li> problem is that the product arrived in a box without any padding for the brushes, just the packages the brushes would come in, right off the shelf.</li>
            <li> Went right through mine and my daughter&#x27;s tangles.  </li>
            <li> I would rate this brush 5 stars coming right out of the box.</li>
            <li> If you have any tangles in your hair, buy this right now.  </li>
            <li> This brush goes right through my hair without any pulling or pain.</li>
            <li> Goes right through the tangles in one stroke with no pulling or breakage.</li>
            <li> For brushing long wet hair this brush is the best.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really nothing special for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent for brush childrens hair, wet or dry, they can brush by themself</li>
            <li> Excellent product on wet and dry hair!</li>
            <li> This brush not only doesn&#x27;t hurt when brushing through even huge tangles, but eliminates the static that normally comes with paddle brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome, especially if you have little girls..</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my young niece who has a tender head and hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> I have long fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best brushes that pull the least on my two daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Got these for my two granddaughters that have naturally curly, easily tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> We have long, fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has SUPER thick hair and is always a struggle to brush, these have been amazing!</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair very much and yet it gets out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> Love these brushes, waited my whole life to find a brush that combs through my wet hair easily.</li>
            <li> The tangles come right out  when wet and does a very good job when dry  </li>
            <li> Both my husband and daughter have long, wavy hair that knios and tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> After that I just kept brushing because the brush has long bristles w/ little balls on the end that feel great on your scalp!  </li>
            <li> but so far we love them and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Works amazing for wet tangly hair</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My grand daughter no longer cries or fights getting her haired brushed after I bought this for my daughter in law to try.</li>
            <li> that probably makes sense to the ladies reading this ;)</li>
            <li> They really help with tangly hair!  </li>
            <li> she tries to take mine even though she has her own...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it the first night.  </li>
            <li> We only had to buy more because of a lost brush.</li>
            <li> It cuts through tangles like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> last week, since I&#x27;ve been using the brushes, I have had so many people compliment my hair and tell me they never knew my hair was so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So first let me tell you</li>
            <li> Please be aware -</li>
            <li> It has helped with knots and such with no pain!  : )  </li>
            <li> The ease of brushing my hair wasnt exactly a shocker.</li>
            <li> This brush really does the trick!</li>
            <li> but my grand daughter HATES to have her hair brushed.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> I love these brushed.  </li>
            <li> and it worked better since I was using it on smaller sections of hair and, again, it did not pull/hurt when I had to brush through a tangle</li>
            <li> since bought them as gifts and have raved about them to other families who have all purchased the brushes and love them too!</li>
            <li> Just be aware.)</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughters short hair, not so much on my long hair.</li>
            <li> This brush has made my life so much easier!  </li>
            <li> Love the brush although I can&#x27;t figure out why it is so different from others....</li>
            <li> My girls don&#x27;t love their hair brushed - until this brush!  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle brush for you or your kids!</li>
            <li> it really works!</li>
            <li> It definitely works better on the finer hair.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to be doing nothing at first</li>
            <li> The whole family likes it!</li>
            <li> Prices were pretty comparable</li>
            <li> The first brushes that don&#x27;t hurt to use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and it tangles more than when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> they really work!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to the brush at my salon.  </li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t get it, because it just seems like a regular brush with more pliable bristles, but I am a believer.</li>
            <li> First, my sister used it after a shower.  </li>
            <li> and this was unnerving at first.  </li>
            <li> i have super long hair that gets easily tangled</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, fine hair (and lots of it!).  </li>
            <li> They are colorful, sturdy and run through my hair just great, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> It detangles my hair wet or dry, and leaves it smooth after a fair number of strokes.</li>
            <li> For my nieces … fine for their needs … have super long hair …works for them.</li>
            <li> When I was ready to head to work, I&#x27;d simply brush the top and the ends of my hair and balled it up in a bun.  </li>
            <li> They are a little better at brushing through wet hair and that is good for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Cut through knots with fair ease and cause very little stress on the hair for my daughter during brushing.  </li>
            <li> I just had no idea, at the time, how positive that feedback would be!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am normally a HUGE fan of these wet brushes and I own several of them.  </li>
            <li> granddaughters both have long hair and they love these brushes because they made brushing their hair</li>
            <li> 3 girls in the house with long hair and all 3 of us just love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes I won one at a bridal shower and thought it was a strange gift.</li>
            <li> I use nice fragrance products (e.g. leave-in conditioners) in my hair, only to be accosted by this smell as I brush it - or even if applying makeup or putting in contacts in the general area!</li>
            <li> I dont understand how a seemingly normal brush can go right through snarls and knots as if they were never there.  </li>
            <li> ok for dry</li>
            <li> The best ever hairbrush i&#x27;ve ever used on my 3 granddaughters who have long thick hair  </li>
            <li> Works great for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> they work great on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> They work great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> and it works great wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> and it works great on wet or dry</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and it works great for both wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It works great on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It works fine as a regular brush</li>
            <li> I bought a total of ten and would love to buy another 10 to give away to friends and family!</li>
            <li> It works fine as a regular brush</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My whole life I have struggled with knotted curly hair.  </li>
            <li> is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I now don&#x27;t have to use any conditioner or detangler in my hair thanks to this brush.</li>
            <li> Very upsetting that I have to hassle with a return.  </li>
            <li> both of my granddaughters have looong hair which gets very tangled in the shower.  </li>
            <li> really pays to read and compare product before you spend your money</li>
            <li> Now she brushes her hair with no fuss, both in the shower and any time she wants with no pain.  </li>
            <li> All because of the too much ironing.</li>
            <li> and I was really upset that it stunk of cigarette.</li>
            <li> this has made my daughters hair much nicer looking it is not spliting as much</li>
            <li> anymore she is much happier</li>
            <li> but it is very misleading that it is supposed to be a detangling brush.</li>
            <li> because I am very tender headed</li>
            <li> She is 12 and loves it; it really helps with her knotts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to Express how much my family loves these brushes.</li>
            <li> They both really love these wet brushes.</li>
            <li> fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> These work very well to get tangle out without too much pulling.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo/Condition then section out hair and gently brush from ends up.</li>
            <li> I have a very tender scalp and am growing my hair out (longer than ever).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This helped so much with the frizz.</li>
            <li> really good&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> I felt like I was going bald because of how much hair I was pulling out.</li>
            <li> It was an absolute chore to brush her hair each day.  </li>
            <li> Thank you, magic Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> Every time she comes to my house now she wants to take my brush home with her.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My niece would refuse to brush her hair because it hurt so much.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tangle and pull on their hair even when straight out of the pool.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> These brushes have made it so much easier.</li>
            <li> They really work to take out knots.</li>
            <li> I saw it advertised on a health show and it really helps tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I &amp; my daughter have a very tender scalp.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Elsie</li>
            <li> I really like this brush</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but it is very misleading that it is supposed to be a de-tangling brush.</li>
            <li> Both my kids -- one with curly hair, one straight</li>
            <li> Really, who&#x27;d a thought?</li>
            <li> Kids can be very picky</li>
            <li> Far fewer strands pulled out when de-tangling freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li> They really work.</li>
            <li> Goes through fairly smooth compared to a regular brush that would get stuck at every night.  </li>
            <li> We were very sceptical that it could deal with her hair.  </li>
            <li> These are great for thin hair as they don&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> Note that the points are very flexible</li>
            <li> Gentle, they take the angst our of hair brushing.</li>
            <li> This brush really works.</li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> POst shower, I used it and agreed with my sister that you really feel like it&#x27;s just floating over the hair.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t necessary as my hair was, in fact, free of tangles.  </li>
            <li> This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter has mixed hair, and she can actually do her own hair in the morning with these.  </li>
            <li> Probably takes a few more passes to get deeper into the hair, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the magic, looks like a normal brush but brushing long hair is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I loved the one I received as a gift initially, which introduced The Wet Brush to me.  </li>
            <li> One of them actually kept coming back because she liked the scalp massage it gives.  </li>
            <li> Next time I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it, was after washing my hair, and I was able to brush through my mass of usual tangles so easily!</li>
            <li> Her hair is very wavy and tangles easily wet or dry, this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has long curly hair that mats easily.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this brush for my granddaughter who has long hair that tangles easily - won&#x27;t purchase this again</li>
            <li> My hair is long and gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> No detangler required, and it works better than any other brush.</li>
            <li> so I was beyond excited when my stylist used this brush on my hair during my last salon visit.</li>
            <li> Both my girls like them much better than any other brushes we have tried.</li>
            <li> No more tears for sure!  </li>
            <li> Now Excited my daughter finally.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t untangle any better than her other brushes</li>
            <li> They look like many other brushes out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still wondering how and why is it that this hair brush works better than all other hair brushes I&#x27;ve ever tried before...</li>
            <li> Still, to be sure, I felt the need to take one of my other hair brushes through it.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin long hair, this is the perfect brush for you.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li> And the amazing this was I lost very little hair.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry, these brushes feel good in their hair.</li>
            <li> A friend told me it was fantastic on long, tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how smoothly it went through my hair and left it so soft!  </li>
            <li> (she would go days without running as much as her fingers through normally)</li>
            <li> In a house full of girls, these are the only brushes my daughters will let me brush their hair with.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers about the odor, it is like a diesel smell and very strong when you first open the packaging, however it did not leave the odor in my hair and after about a month the odor is almost gone.</li>
            <li> so I can have one for home and give one to my new stylist to try!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that snags easily with combs and other brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price on Amazon is amazing for two of them as I paid almost the same for one wet brush at my salon.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but these really do work great</li>
            <li> A good friend told me about this brush and how it only took a few strokes to get through a tangled head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Awesome brush to detangle wet thin hair.</li>
            <li> They work great for my hair and for my poor old dog&#x27;s hair as well...</li>
            <li> This brush is so gentle and magically combs thru my hair in a few strokes.</li>
            <li> I have the biggest tangled mess on top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tear your hair,  very soft but gets the tangles out!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have tangly hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those who have that problem.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my little granddaughters too and they really love them.  </li>
            <li> Also, some of the little beads at the top started to come off, making the bristles scratch your scalp</li>
            <li> this brush, I can completely untangle all my hair within minutes!!  </li>
            <li> so i wanted to invest in something a little bit more then a minimum cost hair brush.</li>
            <li> Still makes the other daughter more willing to sit and have her hair brushed, however!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely like a hot knife going through butter, I didn&#x27;t believe it until it worked for my hair!</li>
            <li> My little girls love them.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t exactly work like I thought it would and doesn&#x27;t glide as easy as it apparently does on other people.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter is 16 and wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m also ordering a few more for myself to stockpile)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great brush for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> The brush is great for tangles, specically that my hair is very long and thick.</li>
            <li> I bought these to go in my office at work and in my gym bag and each kid has their own wet dry brush</li>
            <li> I have long super tangly hair</li>
            <li> We use it both for wet hair and it works amazingly well on dry hair too!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stress free on my hair and combs through tangles without breakage like other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I live with them and am like their nanny.</li>
            <li> We had a tangle teezer brush before and it worked Ok, but was hard to hold onto when I was brushing their hair; it doesn&#x27;t have a handle and eventually the bristles didn&#x27;t get through the tangles very well</li>
            <li> Ok as a dry brush but made me very nervous the way it was pulling on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight hair and LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li> Hairbrush is fine,but has a odd ,strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li> My long hair gets so tangly, and this brush helps so much!!</li>
            <li> The first few Wet Brushes I purchased were awesome, but this set was not the same as my previous purchases.</li>
            <li> Leaves it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Ok, I fell for the promise this brush was somehow different and almost magic at getting thru long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> But when I followed with my wide tooth pick it slid right through my hair!  </li>
            <li> This was usually followed by a healthy dousing of detangler and/or leave-in conditioner after I got out.</li>
            <li> It did pull slightly and I had to readjust the brush, but that&#x27;s probably because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this works, since it looks like all the others, but WOW!</li>
            <li> For the first time, our kids don&#x27;t scream when they have their long/thick/wavy/super-curly hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> My child has the thickest hair and these are the only brushes that we can use that brush gently and thoroughly through her hair!</li>
            <li> this brush makes my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> they all look all pretty the same!</li>
            <li> when using this brush on my wet hair - out of the shower - I still remove a hand full cluster of hair.</li>
            <li> I had to use so much product in her gorgeous, thick, curly, Irish red hair that it not only took forever, but required more patience than any child should be expected to have.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely flexible and soft and the rounded tips are very small which I think also helps make brushing more comfortable--especially for a 1.5 year old with baby fine hair and a tender little head :)</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush:&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first Wet Brush at a Sally&#x27;s and was just AMAZED at how easily it moved through my hair.</li>
            <li> Typically when it gets washed at the salon it is a huge labor for the stylist to detangle.</li>
            <li> Gently going over the spot will free the tangles usually.  </li>
            <li> Not super important for me, but</li>
            <li> Brushing wet--or dry--hair is not nearly the chore it used to be as they really do detangle hair gently.</li>
            <li> They brush the hair out smooth with less snagging and pulling hair out.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair that tangles pretty much by just breathing on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard raves from a friend about a wet brush and though I&#x27;ve had long hair most of my days</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because I was taught to never brush wet hair, but these brushes are gentle as can be.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and a super sensitive scalp this brush did not hurt at all</li>
            <li> They take a little more patience in working through long, tangled hair but the brush also does not break off as much hair in the process.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it: I need conditioner AND a little after-shower serum to work a pick through my hair and it takes awhile.  </li>
            <li> It allows me to easily brush through wet hair without damaging it, and no longer leaves me embarrassed at the hairdresser when I come in with massive knots.</li>
            <li> This brush makes it so easy to comb through wet hair, especially after adding conditioner.</li>
            <li> And after your hair is washed/conditioned, all you have to do is towel dry and brush right through itagain.  </li>
            <li> It works great on super thick hair and thin hair.  </li>
            <li> It certainly didn&#x27;t rip out my hair even if I tried like a regular brush did.</li>
            <li> so I finally go smart and ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great on wet hair that is very hard to brush (tangled).  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 7 year old niece to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> They both have traded in their old brushes for these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come across so far for brushing tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought these to brush our young daughters&#x27; hair because they are sensitive to tangle yanks.  </li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spend more than I can remember on all different shapes and sizes of boar hair bristle brushes, from cheap to expensive.  </li>
            <li> My old brushes would pull out hair as they went through the tangles.  </li>
            <li> My 8-year old LOVES this brush.  </li>
            <li> if you are sensitive to smell - this will be an issue for you.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter would complain, cry, squirm and avoid brushing her hair every day.  </li>
            <li> no crying from having their hair pulled.</li>
            <li> I had always used a comb and it took nearly 30 mins to comb it out...</li>
            <li> My niece who has a sensitive head like me loves this brush also.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t disturb her natural curl.  </li>
            <li> and it was completely combed out in 4 strokes.</li>
            <li> No crying or screaming.</li>
            <li> They work very well and actually beyond my expectation.</li>
            <li> This brush has completely changed that.</li>
            <li> I have to her use to how soft it is in my hair..</li>
            <li> My 95 year old mother-in-law appreciates the tenderness of her&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> One with wavy hair and a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> Got one for me and one for my 7 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the 4 and 5 year old a mini which was easier for them to use by theirselves.</li>
            <li> The color is a soft metallic.</li>
            <li> Even my 5 yr old is brushing her hair herself.</li>
            <li> Near all baths and showers.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and my hair is always in tangles when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft but still untangles my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in my life that I have had really long hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that has gotten extremely tangled my entire life.</li>
            <li> what its worth, the first brush I bought had a raised logo (same color as brush) where these have a black sticker/stamp (not raised).  </li>
            <li> They go right through tangled wet hair.</li>
            <li> This brush just goes right through wet hair.</li>
            <li> Wet: neither of us found this brush to detangle our hair better than any other brush we have used.</li>
            <li> It really untangles both wet and dry hair quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> We usually have to pick through her hair witj a comb and by the time we are done her skalp is red and the brush is full of hair even though I was very gentle.  </li>
            <li> As a girl with thick, tangly hair from it being dyed so much, this brush saved my hair&#x27;s life pretty much.</li>
            <li> The brushes in the package are actually labeled Wet Brush Pro and while they look similar to the other, actual, wet brushes that I own, they are neither soft nor pull free.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair but a ton of it and usually brushes break my hair because I get a lot of tangles.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve tried so many brushes that don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it&#x27;s a cheap enough brush that I don&#x27;t mind replacing it when it gets worn down.</li>
            <li> Grandchild and I have searched high and low for brush for tangles.</li>
            <li> Glides right through curly, straight, dry or wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick wavy hair, my older daughter has straight, fine hair and my other daughter has naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my 2 daughters who both have tender heads but both like their hair long and straight.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was this brush comes in wide selection of colors and designs.  </li>
            <li> These brushes work great on my daughter long hair, no more crying.</li>
            <li> I just used it the first time tonight on my wet hair</li>
            <li> I have not used another brush since I bought my first wet brush 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I spent time to read the review and compare with other similar product (on TV commerical a lot).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My son wears his hair a little long and this brush works perfectly clearing snags and styling his &amp;#34;boy-band&amp;#34; style but not so on my long, thick, curly locks!  </li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is the only one she has liked and it works well wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Since I purchased the Wet Brush her hair looks so much better---not so wild.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hair brush that doesn&#x27;t pull my long hair much at all when I brush it no matter wet or dry!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after using them on my self and multiple children, the results are magical.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how these brushes can brush through wet hair so smoothly, but I don&#x27;t care and I will never use a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush on my wet hair again!</li>
            <li> It is fabulous on wet, tangled hair, as well as for use as a regular brush on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Based on all the other positive reviews here I decided to buy four brushes.</li>
            <li> Everyone with long hair, young and old should have one of these.</li>
            <li> I have a kid who wants to have long hair, but hates having it brushed.</li>
            <li> He loves it and frequently forgets to bring it on his visits home, so I ordered the two pack to have an extra on hand.  </li>
            <li> A couple of weeks later, I used my old brush because of proximity and my eyes widened at the pain.  </li>
            <li> Make fast work of wet tangled hair</li>
            <li> This is the only brush my 6 year old will let me use on her hair.</li>
            <li> Bought for my young teen girls because their friend had one that &amp;#34;worked</li>
            <li> Much gentler on wet hair.</li>
            <li> My four year old finally let&#x27;s me brush his hair and does not cry while I&#x27;m doing it!</li>
            <li> this brush really works on kids wet hair.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old used to cry and scream when I brushed her hair, now she lets me and doesn&#x27;t hurt her at all.</li>
            <li> A gentle way to brush that curly and/or wet hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush for difficult hair.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what the secret is, but I&#x27;m glad it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this new pack to replace my 2-year old Wet Brush and the bristle flexibility difference between the two</li>
            <li> wash your hair lightly brush with this miracle of a brush and taraaa in less than 2 minutes your hair will be detangled, with minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how this brush is different from any other brush -</li>
            <li> Having used the &#x27;other&#x27; detangling brushes on the market for my daughters hair and given up because they just couldn&#x27;t get the tangles out without breaking hair and causing tears, these have made my life and theirs so much happier.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t pull out as much hair from the brushes as I used to with the other brushes.  </li>
            <li> the other straight.</li>
            <li> She is very tender headed and screams when I use any other brush.</li>
            <li> thanks The Wet Brush team!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how smoothly it went through very thick hair.</li>
            <li> particular Wet Brush:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old has the most difficult hair to brush.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a MAGIC brush where you can start at the top of the head and just start pulling down...</li>
            <li> the reality it&#x27;s if you buy one,you never will use other brush&lt;br /&gt;Great for adult and for my 4 years old girl</li>
            <li> I have a 12 year old with long hair and a tender head.</li>
            <li> Apparently, there are legit features of this brush that create actual benefits.</li>
            <li> At first it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s brushing out the tangles at all but a few seconds in</li>
            <li> I was using a normal brush when I traveled and missed my Wet Brush</li>
            <li> My hair is thick but long and baby fine.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is baby fine, yet thick and somewhat wavy - buy with confidence!  </li>
            <li> Brushes arrived new, on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has very long curly hair.</li>
            <li> One of my friends used it on her 4 year old niece (who has very long hair) and she didn&#x27;t wiggle or cry at all</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have thin long hair, and we have no problems with this brush pulling our hair out, or creating more tangles.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have thin hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s super thick</li>
            <li> With this brush, it goes right through my hair (which is thick and wavey) and right through my daughter&#x27;s hair (which is thin and straight).</li>
            <li> brushes good for dry and wet hair and delivered what I expected for my daughter&#x27;s long and thick tangled</li>
            <li> Made for wet hair, don&#x27;t really like to use it on my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair tangles so easily when it is wet and usually requires three-four combing sessions to set angle, but this brush works miracles!</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t believe how it just brushes right through wet hair, and reports that she is noticing much less hair loss in the shower and in the brush.</li>
            <li> We did not use any other new products.</li>
            <li> , I still loose hair regardless of the brush - this one no less than others.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes--I have shoulder length extra heavy and thick hair</li>
            <li> I think this just made our mornings a whole lot easier and tons less stressful!</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, or young daughters with long hair, you&#x27;ll want to give this brush a try!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painless on wet hair and like a normal brush on dry hair</li>
            <li> , actually i was looking for a new brush because i broke my last one in half trying to detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less crying and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daughter chose the purple and mom was excited to get the green one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair dresser is now selling these, recommends that we not use this brush with a blow dryer due to the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have thin yet thick stick straight hair that rats easily.</li>
            <li> I will use the 2nd brush in the pack, as my thin hair is prone to falling out, and the less force put on the follicles the better.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter has curly hair down to the middle of</li>
            <li> Then my 5 year old niece (who has ethnic tight curly hair that is contantly one giant ball of tangles in the back) used it after her shower.</li>
            <li> As a mother with young girls who inherited my unruly fine curls hair brushing is like torture, screaming, painful, and nearly always a fight to achieve.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what particular features make it different than a regular small paddle brush</li>
            <li> I have very long hair (to middle of my back)</li>
            <li> She has very long (to the back of her knees) red curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use them on wet and dry hair - adult and child.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to this brush, there are no more tears.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and have always had problems with getting dredlocks and tangles at the back of my head, by the end of the day</li>
            <li> : I used the brush instead of a comb when I was flat ironing my hair</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has really long hair and it would take forever to get her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> We began speaking, and as such, i mentioned my granddaughters long wirery curley hair.</li>
            <li> If you have really long hair like me, just terrific.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter with thick long hair loves these as her usual brush hurts her--even as much as I love my granddaughter</li>
            <li> I have thick, easily tangled hair and these brushes tame my tresses in no time.</li>
            <li> and my mom would still have to nearly hold me down to manage the madness I call my hair.</li>
            <li> Comparatively, if I use a wide tooth comb, I do not loose as much.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Only way to brush my daughters Long hair after swim practice!</li>
            <li> This actually gets the tangles out of my daughter&#x27;s long curly hair without a fight!  </li>
            <li> My stylist introduced this to me and I was amazed at how there is NO pain when brushing out my very long (lower back)</li>
            <li> only  dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve aged, it seems to be frizzier - and is likely because of all the gray (colored red).</li>
            <li> thin hair and sensitive scalp are very Thankful too...</li>
            <li> Wet or dry it brushes my hair like no other brush or comb</li>
            <li> I ordered a 2 pack to split between 2 girls for Christmas and got only a single pack.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so gently --they untangle, wet or dry hair with little hair being removed.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thin curly hair and its snags 75% less then with a normal brush.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair</li>
            <li> and this is the only brush that can get through my wet tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> Once I used it with my long hair</li>
            <li> I wish I found The Wet Brush brush earlier!  </li>
            <li> These are a must for girls with long hair</li>

            <li> I also have long hair.</li>

            <li> and I like to keep it long.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Wet Brush 2 pack and only got 1.</li>

            <li> I can only use this brush to brush my hair when it wet</li>
            <li> 2 girls and a mom with long hair in the house.  </li>
            <li> All with long hair, it doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>

            <li> Suffice it to say, this is the only brush my granddaughter allows her mother to run through her wet hait.</li>
            <li> , i had to let your company know, as I did promise that lady from Long Island , to provide feedback.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it because it is usable with wet hair and the bristles are spaced out further apart</li>
            <li> My six-year old has curly hair, and brushing her hair has always been a chore with lots of crying and complaining.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and straight, and tangles very easily, especially when wet.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair and usually only wash 1-2 times a week and before wet brush</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, so brushes are very hit and miss with me.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a new area of the country with hard water and when I washed my hair it felt like the strands had fused themselves together</li>
            <li> She wanted the green one which was super hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> She rubs her head back and forth all day long and that creates a big mess.</li>
            <li> I  have searched for a brush to brush my daughters thick long blonde sensitive head of hair!  </li>
            <li> I have spent waaaaay to much of my time detangling my wet hair with regular brushes at least 5 minutes after a shower.</li>
            <li> One of the girls has thick, coarse hair and the other thick, fine hair.</li>

            <li> A must have for anyone with children that have long to medium length hair!</li>
            <li> All you grand folks out there know nothing is worse than tears!!</li>
            <li> Every girl with long hair must have one!</li>
            <li> i have very long hair</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> but my daughter who has very long hair would give it a 4.</li>
            <li> Note: my hair is very long (almost to my waist) and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My granddaughters 7 and 8 have very long hair and told me about this brush.  </li>
            <li> sure what happened here, but after an hour-long soak and three water changes, they are still smelling just as bad, so I&#x27;m currently trying to air them out,</li>
            <li> The rest of it is a huge minus, which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of tangles in the dry winter - this brush detangles and doesn&#x27;t break hair</li>
            <li> As for me, i use a pick, but when it coems to brushing my hair (dry)</li>
            <li> dry hair</li>
            <li> and I used it to blow dry my hair once when I could not find my paddle brush.</li>
            <li> Dry</li>
            <li> I keep one in the shower, one to blow dry with, and have another one purchased before for my two terriers.  </li>
            <li> They work just as well on my hair when it is dry also.</li>
            <li> We use these brushes even with dry hair.</li>
            <li> They have sensitive scalps and never liked having their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> This wet brush brushed her hair out in roughly 10 strokes.</li>
            <li> -dom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first was introduced to them at my salon, because I have long, stringy, thin (and tangly) hair.</li>
            <li> I also use these on my two young daughters, who have thinner hair with loose curls (with a lot less fussing than other types of brushes).</li>
            <li> have long hair, down to my lower back.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone with a child that has thick, knotty hair.</li>
            <li> She wouldn&#x27;t go back to any other tool to brush her hair - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> My curly hair can only be brushed in the shower while using conditioner (elsewise it would result in a poofy, frizzy mess!).</li>
            <li> It looks like an ordinary brush, but it is far from it.</li>
            <li> Finally, no more tears from my 3 year old G/daughter.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders on combing through long wet hair without tangling....</li>
            <li> Takes out knots in long, wet hair without a struggle.</li>
            <li> The real wet brushes are terrific.  </li>
            <li> No more anxiety over getting ready and brushing my wet hair anymore, thank you, Wet Brush!!</li>
            <li> day I loose lots of hair - when shampooing, brushing, sleeping, walking, etc...  </li>
            <li> It works wonders to quickly and easily detangle the worst of hair.  </li>
            <li> Out of desperation I bought this brush - because the only other alternative was to shave my head!  </li>
            <li> They were not soft and hurt to use!!</li>
            <li> I can literally towel dry my hair and run these through with no problem or breakage at all!</li>
            <li> It removes tangles - wet or dry - without feeling like my hair is being torn out.  </li>
            <li> This brush runs through your hair without pulling when hair is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this was the &amp;#34;miracle brush&amp;#34; she made it out to be, but the cost was less than the last salon brush I bought</li>
            <li> recommend them whether you are black, white or anything in between.</li>
            <li> Wet hair, dry hair.</li>
            <li> Brush doesn&#x27;t pull my hair; wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I have only slightly curly hair</li>
            <li> She picked up this brush and it made short work of my tangled hair, with much less pain than I</li>
            <li> Kids, Adults, Wet, Dry</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter has thick long hair, and always dreaded brushing her hair, but now she loves to do it.</li>
            <li> For someone with wavy tangly hair, especially when wet after the shower, the Wet Brush is a godsend!!</li>
            <li> long, the other 24 in.</li>
            <li> Had read this in another review prior to purchase - but heard another dismiss it as not true and that the smell dissipated with time.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely curly long hair</li>
            <li> When wet, the metallic purple one drips purple color off of the brush and it actually stained my counter top :(</li>
            <li> I have two little girls, ages 4.5 and 1.5, both of whom cannot stand to have their hair brushed when either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Easy combing through thick or thin hair.  </li>
            <li> There is no pulling of my hair at all; wet or dry!</li>
            <li> Our hair texture and coarseness are all very different, yet it works well on all:  thin, curly, long, thick, short, very tangled.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t give it 6 stars. :)</li>
            <li> So I was shocked to see on Amazon how cheap they are!</li>
            <li> I even use it on my 14 month old&#x27;s delicate hair</li>
            <li> They do not pull your hair even when wet.</li>
            <li> The product I received was a knock off of the Wet Brush.  </li>
            <li> You use it when your hair is wet....</li>
            <li> They detangle wet hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li> We now refer to them as the &amp;#34;magic wet brush&amp;#34; in our house.  </li>
            <li> Getting out of the shower with wet hair and brushing there are no tangles at all.</li>
            <li> You can comb through your wet hair without pulling&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> And contrary to the name, I don&#x27;t use this on wet hair...</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is a miracle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used on wet hair and my hair is curly.</li>
            <li> My girls won&#x27;t use anything but The Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out when brushing wet.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses one on her wet hair and extensions avoiding pull the hair out of the seam.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended The Wet Brush, she swore that it changed their mornings from screaming to &amp;</li>
            <li> to not have crying when the kids get their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li> It takes out the tangles in wet hair with ease.</li>
            <li> I am use to using a harder brissel vented brush.</li>
            <li> The purple one leaked purple ink all over my hair when wet.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the wet brush.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to The Wet Brush by my hairdresser, bought one and have now purchased 2 additional</li>
            <li> I bought the wet brush for my granddaughter, it worked</li>
            <li> They help reduce fly-aways and don&#x27;t break wet hair.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush my hair stylist recommend me to try</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but will do</li>
            <li> We have been using the wet brush now for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Now I spend like 10 seconds brushing my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I immediately asked her about the brush, and it was the Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only had them a few days</li>
            <li> ; Then, we tried it on my daughter who, despite it hitting a few snags in her hair, actually didn&#x27;t scream (a miracle in itself).  </li>
            <li> She has been asing me foe the longest time to get her one (she has long hair down to her butt) and it is a pain, she says, brushing it.</li>
            <li> Looks like any other brush but works like no other brush,  My daughter has long thick hair</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush goes through hair easily, no detangler spray necessary.</li>
            <li> Apparently brushing wet hair is normally pretty difficult, but not with these!</li>
            <li> Trying not to repeat the same torture, I have fell for every gimmick on magic brushes, purchased from tv infomercials that show the brush blazing through the snarled mess without a hitch and have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> They actually do help my daughter tame her tangles.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is like a matted mess when I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> I decided to get one for me and one for my son and while they clearly tackle tangles in a way like no other they are not perfect.  </li>
            <li> However, my 4 star rating is due to the fact that after about 1.5-2 years of use, the bristles on this brush start to get &amp;#34;softer,&amp;#34; which makes it harder to comb through hair.</li>
            <li> and so I places my order ready for the disappointment that generally comes.</li>
            <li> This brush can get through my unruly thick, dry and coarse hair immediately!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush do not pull or tear her hair as much as other brushes.</li>
            <li> Yes there is a rubber smell due to the rubber part, but this doesn&#x27;t bother any of us.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt them and they prefer this brush over all the other brushes we had before.</li>
            <li> purchased these brushes (along with a mini-size) to keep in other places, like work and my purse.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t rip your hair out when trying to brush it wet!</li>
            <li> The wet brush has enabled them to brush without tears.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> No more fighting about keeping her hair brushed.  </li>
            <li> Idk what this brush has because it looks just like any other, but i promise it will work.</li>
            <li> The other brushes either hurt her or the bristles don&#x27;t fully penetrate her hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not pull and snag like other combs do.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this brush when I first opened the package.</li>
            <li> Well, The Wet Brush changed everything!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, since they look like other brushes, but they work</li>
            <li> These brushes, while you do have to work to get the tangles out, don&#x27;t hurt her like every other brush, so she brushes her hair when asked without argument or drama.  </li>
            <li> However, while brushing through tangles it did not hurt or pull as much as other brushes or combs had.</li>
            <li> They have been a small miracle following their swims.  </li>
            <li> so she now can brush it out in the shower, the other I use at my Salon.</li>
            <li> Found mom and other daughter always stealing it.  </li>
            <li> No more losing clumps of hair trying to comb it out with a regular comb.</li>
            <li> Be careful!  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair and always had trouble brushing it.  </li>
            <li> Hair in the morning was always a battle that usually ended with the 4yo going out the door without her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> My daughter refuses to use any other hairbrush either in or out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> and I could give me daughter the other one.  </li>
            <li> Glides through wet hair!</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t know better, I would think they were knockoffs. :(</li>
            <li> Goes through unruly wet hair without pain!</li>
            <li> Ones for home the other stays in our travel bag.</li>
            <li> As a single Dad with little to no hair on his head</li>
            <li> My sister recommended the wet brush to me a couple months ago due to its ouch less brushing.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but they really work well to get tangles out of wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a SUPER tender-headed little girl, and after trying other &amp;#34;tangle-free&amp;#34; brushes, I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> My 9-year old daughter has very thick hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that I lose any less hair with this brush than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had such a hard time brushing my daughters hair until now.</li>
            <li> Hardly feels like it is doing anything on my waist length curly hair but definitely gets thru the tangles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long - past her shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of all the long-haired women that said this brush really works-</li>
            <li> I know, sounds gross, but I&#x27;d usually compensate by putting it up or wear the messy beach wave</li>
            <li> and it was difficult for me to use, sort of glossed over the surface without really brushing.</li>
            <li> I was getting a Keratin treatment and my long past shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> Get a real wet brush, not these knock offs.  </li>
            <li> We both have coarse, kinky, thick hair.</li>
            <li> It is thick, coarse and curly/frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Since I tend to use clips when styling my hair it is not a big deal, but you should know this if you have a thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> husband loves that I can wear my hair down now.  </li>
            <li> it will not allow me to comb from scalp down from the start.</li>
            <li> Brushes through wet hair without ripping your hair out!!</li>
            <li> My 5 year olds will never let me comb their hair with any other brush!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, and wavy hair that gets extremely tangled after I shower.  </li>
            <li> For the past few years, I have simply detangled a few times per week in the shower with lots of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my very fussy granddaughters (4,5and7) with long tangled hair who whine and hate having their hair brushed.  </li>
            <li> I am 43 and have colored and slightly damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I use MUCH less product now than I did</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not lying, I seta helped my hair in less than 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I have a black one that I like</li>
            <li> I am half black, my daughter is a quarter.</li>
            <li> After use my thick, curly hair was left limp.  </li>
            <li> No pulling, much less breaking of hair.</li>
            <li> I do feel it is less damaging on hair</li>
            <li> so it breaks less strands.</li>
            <li> My hair is untangled in less than half the time and with virtually no pain.  </li>
            <li> For the past 3 years I&#x27;ve damaged my hair to the point that it would take me 30mins-1hr to de-tangle it after it was wet.</li>
            <li> I usually have to de-tangle while still in the shower with a wide toothed comb and lots of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> it is a mess if I don&#x27;t manage it.</li>
            <li> No more tears when coming granddaughter&#x27;s wet hair.</li>
            <li> They get out of the tub and hair is a woven mess and brings on tears trying to comb/brush.  </li>
            <li> When she washed her she would not comb the tangles out and it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> No more tears while brushing out knotted wet hair.</li>
            <li> Anyone with long thick unruly hair should give it a go.</li>
            <li> The girls have long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have a lot of long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> Their hair is so tightly curled it used to take forever to brush.</li>
            <li> Standard brushes are difficult to use when their long hair is wet, and I&#x27;m not sure how this brush differs in design, but it works so well.  </li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and have had it like that all my life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an incredibly bad stink, past anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled before on a product, even the cheap plastic stuff from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts down on the time and effort required to tame the beast on my head.</li>
            <li> instead even the price might be a little bit</li>
            <li> I threw the brush in the garbage, and it took about 5 minutes to work the little fish hook bristles out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Buy one; your little one will thank you.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this little brush removes tangles.</li>
            <li> I have a little girl who is in a wheelchair.  </li>
            <li> It has made our mornings a little easier; she loves it.</li>
            <li> this brush is amazing-- my hair gets tangled real bad after i wash it and by the time i get done combing it i pull out alot-</li>
            <li> So my husband bought one of these brushes a few months ago and since then my kids fight over the brush.  </li>
            <li> after a few rinses.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to brush all of her hair because I start at the bottom and work my way up...</li>
            <li> My girls are 10 &amp; 7 and up until I bought these brushes I have been combing their hair everyday and fighting with them and their knots.  </li>
            <li> They work on coarse hair, frail thin hair, and curly hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a battle everyday to keep the knots and tangles out.  </li>
            <li> I keep waiting but have had them for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money, it does nothing to the tangles at all.  </li>
            <li> thick wet  hair.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to sweep the bathroom floor everyday because there is no breakage!&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been using it for a few months now and cant imagine my life without it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed is that one of the brushes paint started coming off a few months</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money, it does nothing to the tangles at all.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this brush on my hair a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I bought a few brushes for me and also bought them for my nieces.</li>
            <li> A few weeks after ordering these brushes on Amazon, I saw the identical brushes on an end cap in Toys R Us.</li>
            <li> and there are so few strands of hair lost</li>
            <li> But is dissipates after a few days.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the handle on the brush is so flat, thin and very hard.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed product, but I was able to dry her hair straight, in small sections, so she wouldn&#x27;t wake up in horrific snarls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And no more sore hands from raking the other brushes thru!  </li>
            <li> A lot less screaming in the mornings!</li>
            <li> It seems to pull on the hair very little (thus causing little pain with detangling), but does get all the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> her mother reports that there is no more screaming and crying after bath time.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, once our hair dried, it was softer than usual.</li>
            <li> long thin lots of hair.  </li>
            <li> No more crying when it&#x27;s time to brush her hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird, this brush looks like every single other brush out there.  </li>
            <li> Please know I only point this out in order to show that it works on all hair types, thick, thin, curly, etc.  </li>
            <li> It has held up without a single broken bristle in over a year.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to brush her hair and not as painful an experience for her anymore.</li>
            <li> And since it&#x27;s a two-pack, I have another one in the wings for when this one is past its prime.  </li>
            <li> No more complaints from her.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that brushes could be that different</li>
            <li> No more fighting over brushes.  </li>
            <li> My usual routine was brushing my hair before washing it, and then I&#x27;d have to use lots of conditioner and a wide-toothed comb to brush out the tangles in the shower.  </li>
            <li> No more tears or battles.  </li>
            <li> The few folks that have complained about the smell either have hyper-sensitive noses or they are brushing mustaches or nose</li>
            <li> no more problems with tangles</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to hear screaming or crying anymore because the knots are no match for this brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy a few for stocking stuffers this Christmas!  </li>
            <li> No more tears when my wife helps our youngest brushes her hair.</li>
            <li> It looks like an ordinary hairbrush.</li>
            <li> No more tears when the granddaughters sleep over.</li>
            <li> No more tears on the daughter,</li>
            <li> There are some small tangles</li>
            <li> what usually took me 10.  </li>
            <li> There are no more tears with this hairbrust.</li>
            <li> There are no more tears in our morning hair routine.  </li>
            <li> No more screaming of tangles</li>
            <li> There are no more arguments in the morning and they don&#x27;t leave the house looking unkempt or homeless.</li>
            <li> Looks like an ordinary brush, but &amp;#34;glides&amp;#34; over hair to prevent tearing or ripping.</li>
            <li> I bought a small one to keep in her swim bag</li>
            <li> No more detangler...</li>
            <li> It takes less than 5 minutes now and it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair!!  </li>
            <li> Less tears when it comes to brushing!!</li>
            <li> I am very tender headed and have had a horrible time brushing out knots my entire life.</li>
            <li> he hurts a lot and hates being brushed after a bath since it is painful to him no matter how careful I am...</li>
            <li> It might be helpful for those with straight hair, something not challenging, but not my THIN curly hair, too difficult!  </li>
            <li> While the brush does wonders for getting the knots out,  it leaves behind a very noticeable unpleasant rubbery smell in my hair.</li>
            <li> He was having a hard time getting the knots out of his hair after shampooing and I found this on Amazon as a solution.  </li>
            <li> So hard to say if the frizz is breakage or surly gray strands coming thru.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> She wont even brush her hair herself because its so hard for her to do.</li>
            <li> I dreaded washing my hair or going to the beach because it  was so hard to get the tangles out and in the process</li>
            <li> But I can hardly wait.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two granddaughters who hated to have their hair brushed are big fans but the biggest fan is</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with the Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> I creepily tell everyone I know about it and have converted two people to Wet Brush</li>
            <li> Two girls with thick, curly, snarly hair.</li>
            <li> This brush allowed me to brush the knots out of  my thick curly hair without almost reducing me to tears.</li>
            <li> but I have really thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> My 4yo has curly hair and my 5yo has thick hair.</li>
            <li> With the WetBrush it takes me longer to brush my hair because I now have to work out some of the knots with my fingers, whereas before a stiffer bristled brush would have forced the knot apart.</li>
            <li> I have thick medium length hair which is wavy and has always tangled after washing, even with conditioner.</li>
            <li> No more screaming at bath time!</li>
            <li> Almost unbelievable!</li>
            <li> No more tears after bath!</li>
            <li> and there are no more tangles, knots, and broken hair.  </li>
            <li> these handle my hair without tangling it up worse like some brushes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick and course, and hard to comb, this is THEIR brush to have!</li>
            <li> (process of teasinging up the hair before applying color and foil but leaves hair with serious tangles).</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it because they won&#x27;t cry and you won&#x27;t feel horrible brushing their hair.</li>
            <li> After years of spending time in the mornings painfully pulling out tangles, or saying forget it, and putting her hair in a knotty ponytail, we can finally brush her hair in the mornings and she can even do it herself!</li>
            <li> Horrible - product  - READ the NEGATIVE REVIEWS first.</li>
            <li> but I would expect something that at least would help!</li>
            <li> She has very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy, curly hair</li>
            <li> He uses it on his daughter who has very thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used one of these on my hair and I was shocked at how well it went through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> My girls are addicted to these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> She has always had a frizz from broken hair shafts.</li>
            <li> We both have thin hair</li>
            <li> These particular ones in the metallic finish  have this terrible rubbery chemical odor, like a car tire that just does not seem to dissipate!  </li>
            <li> Both of them have long, very thick hair and hated brushing their hair.  </li>
            <li> No more painful brushing</li>
            <li> With her hair type, she can end up with very thick looking locks!  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters who both have thick hair that tangles really bad</li>
            <li> I know some of you will be skeptical (as I was) but please read on.  </li>
            <li> They were as skeptical as I was, so I&#x27;d hand them their brush and tell them to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I have tried brushes like this before</li>
            <li> I was skeptical ordering this brush</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> For a 2 pk, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> I would hate for someone unfamiliar with the wet brush to purchase these and then be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> it is usually horrible to comb out wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of you who have crazy hair like mine, I recommend you replace the brush every 6 months or so.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the reviews raving about this brush I was very skeptical - it is a brush.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to get a comb or brush through.  </li>
            <li> One day my sister told me she had a friend who used this brush on her kids who had bad hair, so she bought it for my niece.</li>
            <li> For anyone who has a girl with longish hair - don&#x27;t hesitate to get one of these, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HATE brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone that has a difficult time brushing out tangles!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has the worst bedhead when waking up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful when I get a shower.</li>
            <li> and I HATE to comb it!  </li>
            <li> Of course you have your tugs on the worst tangles, but truly it&#x27;s tugs not ripping the hair out.</li>
            <li> If I clip my hair in sections I breeze through even the worst of snags without losing chunks of hair in the process, but I cannot pull it through my hair otherwise.  </li>
            <li> However, as soon as I removed them from the package I noticed a terrible chemical odor.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Quick delivery, perfect condition.  Love these brushes.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I recommend these brushes all the time.  I actually opened my mouth to recommend these to my stylist, and then he pulled one out himself to detangle my hair.  They&#x27;re that good!  My oldest daughter has mixed hair, and she can actually do her own hair in the morning with these.  I have every bathroom stocked with these.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Bought this for my 7 year old niece to brush her hair. Works great for wet or dry hair. The bristles on this brush do not pull or tear her hair as much as other brushes. It is much easier to brush her hair and not as painful an experience for her anymore. Yay! Bought several of these for family members. I even use it now on my own hair. So happy my friend recommended this brush to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review what the brush is like, once I&#x27;m able to USE them.  They -look- perfect and usable.  Which is a plus.  The rest of it is a huge minus, which is unfortunate. I don&#x27;t like giving negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the product arrived in a box without any padding for the brushes, just the packages the brushes would come in, right off the shelf. The problem wasn&#x27;t the brushes! They looked fine despite the packing job, but the SMELL out of the box and ON the brushes, was like they&#x27;d been in a smoker&#x27;s household or salvaged from a housefire. Even a bleach and vinegar soak isn&#x27;t getting the smell out. It&#x27;s an incredibly bad stink, past anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled before on a product, even the cheap plastic stuff from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what happened here, but after an hour-long soak and three water changes, they are still smelling just as bad, so I&#x27;m currently trying to air them out, outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using them, if I&#x27;m able to and if the smell comes out.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that breaks off easily.  This is the gentlest brush I&#x27;ve found.  Breakage much reduced, so I&#x27;m very pleased.  And since it&#x27;s a two-pack, I have another one in the wings for when this one is past its prime.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!  Went right through mine and my daughter&#x27;s tangles.  No more complaints from her.  I had my doubts but they work great!!</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t magic or powered by &amp;#34;nano technology&amp;#34;. They don&#x27;t know when you&#x27;ve run into a snarl in your hair. They are soft, and nicely shaped. I haven&#x27;t noticed that I lose any less hair with this brush than any other I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s ok. I have one in my purse and one in the bathroom at home. I think my next brush will be a boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry it brushes my hair like no other brush or comb can...really awesome product,....&lt;br /&gt;A must to have!</li>
            <li> You need to try this brush.  I was skeptical that brushes could be that different but this one really is amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t rip through you hair and feels just so good to use.  I bought them for my little granddaughters too and they really love them.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  I can&#x27;t imagine every buying another kind.  I will definitely recommend this one</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever for comfort and not tangles on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Changed our lives. Two girls with thick, curly, snarly hair. Bedtime used to be a disaster of tears and tangles. No longer. These brushes are magic. BUY it. Makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> Rated the best by kids with long curly hair, they asked for this one specifically after using another like it.</li>
            <li> these brushes are awesome. i have super long hair that gets easily tangled and i can finally brush my hair without pain</li>
            <li> So my husband bought one of these brushes a few months ago and since then my kids fight over the brush.  They take it and never put it back so I ordered one for each person in the family and viola!! No more fighting over brushes.  Yes there is a rubber smell due to the rubber part, but this doesn&#x27;t bother any of us.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt them and they prefer this brush over all the other brushes we had before.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever!  Gets through my wet long baby fine hair with amazing speed and no damage! ! I&#x27;m amazed and impressed and grateful!  If your hair is baby fine, yet thick and somewhat wavy - buy with confidence!  Does incredibly well on dry hair too - it let me keep my curl for days without flattening them out- another.time saver! They have earned loyal fan for life.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair and this is the only brush that can get through my wet tangled hair.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Hooray!  No more tears from my 5 and 7 year old girls!  These brushes work great on wet or dry hair.  One daughter has hair about 12 in. long, the other 24 in. and both are so happy I got these brushes that somehow don&#x27;t hurt when they hit tangles.  So worth the money!</li>
            <li> Works fabulous! My daughter has SUPER thick hair and is always a struggle to brush, these have been amazing!</li>
            <li> This brush allowed me to brush the knots out of  my thick curly hair without almost reducing me to tears. I am very tender headed and have had a horrible time brushing out knots my entire life. Thank goodness I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 of these!!!  Once I used it with my long hair I WAS AMAZED!  I do not know WHY this brush works but it does!  I bought others for gifts!  I swear by this brush!!!</li>
            <li> Great brush, I LOVE it, thanks</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They are really great!</li>
            <li> Works great for medium to long, fine hair.  It was a good price for the two-pack.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. Love how they don&#x27;t snag at knots and makes hair real smooth for blow drying. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish I found The Wet Brush brush earlier!  It removes tangles - wet or dry - without feeling like my hair is being torn out.  Everyone who has tried it has wanted to buy one.  I&#x27;ve bought them as gifts for 2 young girls with very fine hair.  Their Moms love that they don&#x27;t argue about brushing their hair anymore!  (The 2 pack is just two individual brush packages put together.)</li>
            <li> Great brushes and work as advertised.  Brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair was a nightmare for 5 years before I bought these.  I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about a year now and they work great!  Cut through knots with fair ease and cause very little stress on the hair for my daughter during brushing.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a child that has thick, knotty hair.</li>
            <li> Everytime my daughter took a shower brushing through her hair was a fight. Not anymore. A friend of ours had this brush when we were on vacation together we tried and have been fans every since. I ordered it while on vacation and it was waiting for us when we got back!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re officially my daughters favorite hairbrush. They have sensitive scalps and never liked having their hair brushed. This saved our sanity!</li>
            <li> Best brush for long hair. I have a lot of tangles in the dry winter - this brush detangles and doesn&#x27;t break hair</li>
            <li> Bought these two for my parents after falling in love with my own wet brush!  It brushes out your hair SO easily.  At first it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s brushing out the tangles at all but a few seconds in you realize your hair is all brushed out and nothing hurt!</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush:&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first Wet Brush at a Sally&#x27;s and was just AMAZED at how easily it moved through my hair. I have fine hair, but a lot of it: I need conditioner AND a little after-shower serum to work a pick through my hair and it takes awhile.  Forget that: I use the brush most exclusively now and its so fast!&lt;br /&gt;This particular Wet Brush:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these brushes (along with a mini-size) to keep in other places, like work and my purse.  The issue I&#x27;m having is that they smell pretty strongly...after a few rinses.  I&#x27;m going to try a heavier detergent (maybe shampoo??).&lt;br /&gt;For what its worth, the first brush I bought had a raised logo (same color as brush) where these have a black sticker/stamp (not raised).  I don&#x27;t know if they switched manufacturers or what...</li>
            <li> Perfect item - works just as described it would !</li>
            <li> AMAZING brush!! I bought the 2 pack (one for me and one for my daughter) due to the good reviews. THIS BRUSH WORKS!!!!!! My daughter, as well as myself, have hair that tangles like you would not believe, and is completely unmanagable when wet. With this brush, it goes right through my hair (which is thick and wavey) and right through my daughter&#x27;s hair (which is thin and straight). It&#x27;s so amazing, I tell everyone I know to get one. I have bought more as gifts for family and friends. I have even talked my salon into getting some. Just Fantastic !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I  have searched for a brush to brush my daughters thick long blonde sensitive head of hair!  She used to be in tears at hair brushing time..not anymore..this brush is honestly one of the best brushes if not the best for easily brushing through tangled long hair wet or dry!!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has long curly hair that mats easily.  He was having a hard time getting the knots out of his hair after shampooing and I found this on Amazon as a solution.  He loves it and frequently forgets to bring it on his visits home, so I ordered the two pack to have an extra on hand.  I don&#x27;t know what particular features make it different than a regular small paddle brush but he says it is really easy to brush out the knots while he&#x27;s under the shower head.  A nice feature is that the hair is captured in the brush instead of ending up on the walls and in the drain!</li>
            <li> I love the brushes and so does my child! It doesn&#x27;t pull tons if hair out like my others ones do!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush and loved it so much, I bought three more for my teenage girls.  They don&#x27;t rip your hair out when trying to brush it wet!</li>
            <li> Definately get tangled out easier than anything yet! No more painful brushing</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out when i brush out at all.  I love it.  I also bought one for my elderly mom, my daughter, my goddaughter, and my niece for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have the biggest tangled mess on top of my head.  My whole life I have struggled with knotted curly hair.  I recently moved to a new area of the country with hard water and when I washed my hair it felt like the strands had fused themselves together and that was after using gallons of conditioner.  Out of desperation I bought this brush - because the only other alternative was to shave my head!  It was a miracle!  In fact it combed through my hair so effectively and painlessly that I couldn&#x27;t believe that my tangles were gone.  But when I followed with my wide tooth pick it slid right through my hair!  I bought this brush for my niece who also inherited the tangled hair gene - her mother reports that there is no more screaming and crying after bath time.  If I could give this product 10 stars I would!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! Both my husband and daughter have long, wavy hair that knios and tangles very easily. They both have traded in their old brushes for these.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my college-aged daughter who has waist-length hair. She can&#x27;t believe how it just brushes right through wet hair, and reports that she is noticing much less hair loss in the shower and in the brush. She wouldn&#x27;t go back to any other tool to brush her hair - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Both of them have long, very thick hair and hated brushing their hair.  I don&#x27;t know exactly how this brush is different from any other brush - but it is like magic.  They said it is the best brush they&#x27;ve ever had and there are no more tangles, knots, and broken hair.  One of the rare instances where you can believe the hype and all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s stress free on my hair and combs through tangles without breakage like other brushes I&#x27;ve used. My hair is on the thicker side &amp; wavy.  I also use these on my two young daughters, who have thinner hair with loose curls (with a lot less fussing than other types of brushes). I would rate this brush 5 stars coming right out of the box. However, my 4 star rating is due to the fact that after about 1.5-2 years of use, the bristles on this brush start to get &amp;#34;softer,&amp;#34; which makes it harder to comb through hair. Also, some of the little beads at the top started to come off, making the bristles scratch your scalp (not a big deal to me, but my daughters complain about it). I bought this new pack to replace my 2-year old Wet Brush and the bristle flexibility difference between the two is very noticeable. Fortunately, it&#x27;s a cheap enough brush that I don&#x27;t mind replacing it when it gets worn down.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best brushes ever.  My husband has longer hair and had been buying Wal Mart brushes, which I used and which we had massive hair pulled out each time we brushed.  These brushes are so gently --they untangle, wet or dry hair with little hair being removed.  My granddaughter with thick long hair loves these as her usual brush hurts her--even as much as I love my granddaughter I couldn&#x27;t give ours to her.  I guess I need to buy more.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and was a great value. These cheaper on Amazon for 2 then what I could have purchased 1 from locally. They do not pull your hair even when wet.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter no longer cries or fights getting her haired brushed after I bought this for my daughter in law to try. She loves it and so do I. I ended up getting myself one. Definitely a wise investment.  It&#x27;s a great brush and worth the price.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick and course, and hard to comb, this is THEIR brush to have! It looks like an ordinary brush, but it is far from it. I can&#x27;t ever run my fingers through my hair through the day, but I can now! Even at the end of the day, my hair hasn&#x27;t tangled up all day! I will never use another brush. My stepdaughter has the same problem and it actually detangles her hair too. She can do her own hair now lol</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! Having used the &#x27;other&#x27; detangling brushes on the market for my daughters hair and given up because they just couldn&#x27;t get the tangles out without breaking hair and causing tears, these have made my life and theirs so much happier. I heard about these brushes through my local Toni &amp; Guy salon who use them!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush! Saves my hair...it is usually horrible to comb out wet. This brush does magic.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I have very long thick hair and have had it like that all my life. I now don&#x27;t have to use any conditioner or detangler in my hair thanks to this brush. I have since bought every female in my family one of these brushes.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has very long curly hair. I used to dread brushing her hair. I used to have to brush it while she was in the bath with conditioner in it, and that still wasn&#x27;t pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;She calls these her MAGIC BRUSHES!!&lt;br /&gt;They look cheap, but they&#x27;re amazing! It takes a few minutes to brush all of her hair because I start at the bottom and work my way up...that probably makes sense to the ladies reading this ;)&lt;br /&gt;You will NOT regret this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair leaving it softer and more manageable. Love this brush.</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old has the most difficult hair to brush.  I am amazed at how this brush works!!!  This is the best brush for anyone who has a child that has a tender head with lots of tangles!!!!  My child is a swimmer, and keeps this in her swim bag.  I would recommend this brush to anyone that has a difficult time brushing out tangles!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are a must for girls with long hair</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best.  They are very good quality and a good price.  This brush runs through your hair without pulling when hair is wet or dry.  I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> best brush I&#x27;ve come across so far for brushing tangled hair.  My daughters (6 and 8) do not complain when I brush their hair with this one.  I received the two colors as shown.  I also got the smaller travel brushes for their dance bags and those work just as well.</li>
            <li> The product I received was a knock off of the Wet Brush.  The brushes in the package are actually labeled Wet Brush Pro and while they look similar to the other, actual, wet brushes that I own, they are neither soft nor pull free.  I would hate for someone unfamiliar with the wet brush to purchase these and then be disappointed.  Get a real wet brush, not these knock offs.  Very upsetting that I have to hassle with a return.  Even more upsetting to think that these brushes are being foisted off on unsuspecting purchasers as the real thing.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes I have ever bought for my daughters! They get the tangles and knots out without pulling their hair.</li>
            <li> Second purchase to give to my granddaughters.  I don&#x27;t know how these work, but they do. both of my granddaughters have looong hair which gets very tangled in the shower.  I didn&#x27;t know if these would work, but saw them advertised in a magazine so I had to give them a try..</li>
            <li> These brushes work great!  They really help with tangly hair!  Amazing!</li>
            <li> My long hair gets so tangly, and this brush helps so much!! No detangler required, and it works better than any other brush.</li>
            <li> If you have any tangles in your hair, buy this right now.  I am 43 and have colored and slightly damaged hair.  This brush has saved my hair.</li>
            <li> For my nieces … fine for their needs … have super long hair …works for them. … TRY IT … MAY WORK FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I spent time to read the review and compare with other similar product (on TV commerical a lot).&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this one instead even the price might be a little bit higer.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes good for dry and wet hair and delivered what I expected for my daughter&#x27;s long and thick tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;It really pays to read and compare product before you spend your money</li>
            <li> This is the best brush.  You use it when your hair is wet....no tangles.  This is a great stocking stuffer.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the original only sparkly. Too bad I can&#x27;t give it 6 stars. :)</li>
            <li> Bought these to brush our young daughters&#x27; hair because they are sensitive to tangle yanks.  These definitely help.  I would say that they don&#x27;t yank tangles because the bristles seem to be a bit more flexible, so they give instead of pull.  Probably takes a few more passes to get deeper into the hair, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old granddaughter has curly hair, and she had a lot of trouble with tangles.  Now she brushes her hair with no fuss, both in the shower and any time she wants with no pain.  With her hair type, she can end up with very thick looking locks!  For anyone who has a girl with longish hair - don&#x27;t hesitate to get one of these, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I have one, too, and it makes my hair smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes a lot.  They detangle wet hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li> These brushes somehow have made my girls want to brush their hair.  We now refer to them as the &amp;#34;magic wet brush&amp;#34; in our house.  My girls are 10 &amp; 7 and up until I bought these brushes I have been combing their hair everyday and fighting with them and their knots.  The wet brush has enabled them to brush without tears.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> A friend told me it was fantastic on long, tangled hair.  It does the same job as any good brush does.  My 2 granddaughters love having their own specially colored brushes, though!</li>
            <li> It works wonders on combing through long wet hair without tangling....I love it and so does my daughter!!! she tries to take mine even though she has her own...</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for brushing wet hair. No pulling, tugging, ripping or stretching of your hair. De tangles without the need to add products to your hair. LOVE.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and they manage to remove a lot of lint from my hair (eww). I also bought some of these as gifts and everyone I&#x27;ve given these brushes to just raves about how great they work. I have stick straight, baby fine hair that rats up easily and these handle my hair without tangling it up worse like some brushes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> If you have thin long hair, this is the perfect brush for you. Both my daughter and I have thin long hair, and we have no problems with this brush pulling our hair out, or creating more tangles. I even loved this brush so much that I bought it as a gift for my mother.</li>
            <li> Works amazing for wet tangly hair</li>
            <li> My toddlers love the no tears hair combing</li>
            <li> Works great.  I was surprised at how smoothly it went through very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Miracle brush for my daughters long hair!</li>
            <li> I have two girls - alot of hair burshing goes on in the house and these brushes are AMAZing! I bought the frist one at a salon and was excited to learn that AMAZON sells them!! They work on coarse hair, frail thin hair, and curly hair. THE BEST EVER - wish i had one when i was growing up.</li>
            <li> I was asked by my daughter for one of these brushes for Christmas, she had tried one and loved it.  She has very thick curly hair and I got all my &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; and myself one and I love it.  Getting out of the shower with wet hair and brushing there are no tangles at all.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but these really do work great - they work best in the shower but do a good job dry as well.</li>
            <li> I love wetbrushes. I don&#x27;t even brush my hair with anything but one now! :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic. You can comb through your wet hair without pulling&lt;br /&gt; it out or hurting. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My kids don&#x27;t complain when I brush their hair.  Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Looks like any other brush but works like no other brush,  My daughter has long thick hair and it&#x27;s a battle everyday to keep the knots and tangles out.  A hairdresser friend recommended this brush and it was life altering.  No more fighting about keeping her hair brushed.  Hair brushing is no longer a chore but a pleasure to do.  Woo Hoo!!</li>
            <li> WOW.  This is an amazing brush!  I know some of you will be skeptical (as I was) but please read on.  If you have long hair, or young daughters with long hair, you&#x27;ll want to give this brush a try!  And contrary to the name, I don&#x27;t use this on wet hair... only  dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had long hair and finding a good detangling brush was never an easy task.  I&#x27;ve spend more than I can remember on all different shapes and sizes of boar hair bristle brushes, from cheap to expensive.  A good friend told me about this brush and how it only took a few strokes to get through a tangled head of hair.  I couldn&#x27;t believe this was the &amp;#34;miracle brush&amp;#34; she made it out to be, but the cost was less than the last salon brush I bought so I figured I&#x27;d give a try.  If it didn&#x27;t work I could always give it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was this brush comes in wide selection of colors and designs.  Not super important for me, but I could see how young girls would love the variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the brush I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it the first night.  I have long, fine hair but there&#x27;s a lot of it.  Some days I curl my hair, others I straighten it.  The curly days are when my hair gets the most tangled.  My usual routine was brushing my hair before washing it, and then I&#x27;d have to use lots of conditioner and a wide-toothed comb to brush out the tangles in the shower.  This was usually followed by a healthy dousing of detangler and/or leave-in conditioner after I got out. This brush makes that practice obsolete!  It only took about 5 swipes through my hair to get rid of the tangles.  After that I just kept brushing because the brush has long bristles w/ little balls on the end that feel great on your scalp!  And the amazing this was I lost very little hair.  My old brushes would pull out hair as they went through the tangles.  This one didn&#x27;t at all!  And after your hair is washed/conditioned, all you have to do is towel dry and brush right through itagain.  I use MUCH less product now than I did before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so amazed by this brush that I bought more for my friends.  They were as skeptical as I was, so I&#x27;d hand them their brush and tell them to give it a try.  And they ended up being just as impressed as me.  One of my friends used it on her 4 year old niece (who has very long hair) and she didn&#x27;t wiggle or cry at all when her hair was brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am normally a HUGE fan of these wet brushes and I own several of them.  These particular ones in the metallic finish  have this terrible rubbery chemical odor, like a car tire that just does not seem to dissipate!  I keep waiting but have had them for a few weeks now and the smell is still there.  I would NOT buy this color/finish of these brushes but would definitely buy the regular ones.</li>
            <li> We use this brush while in the shower with conditioner in our hair.  Combs it through without breaking hairs.  Works great!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. Pulls through my curly hair with no fuss and leaves my hair smooth and detangled.  Highly reccommend</li>
            <li> I bought the two pack of these brushes because of all the good reviews it received. My daughter has long hair and it gets tangled when she sleeps. My wife uses a comb, so I took the 2nd brush. I also have long hair. So I get out of the shower and try the brush. After the second pull through my hair the brush gets stuck. I get the brush out of my hair and there are four of the bristles from the brush, stuck in my hair. I threw the brush in the garbage, and it took about 5 minutes to work the little fish hook bristles out of my hair.</li>
            <li> For the past 3 years I&#x27;ve damaged my hair to the point that it would take me 30mins-1hr to de-tangle it after it was wet. All because of the too much ironing. I&#x27;ve bought numerous brushes that say they will de tangle my hair and yet they&#x27;re just another brush. One day my sister told me she had a friend who used this brush on her kids who had bad hair, so she bought it for my niece. I got it too. And I&#x27;m not lying, I seta helped my hair in less than 5 mins. Idk what this brush has because it looks just like any other, but i promise it will work. I even bought one for my friend who has the same problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush for difficult hair.  I guess I was hoping it would be a miracle brush or something.  Like, maybe one swipe of the brush and you look like a hair model.  LOL!  It does work perfectly in the shower and the bristles are gentler than most brushes like it.  I purchased a 2-pack.  It&#x27;s also VERY light, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever for those with sensitive scalp or snarls !!!</li>
            <li> Grandchild and I have searched high and low for brush for tangles.We found it!  All Grandmothers should order - the brush is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Glides right through curly, straight, dry or wet hair.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t cry anymore when I brush her long hair.</li>
            <li> It came smelling like cigarettes. The brush was in good condition but it smelled of cigarette. I purchased this for my children and I was really upset that it stunk of cigarette.</li>
            <li> i dont know how this brush works but let me tell you its like magic! i have very long hair and it tangles easily, actually i was looking for a new brush because i broke my last one in half trying to detangle my hair. i saw the good reviews and decided to go for it, and im more than pleased with it. wash your hair lightly brush with this miracle of a brush and taraaa in less than 2 minutes your hair will be detangled, with minimal hair loss. it dosnt pull itch scratch i dosnt even feel like is going trough the hair. i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. good for wet hair. ok for dry</li>
            <li> My girls are super picky about their hairbrushes, but they love these. We only had to buy more because of a lost brush. Now I have one too!</li>
            <li> This is the only brush that I can use on my daughter without ensuing wailing.  It combs through even her most tangled and sweaty hair without pulling.  I started using the second brush and I really liked it.  A couple of weeks later, I used my old brush because of proximity and my eyes widened at the pain.  I hadn&#x27;t realized how much the brush had eased my own tangle issues.  This will be the only brush we use from now on.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how these brushes can brush through wet hair so smoothly, but I don&#x27;t care and I will never use a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush on my wet hair again!</li>
            <li> I have these in my car,  purse,  beach bag,  and all of the kids have their own. Doesn&#x27;t tear your hair,  very soft but gets the tangles out!</li>
            <li> this has made my daughters hair much nicer looking it is not spliting as much anymore she is much happier</li>
            <li> This brush is very gentle on my hair and would recommend it to anyone I loved it so much I bought 4</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair. Tons. Plus it&#x27;s super thick and I like to keep it long. Though I am thankful for my hair, it is a pain to brush out. With a regular brush it takes forever requiring lots of patience. The Wet Brush is a miracle and I thank my hair dresser every time I see her for recommending it. Holy smokes! It is seriously amazing. It detangles my hair like magic. It cuts down on the time and effort required to tame the beast on my head. I have recommended it to everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have crazy hair like mine, I recommend you replace the brush every 6 months or so.  It&#x27;s magical powers start to wear off. But every time I replace the old one with a new one I am amazed all over again how great the brush is.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Wet Brush 2 pack and only got 1. There is no contact information for this seller anywhere, whatsoever and because it&#x27;s a 3rd party seller through Amazon, I have no recourse but to have Amazon process a return and send the one I did get back. What a HUGE hassle. I already own one of these brushes and it&#x27;s great. I bought these for my nieces. I don&#x27;t want to return anything. I want the TWO brushes I ordered. Beauty Fulfillment you get a big fat ZERO as a seller.</li>
            <li> Yes! Finally a brush that doesn&#x27;t hurt me! I have thick, easily tangled hair and these brushes tame my tresses in no time. Best investment I have made in my haircare.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money, it does nothing to the tangles at all.  It works fine as a regular brush but it is very misleading that it is supposed to be a detangling brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing ON ALL HAIR TYPES!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them whether you are black, white or anything in between. They are fantastic. Best brush I&#x27;ve ever used on wet hair and my hair is curly. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, fine hair (and lots of it!).  I have always struggled with untangling my hair because I am very tender headed so I was beyond excited when my stylist used this brush on my hair during my last salon visit. I usually have to de-tangle while still in the shower with a wide toothed comb and lots of conditioner.  This brush is magical.  It cuts through tangles like a hot knife through butter.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s going through the hair but it is!  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> They are just wonderful.  My girls won&#x27;t use anything but The Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> My 8-year old LOVES this brush.  She doesn&#x27;t have any problems brushing the tangles out of her own hair now.  We use it both for wet hair and it works amazingly well on dry hair too!  Leaves it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have a toddler.  She hates for me to brush her hair.  It&#x27;s long - past her shoulders.  I needed a brush that would stop tears and get out the tangles with ease.  I use detangler spray and this brush.  WHAT A LIFESAVER!  No more tears or battles.  I have one for me and one for her.  My husband says it&#x27;s like a tiny massage.  These are the best brushes in the world.  I use them on wet and dry hair - adult and child.  You will not regret getting these brushes.  Best purchase of the year!</li>
            <li> The brush  stimulates your hair.</li>
            <li> I L.O.V.E. these brushes.  The few folks that have complained about the smell either have hyper-sensitive noses or they are brushing mustaches or nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair, down to my lower back.  For the past few years, I have simply detangled a few times per week in the shower with lots of conditioner.  When I was ready to head to work, I&#x27;d simply brush the top and the ends of my hair and balled it up in a bun.  It was impressive if I actually ran a brush through all my hair more than twice a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this brush, I can completely untangle all my hair within minutes!!  My hair is not curly and not bouncy-wavy... it&#x27;s somewhere in between.  I guess you can call it tangley.  That about sums it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last week, since I&#x27;ve been using the brushes, I have had so many people compliment my hair and tell me they never knew my hair was so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves that I can wear my hair down now.  I LOVE these brushes!  I also don&#x27;t pull out as much hair from the brushes as I used to with the other brushes.  THAT speaks VOLUMES to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I will buy more of these brushes and keep them on hand because my girls are threatening to run off with my brushes!</li>
            <li> These are perfect in every way.  They are colorful, sturdy and run through my hair just great, wet or dry.  Very nice price on these as well.</li>
            <li> One for me and one for my daughter. She has been asing me foe the longest time to get her one (she has long hair down to her butt) and it is a pain, she says, brushing it. She is 12 and loves it; it really helps with her knotts. As for me, i use a pick, but when it coems to brushing my hair (dry) it is great. I am not ripping out any hair (my hair is to teh middle of my back and has some wave to it, so it gets so knotty</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of all the long-haired women that said this brush really works- but it does!! I have really long hair and have always had problems with getting dredlocks and tangles at the back of my head, by the end of the day it is a mess if I don&#x27;t manage it. This come rocks</li>
            <li> My 9-year old daughter has very thick hair and we have tried so many hair brushes that we end up throwing away.  The other brushes either hurt her or the bristles don&#x27;t fully penetrate her hair.  The Wet Brush is the only one she has liked and it works well wet or dry.  Now, her hair actually looks brushed after she&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and a super sensitive scalp this brush did not hurt at all I would recommend this brush to everyone</li>
            <li> So first let me tell you I have very long hair (to middle of my back) - so please take this into account when considering my review.&lt;br /&gt;Every day I loose lots of hair - when shampooing, brushing, sleeping, walking, etc...  thankfully I have lots to spare!&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve aged, it seems to be frizzier - and is likely because of all the gray (colored red). So hard to say if the frizz is breakage or surly gray strands coming thru.&lt;br /&gt;But when using this brush on my wet hair - out of the shower - I still remove a hand full cluster of hair. I must work from the bottom to the top - it will not allow me to comb from scalp down from the start. Comparatively, if I use a wide tooth comb, I do not loose as much.&lt;br /&gt;On dry hair, I still loose hair regardless of the brush - this one no less than others. It does seem to be a bit silkier if I use this brush though.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have been using these brushes for a couple of months now and they both still smell as they did out of the packaging - like gasoline! And they are not in a drawer tucked away but out on a counter top exposed to air. I use nice fragrance products (e.g. leave-in conditioners) in my hair, only to be accosted by this smell as I brush it - or even if applying makeup or putting in contacts in the general area! Had read this in another review prior to purchase - but heard another dismiss it as not true and that the smell dissipated with time.  Please be aware - if you are sensitive to smell - this will be an issue for you.</li>
            <li> The brush is great for tangles, specically that my hair is very long and thick. The only problem is the handle on the brush is so flat, thin and very hard. It hurts your fingers after a while. If they made the handle with some type of support it would have been the perfect brush.</li>
            <li> Best brush I have, really helps with detangling.  My daughter is 6 and she doesn&#x27;t complain anymore.  Will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard raves from a friend about a wet brush and though I&#x27;ve had long hair most of my days I had no idea what they were.  I don&#x27;t know the magic, looks like a normal brush but brushing long hair is a breeze.</li>
            <li> As a single Dad with little to no hair on his head I have learned the hard way. These brushes were recommended to us by close friends. Both my girls like them much better than any other brushes we have tried. i don&#x27;t know how the work so well but I am just happy that they do work! no more problems with tangles</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced this to me and I was amazed at how there is NO pain when brushing out my very long (lower back) thick wet  hair. I got two so I can have one for home and give one to my new stylist to try!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to Express how much my family loves these brushes. I have a 12 year old with long hair and a tender head. Our mornings before school have been tear free with this brush.</li>
            <li> My two oldest daughters love these brushes one has curly hair the other straight. They both really love these wet brushes. fast shipping too. thanks</li>
            <li> These brushes are best thing since chocolate cake. I can now brush my daughters hair without the screaming. Her hair is long and always knotty. You will not regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  I keep one in my office for my daughter...you, as a dad, have to learn how to brush hair...it&#x27;s not a MAGIC brush where you can start at the top of the head and just start pulling down...but when you do it properly there are no yanks or pulls.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t any different than my current brush, It still hurt, I still was met with resistance. My brush from dollar tree is actually better and has a better quality handle as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out when brushing wet.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great on my daughter long hair, no more crying. And she does it by herself now, yeah THANKS</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! My hair tangles so easily when it is wet and usually requires three-four combing sessions to set angle, but this brush works miracles! It is painless and effective!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush to detangle wet thin hair. I now use this instead of a pick after I wash my hair. My daughter uses one on her wet hair and extensions avoiding pull the hair out of the seam.</li>
            <li> These brushes are simply WONDERFUL! I was skeptical at first but after using them on my self and multiple children, the results are magical. I don&#x27;t have to hear screaming or crying anymore because the knots are no match for this brush! A must buy and I only wish I would&#x27;ve discovered them sooner!!! I&#x27;ve purchased extras since then!!!</li>
            <li> Hairbrush is fine,but has a odd ,strong chemical odor. It smells cleaning fluid and I am hoping it dissipates !</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived so quickly and they were well packaged. I tried the brush and I LOVE it! I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve tried so many brushes that don&#x27;t work but this one is OUTSTANDING - I have baby fine hair but a ton of it and usually brushes break my hair because I get a lot of tangles. Now I don&#x27;t have to sweep the bathroom floor everyday because there is no breakage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering more for stocking stuffers! (I&#x27;m also ordering a few more for myself to stockpile)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> It really works. Wet hair, dry hair. Very gentle and effective. Great purchase for kids (and adults) with fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Hair was a constant issue in our house. My 5 year old daughter would complain, cry, squirm and avoid brushing her hair every day.  A friend recommended The Wet Brush, she swore that it changed their mornings from screaming to &amp;#34;please do my hair&amp;#34;. So I got the 2 pack. I can say from personal experience, this is the best brush I have ever used. My daughter and I have thin yet thick stick straight hair that rats easily. This brush went through my hair so easily, it was like brushing my hair with conditioner in it, but it didn&#x27;t have any on it. My daughter tried it next and... AMAZING. No tears. No de-tangle spray... nothing but the brush. I have no clue why this brush works the way it does... but it works fantastic! I would recommend it to everyone who is fighting the morning hair battle with their kids!</li>
            <li> I have gone through several hair brushes with my daughter&#x27;s hair.  These work very well to get tangle out without too much pulling.  My girls can even brush their own hair easily after a shower and get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> We bought this so everyone in the family  could have one.  An excellent product.  Very much worth the investment to not have crying when the kids get their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of buying cheap brushes so i wanted to invest in something a little bit more then a minimum cost hair brush. These works just fine i&#x27;ve been using them for about 6 months and i&#x27;ve made sure  to keep them clean so they stay in a better condition longer.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair. It did pull slightly and I had to readjust the brush, but that&#x27;s probably because my hair is so fine. It certainly didn&#x27;t rip out my hair even if I tried like a regular brush did. Made brushing my processed fine hair after a shower much faster.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Wet Brushes, they work incredibly well!  My hair is thick and straight, and tangles very easily, especially when wet.  I can literally towel dry my hair and run these through with no problem or breakage at all! Love it!</li>
            <li> My girls love this style of brush.  It has helped with knots and such with no pain!  : )  Yea!  It works great on super thick hair and thin hair.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great brush to tackle wet/dry tangles.</li>
            <li> This is my second personal brush I have bought for myself because I love it so much, I also got one for my mom and best friend. They LOVE them. Everyone who has ever tried it at my house are in shock. It glides through you hair so well. I have pretty thin curly hair and its snags 75% less then with a normal brush. Best thing ever!</li>
            <li> this brush is amazing-- my hair gets tangled real bad after i wash it and by the time i get done combing it i pull out alot- but with this brush it brushes right thru it and untangles it-- its amazing and a good buy for long hair</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome . I&#x27;ve had such a hard time brushing my daughters hair until now. Their hair is so tightly curled it used to take forever to brush. Now they brush their own and the us no crying from having their hair pulled.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my daughters long hair.  No more tears for sure!  Made for wet hair, don&#x27;t really like to use it on my dry hair.  I discovered it after my hairdresser used it on me and just had to have it.  I bought several since for gifts.</li>
            <li> I love these!!  My daughter has the worst bedhead when waking up.  I had always used a comb and it took nearly 30 mins to comb it out... until I found this brush! It takes less than 5 minutes now and it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair!!  This was a lifesaver for us!</li>
            <li> Everyone in our household loves these.  They take a little more patience in working through long, tangled hair but the brush also does not break off as much hair in the process.</li>
            <li> Great to use after Harley ride. Shampoo/Condition then section out hair and gently brush from ends up. Minimal hair loss. Yay! My niece who has a sensitive head like me loves this brush also. No longer whines when Mommy brushes hair.</li>
            <li> Make fast work of wet tangled hair</li>
            <li> I learned about the brush at the salon.  I bought it for my daughter who has a lot of hair and super curly.  Brushing her hair has always been such a task!  Now with this brush it&#x27;s a breeze and it doesn&#x27;t disturb her natural curl.  I&#x27;m so excite about it I&#x27;m going to buy a few for stocking stuffers this Christmas!  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I have tried brushes like this before but my best friend got me one for my birthday. The ease of brushing my hair wasnt exactly a shocker. I have curly and sometimes tangly hair and it was completely combed out in 4 strokes. No tangles. Ok. Great but not so impressive that Im so inclined to write a review. Then my 5 year old niece (who has ethnic tight curly hair that is contantly one giant ball of tangles in the back) used it after her shower. Normally, it takes me a good 15 minutes to brush out her hair, section by seciton. She wont even brush her hair herself because its so hard for her to do. I just cant describe in words the extent of these tangles. This wet brush brushed her hair out in roughly 10 strokes. No pulling. No ripping through her hair. No crying or screaming. She even snuck into my room the next morning to take my brush to brush her hair for church! I cant recommend this enough. These will be in everyones stocking for Christmas! It absolutely amazing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my son&#x27;s daughters when they were visiting me upon the recommendation of my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughters both have long hair and they love these brushes because they made brushing their hair painless.&lt;br /&gt;the brush removed tangles easily.  they loved these brushes.  I would highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li> 3 girls in the house with long hair and all 3 of us just love this brush. Untangles knots easily, makes hair nice &amp; soft. Bought one for myself and had to buy 2 more to share with my girls. My hair dresser is now selling these, recommends that we not use this brush with a blow dryer due to the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> My daughters loved the colors. They work very well and actually beyond my expectation. No more tears when my wife helps our youngest brushes her hair. Works good on dry hair too!!</li>
            <li> This is the only brush my 6 year old will let me use on her hair. She is very tender headed and screams when I use any other brush. Liked it so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this brush for any length hair. Brushes through wet hair without ripping your hair out!! You never have to worry about loosing hair again.</li>
            <li> Ok, I fell for the promise this brush was somehow different and almost magic at getting thru long, thick hair.  It&#x27;s a fine brush, but honestly does not seem special to me and does not work any better than other brushes I have that look similar.</li>
            <li> Two granddaughters who hated to have their hair brushed are big fans but the biggest fan is me!&lt;br /&gt;No more tears for grands!  Fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;Nana</li>
            <li> This is a good hairbrush for wet hair.  My daughter is always in the pool in the summer and she loves it</li>
            <li> Shipping was prompt, and product is great. My sister recommended the wet brush to me a couple months ago due to its ouch less brushing. I have a very tender scalp and am growing my hair out (longer than ever). This brush not only doesn&#x27;t hurt when brushing through even huge tangles, but eliminates the static that normally comes with paddle brushes! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Takes out knots in long, wet hair without a struggle. Well made.</li>
            <li> Brush was not color shown. I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered if I knew it wasn&#x27;t metallic.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes that I have ever owned. I bought these for my daughters who both have thick hair that tangles really bad and this worked beautifully. I did not even know this but I have really thick wavy hair and I used it to blow dry my hair once when I could not find my paddle brush. I cannot believe how great my hair turned out. This helped so much with the frizz. It does not pull and snag like other combs do.</li>
            <li> Bought for my young teen girls because their friend had one that &amp;#34;worked really good&amp;#34;....they were happy to get their own and these do work well getting the tangles out of long wet hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is the greatest product ever! I have fine hair that has gotten extremely tangled my entire life. This brush has completely changed that. It allows me to easily brush through wet hair without damaging it, and no longer leaves me embarrassed at the hairdresser when I come in with massive knots.</li>
            <li> Found this brush (twice the price) through my stylist who does a ton of ombr&amp;eacute; highlights. (process of teasinging up the hair before applying color and foil but leaves hair with serious tangles). It works wonders to quickly and easily detangle the worst of hair.  Hardly feels like it is doing anything on my waist length curly hair but definitely gets thru the tangles.  And no more sore hands from raking the other brushes thru!  It has held up without a single broken bristle in over a year.  Now Excited my daughter finally. Has enough hair to have her own now!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever made. It takes out the tangles in wet hair with ease. For kids its wonderful, no tears.</li>
            <li> This brush is ok, I have Corkskrew curls and when I used it with conditoner in my hair it did not snag or hurt...I have to her use to how soft it is in my hair..I am use to using a harder brissel vented brush.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this brush when I first opened the package. It looks like an ordinary hairbrush. But when I brushed my hair, the brush glided through with ease. I just used it the first time tonight on my wet hair and it was the quickest I ever brushed it. I have long hair that gets tangled. It&#x27;s awful when I get a shower. I felt like I was going bald because of how much hair I was pulling out. This brush is absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical ordering this brush but, I&#x27;m so glad I went with the ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few months now and cant imagine my life without it.&lt;br /&gt;My thin hair and sensitive scalp are very Thankful too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have!</li>
            <li> I have a SUPER tender-headed little girl, and after trying other &amp;#34;tangle-free&amp;#34; brushes, I was desperate.  It was an absolute chore to brush her hair each day.  Well, The Wet Brush changed everything!  It&#x27;s a great brush!  I have no idea why it is, but it just is!  Buy one; your little one will thank you.</li>
            <li> All I can say is my wife was amazed.  She loves it!  I conveniently gave her the gift after a shower.  Apparently brushing wet hair is normally pretty difficult, but not with these!</li>
            <li> No more tears when coming granddaughter&#x27;s wet hair. Fantastic brush!  Even the granddaughter&#x27;s moms are using this brush now. They call it &amp;#34;sharing it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this works, since it looks like all the others, but WOW! My 5 year olds will never let me comb their hair with any other brush! alittle water from a spray bottle in the morning, and the knots are gone! Great Product!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my granddaughter who has long ringlet hair.  Sh&#x27;e now brushing her hair herself!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This brush really does the trick! I have no idea what the secret is, but I&#x27;m glad it works. I bought three of these and all three people love them.</li>
            <li> great price vs what is offered in salons and even at target ($8.99).&lt;br /&gt;brush works well to detangle hair.  not a miracle brush but def one of the best!</li>
            <li> these are the only brushes that my 4 yo will use.  I like them too!</li>
            <li> This brush is a miracle brush. It controls the most wild and knotted hair no problem. Anyone with long thick unruly hair should give it a go.</li>
            <li> For the first time, our kids don&#x27;t scream when they have their long/thick/wavy/super-curly hair brushed. How these brushes work I don&#x27;t know, since they look like other brushes, but they work, that&#x27;s all there is to it. Glad we got these.</li>
            <li> My daughter had essentially given up on brushing her hair until my wife found this gem. It&#x27;s metallic handle and - Ok, I have no idea why we needed this brush or whatnot does the ladies like it and its the only brush my girl uses. Apparently, there are legit features of this brush that create actual benefits. I am just unaware of them. But I have it on authority that it works.</li>
            <li> My daughter HATES to brush her hair and have it cut.  So, she has long, tangled hair.  These brushes, while you do have to work to get the tangles out, don&#x27;t hurt her like every other brush, so she brushes her hair when asked without argument or drama.  Thank you, magic Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes make you WANT to brush your hair.  I have never had a problem with that but my grand daughter HATES to have her hair brushed.  I bought 4 of these brushes and sent one home with them.  Every time she comes to my house now she wants to take my brush home with her.  LOL  Awesome product and I defiantly recommend!</li>
            <li> I thought it was original U.S. products. However, it is Chinese products. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great hairbrush for kids resistant of hair brushing.  These brushes get out the knots, without pulling the hair!  It&#x27;s like magic.  I wish we found these earlier.</li>
            <li> Love love love the wet brush! Only way to brush my daughters Long hair after swim practice!</li>
            <li> Everything went well, no complaints!</li>
            <li> Not as awesome as some lead me to think.  Extra curly hair still pulls even when wet!</li>
            <li> These are the only brushes I use on my hair and my daughters.  I have extremely thick wavy hair, my older daughter has straight, fine hair and my other daughter has naturally curly hair.  They are perfect for all textures!</li>
            <li> Love it! These hairbrushes work great! Fast shipping as well! A must have for every girl!</li>
            <li> These brushes work great on wet hair that is very hard to brush (tangled).  Love them.  Highly recommend.  They also come in a smaller size for smaller hands.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of baby fine curly hair...I dreaded washing my hair or going to the beach because it  was so hard to get the tangles out and in the process took a lot of hair with it or caused hair breakage...but not any more!..I am ecstatic!.. This brush gets the tangles out like  magic. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> great buy on two, and great for the tender headed child with a rat&#x27;s nest in her hair every morning</li>
            <li> The purple one leaked purple ink all over my hair when wet. I have a black one that I like but these did not work out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome, however, I will say, for my hair, I still have to put a little product in it to brush through without ripping my hair out!</li>
            <li> I love these brushed.  I have very thick, wavy, curly hair and they are wonderful to get the tangles out without making me cringe.  I still have a lot of hair that pull out but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Works like everyone is saying.  I have long hair that is like a matted mess when I get out of the shower and I HATE to comb it!  This brush makes it easier.</li>
            <li> Gave them as gifts.  Love them</li>
            <li> I am half black, my daughter is a quarter. We both have coarse, kinky, thick hair. Wet: neither of us found this brush to detangle our hair better than any other brush we have used. However, while brushing through tangles it did not hurt or pull as much as other brushes or combs had. Furthermore, once our hair dried, it was softer than usual. We did not use any other new products. Dry: I used the brush instead of a comb when I was flat ironing my hair and it worked better since I was using it on smaller sections of hair and, again, it did not pull/hurt when I had to brush through a tangle like it did when I used a comb. I think, maybe, if the bristles were longer, the brush would work better on thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these over a year ago and I am still using them. They work great! I have extremely curly long hair and these are perfect for detangling my hair while in the shower. One thing I noticed is that one of the brushes paint started coming off a few months but it still worked fine.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush. Ordered to two pack to give one to my sister. She loves it too.</li>
            <li> My boys both love these brushes. I buy them every year for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Loved at first use! Have bought more for family members as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my young niece who has a tender head and hair that tangles easily.  A friend at work recommended this brush.  He uses it on his daughter who has very thick curly hair.  Another friend who is African-American said this is the only brush she uses on her daughter.  Please know I only point this out in order to show that it works on all hair types, thick, thin, curly, etc.  My niece would refuse to brush her hair because it hurt so much.  Now she asks to brush her hair like a princess.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes on the recommendation of a friend. She was right! I kept one and gave one to my daughter-in-law. They go right through tangled wet hair. My hair is shoulder length, hers is mid-back length.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> these are the best brushes ever. use them on all heads in our house and they even work on the dolls hair, i can&#x27;t keep track of them because they get hauled off to the other bathrooms, the best ever.</li>
            <li> Salon quality hair brush at a good price! I learned about this brush from my hair stylist who uses it on all of her clients. I have very long hair and this brush doesn&#x27;t tear or tangle my hair. Love!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe she liked it! Gave it to my tom-boy daughter for her birthday, she sat just brushing her hair over and over (she would go days without running as much as her fingers through normally) The second day she and her best friend sat there brushing her hair all morning and I decided that I was not making her friend wait for her&#x27;s on her birthday. The friend has taken it to show anyone who will listen &amp;#34;look, I&#x27;m not yelling when I brush my hair!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> When I saw the reviews raving about this brush I was very skeptical - it is a brush.  It is fabulous on wet, tangled hair, as well as for use as a regular brush on dry hair.  Yes, it really is THAT good.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her brush.  I also reviewed the purple one I purchased...I bought them for all three daughters.  They have been a small miracle following their swims.  Standard brushes are difficult to use when their long hair is wet, and I&#x27;m not sure how this brush differs in design, but it works so well.  It doesn&#x27;t tangle and pull on their hair even when straight out of the pool.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve since bought them as gifts and have raved about them to other families who have all purchased the brushes and love them too!</li>
            <li> Amazing . You have to buy it.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!  My hair is thick but long and baby fine.  I keep one in the shower, one to blow dry with, and have another one purchased before for my two terriers.  No tangles!</li>
            <li> good price for a two-pack</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! I have fine, thin hair that tangles pretty much by just breathing on it. I have not used another brush since I bought my first wet brush 3 years ago. I was hesitant at first because I was taught to never brush wet hair, but these brushes are gentle as can be. Haven&#x27;t had any breakage whatsoever. Awesome for hair extensions as well!</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived new, on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Did not detangle as easily as described.  After use my thick, curly hair was left limp.  Ok as a dry brush but made me very nervous the way it was pulling on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> No more tears when the granddaughters sleep over.</li>
            <li> For brushing long wet hair this brush is the best.  No more tears on the daughter, and I kept one in my room for myself because we love them so much.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush that will get through my hair.</li>
            <li> got these for my granddaughter who&#x27;s 8 and hates brushing her hair cuz of the tangles and she loved these.  they work great on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone with children that have long to medium length hair!</li>
            <li> works on my daughter&#x27;s hair which knots easy.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. My daughter would get knot after knot every week. With these brushes her hair is fantastic. I love that there is two. One for her shower and one in her bedroom.</li>
            <li> Finally, no more tears from my 3 year old G/daughter.  All you grand folks out there know nothing is worse than tears!! :)  It sure helps with my new found curly hair and at my age my right foot grew, I need all her smiles!  Everyone smirked at me when I ordered it, but I have the last smirk!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this brush for my granddaughter who has long hair that tangles easily - won&#x27;t purchase this again it didn&#x27;t untangle any better than her other brushes</li>
            <li> While the brush does wonders for getting the knots out,  it leaves behind a very noticeable unpleasant rubbery smell in my hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t rave about these enough! They work great on wet or dry hair. My 9 year old daughter has curly hair down to the middle of her back and this is the only brush she can use with out it hurting. It gets the tangles out well. I have thick, straight hair and LOVE this brush. I was using a normal brush when I traveled and missed my Wet Brush so I finally go smart and ordered a second one. They look like many other brushes out there but some how they manage to not hurt when they go through tangles and still manage to brush your hair effectively.</li>
            <li> Gave one to my granddaughter, her hair is med length so she now can brush it out in the shower, the other I use at my Salon. Good brushes.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair that tangles easily. This brush makes a big difference after a shower when I wash my hair. There are some small tangles but nothing like the rat&#x27;s nest I used to battle.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!! My granddaughter has really long hair and it would take forever to get her hair brushed. These brushes have made it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Best brushes Ever. gets the tangles out pain free. Own four of these. Threw out all of my ither brushes.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes. They really work to take out knots. Great value on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only brush that my 3 and 1 year olds let me use! I even use it myself.</li>
            <li> Excellent for brush childrens hair, wet or dry, they can brush by themself</li>
            <li> I purchased these for gifts.  I loved the one I received as a gift initially, which introduced The Wet Brush to me.  Everyone who has received their&#x27;s from me have raved about it too!  My 95 year old mother-in-law appreciates the tenderness of her&#x27;s.  Love them!</li>
            <li> great hair brush for all lengths of hair</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for weak, colored and fine hair ( that exactly what I have). I can only use this brush to brush my hair when it wet</li>
            <li> Cheep Brush Set, Came Apart The First Day, Returned, Ordered Better Brush.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, waited my whole life to find a brush that combs through my wet hair easily. These brushes are just an amazing invention. Cool colors too.</li>
            <li> Most awesome brushes! I bought a total of ten and would love to buy another 10 to give away to friends and family!</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, so brushes are very hit and miss with me. I tried the wet brush on a whim, and it was amazing! The tangles come out freakishly well without pain. I will never use another brush again. (You will lose the tips, though. Just be aware.)</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that tangles easily; this brush is the best I have ever used. It feels like nothing is happening but it&#x27;s sliding through all the tangles. No pulling, much less breaking of hair.</li>
            <li> I would give the item a 5 but my daughter who has very long hair would give it a 4. I think with time she probably would change her mind to a 5.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever. I use it every day.I saw it advertised on a health show and it really helps tangled hair.</li>
            <li> The BEST brush ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughters short hair, not so much on my long hair. I just don&#x27;t feel like its brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> My girls are addicted to these brushes. We bought one at our beauty salon, but the girls were always fighting over it so I bought these. The girls have long, thick hair. This brush works easily to detangle after washing and conditioning. This two pack allows them to each have their own. The packaging made sure the product arrived in good condition. Probably the only brush we&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on mine and my daughters long hair.  Our hair tangles very easily and these brushes are great.  No tears!</li>
            <li> Great brush. The only one that gets through my daughter&#x27;s curly hair! A must have for sensative scalps !</li>
            <li> This brush has made my life so much easier!  I was ready to cut my daughters hair off because of all the tangles that would take so much time and so many tears brush out.  Now I can do in a minute what usually took me 10.  Highly recommended.  Well made and well priced.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the wet brush.</li>
            <li> This works so well!! As a girl with thick, tangly hair from it being dyed so much, this brush saved my hair&#x27;s life pretty much. It looks like a regular brush but it somehow works. Thank god my friend introduced me to this, it works so well! Highly recommend if you have tangly hair.</li>
            <li> The best ever hairbrush i&#x27;ve ever used on my 3 granddaughters who have long thick hair  I live with them and am like their nanny. The tangles come right out  when wet and does a very good job when dry  There are no more tears with this hairbrust.</li>
            <li> These are really great brushes...They work great for my hair and for my poor old dog&#x27;s hair as well...he hurts a lot and hates being brushed after a bath since it is painful to him no matter how careful I am...He has super fine hair for a Schnauzer.  But, with this brush he just lets me do it with no fuss.  I am so relieved.  Love the brush although I can&#x27;t figure out why it is so different from others....doesn&#x27;t look all that different.  Product was delivered on time and in great condition.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> 2 girls and a mom with long hair in the house.  One with wavy hair and a sensitive scalp.  Bought this for the girl with constant tangles.  Found mom and other daughter always stealing it.  Must be a winner.  Had to buy extras so I there wasn&#x27;t any more stress over who had the brush.  I don&#x27;t know why they like it better but they all do.</li>
            <li> These are the only brushes my 3 daughters will use. Was recommended to me by salon. All with long hair, it doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> I have fine, colored hair that gets easily tangled then breaks off.  This brush is so gentle and magically combs thru my hair in a few strokes. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this and would give this 10 stars if I could!!  Got one for my niece and her mother this brush was so awesome!!</li>
            <li> Work great! Makes brushing my girls hair a breeze!</li>
            <li> Wow! This actually gets the tangles out of my daughter&#x27;s long curly hair without a fight!  No more screaming at bath time!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for people with somewhat long hair that have issues brushing tangles out after a shower or bath.  It is a great brush for easing the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of detangling your wet hair.  Not a miracle, but definitely better than a normal hairbrush you would buy at a retail store.  Got one for me and one for my 7 year old daughter.  She loves it.  Great buy.  Quick ship (amazon prime).</li>
            <li> I was introduced to The Wet Brush by my hairdresser, bought one and have now purchased 2 additional so I don&#x27;t have to share mine with the kids.  My girls don&#x27;t love their hair brushed - until this brush!  Now they brush their hair on their own, allow me to brush when necessary and the tangles come out so easily.  BEST BRUSH!</li>
            <li> I have two little girls, ages 4.5 and 1.5, both of whom cannot stand to have their hair brushed when either wet or dry. I purchased this set of two and each daughter received one in her stocking. We have been using them for a week and wow, they are wonderful! Brushing wet--or dry--hair is not nearly the chore it used to be as they really do detangle hair gently. The bristles are extremely flexible and soft and the rounded tips are very small which I think also helps make brushing more comfortable--especially for a 1.5 year old with baby fine hair and a tender little head :) Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle brush for you or your kids!</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best brushes for girls with long hair.  They really make it easy to get through the tangles.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about the peace these brushes have brought to our life. I &amp; my daughter have a very tender scalp.  We have searched for years for a brush that will help ease the pain.  There are no more tears in our morning hair routine.  One ecstatic Mother &amp; daughter thanks The Wet Brush team!</li>
            <li> Finally a brush that runs through my daughters hair.  Her hair is very wavy and tangles easily wet or dry, this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> For someone with wavy tangly hair, especially when wet after the shower, the Wet Brush is a godsend!! No more losing clumps of hair trying to comb it out with a regular comb. You need to make sure you move your hair around and brush out the layers of your hair because the Wet Brush is flexible and won&#x27;t get all the knots out if you just brush the top layer of hair. No more anxiety over getting ready and brushing my wet hair anymore, thank you, Wet Brush!!</li>
            <li> cant do without these</li>
            <li> Be careful!  The real wet brushes are terrific.  I received counterfeits!!!!  They were not soft and hurt to use!!</li>
            <li> I going to use them next week. But I can hardly wait.I going to wear a wig on my vacation.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks Elsie</li>
            <li> Nice, useful, practical, light weight, easy care, pretty, great, delightful, beautifying, snappy, classic, modern, cool, awesome, fearfully efficient  snarl smoother.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome, especially if you have little girls..</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these!!  Make it much more comfortable to brush hair</li>
            <li> I really like this brush however I do have to use a lot of conditioner before using it or the brush doesn&#x27;t brush my hair.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great!  I have not had an issue with pulling my daughter&#x27;s hair since I purchased them.  I would recommend to everyone.  I use one myself!</li>
            <li> Great brush for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It feels really good to brush your hair with this brush.  I have thin hair so I still get a great scalp massage using it.  I used it on my very fussy granddaughters (4,5and7) with long tangled hair who whine and hate having their hair brushed.  One of them actually kept coming back because she liked the scalp massage it gives.  I do feel it is less damaging on hair and it works great wet or dry.  I have long haired Yorkies so I tried it on them and it worked well too, but since they are only 3 and 4 pounds I bought the mini one and it is just their size.  I also bought the 4 and 5 year old a mini which was easier for them to use by theirselves.</li>
            <li> I bought the wet brush for my granddaughter, it worked so well I bought another one for my house for when she comes to visit</li>
            <li> Incredible. Period. I purchased this for my daughter who is 7 and this had made our mornings, and relationship, a dream before bedtime. I had to use so much product in her gorgeous, thick, curly, Irish red hair that it not only took forever, but required more patience than any child should be expected to have. This brush truly works and it worked even after swimming in a hotel pool when no conditioner was available (I thought I was going to DIE). I desperately needed product, but I was able to dry her hair straight, in small sections, so she wouldn&#x27;t wake up in horrific snarls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this from my hairdresser for $13.95 and thought it was worth every penny. I wanted to purchase a couple for some of my Mama friends so I checked Amazon and got a 2-pack for $12.95 and free shipping because I am an Amazon Prime Member (also worth every penny). Excellent purchase, Folks!</li>
            <li> These are by far the best brushes that pull the least on my two daughters hair. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Horrible - product  - READ the NEGATIVE REVIEWS first. This is a waste of money, it does nothing to the tangles at all. It works fine as a regular brush but it is very misleading that it is supposed to be a de-tangling brush. It gets stuck in my daughter&#x27;s hair every time.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush for the money.  Great for detangling long hair.  The metallic color is also very pretty.  The color is a soft metallic.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing. I have long super tangly hair and so does my daughter. I can&#x27;t believe how well this little brush removes tangles. We have several. Buy the multipack.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used one of these on my hair and I was shocked at how well it went through my wet hair. Note: my hair is very long (almost to my waist) and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, of course, I ran to Amazon to buy one and was so happy to find I could get a 2-pack at a very reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love these brushes! They work just as well on my hair when it is dry also.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE brushing my hair. I have extremely long hair and usually only wash 1-2 times a week and before wet brush I never brushed my hair in between. I know, sounds gross, but I&#x27;d usually compensate by putting it up or wear the messy beach wave look like I owned it. These brushes are amazing. They don&#x27;t hurt your hair when you brush.</li>
            <li> THE BEST BRUSHES FOR KIDS WITH DELICATE SCALPS. TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE. THIS IS THE ONLY BRUSH I CAN USE ON MY DAUGHTERS HEAD</li>
            <li> Wow!  These are the best brushes ever.  I was skeptical but they really work well to get tangles out of wet hair.  I will probably buy more to have on hand for me and my daughter.  Highly recommend if you have children and dread brushing their hair full of knots!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this brush on my hair a few months ago. I was amazed! My hair is long and gets tangled easily. This brush goes right through my hair without any pulling or pain. My hair looks great after brushing (not frizzy or poofy). I bought a few brushes for me and also bought them for my nieces. The youngest calls it the &amp;#34;magic brush&amp;#34;. Prior to having this brush, she wanted to cut her hair short. She hasn&#x27;t mentioned wanting her hair cut since!</li>
            <li> Love it! &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; combs and brushes are all I use now! Excellent product on wet and dry hair!</li>
            <li> this brush has made our mornings tear free! it really works!</li>
            <li> best brush ever for long hair....my granddaughter don&#x27;t mind me brushing their hair!</li>
            <li> This brush just goes right through wet hair.</li>
            <li> I dont understand how a seemingly normal brush can go right through snarls and knots as if they were never there.  i just dont get how it works, but i am so thankful that is does!</li>
            <li> Both my kids -- one with curly hair, one straight -- swear by these brushes. I like them, too. They help reduce fly-aways and don&#x27;t break wet hair. We always have 4 or 5 in circulation between bathrooms, the car, purses, and tote bags used for swim team, dance class etc. very nice to have new colors and patterns available.</li>
            <li> Brush works great on wet and tangled hair.  Especially for the kids!</li>
            <li> This brush makes it so easy to comb through wet hair, especially after adding conditioner. Detangling has never been so easy.</li>
            <li> My grand kids just loved these brushes, worked great on their long hair.  I will definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Theses brushes are the best things around! My child has the thickest hair and these are the only brushes that we can use that brush gently and thoroughly through her hair! WE LOVE THEM! You can never have enough!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush set so each of my daughters could have their own brush. One of the girls has thick, coarse hair and the other thick, fine hair. It definitely works better on the finer hair. Still makes the other daughter more willing to sit and have her hair brushed, however!</li>
            <li> Finally something that glides through hair effortlessly &amp; doesn&#x27;t catch on a tangle. It&#x27;s a life saver when brushing my 2 year old&#x27;s hair, but warning it does have a plastic smell that is very strong when it first arrives. Luckily, the smell wears off after time.</li>
            <li> Every person with hair to be brushed should own this product. My daughter (4 yo) is so thankful for this brush. Best on wet hair but also amazing on dry hair. A time and life saver.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best!  My daughter and I both have a lot of long thick hair.  We use these brushes even with dry hair. They brush the hair out smooth with less snagging and pulling hair out.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for the granddaughters when they visit.  They get out of the tub and hair is a woven mess and brings on tears trying to comb/brush.  This works great, is more comfortable for them and makes my job much easier.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough abut this brush. My granddaughters 7 and 8 have very long hair and told me about this brush.  I purchased them and I just can&#x27;t tell you how well it works.  The brush doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair very much and yet it gets out the tangles.  Everyone with long hair, young and old should have one of these.</li>
            <li> Thought it was just a bunch of hype, but my 4.5 year old can brush her own hair now! And if I do try to fix it myself, there are no tears. Totally worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, my hairdresser uses them and now so do I. Perfect for thick and wavy hair, perfect for me and no more whining from my daughter</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how easy it is to brush my wet hair with these brushes, it is amazing. I agree with other reviewers about the odor, it is like a diesel smell and very strong when you first open the packaging, however it did not leave the odor in my hair and after about a month the odor is almost gone.</li>
            <li> long thin lots of hair.  when I brush most ends up in the brush.  I condition etc.  nothing worked.  Until this brush. I hesitated buying it, not I have several of them.  Gave one to my daughter.  One in my swim bag.  Home.  Love this brush.  it works through knots without breakage.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for curly hair !!!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best, I brush, blow dry, and style my hair with this brush.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this brush.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s the difference to this brush to the others in the supermarket .but the reality it&#x27;s if you buy one,you never will use other brush&lt;br /&gt;Great for adult and for my 4 years old girl</li>
            <li> Great! I bought three more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to be doing nothing at first but they are actually detangling and smoothing your hair.  I have been using these on my two girls&#x27; hair with very positive results.  Our hair texture and coarseness are all very different, yet it works well on all:  thin, curly, long, thick, short, very tangled.  It seems to pull on the hair very little (thus causing little pain with detangling), but does get all the tangles out.  Using them from now on.  Love the variety of colors!</li>
            <li> No more screaming of tangles</li>
            <li> Hi...about a year ago, i met someone from your company, at The View TVShow. She had a brush with her to give them as a promo. For some reason they would not accomodate her by taking it. We began speaking, and as such, i mentioned my granddaughters long wirery curley hair. She handed me the sample brush- intended for them- and i promised to let her know how it went.&lt;br /&gt;Well, its now a year later. Suffice it to say, this is the only brush my granddaughter allows her mother to run through her wet hait. Really, who&#x27;d a thought? Quite frankly, leaving the View, I gave it a 10% chance of success. Kids can be very picky these days.&lt;br /&gt;Well, i had to let your company know, as I did promise that lady from Long Island , to provide feedback. I just had no idea, at the time, how positive that feedback would be!&lt;br /&gt;Bettyann&lt;br /&gt;Staten island NY</li>
            <li> The reviews are really true. The Wet Brush goes through hair easily, no detangler spray necessary. I haven&#x27;t needed to help my 7 year old brush through her morning tangled hair since she started using this, and many tears have been avoided as a result. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This brush is great for scuba divers, especially after a dive.  It really untangles both wet and dry hair quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> My wife loves getting the tangles out post shower easier, the girls love the colors, and I love the price. The whole family likes it!</li>
            <li> Much gentler on wet hair. Far fewer strands pulled out when de-tangling freshly washed hair. Love these brushes! They really work.</li>
            <li> Best brush for thick wavy hair .</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome brush ever! My daughter&#x27;s hair is a nightmare to brush.  It is thick, coarse and curly/frizzy.  Impossible to get a comb or brush through.  This brush went through her hair with out any snagging (or crying/screaming on her part) with me brushing it! I am amazed! This brush deserves 10 stars! I think this just made our mornings a whole lot easier and tons less stressful!</li>
            <li> These hairbrushes are amazing! My four year old finally let&#x27;s me brush his hair and does not cry while I&#x27;m doing it!</li>
            <li> best brushes on the planet, I think our household now has 8 or so of them. Great for sensitive scalps, too!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my grand-daughter and these are great.  When she washed her she would not comb the tangles out and it was a mess.  Since I purchased the Wet Brush her hair looks so much better---not so wild.</li>
            <li> There is no pulling of my hair at all; wet or dry! I would encourage anyone that wonders if they should buy this brush? Yes!</li>
            <li> best brushes seems to be a fight between wife and daughter each needing one for car, bag, room, bathroom, etc...most fought over brush...not really a fight more like a strong debate.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less crying and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daughter chose the purple and mom was excited to get the green one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t decide what is shinier, the hair or the brush.  My wife likes it because it is usable with wet hair and the bristles are spaced out further apart so it breaks less strands.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long, fine hair which tangles very easily. I bought these for us to replace a worn out Tangle Teezer brush. These brushes are best used on wet hair, they detangle so quickly. We love these brushes!</li>
            <li> As a mother with young girls who inherited my unruly fine curls hair brushing is like torture, screaming, painful, and nearly always a fight to achieve. I remember well my own mother ripping through the tangles, bottles of No-More-Tangles and my mom would still have to nearly hold me down to manage the madness I call my hair. Trying not to repeat the same torture, I have fell for every gimmick on magic brushes, purchased from tv infomercials that show the brush blazing through the snarled mess without a hitch and have been disappointed. I knew they wouldn&#x27;t be as good as the infomercial (let&#x27;s be honest it never is) but I would expect something that at least would help! The Wet Brush my hair stylist recommend me to try and so I places my order ready for the disappointment that generally comes. Instead I am happy to say this brush is amazing.  Of course you have your tugs on the worst tangles, but truly it&#x27;s tugs not ripping the hair out. Gently going over the spot will free the tangles usually.  Even my 5 yr old is brushing her hair herself. Great product I highly recommend trying for yourself.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Everybody in my family who tried mine, stole mine. LOL I have to keep buying more.</li>
            <li> I decided to get one for me and one for my son and while they clearly tackle tangles in a way like no other they are not perfect.  My son wears his hair a little long and this brush works perfectly clearing snags and styling his &amp;#34;boy-band&amp;#34; style but not so on my long, thick, curly locks!  If I clip my hair in sections I breeze through even the worst of snags without losing chunks of hair in the process, but I cannot pull it through my hair otherwise.  Since I tend to use clips when styling my hair it is not a big deal, but you should know this if you have a thick head of hair.  This brush is IDEAL for kids who cannot tolerate others brushing out their snags, for that reason alone I would say its worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these are all the rage but they are.  They are a little better at brushing through wet hair and that is good for my daughter.  She wanted the green one which was super hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!  My daughter has long hair and always had trouble brushing it.  These brushes help get the tangles out without hurting her head.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My girls don&#x27;t cry when I brush their hair anymore!</li>
            <li> they leave my hair full of static, don&#x27;t work so awesome as others had said in their reviews... not true!!!!!</li>
            <li> Why have I been a parent for 5 years and had never heard of these brushes? My 4yo has curly hair and my 5yo has thick hair. Hair in the morning was always a battle that usually ended with the 4yo going out the door without her hair brushed. With these brushes, the kids brush their own hair every morning. When I tell them to go brush their hair before going to the bus stop, they never even miss a beat--grab the brush, brush their hair, replace the brush, and out the door. There are no more arguments in the morning and they don&#x27;t leave the house looking unkempt or homeless. I have NO idea what makes these brushes magical but I&#x27;m also not going to question it! A few weeks after ordering these brushes on Amazon, I saw the identical brushes on an end cap in Toys R Us. Prices were pretty comparable but I just found it amusing that after I found these online accidentally, they appear in Toys R Us. As an aside, I also went back and ordered one for myself. A definite good buy!</li>
            <li> works great on wet hair.  I wish I had this when I was a child.&lt;br /&gt;It would have saved a lot of fighting over getting my hair combed.  My hair always tangled easily and the brush really smooth things out.</li>
            <li> AWESOME brushes - now I can keep one at work, one in my travel bag &amp; one at home!</li>
            <li> Got these for my two granddaughters that have naturally curly, easily tangled hair.  They love them.  The first brushes that don&#x27;t hurt to use.  Highly recommend for those who have that problem.</li>
            <li> They actually do help my daughter tame her tangles.</li>
            <li> These work great on my daughter&#x27;s long hair</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but will do</li>
            <li> Works so good. All the girls love them</li>
            <li> this brush really works on kids wet hair.  Goes through fairly smooth compared to a regular brush that would get stuck at every night.  I have 3 of these brushes now.  Near all baths and showers.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this brush to me. I have a kid who wants to have long hair, but hates having it brushed. It gets out the tangles without all the whining and complaining.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims to do. Looks like an ordinary brush, but &amp;#34;glides&amp;#34; over hair to prevent tearing or ripping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard great things about these hairbrushes. However, as soon as I removed them from the package I noticed a terrible chemical odor. I placed them in my bathroom and waited to use them hoping the smell would dissipate. I&#x27;ve had them in there for three days, have rinsed them and washed them with dish soap, but the smell persists. I can&#x27;t even walk into my bathroom without getting an instant headache from the rubbery/chemical smell. I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> I have a little girl who is in a wheelchair.  She has very long (to the back of her knees) red curly hair. She rubs her head back and forth all day long and that creates a big mess. We usually have to pick through her hair witj a comb and by the time we are done her skalp is red and the brush is full of hair even though I was very gentle.  We were very sceptical that it could deal with her hair.  The wet brush is amazing! 4 to 6 strokes is all ot takes to work the brush through her hair.  She has always had a frizz from broken hair shafts. We have been using the wet brush now for 2 weeks and there are so few strands of hair lost you can count them! The frizz is gone her hair looks over all amazingly healthy that even her therapy staff and teachers are noticing!</li>
            <li> For a 2 pk, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with the price. I have naturally wavy hair and my hair is always in tangles when I get out of the shower. You should be able to use this product without a hair detangler, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. Brush doesn&#x27;t pull my hair; wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This brush can get through my unruly thick, dry and coarse hair immediately! It&#x27;s definitely like a hot knife going through butter, I didn&#x27;t believe it until it worked for my hair! I will definitely buy this for my mom and share the wealth! I have noticed that the state of my hair has improved with this brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for Christmas stocking stuffers for my daughters after I bought one for myself earlier in the month.  I loved how good mine felt on my hair and on my scalp when I used it</li>
            <li> This is the best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I plan to purchase more for myself and for gifts.  Highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes I won one at a bridal shower and thought it was a strange gift. Then I used it and it was  awesome. I bought these to go in my office at work and in my gym bag and each kid has their own wet dry brush and they love them.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes--I have shoulder length extra heavy and thick hair and it works great on wet or dry</li>
            <li> My daughter refuses to use any other hairbrush either in or out of the shower.  We couldn&#x27;t survive with these!!</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and it tangles more than when I was younger.  This brush is soft but still untangles my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  I bought the 2 pack so I could have one and I could give me daughter the other one.  I might buy a couple more for the gym and the office.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! My daughter and I both have thin hair that tangles easily. These brushes glide right through our hair without pulling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with these, I&#x27;ll never go back or use anything else. If you have really long hair like me, just terrific. My 3 year old used to cry and scream when I brushed her hair, now she lets me and doesn&#x27;t hurt her at all. I can&#x27;t say enough good about these, get them - they are really great</li>
            <li> Brushes work great; quick delivery</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever used</li>
            <li> We love these.  In a house full of girls, these are the only brushes my daughters will let me brush their hair with.  Less tears when it comes to brushing!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Makes brushing me hair so much easier and leaves my hair feeling silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Works great for my 10 year old daughter who always has tangles and can never get them out. This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Good brushes.  Good bristles.  Easy combing through thick or thin hair.  My little girls love them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of witch craft these are made with, but brushing hair is no longer cringe worthy. My hair was to my waist and my daughters is to her shoulders. We each got a brush and I haven&#x27;t had any complaints from her either. I bought a small one to keep in her swim bag and it&#x27;s the perfect size for her toiletries case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had battles with hair brushing for years, my girls now insist on doing it themselves with these very easy to use brushes. Thank you WetBrush!</li>
            <li> My girls love these brushes</li>
            <li> These are my daughters favorite hair brushes. I find myself borrowing hers all the time so I had to buy a couple more!</li>
            <li> These are the coolest and best of all... they really work! Every girl with long hair must have one!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!! It&#x27;s the only one my daughter will let me use. We both have thin hair but mine is straight and hers is curly and gets tangled easily. I have 3 now so I never have to look for one when we travel.</li>
            <li> My wife and 4 daughters all love this brush. Based on all the other positive reviews here I decided to buy four brushes. My oldest daughter is 16 and wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. She says the brush is amazing. My 7 year old daughter has thick long hair, and always dreaded brushing her hair, but now she loves to do it. Wet or dry, these brushes feel good in their hair. And the metallic colors are nice too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hair brush that doesn&#x27;t pull my long hair much at all when I brush it no matter wet or dry!!!</li>
            <li> These are great for thin hair as they don&#x27;t pull. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Glides through wet hair! No more tears while brushing out knotted wet hair. FYI, did hear not to use when blow drying your hair...something about the bristles melting.</li>
            <li> The first few Wet Brushes I purchased were awesome, but this set was not the same as my previous purchases. The bristles are flimsy and they are not as effective in detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair. If I didn&#x27;t know better, I would think they were knockoffs. :(</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I had to PRAISE this brush somehow. I have spent waaaaay to much of my time detangling my wet hair with regular brushes at least 5 minutes after a shower. Now I spend like 10 seconds brushing my wet hair. Hands down best brush I have ever owned. I will be buying some for my three nieces and sister in law for sure!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!! No more detangler...this brush makes my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. So yes, you will still find hairs in your brush, but you won&#x27;t feel them being pulled out. It&#x27;s painless on wet hair and like a normal brush on dry hair</li>
            <li> Best brush ever! Goes through unruly wet hair without pain! This is my 3rd one of these. Highly recommend them to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, and wavy hair that gets extremely tangled after I shower.  This brush doesn&#x27;t exactly work like I thought it would and doesn&#x27;t glide as easy as it apparently does on other people. It gets the job done but it&#x27;s really nothing special for me.</li>
            <li> I love my brush. Get one everybody! I promise you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still wondering how and why is it that this hair brush works better than all other hair brushes I&#x27;ve ever tried before...they all look all pretty the same! It&#x27;s just amazing. It detangles my hair wet or dry, and leaves it smooth after a fair number of strokes. Will definitely buy the same brush when mine breaks.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this brush and I have to say I don&#x27;t get the people who love it. I have only slightly curly hair and it was difficult for me to use, sort of glossed over the surface without really brushing.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and it works great for both wet and dry hair.  I ordered for my grandaughters also.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this product again. I purchased in September 2014, now, 6 months later, the bristles have started to fall out! I would use it about 6x a week. It might be helpful for those with straight hair, something not challenging, but not my THIN curly hair, too difficult!  My curly hair can only be brushed in the shower while using conditioner (elsewise it would result in a poofy, frizzy mess!). This WetBrush is constructed such that the bristles will collapse at medium pressure. The result is it doesn&#x27;t force out a knot, but instead bypasses it. With the WetBrush it takes me longer to brush my hair because I now have to work out some of the knots with my fingers, whereas before a stiffer bristled brush would have forced the knot apart. I will use the 2nd brush in the pack, as my thin hair is prone to falling out, and the less force put on the follicles the better. I feel this product is probably ideal for parents who have to brush their children&#x27;s&#x27; hair, since you cant tell when you might be tugging too hard. Just don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li> For any of you with children who complain about hair-brushing, this is the brush for you.  My six-year old has curly hair, and brushing her hair has always been a chore with lots of crying and complaining.  Now, with this brush, my daughter happily brushes her own hair.  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It is awesome! I think it&#x27;s a perfect product!</li>
            <li> These saved my hair.  This is the first time in my life that I have had really long hair and it is always getting tangled.  I felt like I was always pulling out my hair and I still couldn&#x27;t get out the knots.  These are miracle workers.  My hair is untangled in less than half the time and with virtually no pain.  I am going to order another set!</li>
            <li> I tried this brush after my daughter bought one.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how smoothly it went through my hair and left it so soft!  Next time I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it, was after washing my hair, and I was able to brush through my mass of usual tangles so easily! I have now purchased two brushes, one for myself and another I gave as a gift to a friend.  A week after I gave it to her, she said now it&#x27;s her daughter&#x27;s brush, as she will only have her hair brushed with it and now she needs to purchase another for herself.  Truly a wonder brush!</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to the brush at my salon.  I was getting a Keratin treatment and my long past shoulder length hair has to be washed without conditioner.  I was worried with how my stylist would get out the tangles.  She picked up this brush and it made short work of my tangled hair, with much less pain than I imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked one up from the salon, then tried it on my childs below shoulder length hair after bath.  No tears, No tangles.  It works great on wet or dry hair.  It is now my go to brush, I have one for every member in my family.  Everyone who has tried it loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really magically glides through tangles without pulling.  I can not find myself without this brush again.  Kids, Adults, Wet, Dry, this brush does it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price on Amazon is amazing for two of them as I paid almost the same for one wet brush at my salon.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with the Wet Brush. I creepily tell everyone I know about it and have converted two people to Wet Brush-dom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first was introduced to them at my salon, because I have long, stringy, thin (and tangly) hair. Typically when it gets washed at the salon it is a huge labor for the stylist to detangle. I even warn them in advance that it will be a snarled disaster. The last time I went, while still reclined at the hair-washing sink, the stylist brushed it in two seconds. I immediately asked her about the brush, and it was the Wet Brush. I assumed it would be some Mason-Pearson level of price since it was without a doubt the fastest my hair has ever been detangled. So I was shocked to see on Amazon how cheap they are! The two-pack is perfect for me because I leave one in my gym bag and one at home. I still don&#x27;t get it, because it just seems like a regular brush with more pliable bristles, but I am a believer.</li>
            <li> My girls used to scream and cry every time I brushed their hair. Thanks to this brush, there are no more tears. Note that the points are very flexible so you may have to brush their hair a number of times more than the normal brush. But it&#x27;s worth it because they won&#x27;t cry and you won&#x27;t feel horrible brushing their hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I have long, thick, curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all to brush through it!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!  Will never use another brush!!!</li>
            <li> this is a great brush that the daughter loves to use.  it is a good brush that should last a while.</li>
            <li> Works better on one childs thinner hair than on the one that has thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush! Does exactly what it&#x27;s said to do! Almost unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Just a fan favorite! A gentle way to brush that curly and/or wet hair. My kids love them and so do all the children we&#x27;ve given them to as presents. Gentle, they take the angst our of hair brushing. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These work awesome!!!! Love these brushes!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love these brushes.  We have long, fine, easily tangled hair. The metallics collection does have a smell.  But is dissipates after a few days.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that this brush could be a miracle worker in my house?!  My daughter has waist length hair and used to cry when I brushed it after washing.  Now she asks when am I going to start brushing AND I am already done!  Tears in my eyes with gratitude......</li>
            <li> I have thick medium length hair which is wavy and has always tangled after washing, even with conditioner. This brush is amazing. Goes right through the tangles in one stroke with no pulling or breakage.</li>
            <li> This brush really works. AMAZING. We have a happy daughter and mom here. THANKS.</li>
            <li> Love it bought 3 one for me and Grandmas top</li>
            <li> When wet, the metallic purple one drips purple color off of the brush and it actually stained my counter top :(</li>
            <li> Gift to grand daughters with long hair and don&#x27;t want anyone touching hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They love them&amp;#34; because they don&#x27;t pull&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are the first hairbrushes that don&#x27;t hurt my daughters while I brush their hair!  These are AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> A lot less screaming in the mornings!</li>
            <li> I ordered a 2 pack to split between 2 girls for Christmas and got only a single pack. I&#x27;ve been in the hospital so this was supposed to help. Now no time to fix</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my 2 daughters who both have tender heads but both like their hair long and straight. These brushes cut through the tangles without tears and screams. We&#x27;ve only had them a few days but so far we love them and highly recommend them. We had a tangle teezer brush before and it worked Ok, but was hard to hold onto when I was brushing their hair; it doesn&#x27;t have a handle and eventually the bristles didn&#x27;t get through the tangles very well so we had to use a regular brush to finish up. My girls like the colors too.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Ones for home the other stays in our travel bag.</li>
            <li> This brush is truly miraculous.  I have no idea how or why it works, but it does!  It&#x27;s the only brush that has ever worked on my daughter&#x27;s hair!  After years of spending time in the mornings painfully pulling out tangles, or saying forget it, and putting her hair in a knotty ponytail, we can finally brush her hair in the mornings and she can even do it herself!</li>
            <li> Help my tween more easily care for her own very sensitive head!</li>
            <li> Works great. My wife and daughter love it.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best brushes for little tender heads.  I ended up buying a 2 pack so each of my daughters ( 5 and 3) can have one, and I stole theirs!  No more tears after bath!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Great for my curly hair &amp; my daughter&#x27;s sensitive scalp! Best brush I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.  My kids never wanted me to brush their hair, but this brush is great for getting kids tangles out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird, this brush looks like every single other brush out there.  There is nothing visibly unique about it.  My sister and niece were visiting when it arrived, so there were a total of 4 girls/women in this house, all with different hair types to try it out on.  First, my sister used it after a shower.  She commented that it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel like it was going through the hair-- but it was.&amp;#34; Then, we tried it on my daughter who, despite it hitting a few snags in her hair, actually didn&#x27;t scream (a miracle in itself).  Then it was my turn.  POst shower, I used it and agreed with my sister that you really feel like it&#x27;s just floating over the hair.  I have very thick hair and this was unnerving at first.  When I reached my hand back, I realized that yes, my hair was detangling.  Still, to be sure, I felt the need to take one of my other hair brushes through it.  It wasn&#x27;t necessary as my hair was, in fact, free of tangles.  My niece had no problems with it on her fine hair. I almost miss the feeling of raking through my hair and feeling it through to my scalp... but this brush is great.  ESPECIALLY for my fussy daughter and niece! Five stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that snags easily with combs and other brushes. After purchasing this brush, I no longer dread washing and set angling my hair. This really is a miracle product. I even use it on my 14 month old&#x27;s delicate hair and she does not even notice I am brushing her hair. Truly a miracle product!</li>
            <li> No more crying when it&#x27;s time to brush her hair.  It has made our mornings a little easier; she loves it.</li>
