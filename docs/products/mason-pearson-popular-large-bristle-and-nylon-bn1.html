            <li>/&gt;It looks very gorgeous</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this brush to be very good at taking out the tangles.</li>
            <li>Ladies, this is a great brush, again.....</li>
            <li>great on scalp&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great brush</li>
            <li>Great brush.  </li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>They make a great team.</li>
            <li>I am happy.</li>
            <li>My hair is happy.</li>
            <li>The price was even better, the best we could find anywhere.</li>
            <li>Just want a feel good brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is magic!</li>
            <li>I have owned this hair brush for over a year and love it!  </li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I will attribute much of the beautiful condition of my hair to this brush!  </li>
            <li>I do have to work the brush through my hair, but it does feel really nice</li>
            <li>It looks spectacular on my beauty table.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is when i contacted Mason Pearson again and with the information they provided, i checked out the brush, kindly provided to me from the Amazon seller in question.</li>
            <li>This truly is the kind of brush you will have forever.</li>
            <li>Me-a nice stroke from scalp to ends;</li>
            <li>Hair- a nice bouncy flip curled at the ends in response.</li>
            <li>brush comes with a cleaning brush, which is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Having really fine curly hair, this brush turns it into an afro after a good brushing.</li>
            <li>love this brush, worth every penny, wish the handle was a bit bulkier comes with a cleaning brush that works great</li>
            <li>I figured it was probably too good to be true</li>
            <li>This brush is also very light.</li>
            <li>I have used this Mason Pearson brush for most of my life.</li>
            <li>How many brushes have you bought in your lifetime???  </li>
            <li>(we spend more on shampoo)</li>
            <li>they are not as gentle or effective, and just don&#x27;t feel good.  </li>
            <li>Now, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for then 5 stars it is, but I like my hair to have more defined curls.</li>
            <li>If you think this brush will do magic to your hair don&#x27;t plan on spending money on this.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably purchase a couple more of them</li>
            <li>I love this brush and the shine I see on my hair after each and every use.</li>
            <li>love this brush</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone, with appropriate hair-type.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy two more for my daughters.</li>
            <li>I do think it is pricey, but I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>love this brush.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if all sellers on Amazon are selling authentic brushes</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s better than a Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li>bought this brush in mid-July and waited until now to post review to be sure to help others who are contemplating spending these kinds of $$.</li>
            <li>It removes tangles more easily, prevents frizz.</li>
            <li>although, so far, it has been a great product, and I am satisfied with the hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>One hole at top of brush that makes whooshing sound when brushing.</li>
            <li>I love it, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it&#x27;s the best brush I have ever had</li>
            <li>The feeling of brushing my hair with this brush can only be described as WONDERFUL and something just feels so RIGHT about it.</li>
            <li>It puts the natural oils back into your hair, it gives it a great shine and it feels so good on your scalp.....</li>
            <li>If you want want a brush which does not add damage, but seems to promote healthy hair, this is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I use my regular brush after my shower and my hair looks great throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Bought this seemingly overpriced brush only to make my wife happy.</li>
            <li>Anyone spending 150-200$ on a brush deserves to know they own an authentic product and at the same time be able to take advantage of the discounts provided by sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m watching my hair enjoy itself as I brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I worried about placing this order because I read some reviews that doubted their brush to be authentic, I received mine from London and I am totally confident that it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This brush is worth the money!</li>
            <li>I clean my brush after every use.</li>
            <li>I hope she will love it as much as I have.</li>
            <li>I also own the brush that is all natural bristles hair--no plastic mix as this one has.  </li>
            <li>This, nor any brush, should ever be used to go through a full head of (AA) hair at a time.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling so soft and is great for me as a professional stylist for finishing and styling.</li>
            <li>i have used a boar brush before and can testify that boar brushes in general are amazing.</li>
            <li>It actually makes one&#x27;s hair look better!</li>
            <li>this too is worth the investment.....  </li>
            <li>but I would think that it would come in a nice wooden box or something vs cardboard.</li>
            <li>and I think that it really is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can tell it is removing dirt as opposed to my old one, probably because this one is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>at first glance the plastic on the handle seems almost black, but when you hold it up against light, it glows a wonderful deep ruby</li>
            <li>It really has a bite to it, so it could irritate a more sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I saw first hand on the video how this brush works, and how to use it...</li>
            <li>This recent purchase was the 4th Mason Pearson brush I have had in more than 40 years.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could afford to buy a couple more for her different bags/activities.  </li>
            <li>Yes I love it but not enough to purchase for my daughters.</li>
            <li>This one is a gift for my daughter, who has lovely hair, on the birth of her second son.</li>
            <li>I love this brush; it it second to none.</li>
            <li>Another drastic check, and this is really not necessary, is to take out the top of the pad</li>
            <li>Never has any brush been able to generate such a positive response from my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better for your scalp than the average brush but there is nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my 8-yr old daughter loves brushing my hair as I don&#x27;t seem to be able to get enough of this brush.  </li>
            <li>I wake up and it is already soft and tangle free, making my morning routine so much easier.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>little brush that it comes with honestly is something you could buy from the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have very soft cotton candy, very fine AA hair that straightens quickly with little heat.</li>
            <li>I really could not believe it.</li>
            <li>and I pull so much of it out its a miracle</li>
            <li>I really am amazed with the brush</li>
            <li>wood is very luxurious with a shiny finish, the handle is very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a real investment.</li>
            <li>It changed the whole texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference to my hair.</li>
            <li>The box and stuff looked real except for the the boar bristles.</li>
            <li>What is more I accidentally got this brush wet (dropped into a bathtub!</li>
            <li>I have a dry scalp and this keeps me flake free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve outlined a general guide below-(this was for my large pure boar bristle hairbrush, model B1)-&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>but i believe this general guide can help customers interested in owning a Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li>but I definitely don&#x27;t think its worth $140.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;It slides through your hair easier than a normal brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the combination of two bristle types: the long ones are nylon and the short ones are boar.</li>
            <li>The night I got my new hairbrush</li>
            <li>a side note: within the 1st month of having this brush, several of the boar bristles have broken (or fallen over and not sticking up as they should).&lt;br /&gt;There is no question that this brush feels great on your scalp</li>
            <li>I can say that I&#x27;ve never spent this much on a brush.  </li>
            <li>With further research, I learned it&#x27;s not a fake.</li>
            <li>Dark Ruby color when held up to light.</li>
            <li>I also compared it with an older brush i had, which was bought directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the quality of both the brushes was absolutely the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK not a big deal and definitely not worth spending the money.  </li>
            <li>The brush encourages natural wave patterns and I&#x27;ve noticed the wave pattern moving further down the ends the more</li>
            <li>In ~a year and a half the brush has not sustained any significant damage.</li>
            <li>The smell of singed hair would be clear or a plastic chemical odour would be the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>
            <li>One of my daughter&#x27;s friends used it and commented on the brush - something that I wouldn&#x27;t ever expect a 9 year old to comment on.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 40 years old.</li>
            <li>The natural bristles distribute scalp oils throughout the hair-shaft allowing for optimal conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mason Pearson brushes since the early 1970s.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been making do with a plastic supermarket brush after my young daughter acquired my old mason pearson brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using this brush while in natural state and also while flat-ironed.</li>
            <li>While natural, I section my hair in 4 parts to brush.</li>
            <li>I do love the cleaning brush because it seriously works.</li>
            <li>The same packaging, the same good quality hard plastic,the same rubber pad etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is in almost perfect condition, close to 100% split-end free, and nearly as thick at the ends as the base of a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>I felt a bit guilty spending so much on a brush, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>However, I have thick hair and this bristle/nylon has made it easy for me to use throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>; When I got home and blow dried my hair with it, to my surprise, I fell in love with the round brush.</li>
            <li>I have long, blonde hair which used to be very soft, but when I moved to San Antonio, Texas, the crud in the water here made my hair wirey.</li>

            <li> Another drastic check, and this is really not necessary, is to take out the top of the pad</li>
            <li> Never has any brush been able to generate such a positive response from my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better for your scalp than the average brush but there is nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my 8-yr old daughter loves brushing my hair as I don&#x27;t seem to be able to get enough of this brush.  </li>
            <li> I wake up and it is already soft and tangle free, making my morning routine so much easier.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little brush that it comes with honestly is something you could buy from the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have very soft cotton candy, very fine AA hair that straightens quickly with little heat.</li>
            <li> I really could not believe it.</li>
            <li> and I pull so much of it out its a miracle</li>
            <li> I really am amazed with the brush</li>
            <li> wood is very luxurious with a shiny finish, the handle is very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a real investment.</li>
            <li> It changed the whole texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference to my hair.</li>
            <li> The box and stuff looked real except for the the boar bristles.</li>
            <li> What is more I accidentally got this brush wet (dropped into a bathtub!</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp and this keeps me flake free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve outlined a general guide below-(this was for my large pure boar bristle hairbrush, model B1)-&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> but i believe this general guide can help customers interested in owning a Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li> but I definitely don&#x27;t think its worth $140.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;It slides through your hair easier than a normal brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the combination of two bristle types: the long ones are nylon and the short ones are boar.</li>
            <li> The night I got my new hairbrush</li>
            <li> a side note: within the 1st month of having this brush, several of the boar bristles have broken (or fallen over and not sticking up as they should).&lt;br /&gt;There is no question that this brush feels great on your scalp</li>
            <li> I can say that I&#x27;ve never spent this much on a brush.  </li>
            <li> With further research, I learned it&#x27;s not a fake.</li>
            <li> Dark Ruby color when held up to light.</li>
            <li> I also compared it with an older brush i had, which was bought directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the quality of both the brushes was absolutely the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK not a big deal and definitely not worth spending the money.  </li>
            <li> The brush encourages natural wave patterns and I&#x27;ve noticed the wave pattern moving further down the ends the more</li>
            <li> In ~a year and a half the brush has not sustained any significant damage.</li>
            <li> The smell of singed hair would be clear or a plastic chemical odour would be the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>
            <li> One of my daughter&#x27;s friends used it and commented on the brush - something that I wouldn&#x27;t ever expect a 9 year old to comment on.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 40 years old.</li>
            <li> The natural bristles distribute scalp oils throughout the hair-shaft allowing for optimal conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mason Pearson brushes since the early 1970s.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been making do with a plastic supermarket brush after my young daughter acquired my old mason pearson brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this brush while in natural state and also while flat-ironed.</li>
            <li> While natural, I section my hair in 4 parts to brush.</li>
            <li> I do love the cleaning brush because it seriously works.</li>
            <li> The same packaging, the same good quality hard plastic,the same rubber pad etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is in almost perfect condition, close to 100% split-end free, and nearly as thick at the ends as the base of a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> I felt a bit guilty spending so much on a brush, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> However, I have thick hair and this bristle/nylon has made it easy for me to use throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> ; When I got home and blow dried my hair with it, to my surprise, I fell in love with the round brush.</li>
            <li> I have long, blonde hair which used to be very soft, but when I moved to San Antonio, Texas, the crud in the water here made my hair wirey.</li>
            <li> this is another wish list item I have been wanting for so long and finally got it....</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and feel this is the first brush to reduce breakage and actually disperse oils from my scalp evenly.</li>
            <li> After brushing with this brush my hair is softer and there is less hair loss than with my old paddle brush.  </li>
            <li> Used with An oil shampoo and hair oil, within a few days my hair was very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Does this sound fake?</li>
            <li> I have long and curly hair</li>
            <li> Now, to get my desired look I would have to use this brush on wet or treated hair causing potential damage to the structure of the brush.</li>
            <li> I think it will not work as well on thick and very curly</li>
            <li> ) When you squeeze down on the brush you should hear it whistle or wheeze as the air flows out of the cushion and the cushion should bounce back at the same speed.&lt;br /&gt;6)</li>
            <li> My hair is dry</li>
            <li> This brush cleanses the hair but should any oily residue begin to appear, a dry shampoo to the hair cleared out with this brush will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To get the desired effect I have to brush my hair while wet and then air dry, or use a mousse or lotion.</li>
            <li> Can anyone tell me if the brush is supposed to have black plastic bristles mixed with clear/white ones.</li>
            <li> Expensive but sooooooo worth it.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have medium to thick hair that is down to the middle of my back and is damaged from years of dying</li>
            <li> (it just doesn&#x27;t seem to pull the way other brushes do).</li>
            <li> If I brush with the bristles facing down, my ends will curl upwards.</li>
            <li> I figure this brush has cost less than $15.00 a year.  </li>
            <li> With the Mason Pearson brush I find less then half the amount of hair lost as before.</li>
            <li> and this brush allows me to use less product because it rakes my hair from root to tip.</li>
            <li> I use less product on my hair to style.</li>
            <li> I ordered the BN1 where it is half boar bristles and the bristles look like black plastic.</li>
            <li> My hair is really, really thick and long</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter who has long thick hair</li>
            <li> I got the brush as a gift and thought my friend was crazy for paying so much for a brush.  </li>
            <li> #34;this is probably going to be a waste of money...</li>
            <li> But after my experience with the round brush, I immediately went to Amazon and found the Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li> A drastic check is to pull out a small piece of the black bristle and set fire to it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this and a couple of similar complaints by other customers resulted in the seller being taken off the Amazon Marketplace.</li>
            <li> You should totally get it if you&#x27;re even slightly considering it - you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I usually have to fight with my hair for a while to untangle it</li>
            <li> If I lost it I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase another one.</li>
            <li> of the hardest factors for me in deciding was that they have one brush for thin hair, one brush for short-medium to thick hair and one for long think hair.</li>
            <li> I received this $100 brush, I was crushed because I thought it was a fake because the handle was plastic.</li>
            <li> I am over 55 and have waist-length, super-fine, super-straight but thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy a nylon brush because why pay all that money for just nylon, that&#x27;s just ridiculous to me.</li>
            <li> So I was confused as to what to buy for long-medium thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, this brush is not perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive</li>
            <li> I decided to return the brush, unopened, letting Amazon know that i was worried it was a fake.</li>
            <li> One may wonder why Mason Pearson would suggest that these brushes are possibly fake?</li>
            <li> (I know, weird to say about a brush) When my stylist had shown me the Mason Pearson and described it as &amp;#34;The Cadillac of Brushes&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t believe her.</li>
            <li> I do not appreciate the price, extremely expensive for a hairbrush!</li>
            <li> I am thinking about buying the pocket size version because I hate using anything else and know that I will use it on my daughters hair all the time,</li>

            <li> After brushing with this brush my hair is softer and there is less hair loss than with my old paddle brush.  I love it, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Best hair brush ever,</li>
            <li> Ladies, this is a great brush, again.....from my hair website.....I saw first hand on the video how this brush works, and how to use it...It puts the natural oils back into your hair, it gives it a great shine and it feels so good on your scalp.....you can also feel the sensation of the bristles after you have brushed your hair....If I were you, i would try this...this is another wish list item I have been wanting for so long and finally got it....this too is worth the investment.....  Trina from Chicago</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this brush. I have thick, long hair and feel this is the first brush to reduce breakage and actually disperse oils from my scalp evenly.</li>
            <li> I have used this Mason Pearson brush for most of my life. I am over 55 and have waist-length, super-fine, super-straight but thick hair.  My hair is in almost perfect condition, close to 100% split-end free, and nearly as thick at the ends as the base of a ponytail.  I will attribute much of the beautiful condition of my hair to this brush!  If you want want a brush which does not add damage, but seems to promote healthy hair, this is worth the investment. This recent purchase was the 4th Mason Pearson brush I have had in more than 40 years.  How many brushes have you bought in your lifetime???  I figure this brush has cost less than $15.00 a year.  (we spend more on shampoo) This brush accompanies me to the salon for the quartly end-trimming.  The hairdresser may not use her professional-grade brushes-- they are not as gentle or effective, and just don&#x27;t feel good.  Preserve your tresses- buy the best quality brush.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have medium to thick hair that is down to the middle of my back and is damaged from years of dying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now owned this brush for one month now.&lt;br /&gt;I did a ton of research before spending a ton of money on just a hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;One of the hardest factors for me in deciding was that they have one brush for thin hair, one brush for short-medium to thick hair and one for long think hair. So I was confused as to what to buy for long-medium thick hair so I took a chance and chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;My purpose for investing in this brush was because I was hoping to find something that would help my damage hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just a side note: within the 1st month of having this brush, several of the boar bristles have broken (or fallen over and not sticking up as they should).&lt;br /&gt;There is no question that this brush feels great on your scalp but I definitely don&#x27;t think its worth $140.&lt;br /&gt;The little brush that it comes with honestly is something you could buy from the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on scalp&lt;br /&gt;It slides through your hair easier than a normal brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this brush if:&lt;br /&gt;1. You have a lot of money sitting around and it won&#x27;t make a dent in your pocket book to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Care about name brand things.&lt;br /&gt;3. Just want a feel good brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive&lt;br /&gt;Boar bristles aren&#x27;t has sturdy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this brush if:&lt;br /&gt;1. You are looking for a miracle cure for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you have to save up to buy this than you may be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great brush but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy another one if I lost this one.</li>
            <li> My girl wanted this brush so I bought it for Christmas.  She loves it but I would think that it would come in a nice wooden box or something vs cardboard.</li>
            <li> This is undeniably a wonderful brush. I have long and curly hair and it gets tangled 5 minutes after I brush it. The night I got my new hairbrush I used it on my already knotted hair. The brush went through it like a knife through butter [at room temperature]! I really could not believe it. I usually have to fight with my hair for a while to untangle it and I pull so much of it out its a miracle I&#x27;m not bald. With the Mason Pearson brush I find less then half the amount of hair lost as before. I really am amazed with the brush and I think that it really is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this brush is not perfect for my hair. Having really fine curly hair, this brush turns it into an afro after a good brushing. Now, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for then 5 stars it is, but I like my hair to have more defined curls. To get the desired effect I have to brush my hair while wet and then air dry, or use a mousse or lotion. Now, to get my desired look I would have to use this brush on wet or treated hair causing potential damage to the structure of the brush. Therefore, I have resolved to use this brush on my hair before going to sleep. Lo and behold it was one of my best decisions - my hair does not tangle during the night! I wake up and it is already soft and tangle free, making my morning routine so much easier. I use my regular brush after my shower and my hair looks great throughout the day. All in all, I am VERY happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could afford to get another brush I would definite go for it!</li>
            <li> I can say that I&#x27;ve never spent this much on a brush.  I bought the comb too.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks, but have not gotten to the point where I&#x27;m a daily user yet.  Great brush.  Makes my hair feel smooth and silky.  My hair is really, really thick and long and I&#x27;ve noticed this brush does not get through it with one stroke.  I do have to work the brush through my hair, but it does feel really nice once I finish.</li>
            <li> Bought this seemingly overpriced brush only to make my wife happy. This brush is magic! LOL It actually makes one&#x27;s hair look better! I brush my daughter&#x27;s hair with it. It removes tangles more easily, prevents frizz. We&#x27;ll never use a different brush again if we can help it.</li>
            <li> I have owned this hair brush for over a year and love it!  I am thinking about buying the pocket size version because I hate using anything else and know that I will use it on my daughters hair all the time, (it just doesn&#x27;t seem to pull the way other brushes do).</li>
            <li> This brush is worth the money! Leaves your hair feeling so soft and is great for me as a professional stylist for finishing and styling.</li>
            <li> i like this brush and it says what it advertises, however i dont think i will pay another $100 for a hair brush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what is all the big deal about this brush!!  To me it&#x27;s just a regular brush.  If you think this brush will do magic to your hair don&#x27;t plan on spending money on this.  It&#x27;s just OK not a big deal and definitely not worth spending the money.  It&#x27;s probably better for your scalp than the average brush but there is nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> Expensive but sooooooo worth it.  I bought it for my daughter who has long thick hair and she said she doesn&#x27;t feel anymore pulling - I wish I could afford to buy a couple more for her different bags/activities.  Instead we will cherish this one.  :)  One of my daughter&#x27;s friends used it and commented on the brush - something that I wouldn&#x27;t ever expect a 9 year old to comment on.</li>
            <li> I do not appreciate the price, extremely expensive for a hairbrush! although, so far, it has been a great product, and I am satisfied with the hairbrush.  If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive I&#x27;d probably purchase a couple more of them</li>
            <li> i have used a boar brush before and can testify that boar brushes in general are amazing. However, I have thick hair and this bristle/nylon has made it easy for me to use throughout my hair. It doesn&#x27;t always touch my scalp and I do need to part my hair to come in contact with my scalp. I didn&#x27;t want to buy a nylon brush because why pay all that money for just nylon, that&#x27;s just ridiculous to me. I do love the cleaning brush because it seriously works. I clean my brush after every use.I worried about placing this order because I read some reviews that doubted their brush to be authentic, I received mine from London and I am totally confident that it is the real deal. I love this brush and the shine I see on my hair after each and every use. My hair is dry and I have to use products to hydrate it and this brush allows me to use less product because it rakes my hair from root to tip. Yes I love it but not enough to purchase for my daughters. It&#x27;s too expensive and I believe you are partly paying for the name. If I lost it I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase another one. On the other hand, it&#x27;s the best brush I have ever had and I&#x27;m 40 years old.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks very gorgeous and I always get a lot of complements on my hairbrush. It looks spectacular on my beauty table.&lt;br /&gt;The wood is very luxurious with a shiny finish, the handle is very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the combination of two bristle types: the long ones are nylon and the short ones are boar. The duo makes for a brush that not only combs the hair well, but it also cleans and shines it. The natural bristles distribute scalp oils throughout the hair-shaft allowing for optimal conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is of medium thickens, wavy and shoulder length--this brush is perfect for them. I think it will not work as well on thick and very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with a cleaning brush, which is very easy to use. However, sometimes I also use Olivia Garden Brush Cleaner on it from time to time. This does not seem to hurt anything. In ~a year and a half the brush has not sustained any significant damage. What is more I accidentally got this brush wet (dropped into a bathtub! twice!) two times---the finis did not get damaged at all!&lt;br /&gt;True quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush and I would recommend it to anyone, with appropriate hair-type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mason Pearson brushes since the early 1970s.This one is a gift for my daughter, who has lovely hair, on the birth of her second son. I hope she will love it as much as I have.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a Mason Pearson brush for years, and I finally bought this one. I have been very happy with it. I plan to buy two more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> I had this brush growing up.  It is amazing.  The price was even better, the best we could find anywhere.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much stronger now that I have used this brush for a few months.  I never heard of Mason Pearson before and had no idea what it cost.  I got the brush as a gift and thought my friend was crazy for paying so much for a brush.  I am getting this one as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size and the ideal bristle type for me and my shoulder-length hair.  Luckily, my 8-yr old daughter loves brushing my hair as I don&#x27;t seem to be able to get enough of this brush.  a real investment.</li>
            <li> love this brush, worth every penny, wish the handle was a bit bulkier comes with a cleaning brush that works great</li>
            <li> I love this brush; it it second to none. I do think it is pricey, but I&#x27;m glad I got it. It changed the whole texture of my hair. I have long, blonde hair which used to be very soft, but when I moved to San Antonio, Texas, the crud in the water here made my hair wirey. Used with An oil shampoo and hair oil, within a few days my hair was very soft and manageable. I&#x27;ve found this brush to be very good at taking out the tangles. It really has a bite to it, so it could irritate a more sensitive scalp. Moves the oils from the scalp into the hair beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever had.</li>
            <li> There have been a lot of doubts over the authenticity of Mason Pearson brushes sold on Amazon. I&#x27;d recently bought a brush on Amazon and decided to contact Mason Pearson for a price comparison which is when they told me that there were plenty of forgeries on the market. I decided to return the brush, unopened, letting Amazon know that i was worried it was a fake. Unfortunately this and a couple of similar complaints by other customers resulted in the seller being taken off the Amazon Marketplace. This is when i contacted Mason Pearson again and with the information they provided, i checked out the brush, kindly provided to me from the Amazon seller in question. I also compared it with an older brush i had, which was bought directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the quality of both the brushes was absolutely the same. The same packaging, the same good quality hard plastic,the same rubber pad etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve outlined a general guide below-(this was for my large pure boar bristle hairbrush, model B1)-&lt;br /&gt;1) The name on the handle should be in goldblocking and sunken into the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;2) The name on the handle should say:&lt;br /&gt;The&lt;br /&gt;Mason Pearson&lt;br /&gt;London England&lt;br /&gt;Pure Bristle (varies with brush type)&lt;br /&gt;3) There should be a hole at the end of the brush only, the side opposite to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;4) There should be 16 rows (or 8 rings) of tufts (varies with brush size)&lt;br /&gt;5) When you squeeze down on the brush you should hear it whistle or wheeze as the air flows out of the cushion and the cushion should bounce back at the same speed.&lt;br /&gt;6) This is for the ruby brushes only- at first glance the plastic on the handle seems almost black, but when you hold it up against light, it glows a wonderful deep ruby red.&lt;br /&gt;7) A drastic check is to pull out a small piece of the black bristle and set fire to it. The smell of singed hair would be clear or a plastic chemical odour would be the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;8) Another drastic check, and this is really not necessary, is to take out the top of the pad and you will find a stamp on the plastic head inside.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if all sellers on Amazon are selling authentic brushes but i believe this general guide can help customers interested in owning a Mason Pearson brush. One may wonder why Mason Pearson would suggest that these brushes are possibly fake? Well, for one, they have no way of knowing if these brushes have been obtained from their authorized seller in the US. And secondly, these brushes are being sold at a discounted price on Amazon, something that i believe the manufacturer does not approve of. Anyone spending 150-200$ on a brush deserves to know they own an authentic product and at the same time be able to take advantage of the discounts provided by sellers on Amazon. With Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy, we have nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much on a brush until I purchased a boar&#x27;s hair round brush from my salon. I thought &amp;#34;this is probably going to be a waste of money...&amp;#34; When I got home and blow dried my hair with it, to my surprise, I fell in love with the round brush. (I know, weird to say about a brush) When my stylist had shown me the Mason Pearson and described it as &amp;#34;The Cadillac of Brushes&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t believe her. But after my experience with the round brush, I immediately went to Amazon and found the Mason Pearson. This truly is the kind of brush you will have forever. It feels wonderful on my scalp. I have a dry scalp and this keeps me flake free. The feeling of brushing my hair with this brush can only be described as WONDERFUL and something just feels so RIGHT about it. You should totally get it if you&#x27;re even slightly considering it - you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been making do with a plastic supermarket brush after my young daughter acquired my old mason pearson brush. I felt a bit guilty spending so much on a brush, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. It really makes a difference to my hair. I can tell it is removing dirt as opposed to my old one, probably because this one is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s better than a Mason Pearson brush. Nothing.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush around.  I have used this brand for over 25 years.  My father used it also.  Worth the price. I also own the brush that is all natural bristles hair--no plastic mix as this one has.  They make a great team.</li>
            <li> My hair and I have renewed our relationship. We are getting along now in this marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has stopped being the rebellious stallion because I have approached her now with apples and sugar cubes. Me-a nice stroke from scalp to ends; Hair- a nice bouncy flip curled at the ends in response. If I brush with the bristles facing down, my ends will curl upwards. If I brush with bristles facing out away from my scalp, my ends will flip under in response. Never has any brush been able to generate such a positive response from my hair. I&#x27;m watching my hair enjoy itself as I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very soft cotton candy, very fine AA hair that straightens quickly with little heat. But dryness and itchy scalp have always been a problem and with dryness comes tangles and breakage. I&#x27;ve tried using this brush while in natural state and also while flat-ironed. While natural, I section my hair in 4 parts to brush. This, nor any brush, should ever be used to go through a full head of (AA) hair at a time. The brush encourages natural wave patterns and I&#x27;ve noticed the wave pattern moving further down the ends the more I use this brush, vs. closer to the root with the newer hair. While flat-ironed, this brush extends the look longer by preventing dryness that comes with brushing distributing the oils to the ends. This brush cleanses the hair but should any oily residue begin to appear, a dry shampoo to the hair cleared out with this brush will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this $100 brush, I was crushed because I thought it was a fake because the handle was plastic. I figured it was probably too good to be true and that&#x27;s what I deserved for spending $100 on a hairbrush. With further research, I learned it&#x27;s not a fake. I found instructions from Mason Pearson to clip 1 or 2 boar bristles and burn them to check for the burned hair smell. Check. Imprinted logo. Check. Dark Ruby color when held up to light. Check. One hole at top of brush that makes whooshing sound when brushing. Check. So I didn&#x27;t need to get my credit card company involved with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brush in mid-July and waited until now to post review to be sure to help others who are contemplating spending these kinds of $$. Itchy scalp is gone. I am happy. I use less product on my hair to style. My hair is happy. That&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from TresStyle. The box and stuff looked real except for the the boar bristles. I ordered the BN1 where it is half boar bristles and the bristles look like black plastic. I know what hair looks like and this is NOT hair. Can anyone tell me if the brush is supposed to have black plastic bristles mixed with clear/white ones. This brush is also very light. Does this sound fake?</li>
