            <li>I love this product!</li>

            <li>I LOVE Vitapointe.</li>
            <li>used this product for many years saved money compared to okc purchase.</li>
            <li>Original Clairol Vitapointe does not exist anymore!</li>
            <li>the original came in a jar and was much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original Clairol Vitapointe gave your hair a healthy look and bright alive shine without any feeling of having anything on it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product for dry, unruly, curly hair.</li>
            <li>That said however it still works for my hair leaving it shiny and soft and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find Vitapointe in this new container.</li>

            <li>No one seems smart enough to restore the original recipe....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close enough to the original formula</li>
            <li>This tube seems different from the original formula.  </li>
            <li>In fact - shortly after application it evaporated leaving only a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>Current manufacturer, Hellen of Troy, changed slightly the original recipe.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still the only thing on the market that gives your hair a natural shine..</li>
            <li>Too bad it&#x27;s no longer available !!!</li>
            <li>It is not as long lasting as the old tube, on the hair.  </li>

            <li> Vitapointe Tube 1.7 oz. lasts forever!! So little is needed to do the job of calming flyaway hair in the winter, which is why I use it. It also happens to condition nicely, I must admit. Try it. You&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Been using for years and it&#x27;s still the only thing on the market that gives your hair a natural shine..</li>

            <li> Original Clairol Vitapointe does not exist anymore! Current manufacturer, Hellen of Troy, changed slightly the original recipe. This VITAPOINTE leaves residue in your hair and your hair will have a \\&quot;dull\\&quot; look within 24 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;Original Clairol Vitapointe gave your hair a healthy look and bright alive shine without any feeling of having anything on it. In fact - shortly after application it evaporated leaving only a healthy shine. Too bad it&#x27;s no longer available !!! No one seems smart enough to restore the original recipe....</li>
            <li> Well, this clearly is a tiny bit different formula than the Vitapoint I used as a teen; heavier.  That said however it still works for my hair leaving it shiny and soft and smelling nice.  Happy I took the chance in spite of other bad reviews. It&#x27;s close enough to the original formula and I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected. This is a very good finish for your hair. Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> We have used Vitapoint for years, it is still the wonderful product it was &#x27;Way Back When&#x27;. Buy it, you will like it!!!!</li>
            <li> just not like it used to be - too greasy. the original came in a jar and was much better. cannot get the jars anymore.</li>

            <li> Absolutely the best product for dry, unruly, curly hair. Nothing better and I have tried them all. Just a little on my palms, through my hair does the job. Hair is so much better, no frizzies, lookiung shiny and sleak. Dont buy anything else.</li>
