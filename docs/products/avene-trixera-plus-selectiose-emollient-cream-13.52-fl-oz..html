            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how smooth my skin feels.</li>
            <li>It is very economical too.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely the best cream I have ever used for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>and this is the only cream that makes my skin soft and supple, and it doesn&#x27;t have any smell, which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true when they say &amp;</li>
            <li>I bought a tube from her for the full retail price.</li>

            <li>I have dry skin, I don&#x27;t know if it would be a good choice for oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best moisturizer products for sensitive skin we have ever tried, and a little is all it takes for</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a fabulous product, but the balm was really what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price tag.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>But it is totally worth to take your time and use it every day.</li>
            <li>I must have used it for only 2 days and it healed my skin so nice without any irritation.</li>
            <li>This us an amazing product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>If you are chemically sensitive or need fragrance free</li>
            <li>The problem is the pump 13.52 fl oz container stops working properly, the top is not removable, and there is plenty of cream remaining in the container.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist first recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feel, but does an amazing job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>But I notice it is better and not as dry.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and this has done wonders.</li>
            <li>each application.&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin for those with thyroid issues that also make you very sensitive to some chemicals and compounds can make it difficult to find the &#x27;perfect&#x27; moisturizer to put on cleansed face and eye areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came promptly and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes, and does not feel greasy at all</li>
            <li>When applied, it absorbs into the skin quite readily.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is a very hydrating moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It really softens.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but can be a wonderful tool in the arsenal for those with sensitive skin with atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>As a big plus, it has never broken me out so it is truly appropriate for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Much better than anything you&#x27;ll find at CVS or other drug stores.</li>
            <li>Considerably cheaper here than in the H&amp;BA boutique where I first found this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>For everyday dry, sensitive skin, the cream is great.</li>
            <li>-in-all,  I really don&#x27;t think my skin has ever been so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This cream is too expensive for me to happily toss the container with a couple of oz of cream remaining in it.</li>
            <li>The rough skin disappeared and they became as smooth as the rest of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Initially there is a slight tacky feel to it but that dissipates quickly,  leaving your skin feeling soft, smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The smaller container&#x27;s per oz cost is much higher and I shouldn&#x27;t have to consider it.</li>
            <li>I read that the container was specifically designed so that one is not able to remove the top in order to prevent the cream to be contaminated.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive dry skin and wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I have super dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It tends to be a bit greasy, so only a dab is needed, but since using it, I&#x27;ve noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TriXera was actually prescribed for one female in our household, and we quickly decided it was going to be the go-to product for others as well.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering</li>
            <li>It does stay on pretty long.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse and in the winter time washing hands so frequently strips the skin of natural oils.</li>
            <li>This lotion has put a complete halt to any irritation while working.  </li>
            <li>So far it does what it promises.</li>
            <li>It seems like it actually fixed the problem altogether.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it on his face and he has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous lotions, but none helped my skin as much as  Avene TriXera.  </li>
            <li>It is literally the only lotion that I&#x27;ve found that helps super dry skin.  </li>
            <li>through an Amazon supplier just makes it that much easier to get double the volume for the same amount of money - considerable savings.</li>
            <li>This lotion is the only thing we use on my infants eczema and sensitive sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>bottle lasts for two months  of applications on a four-year old, twice per day, so I imagine this would last a month if applied to an adult twice per day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive skin creams, but this is my absolute favorite of all time.  </li>
            <li>This has become a major part of my every day routine</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream to anyone with \\&quot;dry skin\\&quot; issues.</li>
            <li>I have used Eucerin and Nivea for very dry skin, and trust me, this is even better; at least for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and live in a farm</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone with very dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We have very dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my eczema worse, but it certainly didn&#x27;t help much either.</li>

            <li> It tends to be a bit greasy, so only a dab is needed, but since using it, I&#x27;ve noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;TriXera was actually prescribed for one female in our household, and we quickly decided it was going to be the go-to product for others as well.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering</li>
            <li> It does stay on pretty long.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and in the winter time washing hands so frequently strips the skin of natural oils.</li>
            <li> This lotion has put a complete halt to any irritation while working.  </li>
            <li> So far it does what it promises.</li>
            <li> It seems like it actually fixed the problem altogether.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it on his face and he has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous lotions, but none helped my skin as much as  Avene TriXera.  </li>
            <li> It is literally the only lotion that I&#x27;ve found that helps super dry skin.  </li>
            <li> through an Amazon supplier just makes it that much easier to get double the volume for the same amount of money - considerable savings.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only thing we use on my infants eczema and sensitive sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> bottle lasts for two months  of applications on a four-year old, twice per day, so I imagine this would last a month if applied to an adult twice per day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive skin creams, but this is my absolute favorite of all time.  </li>
            <li> This has become a major part of my every day routine</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream to anyone with \\&quot;dry skin\\&quot; issues.</li>
            <li> I have used Eucerin and Nivea for very dry skin, and trust me, this is even better; at least for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and live in a farm</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone with very dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We have very dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my eczema worse, but it certainly didn&#x27;t help much either.</li>
            <li> I have an itching problem, and the issues with other anti-itch products is that they require frequent application.  </li>
            <li> It past with high ratings!  </li>
            <li> I find it long lasting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, expensive skin cream that helped the scaling a little</li>
            <li> When my skin is so dry that it is red and irritated</li>
            <li> Poor design generates waste and boosts the per oz cost because many probably end up tossing it out of frustration.</li>
            <li> so she gets these very dry itchy patches on her skin and it has all relieved and disappeared with constant use of this cream.</li>
            <li> and it stays moisturized all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have psorosias and my face gets rough and red.  </li>
            <li> As long as the doctor orders, this it will be continued.</li>
            <li> size is pricey, but it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I found this larger (double) size here on Amazon for way less than the retail price of the tube.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin that continuously itched</li>
            <li> I am a 71-year-old woman with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I intermittently use this lotion in between hand washes &amp; during times I actually have a chance to sit down to document while at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin problem anywhere on your body, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My face gets really red and dry and feels very tight and sometimes itchy in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It is very emollient but not greasy and soothes my skin without irritating me.</li>
            <li> so have to be careful with products.</li>
            <li> This causes my hands to become inflamed with small red spots, reddened/rashy looking, dry, and irritated.  </li>
            <li> Initially, this lotion feels oily (not the annoying sticky-greasy feel), but doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into my skin &amp; leaving it silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and makes your skin glow</li>
            <li> No parabens or other toxins.</li>
            <li> The cream works extremely well.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It was twice the size and half the price compared to my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less greasy than the balm, so my husband appreciates that when he has to put it on our son.</li>
            <li> It does appear to go on a little oily but it does eventually soak in.  </li>
            <li> It just take a little while.  </li>
            <li> a little is all you need for your face in order to avoid an oily sheen.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours it does still have a like a protective covering layer on my skin.</li>
            <li> I know some people don&#x27;t mind heavy lotions</li>
            <li> , I use it everyday twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Trixera in the tubes, but found the stiff plastic made it difficult to get the last bit out of the tube and at the price</li>
            <li> Also the consistency is a little bit thin considering</li>
            <li> It does not, in the least, irritate my skin...</li>
            <li> I like the feel of Akerat, but it was helping slowly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a balm like Avene&#x27;s TriXera Plus Selectiose Emollient Balm which is quite thick.</li>
            <li> So far this product has taken care of my dry skin issues without leaving that nasty greasy residual that leaves finger or hand prints on everything.</li>
            <li> The dryness in the winter air had aggravated the skin around my neck and it was getting annoyingly itchy, dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> I am weird about greasiness though so</li>
            <li> I wait for it to go on sale because it is expensive.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have very dry skin problem anywhere on your body, this is for you. Use it for a week then is totally gone.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!!</li>
            <li> I have used avene day and night for the last 3 years. I also mix it with foundation. It is perfect for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Did not cure my skin condition, as my skin does itch still at night. But I notice it is better and not as dry. It does stay on pretty long. After a few hours it does still have a like a protective covering layer on my skin.</li>
            <li> Came promptly and was packaged very well. very pleased with service. i was very pleased with the pricing and size of container the cream came in. It was twice the size and half the price compared to my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My face gets really red and dry and feels very tight and sometimes itchy in the morning.  This is the only lotion I have found that soothes and does not irritate, or burn my skin.  It does appear to go on a little oily but it does eventually soak in.  It just take a little while.  But it leaves my face feeling so good and it stays moisturized all day long.  I highly recommend this product.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the cream on accident, I thought it was the balm. I gave it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a fabulous product, but the balm was really what I wanted. It&#x27;s less greasy than the balm, so my husband appreciates that when he has to put it on our son. I prefer the balm because it seems to be the most hydrating, and that&#x27;s what my sons particular dermatitis needs. For everyday dry, sensitive skin, the cream is great.</li>
            <li> Way too greasy for me. I felt like I had put Crisco on my skin. I actually waited a bit and then had to get in the shower and literally wash this lotion off. I know some people don&#x27;t mind heavy lotions so if you don&#x27;t mind that, I think it is probably a good cream. I have super sensitive dry skin and wanted to give it a try. I am weird about greasiness though so if that doesn&#x27;t bother you I think it would be fine. Just my personal preference with body lotion, so this was a no go.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my eczema. I used it for more than a week. It&#x27;s a nice, expensive skin cream that helped the scaling a little but my face remained red and itchy. As soon as I stopped using Avene and resumed my prescription cream, my face cleared up.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for protecting my hands from dermatitis outbreaks and for just locking in the moisture.  It is literally the only lotion that I&#x27;ve found that helps super dry skin.  It leaves a protective moisturizing layer on your hands preventing scaly, flaky skin.  When my skin is so dry that it is red and irritated this is my go-to.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. I originally bought this from my dermatologist and was so impressed that I ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;This is a much more dilute version- I guess it&#x27;s true when they say &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;....not what I had&lt;br /&gt;expected from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this is the only cream that makes my skin soft and supple, and it doesn&#x27;t have any smell, which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> At my dermatologists suggestion, I purchased this for my son. It&#x27;s got great moisturizing power without being tacky, absorbs well, lasts all day, leaves skin butter soft. My son has fewer rashes and itchy scaly skin. I was happy to see that it&#x27;s $15 cheaper on Amazon, including the shipping costs than at the derm&#x27;s office. I recommend it for anyone with very dry or sensitive skin. The 13.5 oz. bottle lasts for two months  of applications on a four-year old, twice per day, so I imagine this would last a month if applied to an adult twice per day. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Gives skin a nice glow and provides moisture all day!  It absorbs quickly into skin and is non greasy! I will buy this product again</li>
            <li> I have psorosias and my face gets rough and red.  This TriXera Plus Emollient Cream keeps my face smooth and moist without spending tons of money.  I lOVE it!</li>
            <li> not greasy, works well. Well worth the price tag.  Much better than anything you&#x27;ll find at CVS or other drug stores.</li>
            <li> Considerably cheaper here than in the H&amp;BA boutique where I first found this. Non-scented and non-comedogenic. Very good value.</li>
            <li> As long as the doctor orders, this it will be continued. I don&#x27;t know how to rate a medical item. It either works or does not work. This  does work.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. This is the only cream I can use in winter. It is very emollient but not greasy and soothes my skin without irritating me. If you are chemically sensitive or need fragrance free it is for you.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only thing we use on my infants eczema and sensitive sensitive skin! Her skin is back to feeling like a baby again!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect cream for eczema skin. I have kept my eczema at bay with it now for several years.</li>
            <li> No annoying cloying scent.  It really moisturizes, and does not feel greasy at all -- I even use it on my face</li>
            <li> My dermatologist had me use Akerat cream to put moisture back in my skin. I like the feel of Akerat, but it was helping slowly. So he moved me up to Trixera. It has a slightly &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feel, but does an amazing job of moisturizing. My skin is super sensitive and this has done wonders. I&#x27;ve bought Trixera in the tubes, but found the stiff plastic made it difficult to get the last bit out of the tube and at the price, I didn&#x27;t want to wastw a bit! Also, in the pump bottle I use it more often. Expensive, but can be a wonderful tool in the arsenal for those with sensitive skin with atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and in the winter time washing hands so frequently strips the skin of natural oils. This causes my hands to become inflamed with small red spots, reddened/rashy looking, dry, and irritated.  This lotion has put a complete halt to any irritation while working.  I intermittently use this lotion in between hand washes &amp; during times I actually have a chance to sit down to document while at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this lotion at bedtime and wake up to incredibly smooth skin.  I can&#x27;t get over how smooth my skin feels. It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and makes your skin glow/glossy.  Initially, this lotion feels oily (not the annoying sticky-greasy feel), but doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into my skin &amp; leaving it silky smooth.  I&#x27;ve never used a lotion quite as effective as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with asthma/allergies/etc- it is fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all,  I really don&#x27;t think my skin has ever been so soft and moisturized.  I am very satisfied with this lotion.  I will continue to purchase this and more Avene products.  Thank you Avene!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I also use the recovery cream on my face.  One word - AMAZING!  Not even exaggerating  :::: ! In Love ! :::::</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream for my very dry skin -- and it is very good. The problem is the pump 13.52 fl oz container stops working properly, the top is not removable, and there is plenty of cream remaining in the container. This cream is too expensive for me to happily toss the container with a couple of oz of cream remaining in it. The smaller container&#x27;s per oz cost is much higher and I shouldn&#x27;t have to consider it. I read that the container was specifically designed so that one is not able to remove the top in order to prevent the cream to be contaminated. I am giving it 2 stars because although the cream is very good and merits 5 stars, the difficulty involved in accessing it merited the loss of 3 stars. Poor design generates waste and boosts the per oz cost because many probably end up tossing it out of frustration.</li>
            <li> I have an itching problem, and the issues with other anti-itch products is that they require frequent application.  This product provides relief all day.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this cream. I have very sensitive skin so have to be careful with products. So far this product has taken care of my dry skin issues without leaving that nasty greasy residual that leaves finger or hand prints on everything. It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The Avene TriXera Plus Selectiose Emollient Cream is loaded with good to excellent ingredients that are effective in nourishing, hydrating and protecting your skin. It is emollient, yet quite creamy. It&#x27;s not a balm like Avene&#x27;s TriXera Plus Selectiose Emollient Balm which is quite thick. This instead, has a creamy texture that has a nice \\&quot;slip\\&quot; to it. When applied, it absorbs into the skin quite readily. Initially there is a slight tacky feel to it but that dissipates quickly,  leaving your skin feeling soft, smooth and hydrated. It does not, in the least, irritate my skin...it is very gentle and soothes the skin, leaving it feeling comfortable. I highly recommend this cream to anyone with \\&quot;dry skin\\&quot; issues. So far it does what it promises. Very good product. It is worth the investment. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This us an amazing product for dry skin. It hydrates without leaving you greasy. I wait for it to go on sale because it is expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a very hydrating moisturizer.  I use it morning and night on my face and love it!  It tends to be a bit greasy, so only a dab is needed, but since using it, I&#x27;ve noticed a positive difference. It&#x27;s also been a great compliment to the retin-a cream that i&#x27;ve been using, which is very drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive skin creams, but this is my absolute favorite of all time.  It is *so* moisturizing.  I love that it is meant for both the face and the body.  It is very economical too.  I have only ever gotten compliments on my complexion when wearing this cream.  It goes on dewy, so a little is all you need for your face in order to avoid an oily sheen.  The cream is also perfect as a night time moisturizer... I always wake up with glowing and hydrated skin.  As a big plus, it has never broken me out so it is truly appropriate for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best cream I have ever used for my dry skin. It is a bit sticky and takes a while to absorb, which I don&#x27;t like because I&#x27;m always in a hurry and I don&#x27;t like to put the clothes on feeling sticky. But it is totally worth to take your time and use it every day. My skin has never looked healthier. I have used Eucerin and Nivea for very dry skin, and trust me, this is even better; at least for my skin. My sister has atopic allergy so she gets these very dry itchy patches on her skin and it has all relieved and disappeared with constant use of this cream. Avene products in general are very good.</li>
            <li> Like it, keep moisture longer and smooth skin ;)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  This is a very rich cream so go sparingly.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizer products for sensitive skin we have ever tried, and a little is all it takes for each application.&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin for those with thyroid issues that also make you very sensitive to some chemicals and compounds can make it difficult to find the &#x27;perfect&#x27; moisturizer to put on cleansed face and eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;TriXera was actually prescribed for one female in our household, and we quickly decided it was going to be the go-to product for others as well.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering through an Amazon supplier just makes it that much easier to get double the volume for the same amount of money - considerable savings.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice for dry skin.  It&#x27;s better than any of the anti-aging cremes and serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever. My husband has been using this for years and I just started to use it. We have very dry and sensitive skin and this has worked wonders. My father has eczema and now he swears by this too! Amazon also the best price for the 13oz  for $27. My only gripe is that when using the pump bottle there is a lot of lotion left at the bottom that will not come out. I have tried to remove the top unsuccessfully but have yet to use ALL of the lotion in the pump version.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist first recommended this product.  I have extremely dry skin that continuously itched but after just a day using Trixera the itching was gone.  I especially noticed a difference on my elbows.  The rough skin disappeared and they became as smooth as the rest of my skin.  At my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation I&#x27;ve also used Trixera on my face at night if it feels wind chapped or sunburned.  This has become a major part of my every day routine and I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> Avene is the best product line that I have found for sensitive and acne prone skin. If you want to make people jealous of your skin, buy this. Noticeable difference in a week for me, I use it everyday twice a day. I have dry skin, I don&#x27;t know if it would be a good choice for oily skin. I use this with my acne treatment, such a life saver, and the bottle: HUGE. I would like to say I will use this product FOREVER.</li>
            <li> This cream is so silky.  It goes on smoothly and you feel the difference in your skin right away.  It goes hand and hand with the &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; which is better for night use (heavier).  If you have very dry skin like I do, I have used the balm in the morning too and the cream throughout the day.  No parabens or other toxins.</li>
            <li> This was a test to see if I could buy something online like this item.  It past with high ratings!  It really is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> THE BEST. I have super dry and sensitive skin.  Even works on my face and no break outs!  Great price! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> The dryness in the winter air had aggravated the skin around my neck and it was getting annoyingly itchy, dry and scaly. I tried the Avene riche thermale and it only provided temporary relief. I then read reviews of this product on Amazon and decided to try it out. It&#x27;s definitely turned to be an excellent choice!! I must have used it for only 2 days and it healed my skin so nice without any irritation. It seems like it actually fixed the problem altogether. A small amount goes a long way. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of these. Loved it!</li>
            <li> Excellent and prices are great on line</li>
            <li> The cream works extremely well. It helps your skin retain moisture.I have tried many different skin creams and this one works best.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice all over moisturizer.  I find it long lasting and it is emollient.  I have very dry skin and live in a farm so I am out in conditions all the time.  My husband uses it on his face and he has sensitive skin.  It really softens.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this to apply on my son&#x27;s skin / body as he is having skin hexima..&lt;br /&gt;We are continuously using this cream.. when we apply this cream.. my son feels better but we have to apply this continuously</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my dermatologist. I bought a tube from her for the full retail price. When it was time for a refill I checked to see if I could find it at a cheaper price. I found this larger (double) size here on Amazon for way less than the retail price of the tube.</li>
            <li> I am a 71-year-old woman with dry skin.  I have tried numerous lotions, but none helped my skin as much as  Avene TriXera.  The 13.52 fl. oz. size is pricey, but it goes a long way.  More importantly, it has helped my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> This lotion irritated my skin when I put it on my legs, and made my skin sting and burn for a couple of minutes after administration. Also the consistency is a little bit thin considering it is supposed to be deeply hydrating. It didn&#x27;t make my eczema worse, but it certainly didn&#x27;t help much either.</li>
            <li> excellent for dry skin</li>
    </ol>
