    <ol>
            <li>I just tried the Yes to Cucumbers and find that its equally wonderful.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU TO SAY YES TO Tomatoes for making an AWESOME product.  </li>
            <li>I still use the Yes to Blueberries night cream to help keep the wrinkles away, and they work marvelously together!</li>

            <li>and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>

            <li>I have acne prone/combination skin and this moisturizer is amazing!!</li>
            <li>If they had an even lighter version, it would be ideal for summer.</li>
            <li>It feels great on and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>so ideally I like a moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and leaves my skin looking and feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li>coming from someone who has tried a variety of moisturizers on the market this is the best doesnt break me out , smells good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great for me</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy I tried it.</li>
            <li>Not the case with this moisturizer, plus it comes at a great price on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>they have a great line of products</li>
            <li>Yes to whatever makes some great products.</li>
            <li>I thought this moisturizer was great</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want to say don&#x27;t try this - my sister still uses the mask and her face is looking great, but this just happened to not work for me.</li>
            <li>Great feel, smell, and quality, though.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell that great.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>The cream is great in winter, and I use it both in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li>Now I am so happy I bought it &amp; wish I&#x27;d have bought it sooner.</li>
            <li>Great lotion.</li>
            <li>Really happy with this moisturiser.</li>
            <li>I would say it works great for just a cleaner and moisturizer but, not so for acne.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>It goes on great, feels wonderful, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Love it !!</li>
            <li>I use this moisturizer instead of the one that came with the Exposed skin care set, which has proven to also be very effective on my oily and&lt;br /&gt;acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>And frankly no matter how good it is for some</li>
            <li>I have given it a good therapeutic trial before offering an endorsement.  </li>
            <li>I would give this product 1000 stars if I could, plus it is fairly priced.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid-30s with combination type, fair skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned the product a good 6 months</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find anything else that works so good.</li>
            <li>My skin is fair, combo leaning toward oily, acne prone, sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>seemed really good, so I bought it via my prime account and got the product in 1 day.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a couple of things to be known about this product though, good or bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to have a lot of good nutrients for your skin.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about this brand and specifically this moisturizer</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel really good throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li>So I needed a good moisturizer to help with that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is probably a good thing since anything with fragrance in it also dries out your skin.</li>
            <li>I use it at night after using the gel cleanser and repairing lotion and it smells gorgeous.</li>
            <li>good quality and value for money</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has fragrance, but it is very pleasant and light.  </li>
            <li>I move on quickly lol :)</li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed that it works this well in winter.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Love this Moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is a pretty awesome product.  </li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product, and will probably keep purchasing it!</li>
            <li>A+++++++ FAST SHIPPING!!!!!</li>
            <li>This has a great light texture, but I still avoid putting it on my nose which tends to be oily (</li>
            <li>To products smell amazing</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;ll be great in summertime too because it&#x27;s so light, and</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I use this after I wash my face in the morning and night and it keeps my skin nice and balanced all day.</li>
            <li>maybe a nice moistorizer for someone elses skin but not for mine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Awesome product and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I wish I liked it.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not greasy at all</li>
            <li>To moisturizers are as good of a product as Clinique, but more affordable.</li>
            <li>I really liked the face wipes</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great, basic moisturizer at a very good price.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has a nice, light scent and a good feel on my face...</li>
            <li>skin is incredibly picky though and where many have had success</li>
            <li>the scent is very strong</li>
            <li>I will update my review after I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a day! :)  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice - very light.</li>
            <li>cheap perfume would be a good way to describe it.</li>
            <li>Within three applications this product was more effective than months of others.</li>
            <li>This is working wonderfully to help clear up my DD&#x27;s skin along w/</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very very impressed.</li>
            <li>Love, love LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>At first it was great.  </li>
            <li>I have combination/sensitive skin (very light tone).</li>
            <li>it really is the best daily moisturizer to balance out ur skins own oil love this!!</li>
            <li>I love Yes To products and this one met my fussy standards for organic skin care.  </li>
            <li>and I simply love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Anything would cause a flare-up, even applying sunscreen was sure to clog pores causing a Godzilla eruption.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I needed something more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>After about a week of use my skin is clearer and more even.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love a lot of the \\&quot;Yes to (produce)\\&quot; line; I&#x27;d already been using the Yes to Blueberries night cream when my St. Ives day cream made me start breaking out.</li>
            <li>My staple not heavy not too light just perfect!</li>
            <li>The change was not immediate, but my acne seems to have mostly gone away and the acne scars are beginning to recede as well.</li>
            <li>After a month or so, I got used to the thicker texture, and feel like this does a better job keeping my skin hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she was finally able to wear a tank top without being embarrassed.  </li>
            <li>I love this company and all of their products.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>instead I had more breakouts.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Really nice, light moisturizer for the summer months when my face is more oily.</li>
            <li>I found what I love and have included it below.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I love this stuff\\&quot; and I have a lot of my friends using it as well.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the texture of this cream.</li>
            <li>love it, but it costs quite a bit&lt;</li>
            <li>To Tomatoes face products and love them all, I also use the Yes</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin just seemed to get more oily.  </li>
            <li>In my tireless search for the perfect oil-free moisturizer, I have tried anything from high-end products to Olay&#x27;s Beauty Fluid.</li>
            <li>Yes to Tomatoes off Amazon on a whim and love it.</li>
            <li>i love yes to tomatoes :)</li>
            <li>Cucumber works way better for my type of skin.</li>
            <li>and I usually love everything)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Its so overwhelming it makes me nauseous.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Love they are natural-based.  </li>
            <li>Has become a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and will be buying more when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>the longer I have been using notice I have not has as many breakouts.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on.</li>
            <li>Yes to Tomatoes has been my favorite skin care line that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the product as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of years and love it.  </li>
            <li>It is very light/not greasy and smells great.</li>
            <li>I thought this was more of a unisex/natural moisturizer</li>
            <li>I REALLY love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to go well with more oily skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve mostly had oily skin during my life</li>
            <li>But, ick!, the overwhelming floral perfume made it unbearable for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprised at so many good reviews because I cannot find anything good about this product.</li>
            <li>But so far, so good!</li>
            <li>It feels very light going on and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty good buy, and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>However, the too-much moisture become great in the winter in New England weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant, sweet and perfume, definitely not harsh.</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well, nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li>To product would be best for people with dry</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin ( post accutane) and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It also smells lovely, very light and sweet.</li>
            <li>If your skin isn&#x27;t super oily and you don&#x27;t live in a climate where it&#x27;s incredibly humid, it might do what you want it to.  </li>
            <li>I have never gotten five huge pimples at one time - three at the most.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer feels great and leaves you skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind it at all and most importantly</li>
            <li>Great combination for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am honestly so surprised by how great this moisturizer is.</li>
            <li>It is also perfect for a changing climate that experiences a lot of extreme warm/cold spells.</li>
            <li>Even if acne is not an issue for you the tomato spreads A LOT better and is absorbed by the skin without residue!</li>
            <li>, it makes it easy to get just what you need out.</li>
            <li>I started looking better within a few uses and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I like that they&#x27;re paraben free, cruelty free, and mostly natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t significantly strong so it wouldn&#x27;t be a deal-breaker, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This has fragrance in it and it&#x27;s too strong for my allergies.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper here than at Target, which is nice for the first try.</li>
            <li>I like this moisturizer, the smell was not bad and it is my go to moisturizer on most days.  </li>
            <li>My skin is dewey, the fine lines are diminishing, and even the deeper ones are showing improvement.</li>
            <li>I have yet to try that water mix since I like it just fine.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly, and easily and dispenses from a pump bottle.</li>
            <li>Very creamy &amp; moisturizing without the oily feel, I love this products smells great &amp; only takes a dime sized amount for a great facial coat it can&#x27;t give it an honest opinion on the &amp;#34;clear skin&amp;#34; because was not a problem to begin with</li>
            <li>To Tomatoes works for me very well, and I would recommend that anyone who has been trying product after product, searching for one they can finally love, should try Yes To!</li>
            <li>but it LITERATELY smells like one of those cheap Wal-mart perfumes broke and poured all over</li>
            <li>And it is not oil free.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even joking its nourished, hydrated, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great daily moisturizer for those with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It is light.</li>
            <li>The Olay one is fantastic, as it absorbs almost immediately because it is so light.</li>
            <li>FINALLY!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found a great moisturizer that does NOT break me out AND helps rid of my current breakout.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using it (and I haven&#x27;t changed anything else about my routine), my breakouts have cleared and my skin looks really fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>product manages that; it feels both light and moisturizing on my skin, and has never given me any problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not oily, semi-lightweight, and it smells terrific (like carrot cake lol).</li>
            <li>it is light weight</li>
            <li>This lotion is fantastic.</li>
            <li>If they make a fragrance free version of this I might try it again.</li>
            <li>but it glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on creamy yet light.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had good, clear skin since before I was a teenager</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily and smells nice (kind of like French toast for some reason..</li>
            <li>So far this product is by far the best.</li>
            <li>irritation, no strong fragrance, goes on evenly, and makes my face look and feel GREAT!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and glowy!</li>
            <li>I am so happy and will keep buying this for as long as I can.</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>used this for two weeks and at first I was like, okay,</li>
            <li>so I have always tried to support Eco friendly products, but it seemed my skin wouldn&#x27;t cooperate.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try out this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Well, until I chance upon a better one, of course ;).</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>have gone through Aveeno clarifying moisturizers (with and without SPF), The Body Shop lines (vitamin e, tea tree, and aloe), Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter... and possibly even more over the years, and this is just simply the best I&#x27;ve come</li>
            <li>The scent is quite strong but not unpleasant, and does not affect my sensitive skin, it actually feels wonderfully when you apply it.</li>
            <li>The face wash did its job, my skin was clean.  </li>
            <li>I guess balancing cream for oily/combination skin should be light and absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;YtD is mostly (98% as written on the can) made of natural ingredients and I love how Yes to is upfront about what they put in their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then, a couple years ago, I grew more interested in the true care of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is light, absorbs quickly, and thankfully moisturises.</li>
            <li>It is perfect in thickness (not too thick but not too light either).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all-I actually find it pleasant.</li>
            <li>Daily Moisturizer has a pleasant scent, though it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I prefer.</li>
            <li>Very soft and smells nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and natural, which i love!</li>
            <li>Did not do anything special for my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, my makeup goes on more easily, and yes, it is helping to clear up my breakouts!</li>
            <li>I find that with my oily skin, more than once a day would be too much moisture.</li>
            <li>This is a nice natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and when i switched to the daily moisturizing lotion i loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect balance and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy or feeling thick.</li>
            <li>If I use a full squirt of this stuff, my face would be moisturized for days.</li>
            <li>I have developed skin with a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use the most gentle moisturizers or even wash my face with the most gentle cleansers - it was a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This goes for all Yes to.. moisturizers - they smell good, go on smooth, and leave my face moisturized during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes a huge difference right after I put it on as if I could star in one if those beauty commercials.</li>
            <li>This lotion very quickly calmed everything down,and it was truely amazing how much better my skin looked after just a few days.</li>
            <li>And my skin felt irritated, almost like a mild sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This moisturizer soaks in quickly and keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>The acne products have salicylic acid which is super drying and</li>
            <li>Loyal user.</li>
            <li>but honestly you barely notice it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>Overall, the consistency was nice and it went on smoothly when I used the right</li>
            <li>It smells nice, it applies nice, and it feels nice to know you&#x27;re using something at least somewhat natural...</li>
            <li>This product caused my face to turn bright red and burning hot.</li>
            <li>and when I apply this moisturizer.. my face instantly looks better!</li>
            <li>It is soothing, and seems to hold up pretty well during the day!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is the first I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s 98% natural AND cruelty-free!</li>
            <li>The best drugstore moisturizer, an upgrade from this would be department store ones (more expensive alternatives: I&#x27;m also using pure Argan Oil or L&#x27;occitane first-sign-of-aging moisturizer in the winter).</li>
            <li>was so excited to read positive reviews for this item &amp; immediately bought one ($15.49 at Walgreens)</li>
            <li>I decided to treat myself to a real face moisturizer instead of using just a cheap non-condegemic lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it about 4-5 times now, but I see amazing</li>
            <li>I washed it off, and had to put ointment on my face to calm the burning.  </li>
            <li>My face just looked red and kind of stung.</li>
            <li>love that these products are Paraben-free and 98% natural.  </li>
            <li>love that these products are Paraben-free and 98% natural.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this from a gel moisturizer because I wanted something more natural, and even though the gel was working alright with my combination skin</li>
            <li>have used burts bees, proactive, Lush, Dermalogica, Murad and many others from when I have received facials.</li>
            <li>I had been using Alba Botanical Coconut Milk Face Wash, and while it smelled nice, I started breaking out massively after 3-4 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Trying to keep the ingredients more natural, I tried the Yes</li>
            <li>Will not order again, but only because I know natural oils are still cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also taken my natural/organic product usage to the next level, in making my own concoctions at home.</li>
            <li>it is MORE moisturizing than my old one and at 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes well, skin feels fresh, smells like cinnamon bread</li>
            <li>and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I will however say that after taking a bath one day &amp; cleaned my face with warm water I put on the moisturizer and my face got red &amp;  </li>
            <li>I have started to use more natural products, so I thought I would give this a go.</li>
            <li>Because on top of being oily, my skin is sensitive and acne-prone.</li>
            <li>love that it is mostly natural.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something with a little more oomph!!</li>
            <li>I started with this moisturizer and face wash, and they made my skin feel so good, I started looking for other products by the Yes</li>
            <li>I just received it in the mail and had to try it out right away.  </li>
            <li>As of right now, I will repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li>Once applied though, you barely notice it and it very light.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not 100% sure it breaks me out, could possibly good for others with less sensitive skin but</li>
            <li>After only 1 use, the bright red of my breakout spots were no longer bright red!  </li>
            <li>About 4 months ago, when I really started noticing that my acne had receded, I also started using the Yes to Grapefruit CC Cream - Light (with SPF 18) as a daily face sunblock/moisturizer which is very lightly tinted.</li>
            <li>They are salicylic acid pads, but for some reason when I use this product, it makes my face feel soft and clean, unlike the Clean &amp; Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries VERY quickly and really seems to soak in, but it gets very greasy overnight.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a sweet floral scent which I found to be too much.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion each morning (right after I get out of the shower), and in the evening after wiping my face with a hot washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin so the oiliness balances it out (it gives my face a nice glow</li>
            <li>I bought the whole set of this facial cleaner and it did smell and feel really nice on my face</li>
            <li>It does moisturize evenly without oily or dry patches, its just not my kind of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very nice moisturizer, without the heavy greasy feel!  </li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s not an astonishingly large amount of product, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li>I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>but I had not been out in the sun for more than enough time to get out of my car and walk in and out of places.&lt;br</li>
            <li>finally it was Accutane that cleared my skin for many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been getting some complements on my complexion --- for the first time, ever.  </li>
            <li>But, the most important factor is:  I have only had one bump, early in the trial;  </li>
            <li>;) NOT.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;ll see how long the shinies stay away, so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>First i use in the morning(with</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product because it moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, but it can be pretty greasy.</li>
            <li>Fast absorbed.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it at first</li>
            <li>I was really devastated; I was so self-conscious that I didn&#x27;t want to leave my house for work and school for a week!</li>
            <li>I have always had pretty hardy skin.</li>
            <li>I feel confident that in spring, especially summer, this moisturizer would still work well (without the aveeno).</li>
            <li>first degree is also in Environment</li>
            <li>I would prefer if the product were local, but I still love this product.</li>
            <li>and she loves it better than her Christian Dior moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The description for this product is pretty to the point.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today is the first day that I have 1-2 whiteheads as opposed to the 30 whiteheads + 6 cycstic acne bumps, etc from before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the entire</li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve been switching between high-end and lower end products such as Guerlain, Dior, Skin Authority, Lancome, Aveda, Aveeno...</li>
            <li>It lasts you awhile, and that&#x27;s with me being pretty generous with the amount I use on my skin</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been using Murad&#x27;s anti-acne lotion, and have been very happy with the results, with a few minor exceptions - the price, and the \\&quot;weight\\&quot; of the lotion</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s pretty lightweight</li>
            <li>I like this stuff better than the Murad at a third of the price!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pump, but I don&#x27;t see a way to uncap the bottle to make sure you get the last bit out of it when you are nearing the end.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin on my cheeks and a little oily in the t-zone sometimes, and this is the perfect weight for me to use as a daytime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Cutting the amount in half is perfect - my skin feels nice and smooth without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I doubt the claims of being natural because as soon as you put it on it has a very UNNATURAL, strong scent-</li>
            <li>Plus, the price, compared to other skin care products, is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried clean &amp; clear and Neutrogena and neither of them worked as well for my skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin baby soft and still clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I plan to buy it in bulk and smuggle it back home (where a bottle goes for a whopping $25!)</li>
            <li>I also feel good about putting such a natural product on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the salicyclic acid in it because that&#x27;s what the clean &amp; clear moisturizer that I bought had in it, but whatever else is in it is very soothing.</li>
            <li>so i usually use it most every other day but it feels really good and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like most facial moisturizers do.</li>
            <li>Now, I have super clear skin</li>
            <li>My skin is not oily or dry at the end of the day :).</li>
            <li>My face seems to like the product used sparingly, I still do get the occasional pimple, but it goes away very quick.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a good sign, but then in the second to third week I suddenly got five huge pimples in some really unusual places on my face-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live with out it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using simple brand replenishing moisturizer and that was working fine for me</li>
            <li>You only need to use a little, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>I really like the light scent, personally.</li>
            <li>I was bummed because it promised so much.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>but I really like the smell it has (doesn&#x27;t smell tomato</li>
            <li>I use this to moisturize, and Cetaphil Gentle Skin cleanser to cleanse.</li>
            <li>give it 2 stars because delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a whole, I like this product line.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I like the way it glides on and makes my face feel really hydrated.</li>
            <li>The smell is so intense.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face moisturized without too much oiliness.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really put my hand on it, but its very perfume-y.</li>
            <li>My skin is very picky when it comes to skin care.</li>
            <li>just very well hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the scent is very feminine.</li>
            <li>I really like the</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really struggled with acne.</li>
            <li>so I really have to pile it on during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Yes to Tomatoes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this so much, because I usually only use natural or organic products.</li>
            <li>To products, especially their cucumber eye gel, so I expected good things from their tomato face lotion.</li>
            <li>And finally, I turned to Aveeno, hoping to be more natural with my skin care choices.</li>
            <li>I have gradually been able to re-incorporate some of my old products back into my regimen.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and have been struggling to find the right balance of products.  </li>
            <li>why: It&#x27;s light to touch and absorbs right into your skin, has a very gentle fragrance, comes in a pump so you can use as little or as much as you need, is about a 3 on a scale of 1-10 for &#x27;greasiness&#x27;..</li>
            <li>&amp; I only break out with like 3 pimples right before my period on my forehead or right around my chin.</li>
            <li>The smell is not terrible like other people have mentioned.</li>
            <li>My sensitivity results in redness and sometimes stinging sensations with certain products, even high end moisturizers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only plus side to this stuff is the texture, its pretty fluffy and the ease of application is pretty nice, but that is IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love moisturizing and know that is really important, especially during these winter months, but some moisturizers leave me feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so overpowering, it make me wonder why a product that claims to &#x27;clear skin&#x27; can have such a strong perfume in it.</li>
            <li>Slight scent, overall good moisturizer for drugstore</li>
            <li>The lotion itself was fine; I have problem dry skin, and this moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I have searched and searched for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or super greasy, and this is it!</li>
            <li>After struggling with acne, sensitive skin, humid Southern summers, and moisture-sucking Northeastern winters - the full spectrum of skin nightmares - through my teenage years and early 20s, I noticed a phenomenal change in my skin when I started to use this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>After applying the moisturizer to the rest of my face, I use my moisturized hands to barely dab the nose and that seems to be the right amount).</li>
            <li>Some people need more or less than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have dry skin and prefer light fragrance, this might work well for you.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t go back to the YTC facial lotion sans SPF because I had already fallen in love with the Yes</li>
            <li>Six months later it is finally getting better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many expensive department store brands and have never been fully satisfied with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>Like an older woman&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>However, I think this particular</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, which can dry out quite easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every single skin care product available, spending thousands of dollars.  </li>
            <li>I use this moisturizer as a \\&quot;first coat\\&quot; because it is not very heavy, and i need something \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; to lock in the moisture (</li>
            <li>Honestly, at first it really wasn&#x27;t strong enough &amp; I had some dry patches on my face that needed to be remoisturized halfway through the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich cream that keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day long, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any acne flare-ups.</li>
            <li>It was months of trying clinical solutions before I finally was able to calm my skin down.  </li>
            <li>it cleared up promptly, when using the &#x27;Yes Spot Stick&#x27; at bedtime (which I highly recommend, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was having to wear high neck t-shirts to hide the acne</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Been looking for a moisturizer for my very oily skin and so far this once seems to work better than any of the more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>Smells great, even left my face looking better after the burning and discoloration subsided, but it was impossible to keep using.</li>
            <li>The KEY to this being so great, is that when you have sensitive and dry skin, all of the acne products you use (that include the key ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide) dry your skin even more.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has completely changed my skin!!  </li>
            <li>The only thing that helped some was &#x27;Clean &amp; Clear OIL-FREE&#x27;  moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve evolved much over the years as far as moisturizers are concerned.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>have very oily skin and adult acne.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m REALLY picky about items that go near my nose.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a blessing because normally i have combination skin problems:</li>
            <li>and I use a Clarisonic a few times a week, and I think those both help exfoliate my skin and help it absorb the nutrients better.</li>
            <li>She has actually pretty much always had a constant presence of acne in those areas until now.</li>
            <li>I was unsure and the smell was a little strong but ended up using the whole package</li>
            <li>Other reviews complain of the smell, however the lotion smelled pleasant and slightly floral, nothing like a pizza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very excited because I don&#x27;t think I am going to be let down!</li>
            <li>after several months of using, particularly in the summer: this was fine for winter, but in the summer it only adds to the shine that my T-zone acquires on hot/humid days.</li>
            <li>I read the other review before purchasing and I have to disagree with some having issues with the smell being unpleasant,it smells just fine to me.</li>
            <li>I feared the Yes to Tomatoes daily moisturizer might not be quite strong enough for me, as I&#x27;m 40</li>
            <li>It is a light moisturizer targeted for those who need a little bit more moisture than your average \\&quot;acne\\&quot; type skin (as the Yes to</li>
            <li>My face has never felt tight, irritated, or oily after using it--even after exfoliation when my skin is most sensitive.</li>
            <li>Other products in the brand&#x27;s \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; line are likewise fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I live on the east coast where we deal with four season weather:</li>
            <li>I was on a mission for a new skin care regime because I noticed that my skin was changing.</li>
            <li>- I can totally live with them but for the sake of others wanted to include them)</li>
            <li>though very light small amount in AM under Primer&lt;br /&gt;Colorescience</li>
            <li>I think my skin is just sensitive to a particular ingredient in this lotion.</li>
            <li>The Yes to Daily Balancing Moisturizer is gentler on my skin which actually became almost dry after using Exposed (it was that effective on me) and hydrates</li>
            <li>my skin was unhappy until I found it on Amazon...and my skin is back to feeling happy!</li>
            <li>at first I really liked it, it smells a little vanilla/bakery to me, but after a few weeks I&#x27;d really just prefer if it were unscented.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Especially during the dry winter months it keeps my skin from drying out and becoming itchy.</li>
            <li>My go-to moisturizer changed their formula for the worse, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a new affordable moisturizer that is natural and good for sensitive and acne</li>
            <li>delivers NO moisture at all, in fact for me it did the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>I have just finished my first bottle and have my next on order.  </li>
            <li>I have used moisturizers in the past (even though it seems oily skin wouldn&#x27;t need moisture, most beauty sites and experts say all skin needs moisturizer) and they have been semi-successful.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been using Dove unscented, sensitive skin soap to wash my face, hydrogen peroxide to spot treat, and then this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>I first tried Daily Pore Scrub, Roller Ball and Acne Repair Lotion (can purchase in store at Target for 19.99) before purchasing this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Naturally made, my skin loves it!</li>
            <li>The smell is a little odd--makes me think of a cross between sandalwood and old lady face powder--but I&#x27;m getting used to it, and I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a product that&#x27;s both all natural and delivers on its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine that this would help with fine lines and wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a difference in that regard.</li>
            <li>It lightly moisturized with out clogging my pores and calmed down my acne.</li>
            <li>with just a partial pump of this stuff my skin felt like it had a lot on it, and it didn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as I like.</li>
            <li>I can only really smell it for 5 minutes or so, but it&#x27;s just not a scent I would normally want to put on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has helped to make such a positive influence on my skin.</li>
            <li>There is a noticeable change in my complexion as well; overall, the tone is more even with less redness.</li>
            <li>I use this as a night cream because its slightly heavier, and your skin can definitely use more moisture during the night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less expensive than most products claiming to be this effective.</li>
            <li>To Tomatoes&#x27;  for clear skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear in seven years.</li>
            <li>It was the only one I could find that wouldn&#x27;t break me out (even though I don&#x27;t generally even have breakout prone skin - moisturizer would do it in a hot minute).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to if it has helped clear up my pimples or even out my tone because I only use it on an as-needed basis.</li>
            <li>If I use a moisturizer that&#x27;s too thick and heavy, my pores clog and I get breakouts; this moisturizer is a happy medium.</li>
            <li>Ive got combination acne prone skin, my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>the yes to tomatoes is so moisturizing but not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>A dime size amount covers my whole face and neck (including back of the neck).</li>
            <li>Yes, my skin is fairly sensitive</li>
            <li>This is going directly to the trash.</li>
            <li>and I can already see an improvement, old acne scars are getting lighter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had oily skin, and I&#x27;ve been battling adult acne since my son was born two years ago.</li>
            <li>Yes To Cucumbers Daily Gentle Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am 38yrs old...</li>
            <li>the winter/fall/spring: one pump is enough for the whole face.</li>
            <li>This soaks in and leaves skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t see more even skintone, I did not have any breakout yet (it either prevents breakout, or at least do not cause breakout).&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far my skin feels REALLY soft and well moisturized, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Nothing natural could smell that way.</li>
            <li>My T-zone still oily, but the rest of my face is soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It does keep the sensitive skin under my eyes soft.</li>
            <li>Finding a moisturizer that my sensitive skin approves of is always a nightmare for me.  </li>
            <li>And the way it dispenses there is no waste.</li>
            <li>To line has completely amazed me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mostly natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend it if you have sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>and I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried almost all of their Yes</li>
            <li>weather or not its doing the job in keeping me young looking.</li>
            <li>I feel young.</li>
            <li>its not heavy, greasy or cause my face to break out or heat up</li>
            <li>At 25 years old, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every product ever.  </li>
            <li>Not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin at all, save yourself the money and the pain and steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li>But as far as moisturizing goes, grade</li>
            <li>The latter better fit my budget, and wouldn&#x27;t you know, appeased my angry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with acne and oily skin since I was 10 years old, and being in my 30s hasn&#x27;t changed that.  </li>
            <li>only complaint is that it has no SPF in it, but honestly I love the product so much I don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so perfumey, like what an old lady would wear.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell natural at all.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin does not break out.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list is acceptable as far as lotions go.</li>
            <li>I was using purpose for sensitive skin with spf which seemed alright in the summer</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m guessing its part of the natural ingredients in it that gives it that smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my skin so soft too.</li>
            <li>It cleared up the overall tone of my skin from bumpy and blotchy to a more even tone with just a few post acne discolorations.</li>
            <li>It will last me a long time since I don&#x27;t even need a full pump to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li>After many years of suffering from embarrassing acne, I finally realized that my skin was sensitive to the SPF that is usually present in facial moisturizers and caused me to breakout constantly.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not bad, and it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Eh... doubtful, but it certainly makes my face feel gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Pricey products are not really an option right now, and I stumbled upon a combination that works for me--Purpose face wash, this moisturizer, and a dab of Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Spot Treatment.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I have combination skin (oily T-zone and dry cheeks).</li>
            <li>You know how much you need (taking in consideration the creamier than normal quality).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t broken out from this product at all, and its been good few weeks since I started using it.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals, just a clean feeling for everyday.</li>
            <li>Use a little on first use, and your face will let you know how much it needs.</li>
            <li>I would be okay with the smell if it were subtle.</li>
            <li>Instant allergic reaction the first time I used it - red, blotchy skin.</li>
            <li>days when I have worn more makeup than usual, or I&#x27;ve been exercising, or working in the garden, I will use the &#x27;Yes Deep Cleansing Pads&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This causes more product to be used as one pump does not cover enough surface area, and I have a small face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im not typically finicky about fragrances, but this is Not at all what I&#x27;d expect from YTC.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended product for oily skin sufferers such as myself!</li>
            <li>I have a very oily T-zone, dry cheeks, enlarged pores and adult acne.</li>
            <li>requiring so many words for this review is not good idea</li>
            <li>I was wary of trying any kind of moisturizer on my oily skin, but this has completely changed my views!</li>
            <li>The challenge as an adult is to find a product that is light enough to not cause my oily skin to break out, but not drying or harsh on my now aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Now this is my new facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I got this because my sister actually loves the Yes to Carrots face mask; she said her face cleared up so much after using the mask several times.</li>
            <li>This lotion is gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and definitely provides me with enough moisture.  </li>
            <li>When I heard that it&#x27;s best to use one NOW to prevent skin issues in the future, I started to search for one that would work with my annoying skin.</li>
            <li>pros are that it&#x27;s a great product WITHOUT SPF that works for my skin, the price point is much better than what I had been buying before, and since a little of this goes a long way (I seriously use less than a pea-sized amount), it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t get the big cystic pimples/ acne, but gets a lot of smaller ones (clusters) along her hair line, the sides of her face, &amp; forehead pretty regularly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price for the little pump bottle.</li>
            <li>skin is healthy (a lot less oily and less spots)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything great about it, but I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it either.</li>
            <li>To brand in general.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try to help clear up my daughter&#x27;s acne on her back and chest.  </li>
            <li>the YTT Clear Skin Deep Pore Scrub &amp; Clear Skin Deep Pore Scrub.</li>
            <li>I can barely use this moisturizer in the summer if I apply sparingly and sit in front of the fan.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t finish the bottle, and went back to my old stuff.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to be careful not to use too much; I did a time or two</li>
            <li>Recently I was mistaken for being in my early twenties (which I am not)--</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY moisturizer I can and will (so far) use on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At one point, I used generic Vitamin E \\&quot;pastes\\&quot; that only broke out my normally acne-free face.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to use a moisturizer with out it irritating and rash-ing up my skin.</li>
            <li>I used to have to duck into the restroom around lunch to blot my entire face, but this stuff makes my skin look more matte (without being dull and flat) throughout the day and into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>burned slightly the first i used it but hasn&#x27;t since.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin, do NOT make the same mistake I made and continue using this product if you notice a problem after the first few days.</li>
            <li>I have oily combination and acne prone skin and live in a dry northern state.</li>
            <li>I have wasted so much money on moisturizers for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find natural products that actually work for me, and I finally have!</li>
            <li>dry, somewhat lathery,  and VERY sensitive to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say, the scent is a little displeasing, I can&#x27;t really describe it, but you can tell they don&#x27;t add any perfumes!</li>
            <li>It also was not hydrating enough for my normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>This you will probably figure out from one use, but I hope this saves you that messy first experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thick but absorbs pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Gently press down so that the flow is well controlled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will still try other products from this brand because of the high quality.</li>
            <li>I often wonder how much my skin was previously reacting to chemicals that it just couldn&#x27;t tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I often wonder how much my skin was previously reacting to chemicals that it just couldn&#x27;t tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out but leaves it feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have quite dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has a thick consistency and a mild perfume smell</li>
            <li>The other thing I&#x27;ll say is that it leaves my skin feeling a tiny bit tight, which at first made me feel that it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough, but now I realize that it is very moisturizing, and the tightness is just a minor annoyance that I&#x27;ve gotten used to.</li>
            <li>Although I have been very upset to revisit the past through acne, I was surprised to read, recently, that 40% of women who have never had acne are now experiencing it at mid-life and beyond --- well into their sixties.</li>
            <li>I do have the now rare, occasional deep pimple, but nothing in comparison to the past--</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has fixed my dry skin around my nose and brow area.</li>
            <li>Some background on my skin type: I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have not had problems with acne during my lifetime, but my skin is sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li>After this, I immediately stopped using Yes to Carrots and went back to my old moisturizer, which doesn&#x27;t leave me pimple free, but at least they are fewer and less</li>
            <li>pump bottle dispenses a little too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pale, but this moisturizer has brightened my skin and actually seems to improve circulation, so my skin is a little bit more pink than before.</li>

            <li> they have a great line of products</li>
            <li> Yes to whatever makes some great products.</li>
            <li> I thought this moisturizer was great</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to say don&#x27;t try this - my sister still uses the mask and her face is looking great, but this just happened to not work for me.</li>
            <li> Great feel, smell, and quality, though.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell that great.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> The cream is great in winter, and I use it both in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> Now I am so happy I bought it &amp; wish I&#x27;d have bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> Great lotion.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this moisturiser.</li>
            <li> I would say it works great for just a cleaner and moisturizer but, not so for acne.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> It goes on great, feels wonderful, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Love it !!</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer instead of the one that came with the Exposed skin care set, which has proven to also be very effective on my oily and&lt;br /&gt;acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> And frankly no matter how good it is for some</li>
            <li> I have given it a good therapeutic trial before offering an endorsement.  </li>
            <li> I would give this product 1000 stars if I could, plus it is fairly priced.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-30s with combination type, fair skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the product a good 6 months</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find anything else that works so good.</li>
            <li> My skin is fair, combo leaning toward oily, acne prone, sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> seemed really good, so I bought it via my prime account and got the product in 1 day.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a couple of things to be known about this product though, good or bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to have a lot of good nutrients for your skin.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this brand and specifically this moisturizer</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel really good throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li> So I needed a good moisturizer to help with that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is probably a good thing since anything with fragrance in it also dries out your skin.</li>
            <li> I use it at night after using the gel cleanser and repairing lotion and it smells gorgeous.</li>
            <li> good quality and value for money</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has fragrance, but it is very pleasant and light.  </li>
            <li> I move on quickly lol :)</li>
            <li> Love them!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed that it works this well in winter.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Love this Moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is a pretty awesome product.  </li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product, and will probably keep purchasing it!</li>
            <li> A+++++++ FAST SHIPPING!!!!!</li>
            <li> This has a great light texture, but I still avoid putting it on my nose which tends to be oily (</li>
            <li> To products smell amazing</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;ll be great in summertime too because it&#x27;s so light, and</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I use this after I wash my face in the morning and night and it keeps my skin nice and balanced all day.</li>
            <li> maybe a nice moistorizer for someone elses skin but not for mine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Awesome product and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I wish I liked it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not greasy at all</li>
            <li> To moisturizers are as good of a product as Clinique, but more affordable.</li>
            <li> I really liked the face wipes</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great, basic moisturizer at a very good price.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a nice, light scent and a good feel on my face...</li>
            <li> skin is incredibly picky though and where many have had success</li>
            <li> the scent is very strong</li>
            <li> I will update my review after I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a day! :)  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice - very light.</li>
            <li> cheap perfume would be a good way to describe it.</li>
            <li> Within three applications this product was more effective than months of others.</li>
            <li> This is working wonderfully to help clear up my DD&#x27;s skin along w/</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very very impressed.</li>
            <li> Love, love LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> At first it was great.  </li>
            <li> I have combination/sensitive skin (very light tone).</li>
            <li> it really is the best daily moisturizer to balance out ur skins own oil love this!!</li>
            <li> I love Yes To products and this one met my fussy standards for organic skin care.  </li>
            <li> and I simply love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Anything would cause a flare-up, even applying sunscreen was sure to clog pores causing a Godzilla eruption.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I needed something more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> After about a week of use my skin is clearer and more even.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love a lot of the \\&quot;Yes to (produce)\\&quot; line; I&#x27;d already been using the Yes to Blueberries night cream when my St. Ives day cream made me start breaking out.</li>
            <li> My staple not heavy not too light just perfect!</li>
            <li> The change was not immediate, but my acne seems to have mostly gone away and the acne scars are beginning to recede as well.</li>
            <li> After a month or so, I got used to the thicker texture, and feel like this does a better job keeping my skin hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she was finally able to wear a tank top without being embarrassed.  </li>
            <li> I love this company and all of their products.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> instead I had more breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, which is mostly oily.</li>

            <li> Love love love this moisturizer,</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really nice, light moisturizer for the summer months when my face is more oily.</li>
            <li> I found what I love and have included it below.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I love this stuff\\&quot; and I have a lot of my friends using it as well.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the texture of this cream.</li>
            <li> love it, but it costs quite a bit&lt;</li>
            <li> To Tomatoes face products and love them all, I also use the Yes</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin just seemed to get more oily.  </li>
            <li> In my tireless search for the perfect oil-free moisturizer, I have tried anything from high-end products to Olay&#x27;s Beauty Fluid.</li>
            <li> Yes to Tomatoes off Amazon on a whim and love it.</li>
            <li> i love yes to tomatoes :)</li>
            <li> Cucumber works way better for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> and I usually love everything)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> love this</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Its so overwhelming it makes me nauseous.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Love they are natural-based.  </li>
            <li> Has become a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and will be buying more when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> the longer I have been using notice I have not has as many breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on.</li>
            <li> Yes to Tomatoes has been my favorite skin care line that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the product as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of years and love it.  </li>
            <li> It is very light/not greasy and smells great.</li>
            <li> I thought this was more of a unisex/natural moisturizer</li>
            <li> I REALLY love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to go well with more oily skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve mostly had oily skin during my life</li>
            <li> But, ick!, the overwhelming floral perfume made it unbearable for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised at so many good reviews because I cannot find anything good about this product.</li>
            <li> But so far, so good!</li>
            <li> It feels very light going on and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty good buy, and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> However, the too-much moisture become great in the winter in New England weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant, sweet and perfume, definitely not harsh.</li>
            <li> I love the smell as well, nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li> To product would be best for people with dry</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin ( post accutane) and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It also smells lovely, very light and sweet.</li>
            <li> If your skin isn&#x27;t super oily and you don&#x27;t live in a climate where it&#x27;s incredibly humid, it might do what you want it to.  </li>
            <li> I have never gotten five huge pimples at one time - three at the most.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great and leaves you skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind it at all and most importantly</li>
            <li> Great combination for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am honestly so surprised by how great this moisturizer is.</li>
            <li> It is also perfect for a changing climate that experiences a lot of extreme warm/cold spells.</li>
            <li> Even if acne is not an issue for you the tomato spreads A LOT better and is absorbed by the skin without residue!</li>
            <li> , it makes it easy to get just what you need out.</li>
            <li> I started looking better within a few uses and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like that they&#x27;re paraben free, cruelty free, and mostly natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t significantly strong so it wouldn&#x27;t be a deal-breaker, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This has fragrance in it and it&#x27;s too strong for my allergies.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper here than at Target, which is nice for the first try.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer, the smell was not bad and it is my go to moisturizer on most days.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dewey, the fine lines are diminishing, and even the deeper ones are showing improvement.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try that water mix since I like it just fine.</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly, and easily and dispenses from a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Very creamy &amp; moisturizing without the oily feel, I love this products smells great &amp; only takes a dime sized amount for a great facial coat it can&#x27;t give it an honest opinion on the &amp;#34;clear skin&amp;#34; because was not a problem to begin with</li>
            <li> To Tomatoes works for me very well, and I would recommend that anyone who has been trying product after product, searching for one they can finally love, should try Yes To!</li>
            <li> but it LITERATELY smells like one of those cheap Wal-mart perfumes broke and poured all over</li>
            <li> And it is not oil free.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even joking its nourished, hydrated, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great daily moisturizer for those with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It is light.</li>
            <li> The Olay one is fantastic, as it absorbs almost immediately because it is so light.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found a great moisturizer that does NOT break me out AND helps rid of my current breakout.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using it (and I haven&#x27;t changed anything else about my routine), my breakouts have cleared and my skin looks really fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> product manages that; it feels both light and moisturizing on my skin, and has never given me any problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not oily, semi-lightweight, and it smells terrific (like carrot cake lol).</li>
            <li> it is light weight</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic.</li>
            <li> If they make a fragrance free version of this I might try it again.</li>
            <li> but it glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It goes on creamy yet light.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had good, clear skin since before I was a teenager</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily and smells nice (kind of like French toast for some reason..</li>
            <li> So far this product is by far the best.</li>
            <li> irritation, no strong fragrance, goes on evenly, and makes my face look and feel GREAT!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and glowy!</li>
            <li> I am so happy and will keep buying this for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> used this for two weeks and at first I was like, okay,</li>
            <li> so I have always tried to support Eco friendly products, but it seemed my skin wouldn&#x27;t cooperate.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try out this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Well, until I chance upon a better one, of course ;).</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> have gone through Aveeno clarifying moisturizers (with and without SPF), The Body Shop lines (vitamin e, tea tree, and aloe), Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter... and possibly even more over the years, and this is just simply the best I&#x27;ve come</li>
            <li> The scent is quite strong but not unpleasant, and does not affect my sensitive skin, it actually feels wonderfully when you apply it.</li>
            <li> The face wash did its job, my skin was clean.  </li>
            <li> I guess balancing cream for oily/combination skin should be light and absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;YtD is mostly (98% as written on the can) made of natural ingredients and I love how Yes to is upfront about what they put in their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then, a couple years ago, I grew more interested in the true care of my skin.</li>
            <li> It is light, absorbs quickly, and thankfully moisturises.</li>
            <li> It is perfect in thickness (not too thick but not too light either).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all-I actually find it pleasant.</li>
            <li> Daily Moisturizer has a pleasant scent, though it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I prefer.</li>
            <li> Very soft and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and natural, which i love!</li>
            <li> Did not do anything special for my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, my makeup goes on more easily, and yes, it is helping to clear up my breakouts!</li>
            <li> I find that with my oily skin, more than once a day would be too much moisture.</li>
            <li> This is a nice natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and when i switched to the daily moisturizing lotion i loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect balance and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy or feeling thick.</li>
            <li> If I use a full squirt of this stuff, my face would be moisturized for days.</li>
            <li> I have developed skin with a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use the most gentle moisturizers or even wash my face with the most gentle cleansers - it was a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This goes for all Yes to.. moisturizers - they smell good, go on smooth, and leave my face moisturized during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes a huge difference right after I put it on as if I could star in one if those beauty commercials.</li>
            <li> This lotion very quickly calmed everything down,and it was truely amazing how much better my skin looked after just a few days.</li>
            <li> And my skin felt irritated, almost like a mild sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This moisturizer soaks in quickly and keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> The acne products have salicylic acid which is super drying and</li>
            <li> Loyal user.</li>
            <li> but honestly you barely notice it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> Overall, the consistency was nice and it went on smoothly when I used the right</li>
            <li> It smells nice, it applies nice, and it feels nice to know you&#x27;re using something at least somewhat natural...</li>
            <li> This product caused my face to turn bright red and burning hot.</li>
            <li> and when I apply this moisturizer.. my face instantly looks better!</li>
            <li> It is soothing, and seems to hold up pretty well during the day!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the first I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s 98% natural AND cruelty-free!</li>
            <li> The best drugstore moisturizer, an upgrade from this would be department store ones (more expensive alternatives: I&#x27;m also using pure Argan Oil or L&#x27;occitane first-sign-of-aging moisturizer in the winter).</li>
            <li> was so excited to read positive reviews for this item &amp; immediately bought one ($15.49 at Walgreens)</li>
            <li> I decided to treat myself to a real face moisturizer instead of using just a cheap non-condegemic lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it about 4-5 times now, but I see amazing</li>
            <li> I washed it off, and had to put ointment on my face to calm the burning.  </li>
            <li> My face just looked red and kind of stung.</li>
            <li> love that these products are Paraben-free and 98% natural.  </li>
            <li> love that these products are Paraben-free and 98% natural.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this from a gel moisturizer because I wanted something more natural, and even though the gel was working alright with my combination skin</li>
            <li> have used burts bees, proactive, Lush, Dermalogica, Murad and many others from when I have received facials.</li>
            <li> I had been using Alba Botanical Coconut Milk Face Wash, and while it smelled nice, I started breaking out massively after 3-4 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Trying to keep the ingredients more natural, I tried the Yes</li>
            <li> Will not order again, but only because I know natural oils are still cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also taken my natural/organic product usage to the next level, in making my own concoctions at home.</li>
            <li> it is MORE moisturizing than my old one and at 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well, skin feels fresh, smells like cinnamon bread</li>
            <li> and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I will however say that after taking a bath one day &amp; cleaned my face with warm water I put on the moisturizer and my face got red &amp;  </li>
            <li> I have started to use more natural products, so I thought I would give this a go.</li>
            <li> Because on top of being oily, my skin is sensitive and acne-prone.</li>
            <li> love that it is mostly natural.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something with a little more oomph!!</li>
            <li> I started with this moisturizer and face wash, and they made my skin feel so good, I started looking for other products by the Yes</li>
            <li> I just received it in the mail and had to try it out right away.  </li>
            <li> As of right now, I will repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> Once applied though, you barely notice it and it very light.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not 100% sure it breaks me out, could possibly good for others with less sensitive skin but</li>
            <li> After only 1 use, the bright red of my breakout spots were no longer bright red!  </li>
            <li> About 4 months ago, when I really started noticing that my acne had receded, I also started using the Yes to Grapefruit CC Cream - Light (with SPF 18) as a daily face sunblock/moisturizer which is very lightly tinted.</li>
            <li> They are salicylic acid pads, but for some reason when I use this product, it makes my face feel soft and clean, unlike the Clean &amp; Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries VERY quickly and really seems to soak in, but it gets very greasy overnight.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a sweet floral scent which I found to be too much.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion each morning (right after I get out of the shower), and in the evening after wiping my face with a hot washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so the oiliness balances it out (it gives my face a nice glow</li>
            <li> I bought the whole set of this facial cleaner and it did smell and feel really nice on my face</li>
            <li> It does moisturize evenly without oily or dry patches, its just not my kind of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer, without the heavy greasy feel!  </li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s not an astonishingly large amount of product, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> but I had not been out in the sun for more than enough time to get out of my car and walk in and out of places.&lt;br</li>
            <li> finally it was Accutane that cleared my skin for many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been getting some complements on my complexion --- for the first time, ever.  </li>
            <li> But, the most important factor is:  I have only had one bump, early in the trial;  </li>
            <li> ;) NOT.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll see how long the shinies stay away, so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> First i use in the morning(with</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product because it moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, but it can be pretty greasy.</li>
            <li> Fast absorbed.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it at first</li>
            <li> I was really devastated; I was so self-conscious that I didn&#x27;t want to leave my house for work and school for a week!</li>
            <li> I have always had pretty hardy skin.</li>
            <li> I feel confident that in spring, especially summer, this moisturizer would still work well (without the aveeno).</li>
            <li> first degree is also in Environment</li>
            <li> I would prefer if the product were local, but I still love this product.</li>
            <li> and she loves it better than her Christian Dior moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The description for this product is pretty to the point.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today is the first day that I have 1-2 whiteheads as opposed to the 30 whiteheads + 6 cycstic acne bumps, etc from before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the entire</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve been switching between high-end and lower end products such as Guerlain, Dior, Skin Authority, Lancome, Aveda, Aveeno...</li>
            <li> It lasts you awhile, and that&#x27;s with me being pretty generous with the amount I use on my skin</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using Murad&#x27;s anti-acne lotion, and have been very happy with the results, with a few minor exceptions - the price, and the \\&quot;weight\\&quot; of the lotion</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s pretty lightweight</li>
            <li> I like this stuff better than the Murad at a third of the price!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pump, but I don&#x27;t see a way to uncap the bottle to make sure you get the last bit out of it when you are nearing the end.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my cheeks and a little oily in the t-zone sometimes, and this is the perfect weight for me to use as a daytime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Cutting the amount in half is perfect - my skin feels nice and smooth without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I doubt the claims of being natural because as soon as you put it on it has a very UNNATURAL, strong scent-</li>
            <li> Plus, the price, compared to other skin care products, is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried clean &amp; clear and Neutrogena and neither of them worked as well for my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin baby soft and still clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I plan to buy it in bulk and smuggle it back home (where a bottle goes for a whopping $25!)</li>
            <li> I also feel good about putting such a natural product on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the salicyclic acid in it because that&#x27;s what the clean &amp; clear moisturizer that I bought had in it, but whatever else is in it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> so i usually use it most every other day but it feels really good and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like most facial moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> Now, I have super clear skin</li>
            <li> My skin is not oily or dry at the end of the day :).</li>
            <li> My face seems to like the product used sparingly, I still do get the occasional pimple, but it goes away very quick.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a good sign, but then in the second to third week I suddenly got five huge pimples in some really unusual places on my face-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live with out it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using simple brand replenishing moisturizer and that was working fine for me</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> I really like the light scent, personally.</li>
            <li> I was bummed because it promised so much.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> but I really like the smell it has (doesn&#x27;t smell tomato</li>
            <li> I use this to moisturize, and Cetaphil Gentle Skin cleanser to cleanse.</li>
            <li> give it 2 stars because delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a whole, I like this product line.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I like the way it glides on and makes my face feel really hydrated.</li>
            <li> The smell is so intense.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face moisturized without too much oiliness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really put my hand on it, but its very perfume-y.</li>
            <li> My skin is very picky when it comes to skin care.</li>
            <li> just very well hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the scent is very feminine.</li>
            <li> I really like the</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really struggled with acne.</li>
            <li> so I really have to pile it on during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Yes to Tomatoes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this so much, because I usually only use natural or organic products.</li>
            <li> To products, especially their cucumber eye gel, so I expected good things from their tomato face lotion.</li>
            <li> And finally, I turned to Aveeno, hoping to be more natural with my skin care choices.</li>
            <li> I have gradually been able to re-incorporate some of my old products back into my regimen.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and have been struggling to find the right balance of products.  </li>
            <li> why: It&#x27;s light to touch and absorbs right into your skin, has a very gentle fragrance, comes in a pump so you can use as little or as much as you need, is about a 3 on a scale of 1-10 for &#x27;greasiness&#x27;..</li>
            <li> &amp; I only break out with like 3 pimples right before my period on my forehead or right around my chin.</li>
            <li> The smell is not terrible like other people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> My sensitivity results in redness and sometimes stinging sensations with certain products, even high end moisturizers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only plus side to this stuff is the texture, its pretty fluffy and the ease of application is pretty nice, but that is IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love moisturizing and know that is really important, especially during these winter months, but some moisturizers leave me feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so overpowering, it make me wonder why a product that claims to &#x27;clear skin&#x27; can have such a strong perfume in it.</li>
            <li> Slight scent, overall good moisturizer for drugstore</li>
            <li> The lotion itself was fine; I have problem dry skin, and this moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or super greasy, and this is it!</li>
            <li> After struggling with acne, sensitive skin, humid Southern summers, and moisture-sucking Northeastern winters - the full spectrum of skin nightmares - through my teenage years and early 20s, I noticed a phenomenal change in my skin when I started to use this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> After applying the moisturizer to the rest of my face, I use my moisturized hands to barely dab the nose and that seems to be the right amount).</li>
            <li> Some people need more or less than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have dry skin and prefer light fragrance, this might work well for you.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go back to the YTC facial lotion sans SPF because I had already fallen in love with the Yes</li>
            <li> Six months later it is finally getting better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many expensive department store brands and have never been fully satisfied with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> Like an older woman&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> However, I think this particular</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, which can dry out quite easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every single skin care product available, spending thousands of dollars.  </li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer as a \\&quot;first coat\\&quot; because it is not very heavy, and i need something \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; to lock in the moisture (</li>
            <li> Honestly, at first it really wasn&#x27;t strong enough &amp; I had some dry patches on my face that needed to be remoisturized halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich cream that keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day long, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any acne flare-ups.</li>
            <li> It was months of trying clinical solutions before I finally was able to calm my skin down.  </li>
            <li> it cleared up promptly, when using the &#x27;Yes Spot Stick&#x27; at bedtime (which I highly recommend, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was having to wear high neck t-shirts to hide the acne</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Been looking for a moisturizer for my very oily skin and so far this once seems to work better than any of the more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Smells great, even left my face looking better after the burning and discoloration subsided, but it was impossible to keep using.</li>
            <li> The KEY to this being so great, is that when you have sensitive and dry skin, all of the acne products you use (that include the key ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide) dry your skin even more.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has completely changed my skin!!  </li>
            <li> The only thing that helped some was &#x27;Clean &amp; Clear OIL-FREE&#x27;  moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It smells really good, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve evolved much over the years as far as moisturizers are concerned.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> have very oily skin and adult acne.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m REALLY picky about items that go near my nose.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a blessing because normally i have combination skin problems:</li>
            <li> and I use a Clarisonic a few times a week, and I think those both help exfoliate my skin and help it absorb the nutrients better.</li>
            <li> She has actually pretty much always had a constant presence of acne in those areas until now.</li>
            <li> I was unsure and the smell was a little strong but ended up using the whole package</li>
            <li> Other reviews complain of the smell, however the lotion smelled pleasant and slightly floral, nothing like a pizza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very excited because I don&#x27;t think I am going to be let down!</li>
            <li> after several months of using, particularly in the summer: this was fine for winter, but in the summer it only adds to the shine that my T-zone acquires on hot/humid days.</li>
            <li> I read the other review before purchasing and I have to disagree with some having issues with the smell being unpleasant,it smells just fine to me.</li>
            <li> I feared the Yes to Tomatoes daily moisturizer might not be quite strong enough for me, as I&#x27;m 40</li>
            <li> It is a light moisturizer targeted for those who need a little bit more moisture than your average \\&quot;acne\\&quot; type skin (as the Yes to</li>
            <li> My face has never felt tight, irritated, or oily after using it--even after exfoliation when my skin is most sensitive.</li>
            <li> Other products in the brand&#x27;s \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; line are likewise fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I live on the east coast where we deal with four season weather:</li>
            <li> I was on a mission for a new skin care regime because I noticed that my skin was changing.</li>
            <li> - I can totally live with them but for the sake of others wanted to include them)</li>
            <li> though very light small amount in AM under Primer&lt;br /&gt;Colorescience</li>
            <li> I think my skin is just sensitive to a particular ingredient in this lotion.</li>
            <li> The Yes to Daily Balancing Moisturizer is gentler on my skin which actually became almost dry after using Exposed (it was that effective on me) and hydrates</li>
            <li> my skin was unhappy until I found it on Amazon...and my skin is back to feeling happy!</li>
            <li> at first I really liked it, it smells a little vanilla/bakery to me, but after a few weeks I&#x27;d really just prefer if it were unscented.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Especially during the dry winter months it keeps my skin from drying out and becoming itchy.</li>
            <li> My go-to moisturizer changed their formula for the worse, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a new affordable moisturizer that is natural and good for sensitive and acne</li>
            <li> delivers NO moisture at all, in fact for me it did the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle and have my next on order.  </li>
            <li> I have used moisturizers in the past (even though it seems oily skin wouldn&#x27;t need moisture, most beauty sites and experts say all skin needs moisturizer) and they have been semi-successful.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been using Dove unscented, sensitive skin soap to wash my face, hydrogen peroxide to spot treat, and then this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> I first tried Daily Pore Scrub, Roller Ball and Acne Repair Lotion (can purchase in store at Target for 19.99) before purchasing this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Naturally made, my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little odd--makes me think of a cross between sandalwood and old lady face powder--but I&#x27;m getting used to it, and I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a product that&#x27;s both all natural and delivers on its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine that this would help with fine lines and wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a difference in that regard.</li>
            <li> It lightly moisturized with out clogging my pores and calmed down my acne.</li>
            <li> with just a partial pump of this stuff my skin felt like it had a lot on it, and it didn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as I like.</li>
            <li> I can only really smell it for 5 minutes or so, but it&#x27;s just not a scent I would normally want to put on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has helped to make such a positive influence on my skin.</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable change in my complexion as well; overall, the tone is more even with less redness.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream because its slightly heavier, and your skin can definitely use more moisture during the night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive than most products claiming to be this effective.</li>
            <li> To Tomatoes&#x27;  for clear skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear in seven years.</li>
            <li> It was the only one I could find that wouldn&#x27;t break me out (even though I don&#x27;t generally even have breakout prone skin - moisturizer would do it in a hot minute).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to if it has helped clear up my pimples or even out my tone because I only use it on an as-needed basis.</li>
            <li> If I use a moisturizer that&#x27;s too thick and heavy, my pores clog and I get breakouts; this moisturizer is a happy medium.</li>
            <li> Ive got combination acne prone skin, my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> the yes to tomatoes is so moisturizing but not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> A dime size amount covers my whole face and neck (including back of the neck).</li>
            <li> Yes, my skin is fairly sensitive</li>
            <li> This is going directly to the trash.</li>
            <li> and I can already see an improvement, old acne scars are getting lighter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily skin, and I&#x27;ve been battling adult acne since my son was born two years ago.</li>
            <li> Yes To Cucumbers Daily Gentle Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am 38yrs old...</li>
            <li> the winter/fall/spring: one pump is enough for the whole face.</li>
            <li> This soaks in and leaves skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t see more even skintone, I did not have any breakout yet (it either prevents breakout, or at least do not cause breakout).&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far my skin feels REALLY soft and well moisturized, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Nothing natural could smell that way.</li>
            <li> My T-zone still oily, but the rest of my face is soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It does keep the sensitive skin under my eyes soft.</li>
            <li> Finding a moisturizer that my sensitive skin approves of is always a nightmare for me.  </li>
            <li> And the way it dispenses there is no waste.</li>
            <li> To line has completely amazed me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mostly natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommend it if you have sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> and I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried almost all of their Yes</li>
            <li> weather or not its doing the job in keeping me young looking.</li>
            <li> I feel young.</li>
            <li> its not heavy, greasy or cause my face to break out or heat up</li>
            <li> At 25 years old, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every product ever.  </li>
            <li> Not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin at all, save yourself the money and the pain and steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> But as far as moisturizing goes, grade</li>
            <li> The latter better fit my budget, and wouldn&#x27;t you know, appeased my angry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with acne and oily skin since I was 10 years old, and being in my 30s hasn&#x27;t changed that.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that it has no SPF in it, but honestly I love the product so much I don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> The smell is so perfumey, like what an old lady would wear.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell natural at all.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin does not break out.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is acceptable as far as lotions go.</li>
            <li> I was using purpose for sensitive skin with spf which seemed alright in the summer</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m guessing its part of the natural ingredients in it that gives it that smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my skin so soft too.</li>
            <li> It cleared up the overall tone of my skin from bumpy and blotchy to a more even tone with just a few post acne discolorations.</li>
            <li> It will last me a long time since I don&#x27;t even need a full pump to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> After many years of suffering from embarrassing acne, I finally realized that my skin was sensitive to the SPF that is usually present in facial moisturizers and caused me to breakout constantly.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not bad, and it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Eh... doubtful, but it certainly makes my face feel gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Pricey products are not really an option right now, and I stumbled upon a combination that works for me--Purpose face wash, this moisturizer, and a dab of Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Spot Treatment.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I have combination skin (oily T-zone and dry cheeks).</li>
            <li> You know how much you need (taking in consideration the creamier than normal quality).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t broken out from this product at all, and its been good few weeks since I started using it.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals, just a clean feeling for everyday.</li>
            <li> Use a little on first use, and your face will let you know how much it needs.</li>
            <li> I would be okay with the smell if it were subtle.</li>
            <li> Instant allergic reaction the first time I used it - red, blotchy skin.</li>
            <li> days when I have worn more makeup than usual, or I&#x27;ve been exercising, or working in the garden, I will use the &#x27;Yes Deep Cleansing Pads&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> This causes more product to be used as one pump does not cover enough surface area, and I have a small face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im not typically finicky about fragrances, but this is Not at all what I&#x27;d expect from YTC.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended product for oily skin sufferers such as myself!</li>
            <li> I have a very oily T-zone, dry cheeks, enlarged pores and adult acne.</li>
            <li> requiring so many words for this review is not good idea</li>
            <li> I was wary of trying any kind of moisturizer on my oily skin, but this has completely changed my views!</li>
            <li> The challenge as an adult is to find a product that is light enough to not cause my oily skin to break out, but not drying or harsh on my now aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Now this is my new facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got this because my sister actually loves the Yes to Carrots face mask; she said her face cleared up so much after using the mask several times.</li>
            <li> This lotion is gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and definitely provides me with enough moisture.  </li>
            <li> When I heard that it&#x27;s best to use one NOW to prevent skin issues in the future, I started to search for one that would work with my annoying skin.</li>
            <li> pros are that it&#x27;s a great product WITHOUT SPF that works for my skin, the price point is much better than what I had been buying before, and since a little of this goes a long way (I seriously use less than a pea-sized amount), it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t get the big cystic pimples/ acne, but gets a lot of smaller ones (clusters) along her hair line, the sides of her face, &amp; forehead pretty regularly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price for the little pump bottle.</li>
            <li> skin is healthy (a lot less oily and less spots)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything great about it, but I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it either.</li>
            <li> To brand in general.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to help clear up my daughter&#x27;s acne on her back and chest.  </li>
            <li> the YTT Clear Skin Deep Pore Scrub &amp; Clear Skin Deep Pore Scrub.</li>
            <li> I can barely use this moisturizer in the summer if I apply sparingly and sit in front of the fan.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t finish the bottle, and went back to my old stuff.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to be careful not to use too much; I did a time or two</li>
            <li> Recently I was mistaken for being in my early twenties (which I am not)--</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY moisturizer I can and will (so far) use on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At one point, I used generic Vitamin E \\&quot;pastes\\&quot; that only broke out my normally acne-free face.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use a moisturizer with out it irritating and rash-ing up my skin.</li>
            <li> I used to have to duck into the restroom around lunch to blot my entire face, but this stuff makes my skin look more matte (without being dull and flat) throughout the day and into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> burned slightly the first i used it but hasn&#x27;t since.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, do NOT make the same mistake I made and continue using this product if you notice a problem after the first few days.</li>
            <li> I have oily combination and acne prone skin and live in a dry northern state.</li>
            <li> I have wasted so much money on moisturizers for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find natural products that actually work for me, and I finally have!</li>
            <li> dry, somewhat lathery,  and VERY sensitive to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say, the scent is a little displeasing, I can&#x27;t really describe it, but you can tell they don&#x27;t add any perfumes!</li>
            <li> It also was not hydrating enough for my normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> This you will probably figure out from one use, but I hope this saves you that messy first experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick but absorbs pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Gently press down so that the flow is well controlled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will still try other products from this brand because of the high quality.</li>
            <li> I often wonder how much my skin was previously reacting to chemicals that it just couldn&#x27;t tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I often wonder how much my skin was previously reacting to chemicals that it just couldn&#x27;t tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out but leaves it feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have quite dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency and a mild perfume smell</li>
            <li> The other thing I&#x27;ll say is that it leaves my skin feeling a tiny bit tight, which at first made me feel that it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough, but now I realize that it is very moisturizing, and the tightness is just a minor annoyance that I&#x27;ve gotten used to.</li>
            <li> Although I have been very upset to revisit the past through acne, I was surprised to read, recently, that 40% of women who have never had acne are now experiencing it at mid-life and beyond --- well into their sixties.</li>
            <li> I do have the now rare, occasional deep pimple, but nothing in comparison to the past--</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has fixed my dry skin around my nose and brow area.</li>
            <li> Some background on my skin type: I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have not had problems with acne during my lifetime, but my skin is sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li> After this, I immediately stopped using Yes to Carrots and went back to my old moisturizer, which doesn&#x27;t leave me pimple free, but at least they are fewer and less</li>
            <li> pump bottle dispenses a little too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale, but this moisturizer has brightened my skin and actually seems to improve circulation, so my skin is a little bit more pink than before.</li>
            <li> I was worried this would be too thick and/or greasy, but it absorbs fast, doesn&#x27;t leave a sheen, and makes my skin look and feel soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, a half pump is plenty - using a full pump did leave a slightly heavy, greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> so i used it; neutrogena natural--too heavy, and clogged my pores; clean &amp; clear--dried and irritated my skin; ambi--not heavy enough).</li>
            <li> No acne, it had a slight tingling sensation, but that is normal with an acne product.  </li>
            <li> have really sensitive skin, so this made my cheeks break out and my forehead and chin look extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m particularly sensitive when it comes to products (you can see my other reviews</li>
            <li> only negative for me was the smell which is a little strong.  </li>
            <li> only negative for me was the smell which is a little strong.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I thought this product would be fragrence free, or at least have a slight tomato-like scent.</li>
            <li> Somehow it makes my skin look dry but feel gross and greasy at the same time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend if you would like an inexpensive, basic moisturizer just for hydration and keep minor acne problems in check (AND</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> For me, it seems to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Yes To Tomatoes is thick and ultra moisturizing, just DO NOT apply too much or your skin will feel greasy!</li>
            <li> I buy a new bottle every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The acne and previous acne scars are almost completely gone</li>
            <li> I have recently had an issue with my skin being extremely dry around my nose mouth</li>
            <li> At 39 my skin is starting to dry out a bit</li>
            <li> With this product, I actually use it after one of the Yes to Tomatoes cleansers every other night, opposite the repair lotion.</li>
            <li> I was just hoping for an improvement from my last one, but this is above and beyond what I expected!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it has helped in conjunction with the Yes to Tomatoes line to clear my acne and get it under control.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this lotion it felt a little heavy to me, but that is because I was switching from a gel (Garnier Moisture Rescue) that practically felt like water.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d either sufficiently moisturize, but inflame my adult acne, or leave my skin feeling tight and dry, but not inflame my acne.</li>
            <li> It took me a little time to adjust to it, but it does dissipate quickly and I hardly notice it now.lean &amp; Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It took me a little time to adjust to it, but it does dissipate quickly and I hardly notice it now.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll use this for as long as it works.</li>
            <li> Did not clear nor minimize my acne</li>
            <li> Only been using a week but definitely calms my skin down.</li>
            <li> I only use a very tiny amount (less than a quarter of a pump) and spread it evenly on my face with water.</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way with this lotion, and it last incredibly long.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way (a quarter of a pump is enough to moisturize my entire face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then out of nowhere, when I leapt to the other side of mid-life, I started having occasional bumps again.  </li>
            <li> Its costlier compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li> Tomatoes Mask - As needed (only on my nose to reduce blackheads, too drying on other areas)</li>
            <li> I have used TONS of other products but this along with the repair serum is the only things that worked!</li>
            <li> I actually can&#x27;t wait to try the other products fro this line.</li>
            <li> This product is creamier than Olay, so if you have slightly oily to combination skin, you might want to be careful how much you apply, especially on your oily areas, as you MIGHT get millia or small pimples from the heaviness.&lt;br /&gt;-Has</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other facial moisturizers and it always seemed like 10 minutes after I applied them, my face would be dry again.</li>
            <li> My skin would be terribly dry when ever I got out of the shower and</li>
            <li> I use acne medication which tends to dry my skin out</li>
            <li> I have combo skin with dry cheeks in the winter.</li>
            <li> humidity, dry air, snow, rain and blazing sun.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is not for people with dry skin--definitely for oily skin.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look as dull--dang dry skin).</li>
            <li> someone with extremely dry skin, this would probably work well.</li>
            <li> My skin can be oily some days and dry on others.</li>
            <li> the are dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> It hydrates without it being too greasy but doesn&#x27;t leave it too dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter here, and my skin has been getting painfully dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I just use it on really dry parts of my face.</li>
            <li> If I use a toner or moisturizer that leaves my face matte and dry, that&#x27;s an automatic trigger for oil making a gradual appearance.</li>
            <li> But you only smell it for a few seconds and its not that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no new pimples</li>
            <li> and there however I feel this moisturizer helps keep them limited and controlled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so many kinds of skincare products, with unpleasant and unsatisfying results-- even smearing olive oil on my face in an attempt to moisturise it when it was dry (it worked, but felt yucky).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an unusual, powdery-like scent and slightly thicker consistency than usual moisturizers.</li>
            <li> but my face begin to have a dark red</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press it down all the way, or you&#x27;ll definitely need a tissue for the excess on your hand.</li>
            <li> After about 7-10 days, my skin somehow adjusted and doesn&#x27;t get dry anymore!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s winter which makes the indoor air very dry.</li>
            <li> Never before has my skin looked and felt so consistently balanced and clear; skin tone has improved, skin brilliance and moisture have increased,  and my acne has decreased by at least 80%.  </li>
            <li> NEVER had a single acne breakout with this lotion!</li>
            <li> For the last few years I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of an expensive moisturizer by BareMinerals.</li>
            <li> One of my chief concerns is using as little chemicals as possible in my beauty and food products, so I experimented with Weleda, Dr. Hauschka, and Yes To.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;t didn&#x27;t dry my skin like other acne treatments.  </li>
            <li> Mission not accomplished.  </li>
            <li> The smell was minimal though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> Be careful if you decide to use this.</li>
            <li> Only been using for a few weeks, seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I use it with Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Serum, and there has been no issues related to skin dryness, redness, or breakouts.</li>
            <li> Last week I bought the same Cucumber moisturizer from Target and dislike it (as you can also see my review on amazon) because of the thick viscosity that does not absorb or spread when applying.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but it ended up giving me a horrible rash.</li>
            <li> For the past 8 yrs I have used cliniques dramatically different moisturizer for very dry to dry combo skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because a product is natural, doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t hurt your skin or have long-term consequences.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with tomatoes, right?  </li>
            <li> you guys, definitely not a strong enough reason not to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> but it definitely isn&#x27;t tight and dry -</li>
            <li> I thought I had extreme sunburn</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m allergic to something in it, but it tends to make my face very red.  </li>
            <li> I usually have my breakouts on my chin, the big cyst type zits that hurt and</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of other notes:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily or greasy like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> other Yes</li>
            <li> Its a little oily, only use a little.</li>
            <li> I used a small amount - just enough to cover my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She still uses MOM sometimes, but not the every other night like she used to.</li>
            <li> I prefer it over a lot of other lotions and creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s it (no change in my skin other than it becomes softer after I use it)</li>
            <li> I would definately recommended this, and will be trying other products in the range.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion along with all the other Tomato products and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few selected products my wife uses for her facial skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion is a little watery, but as I said a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I hate layering more products than I have to,</li>
            <li> If they could just tone down the scent a bit, that&#x27;d be dandy.</li>
            <li> Keeps the redness tone down and zits at bay.  </li>
            <li> At the same time, I didn&#x27;t want anything that didn&#x27;t breathe enough, because at 40 I still have regular breakouts - life is unfair sometimes!  </li>
            <li> Added bonus, at the end of the day my skin isn&#x27;t as oily as it was with other brands!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a little bit of a perfumey smell, which I normally hate, but I actually love how it smells.</li>
            <li> I typically dont buy cheaper moisturizer</li>
            <li> but I bought this a week and a half ago after seeing the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for less than a week</li>
            <li> My skin has been less oily and</li>
            <li> and I break out a lot less, but I still fight blackheads in my T zone as well as some</li>
            <li> This is supposedly 90%+ natural, so I&#x27;m a little bit confused where this heavy scent comes from.</li>
            <li> I end up using a little less than a half squirt.</li>
            <li> This makes me breakout like crazy, which is funny since it&#x27;s touted as something for acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I put off buying yet another product line because I felt it was just false hope for her &amp; wouldn&#x27;t be any better than the YTCucumbers cleanser &amp; milk of magnesia, but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> It did feel a little tight afterwards, though.  </li>
            <li> I usually use philosophy&#x27;s hope moisturizer which I love, but hate what it does to my wallet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a single skin complaint to speak of because of this</li>
            <li> Even though I went through the accutane treatment I still get little breakouts here</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell and works with using just a little bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Takes a little while to absorb.</li>
            <li> At times it is a desert, at times it erupts little volcanoes.</li>
            <li> It feels a little bit filmy for a bit, but doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I have an oily T-zone, but I get dry eczema patches on my cheeks, so it is difficult to find a moisturizer that keeps my cheeks hydrated without making my forehead and nose extra oily and breakout prone.</li>
            <li> I still have some small outbreaks when I am highly stressed and it is getting close to my period, but these are not the deep, painful cysts I used to get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always steered clear of fragrance in products but Haven&#x27;t broken out at all from this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the red pepper ingredient, but this stuff is not good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never to heavy on my skin</li>
            <li> no make up on) after few hours that cream was still on my face</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, but it has a few downfalls.</li>
            <li> My skin feels moisturized, but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll buy it online to save a few bucks compared to the $15 retail price in the stores.</li>
            <li> a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that heavy.</li>
            <li> Cream\\&quot; are just too heavy for my skin</li>
            <li> I have been having acne problems for a few years now.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer leaves my face feeling hydrated without being too heavy or greasy, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with acne in response to it.</li>
            <li> so its hard to find a lotion that moisturizes the dry spots and doesn&#x27;t make my face look like an oil slick on the oily spots.</li>
            <li> So I started looking for a moisturizer without SPF, which is no easy feat.  </li>
            <li> as in 3 weeks I&#x27;ve hardly used any, but I imagine down the road it will bug me.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I think the only reason it wasn&#x27;t even worse is because every time I have applied it, I almost immediately went outside to extreme cold and wind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went through about three moisturizers that always had something wrong with them (neutrogena--not heavy enough, but had spf</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;Tomato\\&quot; line for the last few years, and I&#x27;m wary to try anything else.</li>
            <li> It might be a little pricy but from what I&#x27;ve heard this stuff lasts a while!</li>
            <li> and I often break out with large, painful pimples when I&#x27;m feeling stressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, awful skin every winter that demands to be moisturized, but everything else leaves me feeling and looking super greasy.</li>
            <li> Not terribly impressed, I used this for a month and it left my skin greasy and did nothing to help my acne.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s heavy and thick, somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li> I wish that it would have worked better, but my face broke out terribly, unlike anything I have ever seen while using the carrots products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lots of pain and redness in the small area I tested.  </li>
            <li> when i do get a breakout, i immediately apply a small amount and the area clears up.</li>
            <li> No more cysts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wasted so much money on moisturizers, because my skin just breaks out badly with basically everything!</li>
            <li> I had really bad adult acne</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive, but I have not had any breakouts or bad reactions.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve honestly never had this type of reaction to a moisturizer before.  </li>
            <li> This happened in late August and nothing helped me.</li>
            <li> I do try to put it on at least 10 minutes before putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and moisturizes well (too well for me).</li>
            <li> They are slowly going away after using it for four days</li>
            <li> The consistency is also really thick.</li>
            <li> I hate tomatoes as a food and never would have thought that they smelled like much of anything</li>
            <li> I usually get blackheads too but not with this lotion!</li>
            <li> and I ended up doing that thing where the lotion sort of balled up and rolled off my face, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle.</li>
            <li> serious.  </li>
            <li> I have incredibly pale, translucent skin, which means i perpetually have dark circles under my eyes, so whenever I have even the slightest of blemishes my skin looks horrible.</li>
            <li> bottle is convenient, but dumb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that bad</li>
            <li> I was hoping the lotion would even out my skin, however my combination skin looks worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I think something in here might be irritating to me</li>
            <li> This moisturizer made my hormonal acne even worse.</li>
            <li> but it was getting worse.</li>
            <li> but my skin was getting worse with prolonged use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews where people have broken out because it&#x27;s too heavy/greasy - again</li>
            <li> was using the cucumbers but it made me break out even worse.</li>
            <li> I still have some problems from it, but it has decreased gradually over the 1+ year since I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to try this, and im sad to say I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> fragrance is not for the faint hearted, Ive never been one to be bothered by a smell</li>
            <li> I also do get pimples here and there, but nothing real serious.</li>
            <li> I have tried the expensive Clinque and Estee Lauder and the cheaper drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> I am skeptical that the product had any hand in reducing my acne, but</li>
            <li> Started to get terrible acne on my cheeks and they have always been very red</li>
            <li> Stress sure does make your face break out in awful, horrible ways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, like everyone keeps saying, it has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of the smell it could have with the tomato</li>
            <li> Her hormones went crazy...</li>
            <li> but I used cold water to wash my face instead.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said I was afraid to look in the mirror after putting on my makeup</li>
            <li> I will be retuning this product unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> my acne was also particularly bad at the time.</li>
            <li> it looked so bad.</li>
            <li> It even felt painful like a sunburn.</li>
            <li> Then it got painful.  </li>
            <li> well, now it&#x27;s going to the trash &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still annoying</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well this works!  </li>
            <li> Worst of all, it broke me out.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 4th month of a horrible breakout that baffled me.  </li>

            <li> Didnt work for me..Made me break out..</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great and leaves you skin soft and moist. No greasy feeling. I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I typically dont buy cheaper moisturizer but I bought this a week and a half ago after seeing the reviews. Ive got combination acne prone skin, my skin is sensitive but Ive never used a moisturizer that has done THIS to me.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not for the faint hearted, Ive never been one to be bothered by a smell but it LITERATELY smells like one of those cheap Wal-mart perfumes broke and poured all over you.&lt;br /&gt;I delivers NO moisture at all, in fact for me it did the exact opposite. My skin was flaking off, it was firetruck red from irritation. I thought I had extreme sunburn but I had not been out in the sun for more than enough time to get out of my car and walk in and out of places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plus side to this stuff is the texture, its pretty fluffy and the ease of application is pretty nice, but that is IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, do NOT make the same mistake I made and continue using this product if you notice a problem after the first few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using simple brand replenishing moisturizer and that was working fine for me but I wanted something with a little more oomph!! This is definitely it! I have oily combination and acne prone skin and live in a dry northern state. the yes to tomatoes is so moisturizing but not heavy at all. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and glowy! I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews knocking the scent but honestly you barely notice it&#x27;s there. And that&#x27;s another thing, bc I&#x27;m acne prone I&#x27;ve always steered clear of fragrance in products but Haven&#x27;t broken out at all from this moisturizer! It&#x27;s working great for me and I&#x27;m happy I tried it.</li>
            <li> Instant allergic reaction the first time I used it - red, blotchy skin. Stay away!</li>
            <li> I love Yes To products and this one met my fussy standards for organic skin care.  I am 32 and still break out, this has helped control my breakouts and evened out my skin tone.  I am so happy and will keep buying this for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Finally found a natural-brand moisturizer that I can wear, without it costing an arm and a leg. This has a great light texture, but I still avoid putting it on my nose which tends to be oily (After applying the moisturizer to the rest of my face, I use my moisturized hands to barely dab the nose and that seems to be the right amount). I really like the light scent, personally. If they had an even lighter version, it would be ideal for summer. You only need to use a little, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> I bought this last winter and I wish I had bought it sooner. My skin would be terribly dry when ever I got out of the shower and my acne was also particularly bad at the time. I bought this and it solved both problems. It lightly moisturized with out clogging my pores and calmed down my acne. I also feel good about putting such a natural product on my sensitive face. I&#x27;m switching all of my skin care products over to yes to!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before in my life. This product caused my face to turn bright red and burning hot. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wish I could hear from the manufacturers about the diverging responses to their products. But I have been using this moisturizer for the last four years and nothing else and I simply love it. I just tried the Yes to Cucumbers and find that its equally wonderful. Found the Yes to Carrots too oily for a day moisturizer but all in all I get value for money. I&#x27;d wanna say go for it but it seems like a hit and miss depending on your skin type or body chemistry. And frankly no matter how good it is for some it should NEVER do what it seems to do to others. Explanation needed.</li>
            <li> This has something in it that doesn&#x27;t work for me. And it is not oil free. My face seems to react to even &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; fruit and vegetable oils. I didn&#x27;t have an acne breakout after using this. My face just looked red and kind of stung. I think my skin is just sensitive to a particular ingredient in this lotion. I was bummed because it promised so much. Hope it works for others.</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or super greasy, and this is it! I love this stuff. A little goes a long way, and it has helped in conjunction with the Yes to Tomatoes line to clear my acne and get it under control. I will definitely buy this product again. The lotion is a little watery, but as I said a little goes a long way. A dime size amount covers my whole face and neck (including back of the neck). It smells spicy but I enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is sometimes prone to breakout.  I wanted something that would keep my face moisturized but would not make it feel greasy.  Mission not accomplished.  Not sure if I&#x27;m allergic to something in it, but it tends to make my face very red.  Yes, my skin is fairly sensitive but I&#x27;ve honestly never had this type of reaction to a moisturizer before.  Somehow it makes my skin look dry but feel gross and greasy at the same time.  This makes me breakout like crazy, which is funny since it&#x27;s touted as something for acne prone skin.  This is going directly to the trash.</li>
            <li> I took antibiotics for approximately fifteen years, underwent chemical peels, light therapy, hormonal therapies, dermabrasion, and finally it was Accutane that cleared my skin for many years.  I was in heaven.  Then out of nowhere, when I leapt to the other side of mid-life, I started having occasional bumps again.  Anything would cause a flare-up, even applying sunscreen was sure to clog pores causing a Godzilla eruption.  Although I have been very upset to revisit the past through acne, I was surprised to read, recently, that 40% of women who have never had acne are now experiencing it at mid-life and beyond --- well into their sixties. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with that, but I feel for all my sister friends who are in the same boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every single skin care product available, spending thousands of dollars.  The only thing that helped some was &#x27;Clean &amp; Clear OIL-FREE&#x27;  moisturizer.  But this contains Salicylic Acid and repeated use was making my aging skin look dry, somewhat lathery,  and VERY sensitive to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a lark, I decided to order &#x27;Yes To Tomatoes&#x27;  for clear skin.  I have given it a good therapeutic trial before offering an endorsement.  I have just finished my first bottle and have my next on order.  I&#x27;m amazed that this moderately priced product has performed so well.  My skin is dewey, the fine lines are diminishing, and even the deeper ones are showing improvement. I&#x27;ve even been getting some complements on my complexion --- for the first time, ever.  But, the most important factor is:  I have only had one bump, early in the trial;  it cleared up promptly, when using the &#x27;Yes Spot Stick&#x27; at bedtime (which I highly recommend, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On days when I have worn more makeup than usual, or I&#x27;ve been exercising, or working in the garden, I will use the &#x27;Yes Deep Cleansing Pads&#x27;.  Love them!  They are salicylic acid pads, but for some reason when I use this product, it makes my face feel soft and clean, unlike the Clean &amp; Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that these products are Paraben-free and 98% natural.  I often wonder how much my skin was previously reacting to chemicals that it just couldn&#x27;t tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative for me was the smell which is a little strong.  It took me a little time to adjust to it, but it does dissipate quickly and I hardly notice it now.lean &amp; Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that these products are Paraben-free and 98% natural.

            <li> I have incredibly pale, translucent skin, which means i perpetually have dark circles under my eyes, so whenever I have even the slightest of blemishes my skin looks horrible. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for less than a week and I can already see an improvement, old acne scars are getting lighter, current blemishes are fading.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Completely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not terribly impressed, I used this for a month and it left my skin greasy and did nothing to help my acne. The smell was minimal though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days but I really like it. I use acne medication which tends to dry my skin out and when I apply this moisturizer.. my face instantly looks better!</li>
            <li> After struggling with acne, sensitive skin, humid Southern summers, and moisture-sucking Northeastern winters - the full spectrum of skin nightmares - through my teenage years and early 20s, I noticed a phenomenal change in my skin when I started to use this moisturizer.  Never before has my skin looked and felt so consistently balanced and clear; skin tone has improved, skin brilliance and moisture have increased,  and my acne has decreased by at least 80%.  Other products in the brand&#x27;s \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; line are likewise fantastic.  After years trying prescription acne medications and alternately super-organic and high-end brands of cleaners, moisturizers, and toners, this has been the jackpot.</li>
            <li> I love moisturizing and know that is really important, especially during these winter months, but some moisturizers leave me feeling a little greasy. Not the case with this moisturizer, plus it comes at a great price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the Yes To products smell amazing and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Glides on my skin without being greasy or pasty or over moisturizing it making it too oily  it really is the best daily moisturizer to balance out ur skins own oil love this!!</li>
            <li> I switched to this from a gel moisturizer because I wanted something more natural, and even though the gel was working alright with my combination skin I felt like I needed something more moisturizing. I was worried this would be too thick and/or greasy, but it absorbs fast, doesn&#x27;t leave a sheen, and makes my skin look and feel soft and dewy. After about a week of use my skin is clearer and more even. The smell is a little odd--makes me think of a cross between sandalwood and old lady face powder--but I&#x27;m getting used to it, and I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a product that&#x27;s both all natural and delivers on its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit after several months of using, particularly in the summer: this was fine for winter, but in the summer it only adds to the shine that my T-zone acquires on hot/humid days. Reduced my review to 4 stars from 5--I did like this, but it&#x27;s really too heavy for year-round use.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! I had really bad adult acne and I use this before i got to bed and my skin has never looked healthier! The acne and previous acne scars are almost completely gone and I have only been using it for about 3 weeks! It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin! So say yes to tomatoes today!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily skin, and I&#x27;ve been battling adult acne since my son was born two years ago. I was wary of trying any kind of moisturizer on my oily skin, but this has completely changed my views! My skin is softer, my makeup goes on more easily, and yes, it is helping to clear up my breakouts! As another reviewer said, a half pump is plenty - using a full pump did leave a slightly heavy, greasy feeling. Cutting the amount in half is perfect - my skin feels nice and smooth without feeling oily. There is a noticeable change in my complexion as well; overall, the tone is more even with less redness. I use this in conjunction with the Yes To Tomatoes Clearing Facial Mask and Yes To Cucumbers Daily Gentle Cleanser. My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this so much, because I usually only use natural or organic products. I have an uneven skin tone, &amp; red splotchiness, so I was really exited to use this. I used it before I went to bed &amp; again in the morning the next day. By the end of the day I had tons of pimples!!! Now, I have super clear skin &amp; I only break out with like 3 pimples right before my period on my forehead or right around my chin. After using this moisturizer for only one day, I had deep pimples on my cheeks, chin, &amp; the spot in-between my eyebrows! Places I never break out. I read the ingredients after &amp; this product contains a lot of oils... So that may be the reason why. If your skin doesn&#x27;t react well to oil based products, I recommend finding something else! I will be retuning this product unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and I use the same cleanser that works wonders.  This lotion has completely changed my skin!!  I have never been happier about a lotion!  I can use it everyday and have not broken out from it at all and my skin is so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wasted so much money on moisturizers, because my skin just breaks out badly with basically everything! THANK YOU TO SAY YES TO Tomatoes for making an AWESOME product.  I usually have my breakouts on my chin, the big cyst type zits that hurt and I am 38yrs old... Dang I thought acne would go away when I turned 20 or 30... ;) NOT. I would give this product 1000 stars if I could, plus it is fairly priced. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used burts bees, proactive, Lush, Dermalogica, Murad and many others from when I have received facials.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin with dry cheeks in the winter. I can barely use this moisturizer in the summer if I apply sparingly and sit in front of the fan. However, the too-much moisture become great in the winter in New England weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the winter/fall/spring: one pump is enough for the whole face. I&#x27;m at the point where drugstore moisturizers either make me breakout or feels too dry/greasy on the skin. This soaks in and leaves skin soft but not greasy. While I didn&#x27;t see more even skintone, I did not have any breakout yet (it either prevents breakout, or at least do not cause breakout).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not smell like tomato. It&#x27;s just...a moisturizer smell. meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend if you would like an inexpensive, basic moisturizer just for hydration and keep minor acne problems in check (AND a plus is it&#x27;s organic). The best drugstore moisturizer, an upgrade from this would be department store ones (more expensive alternatives: I&#x27;m also using pure Argan Oil or L&#x27;occitane first-sign-of-aging moisturizer in the winter).</li>
            <li> I love a lot of the \\&quot;Yes to (produce)\\&quot; line; I&#x27;d already been using the Yes to Blueberries night cream when my St. Ives day cream made me start breaking out. I feared the Yes to Tomatoes daily moisturizer might not be quite strong enough for me, as I&#x27;m 40 and it&#x27;s winter which makes the indoor air very dry. At the same time, I didn&#x27;t want anything that didn&#x27;t breathe enough, because at 40 I still have regular breakouts - life is unfair sometimes!  Honestly, at first it really wasn&#x27;t strong enough &amp; I had some dry patches on my face that needed to be remoisturized halfway through the day. BUT! After about 7-10 days, my skin somehow adjusted and doesn&#x27;t get dry anymore! It feels very light going on and absorbs easily. I think it&#x27;ll be great in summertime too because it&#x27;s so light, and I&#x27;m pretty impressed that it works this well in winter. I still use the Yes to Blueberries night cream to help keep the wrinkles away, and they work marvelously together!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the Yes to tomatoes facial starter kit that included the face wash, lotion and face mask.  I just received it in the mail and had to try it out right away.  The face wash did its job, my skin was clean.  It did feel a little tight afterwards, though.  Then I used the mask.  It smells really good, and a little bit goes a long way. On to the lotion.  I have oily/combo skin so its hard to find a lotion that moisturizes the dry spots and doesn&#x27;t make my face look like an oil slick on the oily spots. So far my skin feels REALLY soft and well moisturized, but not greasy. And it&#x27;s supposed to help absorb oil, so we&#x27;ll see how long the shinies stay away, so far so good.  I will update my review after I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a day! :)  But so far, so good!</li>
            <li> My go-to moisturizer changed their formula for the worse, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a new affordable moisturizer that is natural and good for sensitive and acne prone skin- This is NOT it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I doubt the claims of being natural because as soon as you put it on it has a very UNNATURAL, strong scent- like another reviewer said- cheap perfume would be a good way to describe it. Nothing natural could smell that way. Also, it&#x27;s heavy and thick, somewhat greasy. Worst of all, it broke me out. And my skin felt irritated, almost like a mild sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised at so many good reviews because I cannot find anything good about this product.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily T-zone, dry cheeks, enlarged pores and adult acne. This moisturizer is great. My T-zone still oily, but the rest of my face is soft and moisturized. My pores appear smaller and I can use it twice a day without breaking out. Love this stuff and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I had been using Alba Botanical Coconut Milk Face Wash, and while it smelled nice, I started breaking out massively after 3-4 weeks of use.  Trying to keep the ingredients more natural, I tried the Yes To Tomatoes clarifying Face Wash and the matching moisturizer.  After only 1 use, the bright red of my breakout spots were no longer bright red!  This stuff is amazing!!!  It smells pleasant and leaves my skin looking and feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> My staple not heavy not too light just perfect!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, it applies nice, and it feels nice to know you&#x27;re using something at least somewhat natural...Otherwise, I dont find it to be some miracle-healing moisturizer. Will not order again, but only because I know natural oils are still cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li> NEVER had a single acne breakout with this lotion! I usually get blackheads too but not with this lotion! It has a thick consistency and a mild perfume smell but I don&#x27;t mind it at all and most importantly neither does my skin! I live on the east coast where we deal with four season weather: humidity, dry air, snow, rain and blazing sun. It&#x27;s never to heavy on my skin and that&#x27;s a blessing because normally i have combination skin problems: oily t-zone, dry/tight skin on my cheeks, blackheads on my nose and acne on my chin and forehead. But that&#x27;s all gone now!! I don&#x27;t have a single skin complaint to speak of because of this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had a formula with SPF in it but I can&#x27;t stand zinc oxide! I used to use the YTC facial lotion but then they put SPF zinc oxide in it and it left white streaks everywhere. I didn&#x27;t go back to the YTC facial lotion sans SPF because I had already fallen in love with the Yes To Tomatoes moisturizer by then. I move on quickly lol :)</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and have been struggling to find the right balance of products.  Pricey products are not really an option right now, and I stumbled upon a combination that works for me--Purpose face wash, this moisturizer, and a dab of Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Spot Treatment.  This moisturizer is not for people with dry skin--definitely for oily skin.  It will help keep your skin matte.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of the smell it could have with the tomato but I really like the smell it has (doesn&#x27;t smell tomato AT ALL)&lt;br /&gt;My skin is healthy (a lot less oily and less spots)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion about a 8 months ago (in conjunction with Yes to Tomatoes Daily Clarifying and Acne Control Gel cleansers) to help with the acne I couldn&#x27;t seem to beat. The change was not immediate, but my acne seems to have mostly gone away and the acne scars are beginning to recede as well. I still have some small outbreaks when I am highly stressed and it is getting close to my period, but these are not the deep, painful cysts I used to get. About 4 months ago, when I really started noticing that my acne had receded, I also started using the Yes to Grapefruit CC Cream - Light (with SPF 18) as a daily face sunblock/moisturizer which is very lightly tinted. Because my skin was clearing up, I didn&#x27;t need to use any heavier make up (which I like), but I think stopping using some of the heavier makeup has also helped keep my skin clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of other notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. I use this lotion each morning (right after I get out of the shower), and in the evening after wiping my face with a hot washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;2. When I first started using this lotion it felt a little heavy to me, but that is because I was switching from a gel (Garnier Moisture Rescue) that practically felt like water. After a month or so, I got used to the thicker texture, and feel like this does a better job keeping my skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;3. I am in my mid-30s with combination type, fair skin.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have combination skin (oily T-zone and dry cheeks). I use this after I wash my face in the morning and night and it keeps my skin nice and balanced all day. My skin is not oily or dry at the end of the day :). It might be a little pricy but from what I&#x27;ve heard this stuff lasts a while!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy and has a pleasant scent. I have dry skin so the oiliness balances it out (it gives my face a nice glow and it doesn&#x27;t look as dull--dang dry skin). As of right now, I will repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. This, along with Giovanni Step 3 moisturizer are the only two products that get the job done. Yes To Tomatoes is thick and ultra moisturizing, just DO NOT apply too much or your skin will feel greasy! Use this sparingly and your skin will thank you. This is the only product that has fixed my dry skin around my nose and brow area. I use this to moisturize, and Cetaphil Gentle Skin cleanser to cleanse. Great combination for sensitive skin. 5/5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the product a good 6 months and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m impressed. Other reviews complain of the smell, however the lotion smelled pleasant and slightly floral, nothing like a pizza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive skin, so this made my cheeks break out and my forehead and chin look extremely greasy. The only thing I can use this for is under my eyes. It does keep the sensitive skin under my eyes soft. I was hoping the lotion would even out my skin, however my combination skin looks worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone with extremely dry skin, this would probably work well. It&#x27;s thick and moisturizes well (too well for me).</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great. It makes my skin baby soft and still clean feeling. Doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily or greasy like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to help clear up my daughter&#x27;s acne on her back and chest.  She went off of estrogen after being on it for 8 years and then got the Mirena IUD.  Her hormones went crazy...hair started falling out, acne, depression.  Six months later it is finally getting better.  I tried several products to try to get rid of the acne.  This lotion calms and moisturizes her skin and it keeps it from breaking out.  They are slowly going away after using it for four days and it&#x27;s not even noticeable.  She was having to wear high neck t-shirts to hide the acne and she was finally able to wear a tank top without being embarrassed.  I plan to get the spot healing roller ball for her to try for her occasional breakouts on her face.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy.  Perfect bedtime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! My skin can be oily some days and dry on others. This is my must have moisturizer for keeping my combination skin looking great!</li>
            <li> I guess balancing cream for oily/combination skin should be light and absorb quickly. First i use in the morning(with no make up on) after few hours that cream was still on my face.. So i decided to use it only before i go to bed - but in the morning my face still felt so sticky, that cream don&#x27;t absorb at all. And the smells is bad.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 2 stars because delivery was fast. But for the product only 1 star.</li>
            <li> I love this company and all of their products. I like this lotion, but it has a few downfalls. It dries VERY quickly and really seems to soak in, but it gets very greasy overnight. I can only use it overnight for this reason. The smell is not terrible like other people have mentioned. A little definitely goes a long way with this lotion, and it last incredibly long. I will continue to use this product because it moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, but it can be pretty greasy.</li>
            <li> Finding a moisturizer that my sensitive skin approves of is always a nightmare for me.  This product is great.  My skin feels moisturized, but not too heavy.  I will definitely be using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer, the smell was not bad and it is my go to moisturizer on most days.  I also like the packaging, it makes it easy to get just what you need out.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I have dry skin on my cheeks and a little oily in the t-zone sometimes, and this is the perfect weight for me to use as a daytime moisturizer.  The scent is nice - very light.</li>
            <li> moisturized without being greasy. Can&#x27;t find anything else that works so good.</li>
            <li> Did not clear nor minimize my acne instead I had more breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;However, I like that it has been tested &amp;#34;cruelty-free&amp;#34; and is paraben-free.&lt;br /&gt;It maybe a nice moistorizer for someone elses skin but not for mine.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer instead of the one that came with the Exposed skin care set, which has proven to also be very effective on my oily and&lt;br /&gt;acne prone skin. The Yes to Daily Balancing Moisturizer is gentler on my skin which actually became almost dry after using Exposed (it was that effective on me) and hydrates very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YtD is mostly (98% as written on the can) made of natural ingredients and I love how Yes to is upfront about what they put in their products.&lt;br /&gt;It has an unusual, powdery-like scent and slightly thicker consistency than usual moisturizers. Once applied though, you barely notice it and it very light. Highly recommended product for oily skin sufferers such as myself!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, which is mostly oily. I also do get pimples here and there, but nothing real serious. As a whole, I like this product line. With this product, I actually use it after one of the Yes to Tomatoes cleansers every other night, opposite the repair lotion. I find that with my oily skin, more than once a day would be too much moisture. I use it sparingly when I do, since too much, especially on the forehead, makes it feel oily. My face seems to like the product used sparingly, I still do get the occasional pimple, but it goes away very quick. I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all-I actually find it pleasant. As of today, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Keeps my face hydrated and clear.not greasy. Fast absorbed. And the way it dispenses there is no waste. Zero left in the bottle!</li>
            <li> OBSESSED!!!! Everything about the Yes To line has completely amazed me. I have recently had an issue with my skin being extremely dry around my nose mouth chin eyes etc. This happened in late August and nothing helped me. I used this product THREE times and my skin has cleared up!!! I&#x27;m not even joking its nourished, hydrated, and smooth. Within three applications this product was more effective than months of others. Please do yourself a favor and join the YES TO movement!</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST moisturizer and Amazon had a $5 off coupon. Even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes for all Yes to.. moisturizers - they smell good, go on smooth, and leave my face moisturized during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Great for combination skin! Smells awesome and was delivered in a timely fashion&lt;br /&gt;I believe this brand will explode soon they have a great line of products</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores  or feel greasy while it&#x27;s on. I like that it&#x27;s mostly natural. Yes to whatever makes some great products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with other Yes To products, especially their cucumber eye gel, so I expected good things from their tomato face lotion. Can&#x27;t go wrong with tomatoes, right?  In fact, this product smells nothing like tomatoes....it&#x27;s a sweet floral scent which I found to be too much. I didn&#x27;t finish the bottle, and went back to my old stuff. The lotion itself was fine; I have problem dry skin, and this moisturized without feeling greasy. If they could just tone down the scent a bit, that&#x27;d be dandy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin ( post accutane) and this stuff is great. Even though I went through the accutane treatment I still get little breakouts here and there however I feel this moisturizer helps keep them limited and controlled.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it if you have sensitive and acne prone skin. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Love this Moisturizer! It is part of my Yes to Tomatoes daily skincare regime. I read the other review before purchasing and I have to disagree with some having issues with the smell being unpleasant,it smells just fine to me.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  No harsh chemicals, just a clean feeling for everyday.</li>
            <li> Love love love this moisturizer, A little pricey so I&#x27;ll buy it online to save a few bucks compared to the $15 retail price in the stores. My skin feels so silky afterwards. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this moisturizer. Leaves skin feeling hydrated without being oily or greasy. I even got my husband to switch over to it and he loves it too. Definitely a great daily moisturizer for those with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone/combination skin and this moisturizer is amazing!! It is affordable, does not make me greasy and moisturizes the areas of my face the are dry and flaky.  It is also perfect for a changing climate that experiences a lot of extreme warm/cold spells.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few selected products my wife uses for her facial skin. Its costlier compared to other similar products. But cost comes with a promise and its YES</li>
            <li> This product worked well for my skin. I started looking better within a few uses and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love it !! Couldn&#x27;t live with out it!!</li>
            <li> Really nice, light moisturizer for the summer months when my face is more oily. The scent is subtle.</li>
            <li> This product will stain your face ! I couldn&#x27;t believe it at first but my face begin to have a dark red undertone.&lt;br /&gt;This product contains chilli and will irritate the skin and cause breakouts. Be careful if you decide to use this.</li>
            <li> I decided to treat myself to a real face moisturizer instead of using just a cheap non-condegemic lotion. I also decide to put in the extra effort to find a moisturizer that helps combat acne. This is it. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear in seven years. I didn&#x27;t think I could ever have skin like this without prescribed creams or a restrictive diet. Amazing! I love it! It also smells lovely, very light and sweet. I also bought the acne stick which works excellently. I look forward to putting this on my face every morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of different facial creams in my 33 years.  I have tried the expensive Clinque and Estee Lauder and the cheaper drug store brands.  My skin is oily/combination----why am I still getting zits at this age----and can have a reddish tone to do, which drives me nuts.  I was shocked at how well this works!  It hydrates without it being too greasy but doesn&#x27;t leave it too dry.  Keeps the redness tone down and zits at bay.  I am going to purchase the towelettes today when I go to the store to see how the work.</li>
            <li> I was on a mission for a new skin care regime because I noticed that my skin was changing. I am approaching 30 and several of my girlfriends have said this is the same time they had to start doing things differently as well. I thought this moisturizer was great but then I started breaking out. I think something in here might be irritating to me but I also was using the Yes to Tomatoes Mask once per week so it could be a combo thing. Either way I was to scared to try this moisturizer again so I&#x27;m not 100% sure it breaks me out, could possibly good for others with less sensitive skin but either way I found what I love and have included it below. My skin is fair, combo leaning toward oily, acne prone, sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Glycolic Cleanser - AM/PM (takes of makeup too)&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Vitamin A Wrinkle Treatment Moisturizing Gel - PM Only (allow to set)&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Hyaluronic Night Cream - AM/PM though very light small amount in AM under Primer&lt;br /&gt;Colorescience Calming Primer SPF 20 - AM (trust me it&#x27;s the best tinted moisturizer/primer out there)&lt;br /&gt;Yes to Tomatoes Mask - As needed (only on my nose to reduce blackheads, too drying on other areas)</li>
            <li> This is a nice natural moisturizer. I can&#x27;t say anything great about it, but I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it either. Works well enough for a moisturizer and I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: No longer using this product as my acne had gotten out of control while using this product for several months. I wish that it would have worked better, but my face broke out terribly, unlike anything I have ever seen while using the carrots products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product and smells nice. I like the way it glides on and makes my face feel really hydrated. I would order again.</li>
            <li> I got this because my sister actually loves the Yes to Carrots face mask; she said her face cleared up so much after using the mask several times. I have combination skin and I am by nature a high-strung person and I often break out with large, painful pimples when I&#x27;m feeling stressed. I haven&#x27;t had good, clear skin since before I was a teenager so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give this a try. I have to say, the scent is a little displeasing, I can&#x27;t really describe it, but you can tell they don&#x27;t add any perfumes! It isn&#x27;t significantly strong so it wouldn&#x27;t be a deal-breaker, in my opinion. The consistency is also really thick. You&#x27;d have to be careful not to use too much; I did a time or two and I ended up doing that thing where the lotion sort of balled up and rolled off my face, if you know what I mean. Overall, the consistency was nice and it went on smoothly when I used the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for two weeks and at first I was like, okay, no new pimples, that&#x27;s a good sign, but then in the second to third week I suddenly got five huge pimples in some really unusual places on my face- I had one on my chin, two on my forehead and one on either side of my mouth like I was trying to sprout whiskers. I have never gotten five huge pimples at one time - three at the most. I was really devastated; I was so self-conscious that I didn&#x27;t want to leave my house for work and school for a week! After this, I immediately stopped using Yes to Carrots and went back to my old moisturizer, which doesn&#x27;t leave me pimple free, but at least they are fewer and less intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to say don&#x27;t try this - my sister still uses the mask and her face is looking great, but this just happened to not work for me.</li>
            <li> I have wasted so much money on moisturizers for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. One time I ran out of some expensive stuff that was doing an okay job, and decided on a whim to give Yes to Tomatoes a try when I saw it while running errands at a drugstore. WHERE HAS THIS STUFF BEEN ALL MY LIFE???? I&#x27;ve had dry, awful skin every winter that demands to be moisturized, but everything else leaves me feeling and looking super greasy. This moisturizer soaks in quickly and keeps me moisturized all day. I love it!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for five years and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have always had pretty hardy skin. I&#x27;ve never had a product cause breakouts or rashes either (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products). For some reason, this gave me a red rash all over as if I had been sunburnt. It even felt painful like a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve evolved much over the years as far as moisturizers are concerned. At one point, I used generic Vitamin E \\&quot;pastes\\&quot; that only broke out my normally acne-free face. I turned to Dove, but after a couple of years, I realized how oily it made my face. And finally, I turned to Aveeno, hoping to be more natural with my skin care choices. But then, a couple years ago, I grew more interested in the true care of my skin. So I went natural/organic with everything from shampoo to mouthwash to fingernail polish remover. And my Yes to Tomatoes/Carrots and Burt&#x27;s Bees journey began. All I can say is that, \\&quot;I love this stuff\\&quot; and I have a lot of my friends using it as well. I&#x27;ve also taken my natural/organic product usage to the next level, in making my own concoctions at home. But I&#x27;ll use this for as long as it works.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily and smells nice (kind of like French toast for some reason.. Hahah) I like it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer truly does balance your skin. I have an oily T-zone, but I get dry eczema patches on my cheeks, so it is difficult to find a moisturizer that keeps my cheeks hydrated without making my forehead and nose extra oily and breakout prone. This moisturizer softens my cheeks, and my oily forehead and nose have gotten under control in the four months I&#x27;ve been using it. My skin is fairly sensitive, but I have not had any breakouts or bad reactions.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a nice, light scent and a good feel on my face...plus I have the peace of mind from no parabens.</li>
            <li> Love! I love the smell and the texture of this cream. It has helped to make such a positive influence on my skin.</li>
            <li> love it, but it costs quite a bit&lt;br /&gt;think requiring so many words for this review is not good idea</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer, without the heavy greasy feel!  It is soothing, and seems to hold up pretty well during the day!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out but leaves it feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is my every day moisturizer. It is light. doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell and works with using just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who needs a lightweight moisturizer.  It feels great on and smells wonderful.  I have been using it for about three weeks and already notice a softer quality to my skin.  I have tried many expensive department store brands and have never been fully satisfied with the outcome.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe out of all these reviews only one person has mentioned the smell of this product. It smells like a million flowers.... Like an older woman&#x27;s perfume. The smell is so intense. I would be okay with the smell if it were subtle. It&#x27;s not. I like the way it felt on my skin so I tried to avoid all areas around my nose but it&#x27;s still annoying and I can smell it. I wish I liked it. I&#x27;m thinking about trying their Yes To Cucumbers</li>
            <li> -Combination skin&lt;br /&gt;-Dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried clean &amp; clear and Neutrogena and neither of them worked as well for my skin. It&#x27;s winter here, and my skin has been getting painfully dry and flaky. I went through about three moisturizers that always had something wrong with them (neutrogena--not heavy enough, but had spf so i used it; neutrogena natural--too heavy, and clogged my pores; clean &amp; clear--dried and irritated my skin; ambi--not heavy enough). This moisturizer, in combination with an aveeno nighttime moisturizer, have turned out to be the perfect combo for me. I was worried about the salicyclic acid in it because that&#x27;s what the clean &amp; clear moisturizer that I bought had in it, but whatever else is in it is very soothing. I use this moisturizer as a \\&quot;first coat\\&quot; because it is not very heavy, and i need something \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; to lock in the moisture (what the aveeno is for). However, I have put just this moisturizer on without the use of aveeno and it felt good/not drying. My face has never felt tight, irritated, or oily after using it--even after exfoliation when my skin is most sensitive. I feel confident that in spring, especially summer, this moisturizer would still work well (without the aveeno). I have been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin is doing well.</li>
            <li> Very creamy &amp; moisturizing without the oily feel, I love this products smells great &amp; only takes a dime sized amount for a great facial coat it can&#x27;t give it an honest opinion on the &amp;#34;clear skin&amp;#34; because was not a problem to begin with</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not greasy at all</li>
            <li> I just discovered the Yes To brand, and now I&#x27;m trying a ton of their products! I started with this moisturizer and face wash, and they made my skin feel so good, I started looking for other products by the Yes To brand that I could use. So far I&#x27;ve tried almost all of their Yes To Tomatoes face products and love them all, I also use the Yes To Grapefruit moisturizer with sunscreen. I also have the Yes To Carrots Shampoo and Conditioner on the way, and I am very excited because I don&#x27;t think I am going to be let down! I&#x27;ve been trying to find natural products that actually work for me, and I finally have! I have combination skin, so the Yes To Tomatoes works for me very well, and I would recommend that anyone who has been trying product after product, searching for one they can finally love, should try Yes To!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY moisturizer my oily acne prone face has approved and I am sticking with it forever. I only use a very tiny amount (less than a quarter of a pump) and spread it evenly on my face with water. My face stays hydrated throughout the day without feeling oily. And also no breakouts! YAYY!! When my current face wash and scrub runs out I will switch those to the Yes to Tomatoes products as well.</li>
            <li> weather or not its doing the job in keeping me young looking. I feel young. its not heavy, greasy or cause my face to break out or heat up so i like it.</li>
            <li> Its a little oily, only use a little. I l Ike the yes to tomatoes wash I thought it helped with my acne. So I decided to try this, and im sad to say I was a little disappointed. I just use it on really dry parts of my face.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer made my hormonal acne even worse. The fragrance is so overpowering, it make me wonder why a product that claims to &#x27;clear skin&#x27; can have such a strong perfume in it. It also was not hydrating enough for my normal to dry skin. Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Some background on my skin type: I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have not had problems with acne during my lifetime, but my skin is sensitive and dry. My sensitivity results in redness and sometimes stinging sensations with certain products, even high end moisturizers. For the past 8 yrs I have used cliniques dramatically different moisturizer for very dry to dry combo skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first degree is also in Environment so I have always tried to support Eco friendly products, but it seemed my skin wouldn&#x27;t cooperate. I would prefer if the product were local, but I still love this product. Last week I bought the same Cucumber moisturizer from Target and dislike it (as you can also see my review on amazon) because of the thick viscosity that does not absorb or spread when applying. This causes more product to be used as one pump does not cover enough surface area, and I have a small face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try another variation of the YTC line and the reviews here for the tomato moisturizer seemed really good, so I bought it via my prime account and got the product in 1 day. It is cheaper here than at Target, which is nice for the first try. Next time I will grab it while I am shopping, and possibly a second because they seemed to be sold out when I went last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I bought the cucumber before this one was because the marketing on the package noted &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; for the cucumber. Even if acne is not an issue for you the tomato spreads A LOT better and is absorbed by the skin without residue! Nontoxic skin care...finally!!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I absorbs well, and does not clog my pores. I have troublesome skin and am very impressed with this product. I believe the Yes To moisturizers are as good of a product as Clinique, but more affordable.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a moisturizer for my very oily skin and so far this once seems to work better than any of the more expensive brands I have tried. It&#x27;s a little thick but absorbs pretty quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait around to apply my makeup. My sister didn&#x27;t like the thickness so she mixed it with a drop of water and she loves it better than her Christian Dior moisturizer. I have yet to try that water mix since I like it just fine. My skin has been less oily and no breakouts which is a plus. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product is probably the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have oily skin in the T-Zone and I am currently using ProActiv to keep the breakouts under control. This moisturizer paired with the ProActiv leaves my skin in the best condition it&#x27;s ever been in! Love, love LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> The TL;DR: Product didn&#x27;t reduce oiliness in my skin. Great feel, smell, and quality, though.  Will not buy again, but encourage others to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full version:&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and adult acne.  At 25 years old, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every product ever.  The moisturizer is a pretty awesome product.  It goes on great, feels wonderful, and smells nice.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help my skin become more balanced.  In fact, my skin just seemed to get more oily.  I have used moisturizers in the past (even though it seems oily skin wouldn&#x27;t need moisture, most beauty sites and experts say all skin needs moisturizer) and they have been semi-successful.  I use the Yes to Carrots shampoo so I was excited to try out this stuff.  It just did not do what I needed.  Just for comparison&#x27;s sake, I diligently put this on after washing my face in the morning and at night for over a week. I used a small amount - just enough to cover my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work for you, however.  If your skin isn&#x27;t super oily and you don&#x27;t live in a climate where it&#x27;s incredibly humid, it might do what you want it to.  That being said, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still try other products from this brand because of the high quality.</li>
            <li> Caused an allergic reaction on my face almost immediately.  Lots of pain and redness in the small area I tested.  It also doesn&#x27;t smell that great. Not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My son never wanted to accept the idea that hydrating skin suffering from acne, improve your appearance. After using this product, the idea will eventually change.!!!!</li>
            <li> Only been using for a few weeks, seems to work well. Keeps my face moisturized without too much oiliness.</li>
            <li> The description for this product is pretty to the point. It is a light moisturizer targeted for those who need a little bit more moisture than your average \\&quot;acne\\&quot; type skin (as the Yes to Tomatoes line is for acne prone skin). It applies smoothly, and easily and dispenses from a pump bottle. There&#x27;s a couple of things to be known about this product though, good or bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Takes a little while to absorb. In my tireless search for the perfect oil-free moisturizer, I have tried anything from high-end products to Olay&#x27;s Beauty Fluid. The Olay one is fantastic, as it absorbs almost immediately because it is so light. This product is creamier than Olay, so if you have slightly oily to combination skin, you might want to be careful how much you apply, especially on your oily areas, as you MIGHT get millia or small pimples from the heaviness.&lt;br /&gt;-Has a heavy scent. I can&#x27;t really put my hand on it, but its very perfume-y. This is supposedly 90%+ natural, so I&#x27;m a little bit confused where this heavy scent comes from. I think its to mask the tomato smell that undoubtedly will be present in a product that is made out of tomato extract.&lt;br /&gt;-The pump bottle dispenses a little too much. This you will probably figure out from one use, but I hope this saves you that messy first experience. Don&#x27;t press it down all the way, or you&#x27;ll definitely need a tissue for the excess on your hand. Gently press down so that the flow is well controlled. You know how much you need (taking in consideration the creamier than normal quality).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t broken out from this product at all, and its been good few weeks since I started using it. I use this as a night cream because its slightly heavier, and your skin can definitely use more moisture during the night. Its a pretty good buy, and I will continue to use this. Well, until I chance upon a better one, of course ;).</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried 2/3rds of the moisturizers at the drugstore--and some higher-end brands as well. They&#x27;d either sufficiently moisturize, but inflame my adult acne, or leave my skin feeling tight and dry, but not inflame my acne. I bought the Say Yes to Tomatoes off Amazon on a whim and love it. It&#x27;s a rich cream that keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day long, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any acne flare-ups. For the money, it&#x27;s not an astonishingly large amount of product, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> i used to use the yes to tomatoes repairing lotion and when i switched to the daily moisturizing lotion i loved it. Especially during the dry winter months it keeps my skin from drying out and becoming itchy. I have oily skin so i usually use it most every other day but it feels really good and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like most facial moisturizers do. i love yes to tomatoes :)</li>
            <li> FINALLY!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found a great moisturizer that does NOT break me out AND helps rid of my current breakout.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to read positive reviews for this item &amp; immediately bought one ($15.49 at Walgreens) that evening.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it about 4-5 times now, but I see amazing improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 4th month of a horrible breakout that baffled me.  I have no idea what caused it.&lt;br /&gt;Today is the first day that I have 1-2 whiteheads as opposed to the 30 whiteheads + 6 cycstic acne bumps, etc from before.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m serious.  I&#x27;m talking \\&quot;tearing up while putting on your makeup\\&quot; type of face.&lt;br /&gt;ANYWHO, I&#x27;ve been using Dove unscented, sensitive skin soap to wash my face, hydrogen peroxide to spot treat, and then this moisturizer!  That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, I&#x27;ll use Desitin baby rash cream to spot treat for several hours (that does wonders too).&lt;br /&gt;I fully recommend this item--you&#x27;ve nothing to lose!&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes &amp; hang in there!x</li>
            <li> A+++++++ FAST SHIPPING!!!!! Thank You!</li>
            <li> I am honestly so surprised by how great this moisturizer is. I was just hoping for an improvement from my last one, but this is above and beyond what I expected! I have combination, acne-prone skin, and this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found for my skin. Since I started using it (and I haven&#x27;t changed anything else about my routine), my breakouts have cleared and my skin looks really fresh and healthy. I&#x27;m pale, but this moisturizer has brightened my skin and actually seems to improve circulation, so my skin is a little bit more pink than before. It seems to have a lot of good nutrients for your skin. I&#x27;d imagine that this would help with fine lines and wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a difference in that regard. As a side note, I do an aspirin mask a couple times a week and I use a Clarisonic a few times a week, and I think those both help exfoliate my skin and help it absorb the nutrients better. I recommend doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a little bit of a perfumey smell, which I normally hate, but I actually love how it smells. This moisturizer does tend to sting a tiny bit, especially when I&#x27;ve just exfoliated. But it&#x27;s not bad, and it doesn&#x27;t last long. The other thing I&#x27;ll say is that it leaves my skin feeling a tiny bit tight, which at first made me feel that it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough, but now I realize that it is very moisturizing, and the tightness is just a minor annoyance that I&#x27;ve gotten used to.</li>
            <li> For the last few years I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of an expensive moisturizer by BareMinerals. It was the only one I could find that wouldn&#x27;t break me out (even though I don&#x27;t generally even have breakout prone skin - moisturizer would do it in a hot minute).  I heard good things about this brand and specifically this moisturizer so I decided to try it and after a couple weeks - I am SOLD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it not break me out.. it is MORE moisturizing than my old one and at 1/3 of the price. Also? IT SMELLS AMAZING. I hate tomatoes as a food and never would have thought that they smelled like much of anything but I find myself looking forward to putting this on day and night not just for the scent but for the way it makes my skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even hesitate.. JUST TRY IT.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the first I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t break me out! It&#x27;s the perfect balance and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy or feeling thick. It&#x27;s lightweight and natural, which i love!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that heavy. It even smells like s&#x27;mores! It makes my face feel really good throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li> My skin is happy! I had run out of this product a short while ago and could not find itinerary Canada...my skin was unhappy until I found it on Amazon...and my skin is back to feeling happy!</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant, sweet and perfume, definitely not harsh. I have somewhat oily skin, but the product reviews on this said it would work for that type of skin. However, I think this particular Yes To product would be best for people with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Even with just a partial pump of this stuff my skin felt like it had a lot on it, and it didn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as I like. I think the only reason it wasn&#x27;t even worse is because every time I have applied it, I almost immediately went outside to extreme cold and wind.&lt;br /&gt;The Cucumber works way better for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but it ended up giving me a horrible rash. Smells great, even left my face looking better after the burning and discoloration subsided, but it was impossible to keep using. If you have sensitive skin at all, save yourself the money and the pain and steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It&#x27;s very thick so a little bit goes a long way. Very soft and smells nice. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m particularly sensitive when it comes to products (you can see my other reviews and I usually love everything) but I have to say this burned my face for a day, I thought that maybe was a one time only reaction and I used again... well, now it&#x27;s going to the trash &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. My skin is very picky when it comes to skin care.</li>
            <li> when i do get a breakout, i immediately apply a small amount and the area clears up. No more cysts. I love it.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well, skin feels fresh, smells like cinnamon bread</li>
            <li> I bought this product because every once in awhile I like to do a facial mask which dries my skin out. So I needed a good moisturizer to help with that. This stuff definitely hits the mark. It hits the mark and then it keep going until the mark is no longer visible. I&#x27;ve tried other facial moisturizers and it always seemed like 10 minutes after I applied them, my face would be dry again. If I use a full squirt of this stuff, my face would be moisturized for days. I end up using a little less than a half squirt. I can&#x27;t really speak to if it has helped clear up my pimples or even out my tone because I only use it on an as-needed basis. But as far as moisturizing goes, grade A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;I just want to add that this stuff is a must if you are using the Yes To Tomatoes acne line (i.e. the face scrub, acne lotion, and spot stick). The acne products have salicylic acid which is super drying and this moisturizer keeps my face from being in a constant state of flake.</li>
            <li> I have developed skin with a mind of its own. At times it is a desert, at times it erupts little volcanoes. I have tried so many kinds of skincare products, with unpleasant and unsatisfying results-- even smearing olive oil on my face in an attempt to moisturise it when it was dry (it worked, but felt yucky). One of my chief concerns is using as little chemicals as possible in my beauty and food products, so I experimented with Weleda, Dr. Hauschka, and Yes To. The latter better fit my budget, and wouldn&#x27;t you know, appeased my angry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Yes To Tomatoes moisturiser. I love it so much that I plan to buy it in bulk and smuggle it back home (where a bottle goes for a whopping $25!) in my suitcase. It is light, absorbs quickly, and thankfully moisturises. I do have the now rare, occasional deep pimple, but nothing in comparison to the past-- I am skeptical that the product had any hand in reducing my acne, but hey-- who knows? The cream is great in winter, and I use it both in the morning and at night. Recently I was mistaken for being in my early twenties (which I am not)-- is it the cream? Eh... doubtful, but it certainly makes my face feel gorgeous!</li>
            <li> This is working wonderfully to help clear up my DD&#x27;s skin along w/the YTT Clear Skin Deep Pore Scrub &amp; Clear Skin Deep Pore Scrub. She loves them all &amp; we are VERY impressed the difference it has made. I put off buying yet another product line because I felt it was just false hope for her &amp; wouldn&#x27;t be any better than the YTCucumbers cleanser &amp; milk of magnesia, but I was wrong! Now I am so happy I bought it &amp; wish I&#x27;d have bought it sooner. She doesn&#x27;t get the big cystic pimples/ acne, but gets a lot of smaller ones (clusters) along her hair line, the sides of her face, &amp; forehead pretty regularly. She has actually pretty much always had a constant presence of acne in those areas until now. She still uses MOM sometimes, but not the every other night like she used to. I am VERY impressed &amp; so grateful!!</li>
            <li> READ THE INGREDIENTS ON ALL OF THE BOXES, FOR TOMATOES, BLUEBERRIES, CUCUMBERS WHATEVER, IT GOES ON AND ON BUT ONE THING REMAINS THE SAME, THE INSIDE OF ALL OF THESE BOXES, IS THE SAME INGREDIENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this twice a day since I got it and so far I love it. I will however say that after taking a bath one day &amp; cleaned my face with warm water I put on the moisturizer and my face got red &amp;  blotchy kinds looked like hives. I have used it several times since then and have not had that problem but I used cold water to wash my face instead.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin with oily tzone. I have done a lot of research to reduce the oil and reduce the pore size so I decided to buy this product. It did not cut the oil and after two weeks of using it I got the feeling that my pores even got bigger and the pore ee area expanded so I stopped using it quicky. I do not recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve had problems with acne and oily skin since I was 10 years old, and being in my 30s hasn&#x27;t changed that.  The challenge as an adult is to find a product that is light enough to not cause my oily skin to break out, but not drying or harsh on my now aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product manages that; it feels both light and moisturizing on my skin, and has never given me any problems.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it has no SPF in it, but honestly I love the product so much I don&#x27;t care.  Plus, the price, compared to other skin care products, is amazing.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wash this off as soon as I put it on.  The smell is so perfumey, like what an old lady would wear.  Its so overwhelming it makes me nauseous.  Im not typically finicky about fragrances, but this is Not at all what I&#x27;d expect from YTC.  Doesn&#x27;t smell natural at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this moisturizer.  It is perfect in thickness (not too thick but not too light either). Has a delightul cinnamon smell...didn&#x27;t expect that.  I love the entire Say Yes to Tomatoes products.  I first tried Daily Pore Scrub, Roller Ball and Acne Repair Lotion (can purchase in store at Target for 19.99) before purchasing this moisturizer.  All are excellent products as my skin has cleared up a lot and feels incredible.  Love they are natural-based.  Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I like it. I prefer it over a lot of other lotions and creams I&#x27;ve tried. I definitely did not notice a change in my complexion, like it clearing up, as the ad says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Chemical free&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way (a quarter of a pump is enough to moisturize my entire face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey (if your not spending over $25 on amazon, otherwise ur paying $5 for shipping, and it&#x27;s $15 every where else)&lt;br /&gt;Nice moisturizer but that&#x27;s it (no change in my skin other than it becomes softer after I use it)</li>
            <li> Great lotion. My sensitive skin does not break out. The ingredient list is acceptable as far as lotions go.</li>
            <li> Has become a favorite of mine. Naturally made, my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I have combination/sensitive skin (very light tone). I have never been able to use a moisturizer with out it irritating and rash-ing up my skin. This moisturizer not only helps my acne, it helped even my skin tone too. I love this moisturizer and will be buying more when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, which can dry out quite easily. For many years I&#x27;ve been switching between high-end and lower end products such as Guerlain, Dior, Skin Authority, Lancome, Aveda, Aveeno... all in the effort to find the perfect moisturizer. So far this product is by far the best. It is not oily, semi-lightweight, and it smells terrific (like carrot cake lol). A little does go a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t break the bank. I use it with Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Serum, and there has been no issues related to skin dryness, redness, or breakouts. So far, I&#x27;m very very impressed.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like tomatoes at all. It smells like a cinnamon bun. I have used TONS of other products but this along with the repair serum is the only things that worked!</li>
            <li> First time I bought this was because the store was out of my usual product. I was unsure and the smell was a little strong but ended up using the whole package (at first I had debated on getting my usual at next trip to store) it is light weight no greasy feel and the longer I have been using notice I have not has as many breakouts. Now this is my new facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic. I have had problem middle age skin for a while and have tried everything. Started to get terrible acne on my cheeks and they have always been very red but it was getting worse. I have started to use more natural products, so I thought I would give this a go. I was using purpose for sensitive skin with spf which seemed alright in the summer but my skin was getting worse with prolonged use. As another reviewer said I was afraid to look in the mirror after putting on my makeup it looked so bad. This lotion very quickly calmed everything down,and it was truely amazing how much better my skin looked after just a few days. The tone and texture of my skin have improved dramatically, and the pimples and spots are healing and disapearing and I have only been using it for a week. The scent is quite strong but not unpleasant, and does not affect my sensitive skin, it actually feels wonderfully when you apply it. I would definately recommended this, and will be trying other products in the range.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews but the ingredient list on here is incorrect. This has fragrance in it and it&#x27;s too strong for my allergies. This was like putting perfume on my face, I had to wash it off! If they make a fragrance free version of this I might try it again.</li>
            <li> coming from someone who has tried a variety of moisturizers on the market this is the best doesnt break me out , smells good&lt;br /&gt;moisturizers just enough and i  use shea butter to seal it in and its just perfect.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t help at all. I really liked the face wipes and I hadn&#x27;t found a moisturizer that worked so I tried this out. It didn&#x27;t work. My skin gets red and blotchy after using this and I feel like my skin gets drier with extended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is incredibly picky though and where many have had success it just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> Stress sure does make your face break out in awful, horrible ways. I noticed a difference the next day I started using this. Never thought I could actually say that about any product. The KEY to this being so great, is that when you have sensitive and dry skin, all of the acne products you use (that include the key ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide) dry your skin even more.  This is a type of lotion with salicylic acid in it. Best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, like everyone keeps saying, it has a weird smell. But you only smell it for a few seconds and its not that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is probably a good thing since anything with fragrance in it also dries out your skin. (Think about that next time you buy bar soap). So I&#x27;m guessing its part of the natural ingredients in it that gives it that smell. It&#x27;s really not that bad you guys, definitely not a strong enough reason not to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin so soft too. Give it a try. It&#x27;s less expensive than most products claiming to be this effective. I actually can&#x27;t wait to try the other products fro this line.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this moisturiser. I use it at night after using the gel cleanser and repairing lotion and it smells gorgeous. Only been using a week but definitely calms my skin down. I have quite dry and sensitive skin and this causes me no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Public Service Announcement: This is the ONLY moisturizer I can and will (so far) use on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through Aveeno clarifying moisturizers (with and without SPF), The Body Shop lines (vitamin e, tea tree, and aloe), Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter... and possibly even more over the years, and this is just simply the best I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why: It&#x27;s light to touch and absorbs right into your skin, has a very gentle fragrance, comes in a pump so you can use as little or as much as you need, is about a 3 on a scale of 1-10 for &#x27;greasiness&#x27;.. so your skin isn&#x27;t greasy/shiny but it definitely isn&#x27;t tight and dry - just very well hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is overactive in producing oil, which is what attracted me to this line by &#x27;Yes to Carrots&#x27;. If I use a toner or moisturizer that leaves my face matte and dry, that&#x27;s an automatic trigger for oil making a gradual appearance. If I use a moisturizer that&#x27;s too thick and heavy, my pores clog and I get breakouts; this moisturizer is a happy medium. I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;Tomato\\&quot; line for the last few years, and I&#x27;m wary to try anything else. Because on top of being oily, my skin is sensitive and acne-prone. I even use it after washing my face at night. Moisturizers labeled \\&quot;Night Cream\\&quot; are just too heavy for my skin and I wake up looking like I&#x27;ve been cooking in the kitchen of a greasy fried food joint all day...eck!! My skin just doesn&#x27;t like them! And I must abide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price for the little pump bottle. It lasts you awhile, and that&#x27;s with me being pretty generous with the amount I use on my skin TWICE a day.. sometimes I reapply if I don&#x27;t feel hydrated enough. I&#x27;ve read some reviews where people have broken out because it&#x27;s too heavy/greasy - again: This is a PUMP. Use a little on first use, and your face will let you know how much it needs. Some people need more or less than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No irritation, no strong fragrance, goes on evenly, and makes my face look and feel GREAT! Viva la Tomato!!and feel GREAT! Viva la Tomato!!</li>
            <li> good quality and value for money</li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling a bit greasy</li>
            <li> I have been having acne problems for a few years now. I bought the whole set of this facial cleaner and it did smell and feel really nice on my face but, it did not help with my acne.  I&#x27;t didn&#x27;t dry my skin like other acne treatments.  I have used but, my acne still came.  I would say it works great for just a cleaner and moisturizer but, not so for acne.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on. It doesn&#x27;t feel like lotion. It feels thicker when it is on but it glides on smoothly. I feel like it makes a huge difference right after I put it on as if I could star in one if those beauty commercials.</li>
            <li> Yes to Tomatoes has been my favorite skin care line that I&#x27;ve tried. The moisturizer leaves my face feeling hydrated without being too heavy or greasy, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with acne in response to it. Love that it&#x27;s 98% natural AND cruelty-free!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has done wonderful things for me. It cleared up the overall tone of my skin from bumpy and blotchy to a more even tone with just a few post acne discolorations. I love the smell of the product as well. Loyal user.</li>
            <li> I usually use philosophy&#x27;s hope moisturizer which I love, but hate what it does to my wallet. This is thicker, but not greasy. Slight scent, overall good moisturizer for drugstore but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase. It will last me a long time since I don&#x27;t even need a full pump to moisturize my face. It does moisturize evenly without oily or dry patches, its just not my kind of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of years and love it.  It is very light/not greasy and smells great.</li>
            <li> was using the cucumbers but it made me break out even worse. have been using this. the scent is very strong but i do like the smell. burned slightly the first i used it but hasn&#x27;t since. overall, my skin is a bit clearer but nothing miraculous. love that it is mostly natural.</li>
            <li> I thought this was more of a unisex/natural moisturizer but the scent is very feminine. Basically smells like prefume. Did not do anything special for my face.</li>
            <li> At first it was great.  No acne, it had a slight tingling sensation, but that is normal with an acne product.  I used it for only 4 days, when I noticed my skin getting red, irritated blotches, sometimes swollen.  I figured it would go away, so I kept using it.  Then it got painful.  I washed it off, and had to put ointment on my face to calm the burning.  Then for several days, every time I washed my face (even thought I stopped using YtTomatoes), it would be followed by pain, redness, and swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used probably 100 creams of different varieties, and have never had any allergies of any sort, only acne.  I would never buy another YtC product again.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the red pepper ingredient, but this stuff is not good for your skin.  Even if you don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction, I think it probably damages your skin over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE**:  This product caused Rosacea for me.  It was months of trying clinical solutions before I finally was able to calm my skin down.  I couldn&#x27;t use the most gentle moisturizers or even wash my face with the most gentle cleansers - it was a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because a product is natural, doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t hurt your skin or have long-term consequences.  I still have some problems from it, but it has decreased gradually over the 1+ year since I stopped using it.  I have gradually been able to re-incorporate some of my old products back into my regimen.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to use a moisturizer because I have such oily, acne-prone skin. When I heard that it&#x27;s best to use one NOW to prevent skin issues in the future, I started to search for one that would work with my annoying skin. I received this lotion along with all the other Tomato products and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It goes on creamy yet light. It smells WONDERFUL. I have never thought to write reviews until I began using this line of skin care. If you are debating it, AT ALL, just buy it!</li>
            <li> I REALLY love this stuff.  And I&#x27;m REALLY picky about items that go near my nose.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance.  This moisturizer has fragrance, but it is very pleasant and light.  It also seems to go well with more oily skin. For me, it seems to last a long time.  I buy a new bottle every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have dry skin and prefer light fragrance, this might work well for you.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this product. I think it&#x27;s a great, basic moisturizer at a very good price. I really like the Yes To brand in general. I like that they&#x27;re paraben free, cruelty free, and mostly natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve mostly had oily skin during my life and I&#x27;ve really struggled with acne. So I&#x27;m always paranoid about products making me break out. At 39 my skin is starting to dry out a bit and I break out a lot less, but I still fight blackheads in my T zone as well as some breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Yes to Tomatoes Daily Moisturizer has a pleasant scent, though it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I prefer. My BF likes it though. I like the texture. It moisturizes well, but isn&#x27;t overly greasy. I do try to put it on at least 10 minutes before putting on my makeup. Best of all, it does not cause my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give it a thumbs up. Like I said, I&#x27;m on my second bottle. The only thing that would make it a \\&quot;five\\&quot; for me is if it had an SPF. I hate layering more products than I have to, so ideally I like a moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break my skin out.  I love the smell as well, nice and fresh.  Great price.</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought this product would be fragrence free, or at least have a slight tomato-like scent. But, ick!, the overwhelming floral perfume made it unbearable for me.</li>
            <li> After many years of suffering from embarrassing acne, I finally realized that my skin was sensitive to the SPF that is usually present in facial moisturizers and caused me to breakout constantly.  So I started looking for a moisturizer without SPF, which is no easy feat.  Almost all moisturizers sold in drug, department and cosmetic stores contain SPF!  For years I&#x27;ve been using Murad&#x27;s anti-acne lotion, and have been very happy with the results, with a few minor exceptions - the price, and the \\&quot;weight\\&quot; of the lotion - it&#x27;s pretty lightweight so I really have to pile it on during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Yes to Tomatoes.&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  I like this stuff better than the Murad at a third of the price!  This lotion is gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and definitely provides me with enough moisture.  Added bonus, at the end of the day my skin isn&#x27;t as oily as it was with other brands!  I used to have to duck into the restroom around lunch to blot my entire face, but this stuff makes my skin look more matte (without being dull and flat) throughout the day and into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;The pros are that it&#x27;s a great product WITHOUT SPF that works for my skin, the price point is much better than what I had been buying before, and since a little of this goes a long way (I seriously use less than a pea-sized amount), it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The cons (and all these together result in just ONE star being taken away - I can totally live with them but for the sake of others wanted to include them) are:&lt;br /&gt;The scent - at first I really liked it, it smells a little vanilla/bakery to me, but after a few weeks I&#x27;d really just prefer if it were unscented.  I can only really smell it for 5 minutes or so, but it&#x27;s just not a scent I would normally want to put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 5-10 minutes before it seems to \\&quot;sink in\\&quot; on my skin.  It feels a little bit filmy for a bit, but doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup application.  Maybe this is just heavier than I need for asummer moisturizer, so I&#x27;ll try to remember to figure that part out in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is convenient, but dumb. It&#x27;s a pump, but I don&#x27;t see a way to uncap the bottle to make sure you get the last bit out of it when you are nearing the end.  Not a big deal yet, as in 3 weeks I&#x27;ve hardly used any, but I imagine down the road it will bug me.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product, and will probably keep purchasing it!</li>
