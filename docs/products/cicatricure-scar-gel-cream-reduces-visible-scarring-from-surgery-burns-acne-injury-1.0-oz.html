            <li>It really worked in my face scar.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>they want you to used it as a minimun 2-3 a day did not last more than a week using teh minimum only thing I got was a rash and still teh scar not even lighter or minimized, I dont reocmend it personnally.</li>
            <li>SO far that I have used I haven&#x27;t seen a difference,</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t disappear your scar completely and leave your skin like babe  </li>

            <li>I thought I would never get rid of those marks, but now, just by using a gel like that, I can see that my skin is getting back to the normal condition.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any major differences...</li>
            <li>It healed and cleared up my scars minimally, but I&#x27;m almost done with the tube at this point and they&#x27;re certainly still visible.</li>
            <li>Its not worth that price if you apply more than once a day and everyday in a week is gone.</li>

            <li> Its not worth that price if you apply more than once a day and everyday in a week is gone.</li>
            <li> This gel is marketed in other countries with an expiration date printed on it, which is the way I expected to receive this mexican product in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this gel about 4 weeks - I believe it is working - I see a minimizing of my scars and they are not as dark as before.  </li>
            <li> , the itching is less, so will see.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste you money!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product was very small</li>
            <li> but instead  it makes them look less ugly</li>
            <li> Without an expiration date this product is useless for me</li>
            <li> but I compared the price with Argentinian&#x27;s price after I bought it, and I realized that the price is too expensive.</li>
            <li> WE HAD THE WORST TIME TRYING TO FIND A PRODUCT THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE A NASTY BREAK OUT WITH.</li>

            <li> There is no expiration date, only a lot number and a ph. number to call. I called 3 times, but my call was never picked up. This gel is marketed in other countries with an expiration date printed on it, which is the way I expected to receive this mexican product in the U.S. Without an expiration date this product is useless for me and I&#x27;m shipping it back.</li>
            <li> This product was very small they want you to used it as a minimun 2-3 a day did not last more than a week using teh minimum only thing I got was a rash and still teh scar not even lighter or minimized, I dont reocmend it personnally.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any major differences...</li>
            <li> Good smell, texture and results.</li>
            <li> Great experience! Great product!</li>

            <li> Its not worth that price if you apply more than once a day and everyday in a week is gone.</li>
            <li> I started the treatment with Cicatricure gel 3 week a go and so far I have a fantastic result everyday.😘</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste you money!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the glowing recommendation for it from my aunt. It healed and cleared up my scars minimally, but I&#x27;m almost done with the tube at this point and they&#x27;re certainly still visible. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my skin type, but it wouldn&#x27;t be the #1 scar removal method I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t disappear your scar completely and leave your skin like babe  but instead  it makes them look less ugly, it really improve how your scar looks.I can say it&#x27;s good if you your scar are not that deep it will help you. I am looking forward in buying it again i</li>
            <li> totalmente recomendado el producto, excelente, venderdor. soy de venezuela  y llego sin ningun incoveniente. saludos. comprenlo .. necesitaremos de estas pronto</li>
            <li> Does not work for my girlfriend</li>
            <li> Using for enough time and I have not seen the expected results different from natural process.</li>
            <li> I have some spots on my skin and scars as well. I feel completely satisfied with Cicatricure gel, because although I have been used that just for a couple of weeks, all those marks seem to be disappearing. I thought I would never get rid of those marks, but now, just by using a gel like that, I can see that my skin is getting back to the normal condition. I recommend Cicatricure to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product it self is good but I compared the price with Argentinian&#x27;s price after I bought it, and I realized that the price is too expensive.</li>
            <li> it really does help have been using it for a while it does help happy with my purchase will buy again</li>
            <li> After almost a year of a deep cut in a finger, I can tell that this gel help me a lot to minimize the scar. Love it.</li>
            <li> It really worked in my face scar. Today, nobody can say I injured my face by just looking at me. They need to see photos when it happened. I am buying the third one and really recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this gel about 4 weeks - I believe it is working - I see a minimizing of my scars and they are not as dark as before.  I believe it&#x27;s because this gel is working.  I&#x27;ll continue until i complete the gel. thanks</li>
            <li> Follow directions and soon you will see scar become smaller . Used it on my c section scar and I am happy with results!</li>
