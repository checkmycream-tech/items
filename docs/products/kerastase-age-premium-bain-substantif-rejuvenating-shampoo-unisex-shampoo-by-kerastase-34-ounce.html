            <li>I had tried the smaller size first and, truxt me, it is worth it.</li>

            <li> However the Keratase Age products work well on my aging, highlighted, average 55 yyear old hair!</li>
            <li> i wanted to have soft hair like the other lines of this brand deliver.</li>
            <li> I know that it is expensive compared to other shampoos, but it leaves my hair so clean, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Used along with a Kerastase everyday conditioner it has transformed my hair from lifeless to shiny, soft and given my color a boost.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, maybe I am doing something wrong like not using a $3 bottle of tropical spring water every time.</li>

            <li> producto de alta calidad, excelente tratamiento para el cabello, tamaño real de la publicacion, lo seguiria comprando porque es muy efectivo y rapido</li>
            <li> Love this for gray hair, would not consider buying another product</li>
            <li> pretty good shampoo but not all its cracked up to be. You&#x27;ll do just as good using something less expensive.</li>
            <li> If you color your hair, this isn&#x27;t for you.  Other than that it wasn&#x27;t anything special.  My hair wasn&#x27;t any nicer than before.</li>
            <li> I have used Kerastase products for the last 5 years and believe you get what you pay for with quality products. This shampoo has exceeded my expectations. Used along with a Kerastase everyday conditioner it has transformed my hair from lifeless to shiny, soft and given my color a boost. I have chemically treated hair and I now can go longer between visiting the salon since using this product. It is a great value buying the larger size - it will lasts for months.</li>
            <li> Being bald myself, never use the stuff.  But if I did, would swear by it!</li>
            <li> I know that it is expensive compared to other shampoos, but it leaves my hair so clean, soft and shiny. My hair just looks better!</li>
            <li> Skeptical that this much money could really be worth it for a shampoo. I had tried the smaller size first and, truxt me, it is worth it. My hair is fuller and shinier. I do use this in combination with the conditioner and mousse so I cannot say it is the shampoo alone. However the Keratase Age products work well on my aging, highlighted, average 55 yyear old hair!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, sad they&#x27;re discontinuing.</li>
            <li> The best for mature hair</li>
            <li> I love this product but was sent the wrong conditioner so I have not achieved the results that I am use to achieving with the use of the The Age Premium Shampoo and Lightweight Conturing  Care/ Treatment</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the Conditioner (over $100) because one of the major beauty magazines HIGHLY recommended it and gave it 5 stars....Hmmm, maybe I am doing something wrong like not using a $3 bottle of tropical spring water every time. I have seen no difference.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel like it has a build up on it. i wanted to have soft hair like the other lines of this brand deliver. i was hoping it would be of high quality, and help my hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  It makes my hair feel thicker and it gives it a nice shine. Worth the dollars.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere in Indy.  Happy to have it.</li>
            <li> Kerastase products are costly, I have found on amazon, it is cheaper:)&lt;br /&gt;Love this shampoo &amp; it comes to my door!! Great fast service!!!</li>
            <li> I  use it as MY shampoo</li>
