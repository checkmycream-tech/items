            <li>If anything it is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>but I can say for some reason this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>The price point is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>but I did not feel it very effective as a masque.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product, I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Love this product, does wonders for my hair and smells great!</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>I think all good reviews come from Loreal....</li>
            <li>It smells SO good</li>
            <li>good~~~</li>
            <li>Not as good as I had hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>Good, rich conditioner for the price, and it smells great!</li>
            <li>Glad I did!</li>
            <li>Glad I found these products!</li>
            <li>and I want to be sure it stays on the market!     </li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it with the matching shampoo!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Their hair looks so healthy and no tangles in the morning!</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This mask is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>start, it smells amazing and when you rinse this out, your hair smells</li>
            <li>This hair mask is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s an amazing masque.</li>
            <li>is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li>To be honest I didn&#x27;t realize it was for colored hair but</li>
            <li>but this really is the best.  </li>
            <li>It was like I had my own hair</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>This conditioner may work best on normal hair.</li>
            <li>But it fades quickly and considering how great my hair looks</li>
            <li>Just comb through while in the shower very easy</li>
            <li>One application of this product, and my hair seemed to be much more healthy and hydrated!</li>
            <li>and works pretty good too!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Prefer others but it&#x27;s a good sulfate free product</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews on anything, but this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this instead of the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34; Miracle Hair Mask because that one is a bit pricier, but I think I&#x27;ll just pay more for the better product.</li>
            <li>my hair also tangles after i straighten it with the heat protection but after using the masque just once, its tangle free!</li>
            <li>Plus, it makes my hair more shiny and bouncy.     </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, but this product is great</li>
            <li>I love the conditioner they use in the hair dye package, but they don&#x27;t sell it separately.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>The EverStrong line coats my hair better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that good,I usually love Loreal products.</li>
            <li>I find argon oil works better for my treated hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try adding argon oil to this product to see if it works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried the product</li>
            <li>Magic in a jar for a bargain price.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping for more of a fruity smell.</li>
            <li>I had another LOreal hair mask that I really enjoyed</li>
            <li>What  a lovely smell.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is inexpensive but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>So buy more hair conditioning products it is.  </li>
            <li>It rejuvenates hair leaving it healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I must say the first time I used it, I was blown away!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size and is relatively inexpensive considering the size and the amazing quality, It makes my hair so silky and shiny!</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it for 4 months and it is wonderful, let my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my parched, lifeless, dry hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for people with oily scalps, it&#x27;s also good for damaged hair because it doesn&#x27;t cover your hair with thick chemicals that stress your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my hair feel soft (manageable) and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Consistently is great for thick, wavy hair and it smells really good!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I got to try Everpure for a cheap price and plan on using my Everpure shampoo/conditioner coupons to try the rest of the line.</li>
            <li>I also love the light mint scent.</li>
            <li>But this doesn&#x27;t smell that good and doesn&#x27;t really conditioning your hair that well</li>
            <li>Wow Amazing .Product!</li>
            <li>There is no sign of frizz after I use this, and my hair stays super healthy.  </li>
            <li>so it is helpful that it is Sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>I decided to try this because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>it has a chemically smell, but there&#x27;s also a mint smell that I enjoy.</li>
            <li>I use along with the EverPure Moisture shampoo and conditioner and am thrilled with the whole line.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair tangle free, doesn&#x27;t flatten my waves, holds the color, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>I very rarely write reviews about products, but this stuff is fantastic</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting my hair to be soft and full of life like it was!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Loreal!!!</li>
            <li>It rinses easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>The flyaways don&#x27;t go away, because the conditioner isn&#x27;t meant to get rid of that, but it does a great job of moisturizing my hair, which is great because I use a flat iron often, and my hair can get dry.</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>This product made it smooth, shiny and more straight.</li>
            <li>Since I started coloring my hair at 15, I have always been on the lookout for the magic conditioner that gives you soft, shiny, healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is nice, curly, soft, and always shiny!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was using the Neutrogena Triple Repair mask with excellent results for awhile, but lately it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping, so</li>
            <li>This masque is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my thick, colored, curly, damaged hair...</li>
            <li>I have a head full of frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Just as good as the pureology deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I love it too much to let go of.</li>
            <li>However, it was a true delight.</li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of products that don&#x27;t come close to providing these results on color treated.</li>
            <li>This product is especially good for preserving your hair color, which is important, as I dye my hair and want to keep the color as long as possible.</li>
            <li>I love the EverPure line, and the red lid stuff is my favorite of the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>And Very Very Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>This product works so much better than a normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair and know when a conditioner is doing a good job.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of this product and thought it smelled reminiscent of Aveda products, so that was a major selling point for me.  :-)</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, minty and herbal, very natural.</li>
            <li>so noticeable people have repeatedly commented on how great my hair looks, asking whether I got a new haircut or did something different.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than some of the Loreal products in the same line that come in a large tube, it just costs more.</li>
            <li>Very affordable, didn&#x27;t expect it to work this nicely for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I use it now every time I take a shower and the results have been far more</li>
            <li>Soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>So by all means buy this, it really is worth it.</li>
            <li>I also love the soft fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I put this on for 2 - 3 minutes after washing, twice per week, and it gives me the right amount of conditioning.</li>
            <li>used in the past works great</li>
            <li>I am normally a snob hair products goddess so it was a huge stretch for me to even order this item.</li>
            <li>Started using this conditioner to give my curly hair more fluffy body in a carefree hairstyle - love how it conditions my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this at more than Half the Cost!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was looking for a no-silicone conditioner that would help preserve my teal hair, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to do such fantastic things for my curls!</li>
            <li>And Helps My Very Itchy Scalp Dermatitis!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>this restorative masque only makes my hair more shiny but not sufficiently conditioned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this conditioner may work OK as a daily conditioner</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my favorite scent of the different ones in this line.  </li>
            <li>My favorite deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>After getting the brainy idea to highlighten my hair after coloring it, my hair went from normal to feeling like straw really quick.</li>
            <li>There are so many products out there that are extremely expensive and do nothing good.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Loreal hair products is the fragrance and that is just a personal opinion; I&#x27;m sure others will like it just fine.  </li>
            <li>I always love how soft and silky my hair feels after I color it and use the included &amp;#34;deep conditioner&amp;#34; but have never been able to find a product that replicates the performance of those little tubes.</li>
            <li>It leaves it soft, silky, shiney and full of body.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice rosemary smell and my husband almost went down to couch</li>
            <li>and it is light, does not weigh fine hair down</li>
            <li>makes colored hair super soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Makes my dry frizzy hair much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Hair feels good, don&#x27;t know about any long lasting results</li>
            <li>My hair is long and bleached &amp; honestly takes about 2 hours to detangle, with this I can comb through my hair with no issues what so ever &amp; my hair feels so soft</li>
            <li>only does my hair look amazing, but some random hottie at the movies told me my hair smells amazing too!</li>
            <li>Not only is this great for my waves, but it really hold the red which is apparently notorious for fading.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this, but it&#x27;s definitely been a great little mask.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s just me, because my nose is very sensitive!!</li>
            <li>It is great to finally find a conditioner that enables me to run my fingers through my hair without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I just really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>This masque really re-conditions and strengthens my hair to a glory its never known, even when it was virgin.</li>
            <li>but I like to wear it straight.</li>
            <li>It really conditions very well.</li>
            <li>and this actually makes it look smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>i color my hair about every month; this product really softens my hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too much a fan of this one.</li>
            <li>I can tell by how much I need to put on when I&#x27;m combing my hair in the show.</li>
            <li>I also bought the leave-in conditioning cream and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it conditions without grease.</li>
            <li>After several uses I did not notice any significant difference.</li>
            <li>but the other one was much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on other reviews and I was expecting more results.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see how this masque would be better than any other masque you find at a supermarket counter.</li>
            <li>The only con I&#x27;d say it has is that the smell is a little strong for my taste and just not my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have long hair (to be honest I didn&#x27;t realize until recently</li>
            <li>i really feel an improvement in my hair...and other people tell me its so soft too :) would purchase again</li>
            <li>I highly recommend,</li>
            <li>My hair still has sheen, but wasn&#x27;t very detangled or soft and silky afterwards.</li>
            <li>My hair becomes soft, and the curls become very defined.</li>
            <li>This really makes hair soft and smells de-light-</li>
            <li>I had been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Moisture mask (the one in the tub similar to this) and I had noticed that my hair was still in need of a little love even right after I got out of the shower using that one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new favourite conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like new hair after I use this.  </li>
            <li>We dry haired ladies so lucky it is around.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER dry hair</li>
            <li>Have used this twice so far and the difference was apparent after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I put a good amount in my hair and left it for a few minutes, but I felt my hair very stiff and had a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>my hair was very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair very soft.</li>
            <li>im definitely going to use this every time im going to apply heat to my hair to make it feel extra smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and springy!</li>
            <li>So for many years I have looked for a conditioner that will do for my hair what the other product does in a much larger jar.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>When I first colored my naturally blonde hair auburn I tried Redkin.</li>
            <li>My hair is usually dry but with this product my hair is super soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is never dry after using it an very shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde hair that is highlighted with platinum pieces and frequently styled with hot tools.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount of this and it leaves your hair feeling soft and vibrant, smooth and revitalized!</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars due to the strong scent.</li>
            <li>People have stopped to ask me how I got my hair so shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>, it is buttery soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair &amp;</li>
            <li>My hair was completely fried</li>
            <li>This makes me hair feel just like it-- soft, silky, no tangles, shiny.</li>
            <li>I use this on my 6 and 4 year old.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrance, you might want to try another L&#x27;Oreal product.</li>
            <li>Because it wasn&#x27;t as thick, I had to use more.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my fine, dry and somewhat frizzy hair soft instead of dry feeling.</li>
            <li>I just use about a tablespoon in my hand and run it first through my bleached ends, and then through the rest of the hair - leave it on for 2 minutes for a regular condition, or 5 minutes for a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the salon brands but very conditioning, this masque is not so heavy that you can&#x27;t use it everytime you wash.</li>
            <li>jar is big and would last a long time, and I don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s well worth the price, but I would not buy it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ill but it again, sure!</li>
            <li>My hair is in pretty rough shape right now as I&#x27;m platinum blonde for summer, but my hair is naturally dark brown.</li>
            <li>I left it in for the 5 minutes it recommends, and my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this silky and soft in</li>
            <li>It makes my coarse hair so soft</li>
            <li>My hair was left soft after just one use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a daily outdoor swimmer, and sit in the sun every day, and live where it&#x27;s hot and humid year round.  </li>
            <li>The only draw back is the perfume or fragrant smell which I have learned to live with.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat thick hair, and this conditioner actually gets the tangles out, easily.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and silky and revives dry color-treated hair, especially when it&#x27;s nearly time to recolor.</li>
            <li>I am South Asian, with thick hair, and this product makes my hair super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I am Black but first borrowed it from one of my white girlfriends on a tennis weekend several years ago</li>
            <li>It is worth $4-$5, but almost $10 is highway robbery for such a small container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair silky soft, but i havent used it long enough to see if it actually does what it says it dies.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This works excellent on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It also smells great, and the tub lasts for MONTHS if you use the conditioner three times a week!</li>
            <li> The best hair mask I have used.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have ever used, if not the best!</li>
            <li> But решы stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> The best!!!  </li>
            <li> when I put it on my ends my hair looks great!  </li>
            <li> It is the BEST conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll like the lightweight feel and the great results!</li>
            <li> stuff is simply awesome.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also a perfect cure for my split ends.  </li>
            <li> It is really great!</li>
            <li> The best for your hear!</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Today I used my \\&quot;cheapie\\&quot; Pantene Beautiful Lengths and decided to grab this out of the closet to use as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have color and highlights, and use this every week, smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is a really great conditioner.</li>
            <li> This works great.  </li>
            <li> This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> great for colored hair</li>
            <li> If anything it is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I can say for some reason this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li> The price point is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> but I did not feel it very effective as a masque.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Love this product, does wonders for my hair and smells great!</li>
            <li> Smells good</li>
            <li> I think all good reviews come from Loreal....</li>
            <li> It smells SO good</li>
            <li> good~~~</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li> Good, rich conditioner for the price, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Glad I did!</li>
            <li> Glad I found these products!</li>
            <li> and I want to be sure it stays on the market!     </li>
            <li> You will love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it with the matching shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Their hair looks so healthy and no tangles in the morning!</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This mask is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> start, it smells amazing and when you rinse this out, your hair smells</li>
            <li> This hair mask is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s an amazing masque.</li>
            <li> is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t realize it was for colored hair but</li>
            <li> but this really is the best.  </li>
            <li> It was like I had my own hair</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> This conditioner may work best on normal hair.</li>
            <li> But it fades quickly and considering how great my hair looks</li>
            <li> Just comb through while in the shower very easy</li>
            <li> One application of this product, and my hair seemed to be much more healthy and hydrated!</li>
            <li> and works pretty good too!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Prefer others but it&#x27;s a good sulfate free product</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on anything, but this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this instead of the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34; Miracle Hair Mask because that one is a bit pricier, but I think I&#x27;ll just pay more for the better product.</li>
            <li> my hair also tangles after i straighten it with the heat protection but after using the masque just once, its tangle free!</li>
            <li> Plus, it makes my hair more shiny and bouncy.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, but this product is great</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner they use in the hair dye package, but they don&#x27;t sell it separately.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> The EverStrong line coats my hair better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that good,I usually love Loreal products.</li>
            <li> I find argon oil works better for my treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try adding argon oil to this product to see if it works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried the product</li>
            <li> Magic in a jar for a bargain price.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for more of a fruity smell.</li>
            <li> I had another LOreal hair mask that I really enjoyed</li>
            <li> What  a lovely smell.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is inexpensive but I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> So buy more hair conditioning products it is.  </li>
            <li> It rejuvenates hair leaving it healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I must say the first time I used it, I was blown away!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size and is relatively inexpensive considering the size and the amazing quality, It makes my hair so silky and shiny!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it for 4 months and it is wonderful, let my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my parched, lifeless, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for people with oily scalps, it&#x27;s also good for damaged hair because it doesn&#x27;t cover your hair with thick chemicals that stress your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my hair feel soft (manageable) and looks great.  </li>
            <li> Consistently is great for thick, wavy hair and it smells really good!  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I got to try Everpure for a cheap price and plan on using my Everpure shampoo/conditioner coupons to try the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> I also love the light mint scent.</li>
            <li> But this doesn&#x27;t smell that good and doesn&#x27;t really conditioning your hair that well</li>
            <li> Wow Amazing .Product!</li>
            <li> There is no sign of frizz after I use this, and my hair stays super healthy.  </li>
            <li> so it is helpful that it is Sulfate free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> it has a chemically smell, but there&#x27;s also a mint smell that I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I use along with the EverPure Moisture shampoo and conditioner and am thrilled with the whole line.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair tangle free, doesn&#x27;t flatten my waves, holds the color, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> I very rarely write reviews about products, but this stuff is fantastic</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting my hair to be soft and full of life like it was!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks Loreal!!!</li>
            <li> It rinses easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> The flyaways don&#x27;t go away, because the conditioner isn&#x27;t meant to get rid of that, but it does a great job of moisturizing my hair, which is great because I use a flat iron often, and my hair can get dry.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> This product made it smooth, shiny and more straight.</li>
            <li> Since I started coloring my hair at 15, I have always been on the lookout for the magic conditioner that gives you soft, shiny, healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is nice, curly, soft, and always shiny!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was using the Neutrogena Triple Repair mask with excellent results for awhile, but lately it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping, so</li>
            <li> This masque is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my thick, colored, curly, damaged hair...</li>
            <li> I have a head full of frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Just as good as the pureology deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I love it too much to let go of.</li>
            <li> However, it was a true delight.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of products that don&#x27;t come close to providing these results on color treated.</li>
            <li> This product is especially good for preserving your hair color, which is important, as I dye my hair and want to keep the color as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I love the EverPure line, and the red lid stuff is my favorite of the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> And Very Very Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> This product works so much better than a normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and know when a conditioner is doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this product and thought it smelled reminiscent of Aveda products, so that was a major selling point for me.  :-)</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, minty and herbal, very natural.</li>
            <li> so noticeable people have repeatedly commented on how great my hair looks, asking whether I got a new haircut or did something different.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better than some of the Loreal products in the same line that come in a large tube, it just costs more.</li>
            <li> Very affordable, didn&#x27;t expect it to work this nicely for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I use it now every time I take a shower and the results have been far more</li>
            <li> Soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> So by all means buy this, it really is worth it.</li>
            <li> I also love the soft fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I put this on for 2 - 3 minutes after washing, twice per week, and it gives me the right amount of conditioning.</li>
            <li> used in the past works great</li>
            <li> I am normally a snob hair products goddess so it was a huge stretch for me to even order this item.</li>
            <li> Started using this conditioner to give my curly hair more fluffy body in a carefree hairstyle - love how it conditions my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this at more than Half the Cost!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a no-silicone conditioner that would help preserve my teal hair, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to do such fantastic things for my curls!</li>
            <li> And Helps My Very Itchy Scalp Dermatitis!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> this restorative masque only makes my hair more shiny but not sufficiently conditioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this conditioner may work OK as a daily conditioner</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s my favorite scent of the different ones in this line.  </li>
            <li> My favorite deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> After getting the brainy idea to highlighten my hair after coloring it, my hair went from normal to feeling like straw really quick.</li>
            <li> There are so many products out there that are extremely expensive and do nothing good.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Loreal hair products is the fragrance and that is just a personal opinion; I&#x27;m sure others will like it just fine.  </li>
            <li> I always love how soft and silky my hair feels after I color it and use the included &amp;#34;deep conditioner&amp;#34; but have never been able to find a product that replicates the performance of those little tubes.</li>
            <li> It leaves it soft, silky, shiney and full of body.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice rosemary smell and my husband almost went down to couch</li>
            <li> and it is light, does not weigh fine hair down</li>
            <li> makes colored hair super soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Makes my dry frizzy hair much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Hair feels good, don&#x27;t know about any long lasting results</li>
            <li> My hair is long and bleached &amp; honestly takes about 2 hours to detangle, with this I can comb through my hair with no issues what so ever &amp; my hair feels so soft</li>
            <li> only does my hair look amazing, but some random hottie at the movies told me my hair smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Not only is this great for my waves, but it really hold the red which is apparently notorious for fading.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this, but it&#x27;s definitely been a great little mask.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s just me, because my nose is very sensitive!!</li>
            <li> It is great to finally find a conditioner that enables me to run my fingers through my hair without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I just really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> This masque really re-conditions and strengthens my hair to a glory its never known, even when it was virgin.</li>
            <li> but I like to wear it straight.</li>
            <li> It really conditions very well.</li>
            <li> and this actually makes it look smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> i color my hair about every month; this product really softens my hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too much a fan of this one.</li>
            <li> I can tell by how much I need to put on when I&#x27;m combing my hair in the show.</li>
            <li> I also bought the leave-in conditioning cream and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it conditions without grease.</li>
            <li> After several uses I did not notice any significant difference.</li>
            <li> but the other one was much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on other reviews and I was expecting more results.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see how this masque would be better than any other masque you find at a supermarket counter.</li>
            <li> The only con I&#x27;d say it has is that the smell is a little strong for my taste and just not my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (to be honest I didn&#x27;t realize until recently</li>
            <li> i really feel an improvement in my hair...and other people tell me its so soft too :) would purchase again</li>
            <li> I highly recommend,</li>
            <li> My hair still has sheen, but wasn&#x27;t very detangled or soft and silky afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair becomes soft, and the curls become very defined.</li>
            <li> This really makes hair soft and smells de-light-</li>
            <li> I had been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Moisture mask (the one in the tub similar to this) and I had noticed that my hair was still in need of a little love even right after I got out of the shower using that one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my new favourite conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like new hair after I use this.  </li>
            <li> We dry haired ladies so lucky it is around.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER dry hair</li>
            <li> Have used this twice so far and the difference was apparent after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I put a good amount in my hair and left it for a few minutes, but I felt my hair very stiff and had a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> my hair was very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair very soft.</li>
            <li> im definitely going to use this every time im going to apply heat to my hair to make it feel extra smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and springy!</li>
            <li> So for many years I have looked for a conditioner that will do for my hair what the other product does in a much larger jar.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> When I first colored my naturally blonde hair auburn I tried Redkin.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually dry but with this product my hair is super soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is never dry after using it an very shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde hair that is highlighted with platinum pieces and frequently styled with hot tools.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of this and it leaves your hair feeling soft and vibrant, smooth and revitalized!</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars due to the strong scent.</li>
            <li> People have stopped to ask me how I got my hair so shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> , it is buttery soft.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair &amp;</li>
            <li> My hair was completely fried</li>
            <li> This makes me hair feel just like it-- soft, silky, no tangles, shiny.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 6 and 4 year old.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrance, you might want to try another L&#x27;Oreal product.</li>
            <li> Because it wasn&#x27;t as thick, I had to use more.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my fine, dry and somewhat frizzy hair soft instead of dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I just use about a tablespoon in my hand and run it first through my bleached ends, and then through the rest of the hair - leave it on for 2 minutes for a regular condition, or 5 minutes for a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the salon brands but very conditioning, this masque is not so heavy that you can&#x27;t use it everytime you wash.</li>
            <li> jar is big and would last a long time, and I don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s well worth the price, but I would not buy it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ill but it again, sure!</li>
            <li> My hair is in pretty rough shape right now as I&#x27;m platinum blonde for summer, but my hair is naturally dark brown.</li>
            <li> I left it in for the 5 minutes it recommends, and my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this silky and soft in</li>
            <li> It makes my coarse hair so soft</li>
            <li> My hair was left soft after just one use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a daily outdoor swimmer, and sit in the sun every day, and live where it&#x27;s hot and humid year round.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back is the perfume or fragrant smell which I have learned to live with.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thick hair, and this conditioner actually gets the tangles out, easily.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and silky and revives dry color-treated hair, especially when it&#x27;s nearly time to recolor.</li>
            <li> I am South Asian, with thick hair, and this product makes my hair super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I am Black but first borrowed it from one of my white girlfriends on a tennis weekend several years ago</li>
            <li> It is worth $4-$5, but almost $10 is highway robbery for such a small container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair silky soft, but i havent used it long enough to see if it actually does what it says it dies.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed the product was very thick and rich, but as soon as I put it in my hair I could tell it wasn&#x27;t going to help.</li>
            <li> It made my color treated (just dyed to the color that my hair turns when the sun hits it, dark auburn) hair perfectly soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, but not oily or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I have damaged my hair badly by going from bright red, to black, to blonde....</li>
            <li> Pureology is probably what it is based off and it is OVERPRICED and will dry out the hair later on.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry curly hair and my child has curly and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> and i must say after the first wash then using heat protection that usually makes my hair feel rough for straightening my hair, its a lot softer.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally very frizzy and dry but after using this for the last month my hair is finally tame and there is no frizz!</li>
            <li> I was going to cut my long hair off</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long</li>
            <li> Conditioners usually just cover my hair in silicone and make it slick, which takes forever to rinse completely; But this conditioner rinses clean without the slick residue feeling.</li>
            <li> I really like it, but not sure to get again due to the expense.  </li>
            <li> Works Almost as Well as My much More Expensive Brand Pureology!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long!  </li>
            <li> good!&lt;br /&gt;I had really dry, damaged hair from bleaching and straightening it.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry the hair rather than moisturize it.</li>
            <li> When I go without it, my hair returns to being dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Over a period of time my hair has become dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Had to try some new things because of hard water</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get a wide tooth comb thru it because it was so dry.</li>
            <li> i have a lot of hair &amp; use this as a mask, takes about a third or half of the jar to cover my hair.</li>
            <li> I put it on, and leave it sometimes for half an hour while I sit outside, rinse it out and my hair is renewed.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner in order to help maintain moisture in my very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t stand applying something on my hair with such a strong bad smell.  </li>
            <li> I am Asian American and have thick, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair stylist said a mask might be beneficial due to my hair being so dry.  </li>
            <li> it just barely reaches my waist, it&#x27;s usually up and out of the way)</li>
            <li> About once a week, I mix this with coconut oil, smear it on wet hair, jam it all under a shower cap for warmth, and let it sit for an hour before rinsing.</li>
            <li> I tried on my childrens hair as well and no real benefit for them either.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly and unruly, this conditioner makes it soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that has been dyed for the past 15 years, so I use this instead of regular condition and leave it on for about 3 minutes each time.</li>
            <li> This softened my hair instantly, and when I air dried my hair over night, I woke up to extremely silky and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that will make my thin, but very curly hair do something other than frizz.</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way, but I just apply to my ends.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes ill put it in and blow dry my hair a lil to really seal it in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I have extremely frizzy, wavy hair with flyaways.</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews and agree.  </li>
            <li> I other words</li>
            <li> I was buying this locally, but have not been able to find it in the stores lately :(</li>
            <li> I have long hair, like past my bra straps, and maybe I get three treatments out of container.  </li>
            <li> My hair is usually thick, coarse and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I use it as a daily since my hair is that thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have dark, chemically treated hair, about down to my mid-back.  </li>
            <li> I also had a dollar off coupon, which knocked it down to about $1.95.</li>
            <li> Plus, it does not weigh my hair down or leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Beats Redken hands down.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s slightly wavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if  L&#x27;Oreal changed the formula of this product, but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and this last delivery, I noticed the product seemed thinner and didn&#x27;t smell like it usually does.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I have tried every product out there for my thick, dry, hair.</li>
            <li> I use this one once a week to give my hair a little boost, and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I think it just needs a little bit of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it lasts for ages even though it comes in a little tub.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the conditioner…just have to wait a little longer for it to set</li>
            <li> just very cheap and bad quality,it makes your hair even worse.</li>
            <li> But Moisture Restorative Masque is what my hair was missing.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer and have been using this product for few months now.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way!</li>
            <li> Used once, not sure if it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li> usually if I don&#x27;t use this.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for the past year, about once a week.  </li>
            <li> Sadly for some reason my grocery store doesn&#x27;t carry this one anymore, only the gold one which I seriously dislike, so I will be ordering online from now on.</li>
            <li> EverPure has brought my hair back to life when other expensive salon brands have failed me.</li>
            <li> :&#x27;( I&#x27;ll probably just use this when I go back to my natural color!</li>
            <li> i think thats what u get for 6 dollars!It makes your hair dry,unhealthy and hard.</li>
            <li> My hair is already short so cutting it wasn&#x27;t an option</li>
            <li> Found the product to be not effective as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m annoyed after losing out on almost 100 bucks in shampoos and conditioners that weren&#x27;t working and my hair looking dead and like straw.     </li>
            <li> But the scent of the cream was rather unpleasant and my hair turned out stiff and slightly</li>
            <li> he hated the smell so much.  </li>
            <li> OMG, you should at least try it!</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using it and no change, matter of fact my hair felt worse then before using it.</li>
            <li> Never experienced anything like this.</li>
            <li> This masque is just alright, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have tried them all (oil based, organic, expensive, from another country, etc.)</li>
            <li> and he also had horrible alergies in his back.</li>
            <li> Desperate</li>
            <li> and then after it cools I wash with cold water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather unpleasant.</li>
            <li> smells really bad for hair product, like medicine or sth.</li>
            <li> This product gave me horrible alergies.</li>
            <li> I had to return this product because of the terrible smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible to my hair, I bleach, dye, dye again,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried every product out there for my thick, dry, hair. This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used. Great product and easy to use. A little goes along way!</li>
            <li> Hair feels good, don&#x27;t know about any long lasting results</li>
            <li> This masque is just alright, unfortunately. My hair is in pretty rough shape right now as I&#x27;m platinum blonde for summer, but my hair is naturally dark brown. Anyway, I was using the Neutrogena Triple Repair mask with excellent results for awhile, but lately it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping, so I thought I&#x27;d try this instead. I loved the smell of this product and thought it smelled reminiscent of Aveda products, so that was a major selling point for me.  :-) I also noticed the product was very thick and rich, but as soon as I put it in my hair I could tell it wasn&#x27;t going to help. My hair still has sheen, but wasn&#x27;t very detangled or soft and silky afterwards. It still feels just as straw-like as it did before. :&#x27;( I&#x27;ll probably just use this when I go back to my natural color! I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking...</li>
            <li> After getting the brainy idea to highlighten my hair after coloring it, my hair went from normal to feeling like straw really quick. I couldn&#x27;t even get a wide tooth comb thru it because it was so dry. My hair is already short so cutting it wasn&#x27;t an option or I would of been bald. Desperate I went to a hair salon who told me to try this way over priced shampoo and conditioner. After 2 weeks of using it and no change, matter of fact my hair felt worse then before using it. I went back to the hair salon who gave me different over priced shampoo and conditioner to try along with a leave in conditioner. Still no change after a week of using it.  Now I&#x27;m annoyed after losing out on almost 100 bucks in shampoos and conditioners that weren&#x27;t working and my hair looking dead and like straw.     One day I&#x27;m in Walmart seen Loreal EverPure Restorative Masque for 6 bucks and figured nothing can hurt at this point. I must say the first time I used it, I was blown away!!!  I wasn&#x27;t expecting my hair to be soft and full of life like it was!!! even my husband noticed it who never takes notice of things like that. I use it now every time I take a shower and the results have been far more then I would ever of thought. Thanks Loreal!!! Please never stop making this. EverPure has brought my hair back to life when other expensive salon brands have failed me.</li>
            <li> I use Pureology Hydrate, Frederic Fekkai Glossing, and Matrix Sleek Look all through the week ( I switch it up). Today I used my \\&quot;cheapie\\&quot; Pantene Beautiful Lengths and decided to grab this out of the closet to use as a conditioner. Glad I did! It made my color treated (just dyed to the color that my hair turns when the sun hits it, dark auburn) hair perfectly soft. I actually purchased this at my local Target here in Houston for $1.95! Here&#x27;s how: It was \\&quot;clearanced out of the system\\&quot; (suppose Loreal quit making it?) and there as 4 on the clearance rack. The scanners wouldn&#x27;t show a price, except for the last sale price which was $2.94. I also had a dollar off coupon, which knocked it down to about $1.95. I am so glad I got to try Everpure for a cheap price and plan on using my Everpure shampoo/conditioner coupons to try the rest of the line. Pureology is probably what it is based off and it is OVERPRICED and will dry out the hair later on. Glad I found these products!</li>
            <li> This works excellent on my hair.  My hair is usually dry but with this product my hair is super soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> This works well, but the smell?  It&#x27;s rather unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I have extremely frizzy, wavy hair with flyaways. I am South Asian, with thick hair, and this product makes my hair super soft and silky. The flyaways don&#x27;t go away, because the conditioner isn&#x27;t meant to get rid of that, but it does a great job of moisturizing my hair, which is great because I use a flat iron often, and my hair can get dry. It also smells great, and the tub lasts for MONTHS if you use the conditioner three times a week! Of course this depends on the length of your hair (I have mid-length hair). This product is especially good for preserving your hair color, which is important, as I dye my hair and want to keep the color as long as possible. Pair this with the matching shampoo, and it will work wonders on your hair!</li>
            <li> makes colored hair super soft and silky.  I have color and highlights, and use this every week, smells great too.</li>
            <li> The best hair mask I have used. Leaves hair soft, but not oily or weighed down.  I color and straighten my hair so it is helpful that it is Sulfate free.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so shiny and manageable. I take it with me to the hairdresser when I get a haircut, too.</li>
            <li> This mask is simply amazing. And for the price? Unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;To start, it smells amazing and when you rinse this out, your hair smells good!&lt;br /&gt;I had really dry, damaged hair from bleaching and straightening it. This softened my hair instantly, and when I air dried my hair over night, I woke up to extremely silky and shiny hair. Also, it helps repair split ends!</li>
            <li> Not too fond of the smell! I thought I&#x27;d try this instead of the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34; Miracle Hair Mask because that one is a bit pricier, but I think I&#x27;ll just pay more for the better product. I put a good amount in my hair and left it for a few minutes, but I felt my hair very stiff and had a strong chemical smell. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> i just received this in the mail and i must say after the first wash then using heat protection that usually makes my hair feel rough for straightening my hair, its a lot softer. im definitely going to use this every time im going to apply heat to my hair to make it feel extra smooth and soft. my hair also tangles after i straighten it with the heat protection but after using the masque just once, its tangle free!</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my fine, dry and somewhat frizzy hair soft instead of dry feeling. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Loreal hair products is the fragrance and that is just a personal opinion; I&#x27;m sure others will like it just fine.  A little seems to go a long way, but I just apply to my ends.  I would recommend this to moisturize and soften hair.</li>
            <li> This hair mask is amazing. To be honest I didn&#x27;t realize it was for colored hair but what the heck. I have long hair (to be honest I didn&#x27;t realize until recently it just barely reaches my waist, it&#x27;s usually up and out of the way) which I thought I&#x27;d have to chop a hefty amount of because of how damaged it was -especially the ends. I had been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Moisture mask (the one in the tub similar to this) and I had noticed that my hair was still in need of a little love even right after I got out of the shower using that one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now used the L&#x27;Oreal one for 3 washes and the difference has been so noticeable people have repeatedly commented on how great my hair looks, asking whether I got a new haircut or did something different. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this, but it&#x27;s definitely been a great little mask. The only con I&#x27;d say it has is that the smell is a little strong for my taste and just not my favorite fragrance. But it fades quickly and considering how great my hair looks I just really don&#x27;t mind. Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> This product is a gem! It smells amazing and works like a charm. We dry haired ladies so lucky it is around. I have blonde hair that is highlighted with platinum pieces and frequently styled with hot tools. This masque really re-conditions and strengthens my hair to a glory its never known, even when it was virgin. And boy does it shine! People have stopped to ask me how I got my hair so shiny and soft.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Started using this conditioner to give my curly hair more fluffy body in a carefree hairstyle - love how it conditions my hair.</li>
            <li> smells really bad for hair product, like medicine or sth.</li>
            <li> Used once, not sure if it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have ever used, if not the best! I have somewhat thick hair, and this conditioner actually gets the tangles out, easily. Plus, it does not weigh my hair down or leave any residue. It is meant to be used as a restorative masque, but I use it as a daily conditioner, leaving it in for only two minutes or so. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now, and it has not left any residue.    It is great to finally find a conditioner that enables me to run my fingers through my hair without feeling heavy or greasy. Plus, it makes my hair more shiny and bouncy.     I very rarely write reviews about products, but this stuff is fantastic and I want to be sure it stays on the market!     Anyone who gets tangles in their hair should try this product!</li>
            <li> Seems to dry the hair rather than moisturize it. Hmmm.</li>
            <li> It was alright. Smells good but my hair did not feel like I had used a deep conditioner. In the end I used the product as a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, but this product is great and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. My hair is usually thick, coarse and unmanageable. This product made it smooth, shiny and more straight.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a no-silicone conditioner that would help preserve my teal hair, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to do such fantastic things for my curls! About once a week, I mix this with coconut oil, smear it on wet hair, jam it all under a shower cap for warmth, and let it sit for an hour before rinsing. My curls are soft and springy! Good, rich conditioner for the price, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> even using once a week I hadn&#x27;t the results that I wanted. I have a dryed hair because of the staining and this product didn&#x27;t help it.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the salon brands but very conditioning, this masque is not so heavy that you can&#x27;t use it everytime you wash. I have long thick hair that&#x27;s slightly wavy but I like to wear it straight. I put this on for 2 - 3 minutes after washing, twice per week, and it gives me the right amount of conditioning.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s an amazing masque. It&#x27;s a good size and is relatively inexpensive considering the size and the amazing quality, It makes my hair so silky and shiny! OMG, you should at least try it! There are so many products out there that are extremely expensive and do nothing good. But решы stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, I love the way it makes my hair feel. Soft and healthy. Will def use again!</li>
            <li> It really conditions very well. my hair was very soft afterwards. Just comb through while in the shower very easy</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that will make my thin, but very curly hair do something other than frizz. I love the conditioner they use in the hair dye package, but they don&#x27;t sell it separately. So for many years I have looked for a conditioner that will do for my hair what the other product does in a much larger jar. Well, I found it in this product! My hair becomes soft, and the curls become very defined. I just use about a tablespoon in my hand and run it first through my bleached ends, and then through the rest of the hair - leave it on for 2 minutes for a regular condition, or 5 minutes for a deep conditioning. You will love it!</li>
            <li> The best!!!  I love this conditioner.  Since I started coloring my hair at 15, I have always been on the lookout for the magic conditioner that gives you soft, shiny, healthy hair.  I feel like I have tried them all (oil based, organic, expensive, from another country, etc.) but this really is the best.  L&#x27;Oreal, please, please don&#x27;t ever stop making this.  &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love the EverPure line, and the red lid stuff is my favorite of the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;. I use this one once a week to give my hair a little boost, and it never disappoints. Sadly for some reason my grocery store doesn&#x27;t carry this one anymore, only the gold one which I seriously dislike, so I will be ordering online from now on.</li>
            <li> Wow Amazing .Product! Works Almost as Well as My much More Expensive Brand Pureology! And Helps My Very Itchy Scalp Dermatitis! I Can only Use this Everpure and Pureology Love this at more than Half the Cost! And Very Very Fast Shipping! Thanks!(:</li>
            <li> This is a really great conditioner. I have SUPER dry hair and this actually makes it look smooth and hydrated. When I go without it, my hair returns to being dry and brittle. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have used this twice so far and the difference was apparent after the first use.  This really makes hair soft and smells de-light-ful!&lt;br /&gt;This is looking like it will be a permanent part of my hair washing routine.</li>
            <li> i have a lot of hair &amp; use this as a mask, takes about a third or half of the jar to cover my hair. I leave it in my hair for about an hour &amp; then I comb it out, it is buttery soft. My hair is long and bleached &amp; honestly takes about 2 hours to detangle, with this I can comb through my hair with no issues what so ever &amp; my hair feels so soft</li>
            <li> Wow! This works great.  I have naturally curly hair &amp; when I put it on my ends my hair looks great!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have bought this multiple times and I will buy it again and again. My hair is always in a different crazy color and this keeps it nice and silky. I&#x27;ve even recommended it to others! Sulfate-free is of course a plus. Be sure to use it with the matching shampoo!</li>
            <li> Wonderfull product! My wife! Love it so much!</li>
            <li> My hair is normally very frizzy and dry but after using this for the last month my hair is finally tame and there is no frizz! I have damaged my hair badly by going from bright red, to black, to blonde.... then to brown. My hair was completely fried and I was at a point I was going to cut my long hair off (hair is at my tail bone) but not anymore! My hair is nice, curly, soft, and always shiny! I just wish you got a bigger size for the price but this does wonders!!!</li>
            <li> This product gave me horrible alergies. I had my husband try it out as well and he also had horrible alergies in his back. We had to throw this product in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This is my new favourite conditioner. I&#x27;ve never tried anything that worked like this did. Conditioners usually just cover my hair in silicone and make it slick, which takes forever to rinse completely; But this conditioner rinses clean without the slick residue feeling. It rinses easily and quickly. It&#x27;s so light it&#x27;s perfect for people with oily scalps, it&#x27;s also good for damaged hair because it doesn&#x27;t cover your hair with thick chemicals that stress your hair. I love the way it smells, minty and herbal, very natural. I will continue buying this.</li>
            <li> I have been a Redken user for years. I decided to try this because it is sulfate free. It is the BEST conditioner I have ever used. Beats Redken hands down. My hair is thick, curly and unruly, this conditioner makes it soft, shiny and manageable. I use it with the shampoo and conditioner from the same line, this one 2X per week. I highly recommend, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product,  i will us it again.</li>
            <li> I color my hair almost every month. Over a period of time my hair has become dry and frizzy. This product works so much better than a normal conditioner. I used conditioner of same series by Loreal before. But Moisture Restorative Masque is what my hair was missing. It leaves my hair smooth and silky. I am a repeat buyer and have been using this product for few months now.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my hair feel soft (manageable) and looks great.  I seem to almost always receive a compliment on my hair after using this product.  I also love the light mint scent.</li>
            <li> Found the product to be not effective as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I read all the other reviews and agree.  My hair actually looks weightless after I use it...as if I&#x27;m walking around underwater.</li>
            <li> What is the difference btw the masque and the deep conditioner can any one tell me will be deeply thankful if anyone answers</li>
            <li> i color my hair about every month; this product really softens my hair. it has a chemically smell, but there&#x27;s also a mint smell that I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I had to return this product because of the terrible smell.  I just couldn&#x27;t stand applying something on my hair with such a strong bad smell.  I guess it&#x27;s just me, because my nose is very sensitive!!</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too much a fan of this one. I have long curly hair and know when a conditioner is doing a good job. I can tell by how much I need to put on when I&#x27;m combing my hair in the show. I haven&#x27;t had this long and I&#x27;m almost done with it. The EverStrong line coats my hair better. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the EverPure line again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair stylist said a mask might be beneficial due to my hair being so dry.  One application of this product, and my hair seemed to be much more healthy and hydrated!</li>
            <li> used in the past works great</li>
            <li> and works pretty good too! I&#x27;m terrible to my hair, I bleach, dye, dye again, heat straighten daily and my hair was showing it! I put this on in addition to the Evercreme line and *POOF!* My hair was bitchin&#x27;. It was like I had my own hair fairy.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does my hair look amazing, but some random hottie at the movies told me my hair smells amazing too! Double Score.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that good,I usually love Loreal products. But this doesn&#x27;t smell that good and doesn&#x27;t really conditioning your hair that well</li>
            <li> great for colored hair and it is light, does not weigh fine hair down</li>
            <li> i think thats what u get for 6 dollars!It makes your hair dry,unhealthy and hard.I couldnt wait to wash my hair out of it.Never experienced anything like this.I would give 3 stars to shampoo and cond. but not to this.&lt;br /&gt;Its just very cheap and bad quality,it makes your hair even worse.I think all good reviews come from Loreal....</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday, and used it on my hair this morning.  I left it in for the 5 minutes it recommends, and my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this silky and soft in I don&#x27;t know how long!  I have dark, chemically treated hair, about down to my mid-back.  I straighten my hair every day, so it sees a lot of heat on a regular basis.  After straightening my hair this morning (after using the product in the shower) you can&#x27;t even see the \\&quot;white split ends\\&quot; anymore!  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!  Will be reordering again and again!</li>
            <li> This conditioner may work best on normal hair. I have processed hair that has been colored and this restorative masque only makes my hair more shiny but not sufficiently conditioned. I other words my hair still feels a bit like straw. I find argon oil works better for my treated hair. I&#x27;d say this conditioner may work OK as a daily conditioner but I did not feel it very effective as a masque. I&#x27;m going to try adding argon oil to this product to see if it works better. I think it just needs a little bit of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> Prefer others but it&#x27;s a good sulfate free product</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner in order to help maintain moisture in my very dry hair. After several uses I did not notice any significant difference. I tried on my childrens hair as well and no real benefit for them either. I&#x27;m glad I tried the product but I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on anything, but this stuff is amazing!  The only thing I have found that saves my color damaged hair.  I was buying this locally, but have not been able to find it in the stores lately :(</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry curly hair and my child has curly and coarse hair.  This stuff helps loosen the hair while showering and makes hair easier to comb through.  It smells SO good, it&#x27;s my favorite scent of the different ones in this line.  I also bought the leave-in conditioning cream and it works very well.  Must try!</li>
            <li> I like the line EverPure line of L&#x27;Oreal. I use this masque once or twice a week. I like the scent, the silkiness and the smoothness of my hair after washing with it.</li>
            <li> Magic in a jar for a bargain price.</li>
            <li> My favorite deep conditioner. Leaves hair soft and silky and revives dry color-treated hair, especially when it&#x27;s nearly time to recolor.</li>
            <li> It has helped Healy damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular. Felt like a regular conditioner. I would like to note I have curly hair which can never get enough moisture but I didn&#x27;t feel that this did anymore than my john frieda conditioner. The smell was minty which I don&#x27;t mind but I was hoping for more of a fruity smell. I had another LOreal hair mask that I really enjoyed so I thought I would give this a try but the other one was much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Update - I think they changed the size container and if not the price sure was expensive.  Almost $10 for this container.  I really like it, but not sure to get again due to the expense.  There are others that are cheaper, find those and buy them having a $35 order instead.  I didn&#x27;t realize I bought the most expensive one.  It is worth $4-$5, but almost $10 is highway robbery for such a small container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for quite some time now and so I&#x27;m changing my review to 5 stars because it actually does improve your hair and the softness of my hair is amazing.  So by all means buy this, it really is worth it.</li>
            <li> What  a lovely smell.  Leaves the hair very soft.</li>
            <li> i really feel an improvement in my hair...and other people tell me its so soft too :) would purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if  L&#x27;Oreal changed the formula of this product, but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and this last delivery, I noticed the product seemed thinner and didn&#x27;t smell like it usually does. Because it wasn&#x27;t as thick, I had to use more. My daughter and I use this as a daily condition because we have chemically treated hair. I&#x27;m going to try buying this at Walmart and seeing if the product is the same as the one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I always love how soft and silky my hair feels after I color it and use the included &amp;#34;deep conditioner&amp;#34; but have never been able to find a product that replicates the performance of those little tubes. Until now! This makes me hair feel just like it-- soft, silky, no tangles, shiny. I love it!</li>
            <li> Makes my dry frizzy hair much more manageable.I use it as a daily since my hair is that thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Consistently is great for thick, wavy hair and it smells really good!  Very affordable, didn&#x27;t expect it to work this nicely for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> This masque is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my thick, colored, curly, damaged hair...and I&#x27;ve used Humectress for years! You only need a small amount of this and it leaves your hair feeling soft and vibrant, smooth and revitalized! Can&#x27;t say enough about it. Buy it and try it. You&#x27;ll like the lightweight feel and the great results!</li>
            <li> This saved my hair. And it lasts for ages even though it comes in a little tub. It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would remoisturize my hair after the beating it takes in the pool and sun every day.  I&#x27;m a daily outdoor swimmer, and sit in the sun every day, and live where it&#x27;s hot and humid year round.  My hair is baked and fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is simply awesome.  I put it on, and leave it sometimes for half an hour while I sit outside, rinse it out and my hair is renewed.  It leaves it soft, silky, shiney and full of body.  It&#x27;s like new hair after I use this.  I also love the soft fragrance.  It&#x27;s creamy and as soon as I put it in my hair I can feel my hair soften and relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a perfect cure for my split ends.  I have a head full of frizzy hair usually if I don&#x27;t use this.  There is no sign of frizz after I use this, and my hair stays super healthy.  I have used this for the past year, about once a week.  It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my parched, lifeless, dry hair.  It makes it like silk.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the conditioner…just have to wait a little longer for it to set</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Just as good as the pureology deep conditioner. I use this on my 6 and 4 year old. Their hair looks so healthy and no tangles in the morning!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is inexpensive but I love it.  I am Black but first borrowed it from one of my white girlfriends on a tennis weekend several years ago and I have never looked back.  It is now the only conditioner that I use.  It makes my coarse hair so soft so I can only imagine what it does for her hair.  It is really great!</li>
            <li> They no longer sell this in any stores around my house and I love it too much to let go of. I have very long hair that has been dyed for the past 15 years, so I use this instead of regular condition and leave it on for about 3 minutes each time. I really like that it conditions without grease.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair silky soft, but i havent used it long enough to see if it actually does what it says it dies.  If anything it is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I first colored my naturally blonde hair auburn I tried Redkin. It was a nightmare with my wavy texture. Not only is this great for my waves, but it really hold the red which is apparently notorious for fading. I use along with the EverPure Moisture shampoo and conditioner and am thrilled with the whole line. It leaves my hair tangle free, doesn&#x27;t flatten my waves, holds the color, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it for 4 months and it is wonderful, let my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> The best for your hear! smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> I am Asian American and have thick, dry hair. This product does what it claims to do and my hair was shinier after one use. But the scent of the cream was rather unpleasant and my hair turned out stiff and slightly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is big and would last a long time, and I don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s well worth the price, but I would not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still looking for my holy grail hair product...</li>
            <li> good~~~ my daily items. kkk</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on other reviews and I was expecting more results. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my hair got a bit better but I don&#x27;t see how this masque would be better than any other masque you find at a supermarket counter.</li>
            <li> Love this product, does wonders for my hair and smells great!</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped it would be.  It doesn&#x27;t work any better than some of the Loreal products in the same line that come in a large tube, it just costs more.</li>
            <li> I am normally a snob hair products goddess so it was a huge stretch for me to even order this item. However, it was a true delight. My hair was left soft after just one use.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a scientist but I can say for some reason this stuff works great.  Love it.  I have color treated med blonde hair. My hair is never dry after using it an very shiny.  Had to try some new things because of hard water and I can&#x27;t afford a water softener system for my home.  So buy more hair conditioning products it is.  Works just as well as salon products.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair often, swim (pool and ocean) often, I&#x27;m in the sun plenty and this stuff rocks!!  I have long hair, like past my bra straps, and maybe I get three treatments out of container.  I have slept in it.  It has a nice rosemary smell and my husband almost went down to couch he hated the smell so much.  But I like the smell.  Sometimes ill put it in and blow dry my hair a lil to really seal it in and then after it cools I wash with cold water. Ill but it again, sure!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It rejuvenates hair leaving it healthy and shiny. The only draw back is the perfume or fragrant smell which I have learned to live with. If you are sensitive to fragrance, you might want to try another L&#x27;Oreal product. The price point is fantastic!!! I have a drawer full of products that don&#x27;t come close to providing these results on color treated. Who would have thought an over the counter product could provide salon quality results. I only gave 4 stars due to the strong scent.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shine &amp; healthier after using this product. I used it once per week to keep it softer after excersise and sun.</li>
