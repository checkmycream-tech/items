            <li>My hair looks better after I use it.</li>
            <li>I ordered it here and was very excited because it was a quarter of the salon price.</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner for long colored hair I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a pleasant, light scent and it definitely does some good.  </li>
            <li>I just love it, it instantly make hair healthier, easy to brush and great looking.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found another product that works as well to reduce frizz and make hair look healthy and full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Goldwell color in my hair for many, many years, so it&#x27;s essential to use the appropriate products to maintain the color as best as possible.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using this.  </li>
            <li>Use on ends, and enjoy the results.</li>
            <li>this smells amazing, and I really do feel a difference in my hair after using it</li>
            <li>The Goldwell company spends a great deal of funds researching innovative technologies to make stellar hair products that actually do what is advertised.  </li>
            <li>I use it along with the Rich Repair shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and it makes my hair baby soft!!</li>
            <li>I am very interested in knowing the others products of this brand like shampoo and masks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchase this Goldwell conditioning treatment at my salon several times and it&#x27;s my all time favorite!</li>
            <li>Make hair feel so soft, full of body, silky and shine ,,, highly ecommended I Love It</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair naturally.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty pumped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, my hair is healthy and I only purchased this because I have a small amount of breakage in one section of my hair that I hoped this product could help with.</li>
            <li>While it is very moisturizing and helps smooth most of my hair, my ends are left dry and damaged.</li>
            <li>Really does leave the hair silky and shiny in 60 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Using heat on the hair really dries out my hair and this repair treatment</li>
            <li>hair is or let&#x27;s say was very stressed and dry.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>my hair is much, much smoother after I use it</li>
            <li>I was expecting a much thicker</li>
            <li>Instant silky smooth hair within seconds</li>
            <li>I have very curly mid-length hair that frizzes easily, and also gets dry.  </li>
            <li>It smoothed my hair just the way I expected and was easy to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended ...</li>
            <li>My hair was very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It left my hair dull and it kind of just fluffed out all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It only takes 60 seconds on the hair and the hair is much improved.  </li>
            <li>( that was my old fav)...</li>
            <li>Good product to help condition troubled hair.  </li>
            <li>To start, I gave to be honest and say the heavy perfume smell of this product was extremely overpowering.</li>
            <li>makes it much more manageable to comb out as well as dry less frizzy.</li>
            <li>The smell was different, much weaker, and it definitely didn&#x27;t feel the same on my hair.</li>
            <li>This product label is the same as the one I purchased at my professional salon, but the product does not look the same inside</li>
            <li>The product at the salon was exceptional, so I think I got a bad batch or a product that is not original and sold off maker from true manufacturer.</li>
            <li>My hair is perpetually over processed and dry and this applied once a week allows me to continue to live my gloriously bleached out life without feeling like I look trashy.</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s enough to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it really is repairing anything</li>
            <li> It did help that section lay flat, but the rest of my hair was a wreck.</li>
            <li> I expected to notice a change but haven&#x27;t noticed anything different and have been using weekly for several months.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy it again, but will be open to other products, as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because ir is similar to the other two products my stylist recommends it to help keep my color in and prevents my color from fading.</li>
            <li> I saw a recommendation for this product for dry and damaged hair, so I decided to check it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve processed hair to bring a level 4 to a level 10 leaving the hair to feel and look extremely stressed-out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While on my hair it felt like it was doing something, but once my hair dried it was not soft or shiny.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how thin it was.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a ton, just a little Scoopful, leave in for a minute and rinse out.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I need to leave it on longer, but the label says to leave it on for one minute, and I usually leave it on for around 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Maybe on hair that isn&#x27;t in such bad shape it would work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No happy, but didn&#x27;t break the bank, so I just kept it.</li>
            <li> I had a bad color done and it went dark, so my stylist had to use bleach to lighten my hair...</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>

            <li> It smoothed my hair just the way I expected and was easy to use in the shower.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Really does leave the hair silky and shiny in 60 seconds.  I use it along with the Rich Repair shampoo.  Love them both.</li>
            <li> Best hair mask ever. My hair is perpetually over processed and dry and this applied once a week allows me to continue to live my gloriously bleached out life without feeling like I look trashy. Smells divine, gloriously goopy and does what it says. Also cheaper than buying in stores so I&#x27;m pretty pumped.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this.  My hair smells amazing after using and.  Not sure if it really is repairing anything but it smells amazing.  I dye my hair often so I hope this is helping it stay healthy.</li>
            <li> It actually wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was. I thought it was leave-in conditioner so it was okay if you like that.</li>
            <li> This repair conditioner did a great job of making my hair silky, shiny and static free! Love it! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and this product is great for dry hair repair - my hairdresser uses it in her salon as well.  I have very curly mid-length hair that frizzes easily, and also gets dry.  This is a great once a week remedy.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner is just the best! I love how my hair feel after I use it!</li>

            <li> I love it. It helps detangles my hair and leaves a very pleasant smell and softness to my hair. I love Goldwell...</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for long colored hair I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;ve had Goldwell color in my hair for many, many years, so it&#x27;s essential to use the appropriate products to maintain the color as best as possible.  Using heat on the hair really dries out my hair and this repair treatment makes it much more manageable to comb out as well as dry less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I got introduced to this product in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is or let&#x27;s say was very stressed and dry.&lt;br /&gt;This rich repair is the absolute best treatment you can give your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended ... Make hair feel so soft, full of body, silky and shine ,,, highly ecommended I Love It</li>
            <li> The best treatment ever!!! And it only takes 60 seconds, I tend to leave it on for about 5 and my hair has that extra shine until I wash it again. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is scientifically formulated and not just because it says so.  The Goldwell company spends a great deal of funds researching innovative technologies to make stellar hair products that actually do what is advertised.  It only takes 60 seconds on the hair and the hair is much improved.  Not all deep conditioners can deliver the result that this product can and I have tried many of them on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time. I don&#x27;t use a ton, just a little Scoopful, leave in for a minute and rinse out. My hair instantly feels smoother and silkier- there&#x27;s quite a difference.</li>
            <li> Great product... there was plenty in the jar so it&#x27;s enough to last a long time.  Love the smell too</li>
            <li> The ingredients on this 60 second repair looks the same as the Dual Senses Conditioner but it&#x27;s SO NOT! This repair product truly repairs the hair from the inside out. I use this for my own hair and recommend this to people who process their hair. I&#x27;ve processed hair to bring a level 4 to a level 10 leaving the hair to feel and look extremely stressed-out. Using this product after processing then conditioning after this repair product is the absolute best results. This also tames regular curly or frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great seller!</li>
            <li> My hair was very soft and manageable. I am very interested in knowing the others products of this brand like shampoo and masks. love it!</li>

Maybe I need to leave it on longer, but the label says to leave it on for one minute, and I usually leave it on for around 3 minutes. It&#x27;s a good conditioner, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. It smells phenomenal though!</li>
            <li> I expected to notice a change but haven&#x27;t noticed anything different and have been using weekly for several months.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t imagine my hair routine without this product! I just love it, it instantly make hair healthier, easy to brush and great looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchase this Goldwell conditioning treatment at my salon several times and it&#x27;s my all time favorite! Love the smell and it makes my hair baby soft!!

The smell was different, much weaker, and it definitely didn&#x27;t feel the same on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, after my stylist recommended it.  I had a bad color done and it went dark, so my stylist had to use bleach to lighten my hair...after that, my already-dry hair felt like straw.  Goldwell 60 second treatment does work...my hair is much, much smoother after I use it and I like that it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of time.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that the results were earth-shattering, though.  Maybe on hair that isn&#x27;t in such bad shape it would work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a pleasant, light scent and it definitely does some good.  I will probably buy it again, but will be open to other products, as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. One jar lasts for years. Use on ends, and enjoy the results.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel somewhat niver, but this product is not going to change your world.</li>
            <li> To start, I gave to be honest and say the heavy perfume smell of this product was extremely overpowering. While it did not last in my hair, it did linger throughout my entire shower.&lt;br /&gt;Second I was surprised at how thin it was. I was expecting a much thicker consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While on my hair it felt like it was doing something, but once my hair dried it was not soft or shiny. It left my hair dull and it kind of just fluffed out all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, my hair is healthy and I only purchased this because I have a small amount of breakage in one section of my hair that I hoped this product could help with. It did help that section lay flat, but the rest of my hair was a wreck.</li>
            <li> this smells amazing, and I really do feel a difference in my hair after using it, it&#x27;s softer and more tamed. I have fine wavy hair naturally. Give it a try, great mask</li>
            <li> Great product for damage hair from hair coloring.</li>
            <li> This product label is the same as the one I purchased at my professional salon, but the product does not look the same inside and it just works ok. The product at the salon was exceptional, so I think I got a bad batch or a product that is not original and sold off maker from true manufacturer. Too bad. Amazon is normally very good about these things. No happy, but didn&#x27;t break the bank, so I just kept it.</li>
            <li> OMG! This is the best condition I have ever used and I have tried everything out there! Instant silky smooth hair within seconds, seriously impressive going to order more instantly! Better than anything Fekkai, better than Perfect 10 ( that was my old fav)... Etc</li>
            <li> Excellent product love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this because ir is similar to the other two products my stylist recommends it to help keep my color in and prevents my color from fading.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair looks better after I use it.</li>
