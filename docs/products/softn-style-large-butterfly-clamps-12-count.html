            <li>Built sturdy, good clips.</li>
            <li>good for clipping my hair up in the show...</li>
            <li>Plastic is best&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you need good clips or also need plastic for hair coloring, even the Sallys-type supply stores are not cheaper.</li>
            <li>Good for using when you are ironing/straightening your hair.</li>
            <li>Good grip.</li>
            <li>Good value clips.</li>
            <li>But these are just as good</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m delighted with them.  </li>
            <li>No bells and whistles, just good quality and functionality.</li>
            <li>These were surprisingly good.</li>
            <li>Good Price for the bulk.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this type of hair clip.</li>
            <li>These are a good buy considering the count and the price.</li>
            <li>I would buy again for the price and think I did get a good deal.</li>
            <li>and they work just as good as for the chip bag holders.</li>
            <li>It also does a good job of holding chunks of your hair at a time though.</li>
            <li>they are just perfect and exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Plus the price is great for how many you get.</li>
            <li>I am always buying more and these were great.</li>
            <li>love those things, great value.</li>
            <li>These are great, I needed more of these to do my hair because it&#x27;s getting longer.</li>
            <li>They work great and keep hair secure!</li>
            <li>Also stylish and very trendy too.</li>
            <li>Came in 3 days of purchase love it!</li>
            <li>I need more!</li>
            <li>I love these clips!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Good quality, and they hold my fine hair too!</li>
            <li>everything was fine with my order, I&#x27;m happy with them&lt;br /&gt;joy</li>
            <li>Real cheap cost.</li>
            <li>The price was great and free shipping with Prime Add On.  </li>
            <li>These come in handy when I am twisting my hair.</li>
            <li>Come in handy</li>
            <li>They are nice longer length, about 2.5 or three inches across.</li>
            <li>so hair stylist on my own hair.</li>
            <li>I liked about this product?</li>
            <li>Kind of flimsy, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shared them with family and all think they&#x27;re handy.  </li>
            <li>These are really nice.</li>
            <li>:) they hold my hair really good</li>
            <li>This product does that, but it feels just as sturdy as when you go to the salon - the hold is very strong.</li>
            <li>If I need more, I will for sure get these!</li>
            <li>This economy and Texas heatwave have me doing more of my own hair care rather than at a salon.</li>
            <li>I love that I got 12 of these, however they kind of snag at my hair everytime</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have shorter or very fine hair?</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed for a great price.</li>
            <li>The description said they were great for hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>very cheaply made scratches scalp</li>
            <li>I love them and will be letting my friends know where to find great hair accessories for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Nice easy colors.</li>
            <li>These are not as strong as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>But you may be better off trying to find this at a beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>They work perfect to hold back sections of my hair while I work on the rest.</li>
            <li>I love these clips.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they hold hair well without snagging.</li>
            <li>also love that they come in a dozen because I seem to misplace them quite often as well.</li>
            <li>buy more of these if more will be needed as it grows longer.</li>
            <li>I think a dozen will be ok to start on 4 inch, fine/thinner hair, for starters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like them much better than clip style hair holders which always manage to fall out of my hair.</li>
            <li>so, I share it with my baby girl and still keep our clamps seperate :)</li>
            <li>I love these clips.</li>
            <li>Hold of the clamps is okay.</li>
            <li>but okay in a pinch ( couldn&#x27;t resist the pun).</li>
            <li>I have a ton of hair and when styling need to separate my hair into many sections...</li>
            <li>I will be getting more soon.</li>
            <li>I love these clamps for when I take a shower it keeps my hair where it needs to be.</li>
            <li>Ok for its price.</li>
            <li>and I totally love them.</li>
            <li>I just wish I could afford more.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I have three two one more word....</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Better more quality selection there.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly at holding back the hair which I am not curling.  </li>
            <li>Would buy more.</li>
            <li>Friends with thicker hair love them though.  </li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t been able to).</li>
            <li>Really love these.</li>
            <li>i love them and they have lasted me for now going on 7 months.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, great price.  </li>
            <li>Very excited to get them.  </li>
            <li>These clips surprisingly hold up your hair very well!</li>
            <li>and so you can work more easily with another section of hair.  </li>
            <li>loved very good not easy to brook</li>
            <li>They work just fine. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>These clips are perfect when sectioning off hair that still wet</li>
            <li>I can easily clip portions of hair out of the way while  blow drying one section at a time.  </li>
            <li>if you have difficulty with your hands, you may find these easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>Easy Use</li>
            <li>Just as described and easy to use for separating the hair into sections.</li>
            <li>These are inexpensive and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>do their job but break easily</li>
            <li>But they hold well, and are fairly strong.  </li>
            <li>They have a strong clamp, not too strong for my weakened fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hurt and are durable and strong.</li>
            <li>These clips are strong and work well for me.  </li>
            <li>I have some that I have been using for a decade that are still going strong.</li>
            <li>I have to colour just the roots, so this is great to create the right size partitions and keep the sections out of the way till i am ready to colour them.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I think that they would be fine for someone with thinner, straighter hair than mine.  </li>
            <li>Arrived safely and quickly.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for attaching plastic to my raised garden bed to construct little mini greenhouses.</li>
            <li>These are great for keeping your hair pinned back or up.</li>
            <li>(Free delivery at this point!)&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>They grip securely and stay out of the way.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, but does the job.</li>
            <li>Yes, these are cheap.</li>
            <li>Sadly, cheap price means junk quality</li>
            <li>The best hair clips to firmly hold up all types of hair.</li>
            <li>For the price they&#x27;re great and they last forever unless you step on them.</li>
            <li>this is really cheap and flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li>But they are cheap</li>
            <li>Great clamps for keeping hair back when styling.</li>
            <li>but that is what you get for cheaply made product</li>
            <li>These are really cheaply made, but they do hold my hair up.</li>
            <li>These clips are very useful.</li>
            <li>Very handy when sectioning off my hair for various treatments and styling.</li>
            <li>These are very useful lots of hair salons use them...</li>
            <li>super easy to use</li>
            <li>the quality is good enough for the price they do bend a bit but don&#x27;t break easily which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>I ordered the clips to quickly throw back my hair or to separate it for styling, and they are great.</li>
            <li>I own a lot of butterfly chips, more than I can possibly keep up with.</li>
            <li>They are nothing special but they do the job.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re still nice clamps though although its pretty obvious they&#x27;re were cheaply made but they look nice and pretty</li>
            <li>They hold my thick hair in place, perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good enough for a student or home use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have extra just in case</li>
            <li>Overall, they are a good product.</li>
            <li>these clips come in handy for holding sectioned hair in place as I complete the process.</li>
            <li>I guess I was just hoping for a good clip that would hold my hair back.</li>
            <li>I only need 1 because they&#x27;re so good.</li>
            <li>I would really appreciate it :)</li>
            <li>Overall a good product</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s a good thing that they come in a big pack!</li>
            <li>for the price it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are great for use while styling or other needs like coloring but these are not for use once hair hair is styled.</li>
            <li>Item arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li>, worthy, without doubt, of 5 stars..</li>
            <li>Came quickly and looks just like the photo listed no isssues at all</li>
            <li>They cause no clip mark in hair and able to brush hair able for daily wear.</li>
            <li>No issues and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I love my new butterfly clips...</li>
            <li>Great item, made well with a softer plastic that bends slightly.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used clamps and they do make things easier!</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy and decent quality..try it for yourself</li>
            <li>Everything came shipped in perfect condition, nothing was broken.</li>
            <li>Maybe they are not premium, but still they are value for money and worth the price.</li>
            <li>These clips hold well and work for my younger daughter&#x27;s very fine hair and my older daughter&#x27;s very full hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for a few weeks now to section my hair when blow drying and they grip the hair very nicely.</li>
            <li>It was just the right size pack for me having the 12 count.</li>
            <li>unlike many other clips, these claws work great for my long, dense hair.</li>
            <li>the usual size butter fly clips.</li>
            <li>You get a good amount so you can style a smaller amount of hair holding wet hair safely in place.</li>
            <li>the price was good but not worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if these are what I would call &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;, but they are a nice size and large enough for me.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t made of as cheap of a plastic as some of the other ones and clean easily.</li>
            <li>The clips themselves feel a little flimsy but the hold is so good and the price is so good that I won&#x27;t be too upset if I have to rebuy them down the line.</li>
            <li>shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li>The next user may need more.</li>
            <li>Does the job but isn&#x27;t made from the most solid materials.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly need 12</li>
            <li>Maybe a smaller version of these would be better.  </li>
            <li>When they arrived I thought they looked &amp;#34;cheapy&amp;#34; but they are exactly what I needed when styling my girls&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know about clips for hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>the shipping cost more than the actual product!</li>
            <li>Would be able to get same quality from a dollar store.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off buying it at a local target for cheaper!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad it had only 2 colors.  </li>
            <li>Probably great for thick hair too</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future if needed.</li>
            <li>First time buying clips like these.</li>
            <li>Bought twice now because I lost the previous ones or others borrowed them and never returned because they loved them so much</li>
            <li>work way better than the long alligator clips</li>
            <li>not sure why this got good reviews.</li>
            <li>I love using these when styling my hair it helps hold the hair in sections when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li>Platinum blonde takes some strong bleach and some extended time.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for long or thick hair in terms of conditions and styling as well.</li>
            <li>large amounts of hair at once in almost any position&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;they hold large clumps of hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are large and they keep all of my hair out of the way.</li>
            <li>These clips are okay, they were cheaply made and wont last to long</li>
            <li>I bought these to hold my travel compact Remington electric rollers, they work so much better than the metal prongs that come with the set...... a super value for such a low cost!</li>
            <li>Product shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>So although I gave them three stars for working, I still don&#x27;t want to use them very often.</li>
            <li>I really needed to get these since my hair has grown to the point that I need to section it off during shampoo days.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hold up any hair and are so cheaply made, they are all crooked.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>They wont hold too much hair</li>
            <li>These have really made blow drying a lot</li>
            <li>It was a nightmare because my hair would fall out of the holes of the clip while I was trying to keep the straight hair separate from the curly hair.</li>
            <li>They really grip and hold the hair into place until I decide to remove the clip.</li>
            <li>and they really help with sectioning the hair.</li>
            <li>Hey, these clips do what they are supposed to do and are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Shipper was fast</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really expect much.</li>
            <li>and they work very well.  </li>
            <li>VERY  </li>
            <li>THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;</li>
            <li>They are very well made, and seem durable.  </li>
            <li>These hair clips really keep your hair up.  </li>
            <li>Great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>These butterfly clamps holds my hair out of my way very well when I am styling my hair.</li>
            <li>I have had them for the past 3 years and they are still as good as new.</li>
            <li>Of course they hold well and are great when keeping flat ironed hair in place as I complete the other sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I had to buy about $30 worth of other stuff on Amazon just to add this one item that I originally wanted.</li>
            <li>They would be \\&quot;okay\\&quot; for hair - as long as you are okay with occassional breakage (they are not heavy- or even medium-duty).</li>
            <li>They break easy though but to be expected.</li>
            <li>I use them mainly to separate my hair while detangling it.</li>
            <li>ALL is worthy, its that simple sometimes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the company selling these think large is supposed to be, but I was hoping for something more like a &amp;#</li>
            <li>They may hold for a bit but loosens up very quickly since the teeth on these clips are shorter than some other brands.</li>
            <li>I use these clips everyday and I love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are normal plastic</li>
            <li>These are great even if you have long  thick hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheaper than the clips you buy at CVS or Walgreens, and pretty much do the same job.</li>
            <li>but hey they were only like $3.00 right.</li>
            <li>but I guess I should not have expected anything more for the low price they are sold at.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re strong, durable hair clips that hold tight for any hair procedure.</li>
            <li>not very big so doesnt hold as much hair as i expected, plus it does not hold the hair securely.</li>
            <li>Cheap clips, not very strong but</li>
            <li>but I have thin long hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>I have thick long hair, so at times I needed to use more than one clip, but it was still worth it to buy these.</li>
            <li>Love the black and white colors</li>
            <li>They do feel a little cheap though</li>
            <li>Adds a professional touch.</li>
            <li>So far they are all in text and haven&#x27;t fallen apart.</li>
            <li>I HAVE A NATURAL KINKY 4C HAIR TYPE</li>
            <li>You get a whole lot of clips that help you create different hairstyles.</li>
            <li>They hold sections of my hair whether it&#x27;s straightened or natural without breaking or getting tangled.</li>
            <li>The even survived my 6 year old playing with them when I wasn&#x27;t looking.</li>
            <li>They are made of a soft plastic.</li>
            <li>They can be had to squeeze open because the springs are pretty tight but that&#x27;s exactly what you need when looking for clamps.</li>
            <li>Definately what i expected, nothing more and nothing less.</li>
            <li>With these my hair is held in place till I am ready to dry that portion and now my hair looks professionally styled using these.</li>
            <li>Exactly what&#x27;s expected...</li>
            <li>Not cheap like some others, in the fact that  it  has a nice tight grip.</li>
            <li>They are strong and thick so I am not worried about breaking them.</li>
            <li>There are more then enough, and they&#x27;re small enough to use for hairstyles.</li>
            <li>I need to start reading the product descriptions on Amazon more carefully - I bought these because they said &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; clamps when in fact I would consider these small.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no slipping, falling, breaking, or popping off.</li>
            <li>But for the sake of my feet, I&#x27;ll just go back to using soft hair ties.</li>
            <li>I love the clips, however when they arrived there was one broken.</li>
            <li>so they are kind of useless to me unless I am dying or styling my hair.</li>
            <li>They have a nice tight hold and keep my hair firmly in place… Which is fantastic, because I have thick, curly, UNRULY hair!</li>
            <li>They are strong to hold thick hair, especially if you have a lot.</li>
            <li>Not true - they are too flimsy for hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>Apparently these are like only $1 if you can find them in the store</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and not a lot, but these clips don&#x27;t hold barely any hair</li>
            <li>Have to use smaller sections if you have super thick hair.</li>
            <li>This size was ok, but the thin plastic used and the the spring makes for limited use.</li>

            <li> Built sturdy, good clips.</li>
            <li> good for clipping my hair up in the show...</li>
            <li> Plastic is best&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you need good clips or also need plastic for hair coloring, even the Sallys-type supply stores are not cheaper.</li>
            <li> Good for using when you are ironing/straightening your hair.</li>
            <li> Good grip.</li>
            <li> Good value clips.</li>

            <li> Good Price for the bulk.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this type of hair clip.</li>
            <li> These are a good buy considering the count and the price.</li>
            <li> I would buy again for the price and think I did get a good deal.</li>
            <li> and they work just as good as for the chip bag holders.</li>
            <li> It also does a good job of holding chunks of your hair at a time though.</li>
            <li> they are just perfect and exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Plus the price is great for how many you get.</li>
            <li> I am always buying more and these were great.</li>
            <li> love those things, great value.</li>

            <li> I need more!</li>
            <li> I love these clips!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Good quality, and they hold my fine hair too!</li>
            <li> everything was fine with my order, I&#x27;m happy with them&lt;br /&gt;joy</li>
            <li> Real cheap cost.</li>
            <li> The price was great and free shipping with Prime Add On.  </li>
            <li> These come in handy when I am twisting my hair.</li>
            <li> Come in handy</li>
            <li> They are nice longer length, about 2.5 or three inches across.</li>
            <li> so hair stylist on my own hair.</li>
            <li> I liked about this product?</li>
            <li> Kind of flimsy, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shared them with family and all think they&#x27;re handy.  </li>
            <li> These are really nice.</li>
            <li> :) they hold my hair really good</li>
            <li> This product does that, but it feels just as sturdy as when you go to the salon - the hold is very strong.</li>
            <li> If I need more, I will for sure get these!</li>
            <li> This economy and Texas heatwave have me doing more of my own hair care rather than at a salon.</li>
            <li> I love that I got 12 of these, however they kind of snag at my hair everytime</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have shorter or very fine hair?</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed for a great price.</li>
            <li> The description said they were great for hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> very cheaply made scratches scalp</li>
            <li> I love them and will be letting my friends know where to find great hair accessories for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Nice easy colors.</li>
            <li> These are not as strong as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> But you may be better off trying to find this at a beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> They work perfect to hold back sections of my hair while I work on the rest.</li>
            <li> I love these clips.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they hold hair well without snagging.</li>
            <li> also love that they come in a dozen because I seem to misplace them quite often as well.</li>
            <li> buy more of these if more will be needed as it grows longer.</li>
            <li> I think a dozen will be ok to start on 4 inch, fine/thinner hair, for starters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like them much better than clip style hair holders which always manage to fall out of my hair.</li>
            <li> so, I share it with my baby girl and still keep our clamps seperate :)</li>
            <li> I love these clips.</li>
            <li> Hold of the clamps is okay.</li>
            <li> but okay in a pinch ( couldn&#x27;t resist the pun).</li>
            <li> I have a ton of hair and when styling need to separate my hair into many sections...</li>
            <li> I will be getting more soon.</li>
            <li> I love these clamps for when I take a shower it keeps my hair where it needs to be.</li>
            <li> Ok for its price.</li>
            <li> and I totally love them.</li>
            <li> I just wish I could afford more.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I have three two one more word....</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Better more quality selection there.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly at holding back the hair which I am not curling.  </li>
            <li> Would buy more.</li>
            <li> Friends with thicker hair love them though.  </li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t been able to).</li>
            <li> Really love these.</li>
            <li> i love them and they have lasted me for now going on 7 months.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, great price.  </li>
            <li> Very excited to get them.  </li>
            <li> These clips surprisingly hold up your hair very well!</li>
            <li> and so you can work more easily with another section of hair.  </li>
            <li> loved very good not easy to brook</li>
            <li> They work just fine. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These clips are perfect when sectioning off hair that still wet</li>
            <li> I can easily clip portions of hair out of the way while  blow drying one section at a time.  </li>
            <li> if you have difficulty with your hands, you may find these easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> Easy Use</li>
            <li> Just as described and easy to use for separating the hair into sections.</li>
            <li> These are inexpensive and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> do their job but break easily</li>
            <li> But they hold well, and are fairly strong.  </li>
            <li> They have a strong clamp, not too strong for my weakened fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hurt and are durable and strong.</li>
            <li> These clips are strong and work well for me.  </li>
            <li> I have some that I have been using for a decade that are still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have to colour just the roots, so this is great to create the right size partitions and keep the sections out of the way till i am ready to colour them.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I think that they would be fine for someone with thinner, straighter hair than mine.  </li>
            <li> Arrived safely and quickly.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for attaching plastic to my raised garden bed to construct little mini greenhouses.</li>
            <li> These are great for keeping your hair pinned back or up.</li>
            <li> (Free delivery at this point!)&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> They grip securely and stay out of the way.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Yes, these are cheap.</li>
            <li> Sadly, cheap price means junk quality</li>
            <li> The best hair clips to firmly hold up all types of hair.</li>
            <li> For the price they&#x27;re great and they last forever unless you step on them.</li>
            <li> this is really cheap and flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> But they are cheap</li>
            <li> Great clamps for keeping hair back when styling.</li>
            <li> but that is what you get for cheaply made product</li>
            <li> These are really cheaply made, but they do hold my hair up.</li>
            <li> These clips are very useful.</li>
            <li> Very handy when sectioning off my hair for various treatments and styling.</li>

            <li> super easy to use</li>
            <li> the quality is good enough for the price they do bend a bit but don&#x27;t break easily which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered the clips to quickly throw back my hair or to separate it for styling, and they are great.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of butterfly chips, more than I can possibly keep up with.</li>
            <li> They are nothing special but they do the job.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re still nice clamps though although its pretty obvious they&#x27;re were cheaply made but they look nice and pretty</li>
            <li> They hold my thick hair in place, perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good enough for a student or home use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have extra just in case</li>
            <li> Overall, they are a good product.</li>
            <li> these clips come in handy for holding sectioned hair in place as I complete the process.</li>
            <li> I guess I was just hoping for a good clip that would hold my hair back.</li>
            <li> I only need 1 because they&#x27;re so good.</li>
            <li> I would really appreciate it :)</li>
            <li> Overall a good product</li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s a good thing that they come in a big pack!</li>
            <li> for the price it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are great for use while styling or other needs like coloring but these are not for use once hair hair is styled.</li>
            <li> Item arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li> , worthy, without doubt, of 5 stars..</li>
            <li> Came quickly and looks just like the photo listed no isssues at all</li>
            <li> They cause no clip mark in hair and able to brush hair able for daily wear.</li>
            <li> No issues and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I love my new butterfly clips...</li>
            <li> Great item, made well with a softer plastic that bends slightly.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used clamps and they do make things easier!</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy and decent quality..try it for yourself</li>
            <li> Everything came shipped in perfect condition, nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> Maybe they are not premium, but still they are value for money and worth the price.</li>
            <li> These clips hold well and work for my younger daughter&#x27;s very fine hair and my older daughter&#x27;s very full hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a few weeks now to section my hair when blow drying and they grip the hair very nicely.</li>
            <li> It was just the right size pack for me having the 12 count.</li>
            <li> unlike many other clips, these claws work great for my long, dense hair.</li>
            <li> the usual size butter fly clips.</li>
            <li> You get a good amount so you can style a smaller amount of hair holding wet hair safely in place.</li>
            <li> the price was good but not worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are what I would call &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;, but they are a nice size and large enough for me.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t made of as cheap of a plastic as some of the other ones and clean easily.</li>
            <li> The clips themselves feel a little flimsy but the hold is so good and the price is so good that I won&#x27;t be too upset if I have to rebuy them down the line.</li>
            <li> shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li> The next user may need more.</li>
            <li> Does the job but isn&#x27;t made from the most solid materials.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly need 12</li>
            <li> Maybe a smaller version of these would be better.  </li>
            <li> When they arrived I thought they looked &amp;#34;cheapy&amp;#34; but they are exactly what I needed when styling my girls&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know about clips for hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> the shipping cost more than the actual product!</li>
            <li> Would be able to get same quality from a dollar store.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off buying it at a local target for cheaper!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad it had only 2 colors.  </li>
            <li> Probably great for thick hair too</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future if needed.</li>
            <li> First time buying clips like these.</li>
            <li> Bought twice now because I lost the previous ones or others borrowed them and never returned because they loved them so much</li>
            <li> work way better than the long alligator clips</li>
            <li> not sure why this got good reviews.</li>
            <li> I love using these when styling my hair it helps hold the hair in sections when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Platinum blonde takes some strong bleach and some extended time.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for long or thick hair in terms of conditions and styling as well.</li>
            <li> large amounts of hair at once in almost any position&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;they hold large clumps of hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are large and they keep all of my hair out of the way.</li>
            <li> These clips are okay, they were cheaply made and wont last to long</li>
            <li> I bought these to hold my travel compact Remington electric rollers, they work so much better than the metal prongs that come with the set...... a super value for such a low cost!</li>
            <li> Product shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> So although I gave them three stars for working, I still don&#x27;t want to use them very often.</li>
            <li> I really needed to get these since my hair has grown to the point that I need to section it off during shampoo days.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold up any hair and are so cheaply made, they are all crooked.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> They wont hold too much hair</li>
            <li> These have really made blow drying a lot</li>
            <li> It was a nightmare because my hair would fall out of the holes of the clip while I was trying to keep the straight hair separate from the curly hair.</li>
            <li> They really grip and hold the hair into place until I decide to remove the clip.</li>
            <li> and they really help with sectioning the hair.</li>
            <li> Hey, these clips do what they are supposed to do and are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Shipper was fast</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really expect much.</li>
            <li> and they work very well.  </li>
            <li> VERY  </li>
            <li> THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;</li>
            <li> They are very well made, and seem durable.  </li>
            <li> These hair clips really keep your hair up.  </li>
            <li> Great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li> These butterfly clamps holds my hair out of my way very well when I am styling my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had them for the past 3 years and they are still as good as new.</li>
            <li> Of course they hold well and are great when keeping flat ironed hair in place as I complete the other sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I had to buy about $30 worth of other stuff on Amazon just to add this one item that I originally wanted.</li>
            <li> They would be \\&quot;okay\\&quot; for hair - as long as you are okay with occassional breakage (they are not heavy- or even medium-duty).</li>
            <li> They break easy though but to be expected.</li>
            <li> I use them mainly to separate my hair while detangling it.</li>
            <li> ALL is worthy, its that simple sometimes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the company selling these think large is supposed to be, but I was hoping for something more like a &amp;#</li>
            <li> They may hold for a bit but loosens up very quickly since the teeth on these clips are shorter than some other brands.</li>
            <li> I use these clips everyday and I love them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are normal plastic</li>
            <li> These are great even if you have long  thick hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheaper than the clips you buy at CVS or Walgreens, and pretty much do the same job.</li>
            <li> but hey they were only like $3.00 right.</li>
            <li> but I guess I should not have expected anything more for the low price they are sold at.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re strong, durable hair clips that hold tight for any hair procedure.</li>
            <li> not very big so doesnt hold as much hair as i expected, plus it does not hold the hair securely.</li>
            <li> Cheap clips, not very strong but</li>
            <li> but I have thin long hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair, so at times I needed to use more than one clip, but it was still worth it to buy these.</li>
            <li> Love the black and white colors</li>
            <li> They do feel a little cheap though</li>
            <li> Adds a professional touch.</li>
            <li> So far they are all in text and haven&#x27;t fallen apart.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A NATURAL KINKY 4C HAIR TYPE</li>
            <li> You get a whole lot of clips that help you create different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> They hold sections of my hair whether it&#x27;s straightened or natural without breaking or getting tangled.</li>
            <li> The even survived my 6 year old playing with them when I wasn&#x27;t looking.</li>
            <li> They are made of a soft plastic.</li>
            <li> They can be had to squeeze open because the springs are pretty tight but that&#x27;s exactly what you need when looking for clamps.</li>
            <li> Definately what i expected, nothing more and nothing less.</li>
            <li> With these my hair is held in place till I am ready to dry that portion and now my hair looks professionally styled using these.</li>
            <li> Exactly what&#x27;s expected...</li>
            <li> Not cheap like some others, in the fact that  it  has a nice tight grip.</li>
            <li> They are strong and thick so I am not worried about breaking them.</li>
            <li> There are more then enough, and they&#x27;re small enough to use for hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I need to start reading the product descriptions on Amazon more carefully - I bought these because they said &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; clamps when in fact I would consider these small.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no slipping, falling, breaking, or popping off.</li>
            <li> But for the sake of my feet, I&#x27;ll just go back to using soft hair ties.</li>
            <li> I love the clips, however when they arrived there was one broken.</li>
            <li> so they are kind of useless to me unless I am dying or styling my hair.</li>
            <li> They have a nice tight hold and keep my hair firmly in place… Which is fantastic, because I have thick, curly, UNRULY hair!</li>
            <li> They are strong to hold thick hair, especially if you have a lot.</li>
            <li> Not true - they are too flimsy for hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> Apparently these are like only $1 if you can find them in the store</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and not a lot, but these clips don&#x27;t hold barely any hair</li>
            <li> Have to use smaller sections if you have super thick hair.</li>
            <li> This size was ok, but the thin plastic used and the the spring makes for limited use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re large enough to hold my hair out of the way when I curl it, but small enough that I can separate my hair into sections.</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re flat ironing, curling, washing or deep conditioning, it helps keep your hair out of your way when needed.</li>
            <li> It made my life easier when separating my hair, prior to flat ironing.</li>
            <li> my hair is real thick and hard to part when i am greasing it, but with these clamps here, greasing my hair is sweet!!!</li>
            <li> They are too small for how much hair I have.</li>
            <li> Looks like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> On the plus size, they do hold my hair well, but I need several of them to work since I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I use these clips to seperate my hair to flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I use these about 3 times a week when I flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t expect them to last too long because of their quality....</li>
            <li> I use them to hold the sections up when I blow dry or flat iron it.</li>
            <li> i got a lot for my money i use them everyday on my natural hair whether i am doing braid or a twist out</li>
            <li> I like the long length of these clamps</li>
            <li> If you have thick curly natural hair ( I am African American) then you may be in for a bit of a wrestle.</li>
            <li> These hold my hair really well and don&#x27;t get stuck in my longish, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting 6 black and 6 white as the description and picture showed, and I got purple and blue :</li>
            <li> Very thin cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> My very long hair requires a lot of sectioning when styling it and these clips</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, so I twist a section around in a pincurl before clipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doubt they will hold up very long for my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use when for when I color my hair, blow dry or need to clip up my hair when I curl it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m waiting for it to dry, during coloring, or when I am curling it.</li>
            <li> so the underside can dry.</li>
            <li> These clips did not work very well for me - first of all because they were not what I thought they were, so my bad.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, since they&#x27;re plastic, you can use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> and you get six white and six black ones in the pack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went to Ulta today and saw the same ones but cheaper and in black and pink though.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these at other retailers in store previously and they didn&#x27;t last a month before breaking.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last...</li>
            <li> as expected, nothing to complain about</li>
            <li> They have held up even though I&#x27;m not gentle on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do what is expected, they clip my hair up while conditioning, and they hold all my hair snuggly. &#x27;</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use when my hair is wet</li>
            <li> Be careful with these.</li>
            <li> measure almost 3 inches wide and hold a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> works as expected for coloring , conditioning sessions</li>
            <li> not really strong enough to keep hair in place</li>
            <li> This holds the hair in place while you work on other parts.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind using them on a day to day basis, but the corners are WAY TOO SHARP.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, but the plastic is flimsy and sharp.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected and I am pleases with this order!</li>
            <li> I just needed clips to keep my hair out of my face when I straighten other parts.</li>
            <li> My other classmates even ask to use them.</li>
            <li> use them on my hair when styling to divide/section it and use them at other times too when i just want to do my hair up.</li>
            <li> What I expected butterfly clips to be like!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t need the other 4.</li>
            <li> Secondly, my hair is too thick for the clips to hold.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wooden clothes pins would be less than half this price and stronger.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in the cheap plastic feel of these.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair &amp; use these when sectioning my hair.</li>
            <li> This works out well as the clips grasp the hair tightly.</li>
            <li> They clamp tight and stay where to you them.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with clips not holding my heavy thick long hair up...</li>
            <li> a little disappoint</li>
            <li> just wish i had waited a little before buying them seeing as how the difference in price change</li>
            <li> and I have no problems using them to hold a little or a lot of my hair.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy little devils.  </li>
            <li> The clips are a little flimsy and on the cheaper side.</li>
            <li> They feel a little weaker than others I have had</li>
            <li> They were sturdy enough to hold my very thick hair with no problems.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and there are enough to grab the strands that try to fall out without being bulky!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re messy like me, these little bastards will surprise you out of no where and hurt your feet because you&#x27;ll probably have a few laying around somewhere on your floor.</li>
            <li> and I need to use atleast 2 of them when drying my hair with a round brush.</li>
            <li> but I only have thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is hard to dry without clamps.</li>
            <li> They are weak and they snag your hair and pull because of the rough hewn edges of the teeth.</li>
            <li> Yes, you may think the are worthless and breakable but they are just as good as those expensive ones you are looking at!</li>
            <li> and I was a little puzzled whether they were going to work on my thick hair or not</li>
            <li> /&gt;none have broken&lt;br /&gt;thinking of buying a set of the small ones, too</li>
            <li> I have to clip small sections of my hair because the clips doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of my hair.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of clips for the price, but the quality just isn&#x27;t there--rough plastic edges and not a very good design.  </li>
            <li> These clips hardly hold my hair in place while I am drying another section.</li>
            <li> These should have somewhat pointed edges to grasp the hair but these are dull and rounded.  </li>
            <li> No fear of the clips snapping and breaking that can happen with a hard plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find a beauty and cosmetics store, or even make it out to hunt for one.</li>
            <li> Like, boarding on that hard plastic and a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Purchased these clips because I am working with my daughters&#x27; hair a lot lately.</li>
            <li> Need at least two to get the job done, which detracts from the utility of them.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length medium thick hair</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and they seem to hold it</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and there is a lot of it, these clips help to style just like my hair dresser does in the salon.  </li>
            <li> They do not hold that well with thick hair.</li>
            <li> They are very small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and use them for clipping up any hair texture from thin to thick.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and like to segment it while drying.</li>
            <li> These butterfly clamps hold my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t vouch for how they will work on very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It was frustrating that it was an add on item</li>
            <li> I have thin hair though</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t broken any in months of use.</li>
            <li> I will say that I do have thin hair</li>
            <li> but I still haven&#x27;t broken one.</li>
            <li> Poor quality plastic material</li>
            <li> They hold up well for me, have had them for almost a year and none have broken.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing</li>
            <li> It was expensive with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very weak and cheap-I threw them away!</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These clips did not work very well for me - first of all because they were not what I thought they were, so my bad.  Secondly, my hair is too thick for the clips to hold.  I think that they would be fine for someone with thinner, straighter hair than mine.  If my hair was different I probably would have added a star to my rating.  They arrived as promised in good condition.</li>
            <li> loved very good not easy to brook</li>
            <li> These come in handy when I am twisting my hair. I will be ordering another set. I wished they held tighter, but they definitely get the job done.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing but then i thought what the hell.  But they hold well, and are fairly strong.  Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed for a great price. I love them and will be letting my friends know where to find great hair accessories for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This holds the hair in place while you work on other parts.  Adds a professional touch. Product shipped fast.  But you may be better off trying to find this at a beauty supply store.  It was expensive with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> as expected, nothing to complain about</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and I like to use them to section my hair off while blow drying it.  My hair has yet to become tangled in them and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use when for when I color my hair, blow dry or need to clip up my hair when I curl it. These clips will not hold a lot of hair so I twist my hair and have the clip hold the end. This works out well as the clips grasp the hair tightly. I am not concerned about the clips breaking. They have held up even though I&#x27;m not gentle on them.&lt;br /&gt;My hair does at times get caught in the teeth but slips out easily.&lt;br /&gt;These are great for use while styling or other needs like coloring but these are not for use once hair hair is styled. They will not work as a claw clip to wear out. Thought I would put that in my review as some might thing that is the purpose of these clips. They are holding hair up during procedures or while styling.</li>
            <li> i got mines for aroung $5 dollar before that pirce drop so im a little disappoint but they&#x27;re still nice clamps though although its pretty obvious they&#x27;re were cheaply made but they look nice and pretty and i have use it a couple of times and will continue to use i just wish i had waited a little before buying them seeing as how the difference in price change</li>
            <li> I always used these to pull my hair up, especially when straightening my hair to help know where I havent straightened and where I have. Couldn&#x27;t find them at  walmart or target so I ordered these. They work just fine. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Good product I use them often</li>
            <li> These are great!  And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  They don&#x27;t leave creases in my hair while I&#x27;m styling but they keep my hair put while I section it off.  These are a must have!</li>
            <li> From applying my leave-in conditioner in sections to the application of my curly hair-dressing products, these clips are the bee&#x27;s knees. They&#x27;ve got amazing, perfect hold. There&#x27;s no slipping, falling, breaking, or popping off. I only needed 1 pack. My hair is shoulder-length. The next user may need more. Nevertheless, a must have for anyone who has a lot of regimen ahead of them and no patience for clippies and sticking a comb in the hair.</li>
            <li> They do what is expected, they clip my hair up while conditioning, and they hold all my hair snuggly. &#x27;Nuff said. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> They look cheap, but they work great! Come in handy and I need to use atleast 2 of them when drying my hair with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use when my hair is wet and I&#x27;m waiting for it to dry, during coloring, or when I am curling it. They work perfect to hold back sections of my hair while I work on the rest. They are strong and thick so I am not worried about breaking them. I have shoulder length medium thick hair and I have no problems using them to hold a little or a lot of my hair. It was just the right size pack for me having the 12 count. Arrived safely and quickly. Great bargain for the quantity and quality of what you get. I have purchased these at other retailers in store previously and they didn&#x27;t last a month before breaking. Having dropped these and leaving them in my purse daily I haven&#x27;t had one break yet.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great pricing!</li>
            <li> Does the job but isn&#x27;t made from the most solid materials. Be careful with these.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find these in the store anymore!  Very excited to get them.  I don&#x27;t like the ones that are curved.  These are great for keeping your hair pinned back or up.</li>
            <li> I love these clips. Once in your hair,  they never move and they won&#x27;t pull out your hair or get tangled in you&#x27;re hair either.</li>
            <li> I have had them for the past 3 years and they are still as good as new. They hold my thick hair in place, perfectly. They are really good quality. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Overpriced compared to local shop. Good enough for a student or home use.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in the cheap plastic feel of these. This is truly a reminder that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my shorter hair style.  Lightweight, also.  First time I&#x27;ve used clamps and they do make things easier!</li>
            <li> Very weak and cheap-I threw them away! I have short hair and wanted them to hold back sections while I touch up my roots-they kept falling out. I had no problems with the seller, just with the product. Wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
            <li> Item arrived really quickly. It was frustrating that it was an add on item so I had to buy about $30 worth of other stuff on Amazon just to add this one item that I originally wanted. Then when i recieved the product I discovered that the clips are actually smaller than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> unlike many other clips, these claws work great for my long, dense hair. you can find them at Sally Beauty Supply for [...] bucks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly need 12 but I have thin long hair and it works great. It&#x27;s good to have extra just in case I lose it or have family or friends come over and need one.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of clips for the price, but the quality just isn&#x27;t there--rough plastic edges and not a very good design.  I have a lot of hair to keep up and these just don&#x27;t do the job.  Maybe if you have shorter or very fine hair?</li>
            <li> These clips are your standard beauty supply clip. They aren&#x27;t the best made and they aren&#x27;t the worst made. I wouldn&#x27;t mind using them on a day to day basis, but the corners are WAY TOO SHARP. You can hurt people with these! So although I gave them three stars for working, I still don&#x27;t want to use them very often.</li>
            <li> I really needed to get these since my hair has grown to the point that I need to section it off during shampoo days. (I do this to prevent tangles) I love the fact that they hold hair well without snagging. Additionally, since they&#x27;re plastic, you can use on wet or dry hair. Whether you&#x27;re flat ironing, curling, washing or deep conditioning, it helps keep your hair out of your way when needed. Plus the price is great for how many you get.</li>
            <li> I like these butterfly clips, but they do get in the way sometimes if you don&#x27;t position it correctly.  Maybe a smaller version of these would be better.  Overall, they are a good product.</li>
            <li> I use these clips everyday and I love them. I have extremely thick hair and they seem to hold it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that they come in a dozen because I seem to misplace them quite often as well.</li>
            <li> This economy and Texas heatwave have me doing more of my own hair care rather than at a salon. Whether deep conditioning treatments or dyeing my hair these clips come in handy for holding sectioned hair in place as I complete the process. Of course they hold well and are great when keeping flat ironed hair in place as I complete the other sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use them when clipping my ponytail twist up out of the way.</li>
            <li> These plastic butterfly don&#x27;t do their job. I have very thick hair and like to segment it while drying. These clips hardly hold my hair in place while I am drying another section. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in these. They are very small.  Nit the usual size butter fly clips.</li>
            <li> Pretty basic clips but exactly what I need for complicated blow drying.</li>
            <li> Good butterfly hair clips, as shown and described.&lt;br /&gt;They are normal plastic and you get six white and six black ones in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;They measure almost 3 inches wide and hold a lot of hair. Real cheap cost.</li>
            <li> Purchased these clips because I am working with my daughters&#x27; hair a lot lately. These clips hold well and work for my younger daughter&#x27;s very fine hair and my older daughter&#x27;s very full hair. When they arrived I thought they looked &amp;#34;cheapy&amp;#34; but they are exactly what I needed when styling my girls&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Great price and great quality. I&#x27;ve been using them for a few weeks now to section my hair when blow drying and they grip the hair very nicely.</li>
            <li> They do the job they are supposed to.  No fuss and no muss.  I use them for when I need to keep a layer of hair out of the way.</li>
            <li> Built sturdy, good clips. Just like the clips you see in a beauty salon.  Looks like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Well they are hair clips...and they definately work. Definately what i expected, nothing more and nothing less. great for sectioning hair and keeping hair out of the way</li>
            <li> These are just great. There are more then enough, and they&#x27;re small enough to use for hairstyles. I use them mainly to separate my hair while detangling it.</li>
            <li> great for what i need them for</li>
            <li> I own a lot of butterfly chips, more than I can possibly keep up with. I am always buying more and these were great. They aren&#x27;t made of as cheap of a plastic as some of the other ones and clean easily.</li>
            <li> good for clipping my hair up in the show...after conditioning...i like this clip, it&#x27;s easy and decent quality..try it for yourself</li>
            <li> It is great for separating your hair when you making two strand twist, greasing the scape. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, these are going straight to the garbage. They don&#x27;t hold up any hair and are so cheaply made, they are all crooked.</li>
            <li> I love that I got 12 of these, however they kind of snag at my hair everytime I try to put it in. Nevertheless it does the job!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, but the plastic is flimsy and sharp.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love my new butterfly clips...they are just perfect and exactly what I wanted!  I use them all the time!</li>
            <li> These arrived in about 4 days. They are nice longer length, about 2.5 or three inches across. They have a strong clamp, not too strong for my weakened fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use them to hold my hair in sections to touch up the roots each month, or so.&lt;br /&gt; I try to avoid re-bleaching all my hair. And also to avoid the salon  costs. Platinum blonde takes some strong bleach and some extended time. These are up to the requirements. Plastic is best&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you need good clips or also need plastic for hair coloring, even the Sallys-type supply stores are not cheaper. (Free delivery at this point!)&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more of these if more will be needed as it grows longer. I got a hack job, I have to recoup!&lt;br /&gt; I think a dozen will be ok to start on 4 inch, fine/thinner hair, for starters.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, worthy, without doubt, of 5 stars..ALL is worthy, its that simple sometimes.</li>
            <li> I love these clips, holds up my hair great!</li>
            <li> I love using these when styling my hair it helps hold the hair in sections when I blow dry.  Everything came shipped in perfect condition, nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> I received these and I was a little puzzled whether they were going to work on my thick hair or not but they did! They are strong to hold thick hair, especially if you have a lot. Good for using when you are ironing/straightening your hair.</li>
            <li> The description said they were great for hot rollers.  Not true - they are too flimsy for hot rollers.  They would be \\&quot;okay\\&quot; for hair - as long as you are okay with occassional breakage (they are not heavy- or even medium-duty).</li>
            <li> My very long hair requires a lot of sectioning when styling it and these clips work great for doing that. Perfect for doing sections with a curling iron.  They don&#x27;t hurt and are durable and strong.</li>
            <li> These hold my hair really well and don&#x27;t get stuck in my longish, thick hair. You get a good amount so you can style a smaller amount of hair holding wet hair safely in place. My hair looks great when I use these. I like them much better than clip style hair holders which always manage to fall out of my hair. I used to be a so- so hair stylist on my own hair. With these my hair is held in place till I am ready to dry that portion and now my hair looks professionally styled using these.</li>
            <li> These should have somewhat pointed edges to grasp the hair but these are dull and rounded.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> super easy to use&lt;br /&gt;stay in place really well&lt;br /&gt;holds large amounts of hair at once in almost any position&lt;br /&gt;none have broken&lt;br /&gt;thinking of buying a set of the small ones, too</li>
            <li> This product is as described. Good grip. Nice easy colors. I use them to hold my hair whilst I curl. So far they are all in text and haven&#x27;t fallen apart. Good value clips.</li>
            <li> They are nothing special but they do the job. I went to Ulta today and saw the same ones but cheaper and in black and pink though. I wish I would have gotten those lol But these are just as good and they hold my hair well. I have thin hair though so I don&#x27;t know about thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Its a great buy for the price and holds hair in place. I like the color choice so, I share it with my baby girl and still keep our clamps seperate :)</li>
            <li> These clips are the bomb for sectioning hair for coloring or styling.  They grip securely and stay out of the way.  I have very long hair, so I twist a section around in a pincurl before clipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work way better than the long alligator clips and I&#x27;m delighted with them.  The price was great and free shipping with Prime Add On.  Brilliant!</li>
            <li> I have mediumish hair and they hold great. I love these clips. I use them for buns, washing hair and half-up hairstyles! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with clips not holding my heavy thick long hair up...these do the trick! So farr so good!</li>
            <li> These clips are very useful. They were sturdy enough to hold my very thick hair with no problems. Very handy when sectioning off my hair for various treatments and styling.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, but does the job. I use this for my wigs.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on sale, so the price matched quality, but if it&#x27;s not,&lt;br /&gt;I would try going to a local beauty supply store and see what pricing they have.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Kristy- wife of Dustin</li>
            <li> I RECENTLY BOUGHT FROM AMAZON AND I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THEM. I HAVE A NATURAL KINKY 4C HAIR TYPE AND MY HAIR WOULD BE TANGLED IN THE CLAMPS CAUSING MY HAIR DAMAGE. THEY HAVE A STONG HOLD BUT I WOULD PERFER THE SET WITHOUT THE TEETH SHAPE POINTED EDGE.</li>
            <li> I need to start reading the product descriptions on Amazon more carefully - I bought these because they said &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; clamps when in fact I would consider these small.  I&#x27;m not sure what the company selling these think large is supposed to be, but I was hoping for something more like a &amp;#34;banana clip&amp;#34; size.  On the plus size, they do hold my hair well, but I need several of them to work since I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner. I have thick, long hair &amp; use these when sectioning my hair. They hold great &amp; haven&#x27;t caused any hair breakage.</li>
            <li> Hold of the clamps is okay. Have to use smaller sections if you have super thick hair. Not the best clamps but okay in a pinch ( couldn&#x27;t resist the pun).</li>
            <li> I bought these to hold my travel compact Remington electric rollers, they work so much better than the metal prongs that come with the set...... a super value for such a low cost!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and looks just like the photo listed no isssues at all they come in very handy for my hair.</li>
            <li> You get a whole lot of clips that help you create different hairstyles. I have a ton of hair and when styling need to separate my hair into many sections...the quality is good enough for the price they do bend a bit but don&#x27;t break easily which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I love the clips, however when they arrived there was one broken.</li>
            <li> These clips are okay, they were cheaply made and wont last to long but hey they were only like $3.00 right. They wont hold too much hair so they are kind of useless to me unless I am dying or styling my hair. I guess I was just hoping for a good clip that would hold my hair back. They are too small for how much hair I have.</li>
            <li> These are great even if you have long  thick hair. I can easily clip portions of hair out of the way while  blow drying one section at a time.  These have really made blow drying a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you have difficulty with your hands, you may find these easy to work with.  I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were putting together a gift bag, these would be in it.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I would use claw clips when I straightened my hair. It was a nightmare because my hair would fall out of the holes of the clip while I was trying to keep the straight hair separate from the curly hair. These worked great! They really grip and hold the hair into place until I decide to remove the clip. I have also used them when I dye my hair and they really help with sectioning the hair. $4 for 12 clips??? Can&#x27;t beat that!!! I will be getting more soon.</li>
            <li> Hey, these clips do what they are supposed to do and are very sturdy.  No bells and whistles, just good quality and functionality.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality, but works for what I need them to do (hold hair out of the way while I put in curlers for cheer hair.)</li>
            <li> everything was fine with my order, I&#x27;m happy with them&lt;br /&gt;joy</li>
            <li> I use these clips to seperate my layers while styling my hair. It works as expected and I am pleases with this order! Good buy!</li>
            <li> Came in 3 days of purchase love it! just what I needed and I&#x27;ve seen the ones at sally&#x27;s beauty supply in store is pricey but these aren&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> These are great clips! I use them every time I want to blow out or straighten my hair! They have a nice tight hold and keep my hair firmly in place… Which is fantastic, because I have thick, curly, UNRULY hair!</li>
            <li> These clips are awesome.  My hair is very thick and there are enough to grab the strands that try to fall out without being bulky!</li>
            <li> These were surprisingly good. I just needed clips to keep my hair out of my face when I straighten other parts. This product does that, but it feels just as sturdy as when you go to the salon - the hold is very strong. The clips themselves feel a little flimsy but the hold is so good and the price is so good that I won&#x27;t be too upset if I have to rebuy them down the line.</li>
            <li> I love these clamps for when I take a shower it keeps my hair where it needs to be.</li>
            <li> The size is pretty small.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for attaching plastic to my raised garden bed to construct little mini greenhouses. They don&#x27;t tear the plastic.</li>
            <li> Yes, these are cheap. Yes, you may think the are worthless and breakable but they are just as good as those expensive ones you are looking at! They clamp tight and stay where to you them. They are perfect for girls trying to curl their own hair, or trying to fix someone elses hair. If I need more, I will for sure get these!</li>
            <li> These butterfly clamp clips work great for sectioning hair and I haven&#x27;t broken any in months of use. No issues and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Ok for its price. Sadly, cheap price means junk quality</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for</li>
            <li> I needed them for school and I totally love them. My other classmates even ask to use them. I just wish I could afford more.</li>
            <li> love those things, great value. use them on my hair when styling to divide/section it and use them at other times too when i just want to do my hair up.</li>
            <li> The best hair clips to firmly hold up all types of hair. Also stylish and very trendy too. Durable as well.</li>
            <li> They work well. Good Price for the bulk. They break easy though but to be expected.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Didn&#x27;t know about clips for hot rollers.  Used to struggle with u shaped pins.  Clips are awesome!</li>
            <li> not very big so doesnt hold as much hair as i expected, plus it does not hold the hair securely. a bit flimsy and deosn&#x27;t quite do the job. would not refer this</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and there is a lot of it, these clips help to style just like my hair dresser does in the salon.  I need more!</li>
            <li> Love them. They&#x27;re large enough to hold my hair out of the way when I curl it, but small enough that I can separate my hair into sections.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this a 5star is because its great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this product? It does what it suppose to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who manage their hair.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice. I use them to clip my hair when I style it which is really great and also for closing bags of food. Versatile use and excellent hold.</li>
            <li> These clips are strong and work well for me.  I have coarse thick hair and they work perfectly.  These were received on time and packed well.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this type of hair clip. Great all purpose clip to use during styling or as a clip to hold style in place. I always have one of these in my purse and all over the house. For the price they&#x27;re great and they last forever unless you step on them. I have some that I have been using for a decade that are still going strong.</li>
            <li> These do what clips need to do. I use them to hold the sections up when I blow dry or flat iron it.</li>
            <li> They do not hold that well with thick hair. They may hold for a bit but loosens up very quickly since the teeth on these clips are shorter than some other brands.</li>
            <li> Kind of flimsy, but they get the job done. Doubt they will hold up very long for my hair.</li>
            <li> These butterfly clamps hold my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use these clips to seperate my hair to flat iron it. I also use them so that I can wash my hair without having it in my face. They cause no clip mark in hair and able to brush hair able for daily wear.</li>
            <li> these work great for holding sections of hair while i color or straighten my hair wish i had gotten some sooner</li>
            <li> Very thin cheap plastic. I thought I was getting 6 black and 6 white as the description and picture showed, and I got purple and blue :(&lt;br /&gt;And the shipping cost more than the actual product! Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Maybe they are not premium, but still they are value for money and worth the price. I think I like them, yeah.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy little devils.  I&#x27;ve shared them with family and all think they&#x27;re handy.  I have three two one more word....</li>
            <li> Great item, made well with a softer plastic that bends slightly. No fear of the clips snapping and breaking that can happen with a hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! I love these clips!</li>
            <li> What I expected butterfly clips to be like! They do feel a little cheap though, I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last...</li>
            <li> These clamps are great for drying my hair. I have thick hair that is hard to dry without clamps. These hold my hair in place without falling out like duck clips. Mine only came with 8 clips instead of 12 but I don&#x27;t need the other 4. I only need 1 because they&#x27;re so good. Love them.</li>
            <li> not sure why this got good reviews. this is really cheap and flimsy plastic. not really strong enough to keep hair in place</li>
            <li> The clips are a little flimsy and on the cheaper side. Would be able to get same quality from a dollar store. Shipper was fast</li>
            <li> These clips are great! They hold sections of my hair whether it&#x27;s straightened or natural without breaking or getting tangled. I don&#x27;t know if these are what I would call &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;, but they are a nice size and large enough for me.</li>
            <li> I use it the clips when I part my hair to straighten it or curl it. I have to clip small sections of my hair because the clips doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of my hair. I would have been better off buying it at a local target for cheaper!</li>
            <li> These are a good buy considering the count and the price. I have thick long hair, so at times I needed to use more than one clip, but it was still worth it to buy these. They&#x27;re cheaper than the clips you buy at CVS or Walgreens, and pretty much do the same job. Please thumbs up this review if it was helpful to you in anyway! I would really appreciate it :)</li>
            <li> They are weak and they snag your hair and pull because of the rough hewn edges of the teeth. But they are cheap so I didn&#x27;t really expect much. Go to sallys beauty. Better more quality selection there. If you have thick curly natural hair ( I am African American) then you may be in for a bit of a wrestle.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and not a lot, but these clips don&#x27;t hold barely any hair and they hurt. Should have stuck with the claw clips.</li>
            <li> I use these about 3 times a week when I flat iron my hair and they work very well.  I will say that I do have thin hair so I can&#x27;t vouch for how they will work on very thick hair.  But for my purposes they are perfect.  The even survived my 6 year old playing with them when I wasn&#x27;t looking.</li>
            <li> need to keep your hair in one place.....these are clamps i recommend. my hair is real thick and hard to part when i am greasing it, but with these clamps here, greasing my hair is sweet!!!</li>
            <li> Great for sectioning my hair for do-it-yourself hair perms/relaxer!! You cannot use metal clips when perming/relaxing your hair. Easy Use</li>
            <li> Great clamps for keeping hair back when styling.</li>
            <li> very cheaply made scratches scalp but that is what you get for cheaply made product the price was good but not worth it.</li>
            <li> Just as described and easy to use for separating the hair into sections. This is perfect for long or thick hair in terms of conditions and styling as well.</li>
            <li> Those clamps are big size. Just used them yesterday and I like them. Four are enough for my hair. Nice product!</li>
            <li> For the price they get the job done. They feel a little weaker than others I have had but I still haven&#x27;t broken one. I would buy again for the price and think I did get a good deal.</li>
            <li> These are very useful lots of hair salons use them... they will not break hold hair perfectly. Love the black and white colors great vale great price am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> These clips are perfect when sectioning off hair that still wet and so you can work more easily with another section of hair.  The white ones are easier to locate if you&#x27;re watching movies while doing your hair! *laughs*</li>
            <li> Sturdy enough to hold up our curly hair and that&#x27;s saying a lot. If these eventually wear out if purchase the same again.</li>
            <li> I bought these along with a curling wand.  They work perfectly at holding back the hair which I am not curling.  I did put them into a Ziploc bag along with the heat mitt that came with the wand to keep them together.</li>
            <li> use these every morning i decide to wear my hair curly -&lt;br /&gt;they hold large clumps of hair so the underside can dry.</li>
            <li> EXCELENT ALL I M HAPPY&lt;br /&gt; VERY  THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;br /&gt; I HOPE WILL BE YOU CUSTOMER AGAIN SOON</li>
            <li> Perfect for when you want to dye your hair. Also for parting hair when straightening. You have to try them</li>
            <li> This size was ok, but the thin plastic used and the the spring makes for limited use. Only for clothes hanging I would say.&lt;br /&gt;Wooden clothes pins would be less than half this price and stronger.</li>
            <li> Great value. Not cheap like some others, in the fact that  it  has a nice tight grip. Would buy more.</li>
            <li> Poor quality plastic material but I guess I should not have expected anything more for the low price they are sold at.</li>
            <li> I am using them for the potato chip bags etc and they work just as good as for the chip bag holders.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re strong, durable hair clips that hold tight for any hair procedure. I&#x27;m a hairstylist and use them for clipping up any hair texture from thin to thick.</li>
            <li> I have to colour just the roots, so this is great to create the right size partitions and keep the sections out of the way till i am ready to colour them.  Good quality, and they hold my fine hair too!</li>
            <li> They can be had to squeeze open because the springs are pretty tight but that&#x27;s exactly what you need when looking for clamps. They are a great product. No complaints from me.</li>
            <li> I am constantly losing my hair ties and clips so its such a relief to just order in bulk.  These are regular quality what you would find in the drugstore.  They hold up well for me, have had them for almost a year and none have broken. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Essie Button sent me.  Da Clip!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for these.  It&#x27;s hard for me to find a beauty and cosmetics store, or even make it out to hunt for one. These are inexpensive and easy to use.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> do their job but break easily</li>
            <li> I got these to help style my hair, cause I&#x27;ve only got 2 hands...LOL.  They are very well made, and seem durable.  They stay in place and I&#x27;m glad it had only 2 colors.  It made my life easier when separating my hair, prior to flat ironing.</li>
            <li> These are not as strong as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> These hair clips really keep your hair up.  Great for thin hair.  Probably great for thick hair too but I only have thin hair.  Friends with thicker hair love them though.  Apparently these are like only $1 if you can find them in the store (I haven&#x27;t been able to).</li>
            <li> I ordered the clips to quickly throw back my hair or to separate it for styling, and they are great. Only problem is my friend stepped on a couple and they snapped. Overall a good product</li>
            <li> These are great, I needed more of these to do my hair because it&#x27;s getting longer. These are really nice. I didn&#x27;t understand what they meant in the description as being &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;. When I got these I could see why. They are made of a soft plastic. Like, boarding on that hard plastic and a plastic bag. The perfect median.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are large and they keep all of my hair out of the way. Really love these. Will buy more in the future if needed.</li>
            <li> works as expected for coloring , conditioning sessions</li>
            <li> Exactly what&#x27;s expected...</li>
            <li> Bought these after I lost the only butterfly clip I ever had. They work great and keep hair secure! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i got a lot for my money i use them everyday on my natural hair whether i am doing braid or a twist out i love them and they have lasted me for now going on 7 months.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re messy like me, these little bastards will surprise you out of no where and hurt your feet because you&#x27;ll probably have a few laying around somewhere on your floor. Obviously that is not the product or manufacturers fault. It also does a good job of holding chunks of your hair at a time though. But for the sake of my feet, I&#x27;ll just go back to using soft hair ties.</li>
            <li> These clips surprisingly hold up your hair very well!</li>
            <li> Bought twice now because I lost the previous ones or others borrowed them and never returned because they loved them so much</li>
            <li> Cheap clips, not very strong but for the price it&#x27;s not bad. The &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t have a chance at holding all of my hair up at once. Need at least two to get the job done, which detracts from the utility of them.</li>
            <li> What can you say their just clips they serve the purpose. They do work well.</li>
            <li> Love these! First time buying clips like these. I bought them so it would be easier for me to iron and wave my hair :) they hold my hair really good</li>
            <li> These butterfly clamps holds my hair out of my way very well when I am styling my hair. I like the long length of these clamps</li>
            <li> These are really cheaply made, but they do hold my hair up. I just don&#x27;t expect them to last too long because of their quality....but I guess it&#x27;s a good thing that they come in a big pack!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Very sturdy, great price.  shipped very fast.  would recommend</li>
