    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It was still a wonderful smell</li>
            <li>This is perfect for day and work.</li>
            <li>I was very happy, after two weeks everything changed.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a wonderful addition to my collection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautifully packaged but the smell!</li>
            <li>Perfect for daytime.</li>
            <li>The scent would linger beautifully for an hour, then fade to nothing.</li>
            <li>Great for daytime but can work for evenings too.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>This is a great perfume for those of you who also like \\&quot;Happy\\&quot; or \\&quot;Pleasures\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderfully feminine but not overbearing like so many women&#x27;s fragrances can be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn primarily green/citrus scents for years--Hugo Boss Woman, Happy to Be--and was very happy with them.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments (from men!)</li>
            <li>I own it</li>
            <li>I bought this because it smelled nice on the tester strip.</li>
            <li>I think the perfume smells nice...</li>
            <li>This fragrance is aptly named.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great success with the life of the scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with Lovely.</li>
            <li>It smells like a lighter version of Ysatis by Givenchy which I always liked but thought it was too strong.</li>
            <li>This is one of the prettiest smelling perfumes I have ever worn, very light, refreshing and intoxicating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been wearing &#x27;Lovely&#x27; by Sarah Jessica Parker all week.</li>
            <li>I nodded my head as I realised this person&#x27;s sentence evoked perhaps the most gender neutral connotations, validating my choice in scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; I knew it was Lovely</li>
            <li>I lean toward lighter scents and Lovely doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>Not cloying or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I plan to wear this on my wedding day so that I will look, feel and smell absolutely lovely. :)</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s lovely</li>
            <li>And the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell was alot like the smell of Sure Deoderant.</li>
            <li>I love you SJP but, to me, your Lovely perfume smells like nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I love S&amp;TC,</li>
            <li>love SJP, but DON&#x27;T love this musky scent.</li>
            <li>Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker features breezy top notes of honeysuckle.</li>
            <li>cute&#x27;--and</li>
            <li>It is so much better than I even thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It has an \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; scent after you spray it on--like many cheap perfumes do.</li>
            <li>and I confirmed it was indeed Lovely.</li>
            <li>loved the fragrance-but disappoointed that the scent did not lastpast 5 minutes even though I loaded on much more than I would normally wear.  </li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t been loving Lovely.</li>
            <li>Now that I have it, I think there&#x27;s a strong soap-like smell, over-powering a musky floral scent.</li>
            <li>This scent is all at once a clean and light smell and a sexy, feminine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume;very clean and light.</li>
            <li>This is a nice scent, very sophisticated and for some reason, I picture it as being more suitable for mature women rather than young girls.</li>
            <li>but this parfum just filled a void for me.  </li>
            <li>It is a great fragrance for wearing daily...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s feminine</li>
            <li>It is very light and pretty, not at all overbearing.</li>
            <li>First of all, I LOVE Sarah Jessica Parker and Sex and the City, so I was excited to hear of her perfume.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed Lovely now for several months and it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The scent is rich and earthy.</li>
            <li>For Lovely, I am willing to tote around a roll-on for re-application throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I like it, but the response I get from other people is pretty darn incredible!</li>
            <li>this fragrance is exactly what I&#x27;m growing into, a scent for a sophisticated woman.</li>
            <li>Perhaps its my skin, but before writing this scent off, if you are looking for an upscale, clean floral fragrance, visit the perfume counter and give it a try.  </li>
            <li>This scent is pleasant and it is only for the Close at hand to smell.</li>
            <li>and I got a full refund.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try and thought for sure I would just love it, especially after seeing SJP on Oprah talking about the fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many fragrances smell different on many people.</li>
            <li>Personally, Lovely is my current favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love, this perfume and have now transformed it to my everyday scent not just for special occasions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small inconvenience for a scent so beautiful and unique.</li>
            <li>Smile.</li>
            <li>I feel that it was well worth my purchase and nothing akin to the Youth Dew</li>
            <li>Lovely has a full tone that reminds me of a greenhouse full of orchids, while at the same time being as fresh as clover.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and I get frequent compliments on it; most of them use the word \\&quot;clean.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It is sophisticated and not a typical \\&quot;celebrity scent\\</li>
            <li>and I saw this perfume I decided to give it a smell it smells to strong and like it was made in the 80&#x27;s not like the new fresh scents of today.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers; if a scent does not smell good on you, it&#x27;s not an inferior product.  </li>
            <li>It is clean and classic.</li>
            <li>Lovely is exciting blend with top notes of passion fruit and light middle notes of pink freesia.</li>
            <li>After smelling it, my first thought was-</li>
            <li>SJP Lovely is simply that...lovely.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled this scent in a magazine sample, it immediately grabbed my attention.</li>
            <li>It is a really pretty smell.</li>
            <li>It was a real dissapointment!</li>
            <li>When I first received my fragrance</li>
            <li>After a lengthly conversation with a higher up they agreed I could return it for testing</li>
            <li>This was my first experience purchasing fragrance online</li>
            <li>The bottle is really pretty</li>
            <li>I smelled this first on a scent strip and was intrigued; it had the crispness I like in the greener scents, but also a softness I&#x27;ve missed in my scents, an unexpected light musk richness.</li>
            <li>So, the first time I could find it at a reasonable price, I bought some on the spot.</li>
            <li>The dividing line between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fragrances has always been a very porous one.</li>
            <li>&quot; I was really embarrassed for the girl wearing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, feminine, quirky and not over the top.</li>
            <li>So many of the other perfumes out there smell like your trying to attract a bayou wolf.</li>
            <li>I usually like more fruity scents, but I was trying to find something more romantic for Valentine&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>However, I have received more compliments from guys when I wear this perfume than any other perfume I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li>Lovely is a nice, unoffensive floral musk that is basically a toned-down version of Narciso Rodriguez for Her - for those on the fence, I&#x27;d suggest Lovely, as it is considerably less expensive.  </li>
            <li>Is that the new thing to make perfumes go away fast</li>
            <li>but this does kinda smell like something older ladies would wear.</li>
            <li>I expected this perfume to smell light, airy, and for some reason I had imagined some sort of citrus bent to it.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer said it reminded her of old lady perfume, and it really does.</li>
            <li>So, I returned it to the dept store from which I had purchased it and exchanged it for a new one.  </li>
            <li>and they would issue a new one to me.  </li>
            <li>and I considered myself foolish because I also had bought the lotion at no small expense.</li>
            <li>It smells ok not my usual taste</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not old, it&#x27;s not young; it&#x27;s mature, and equally appropriate with a sweater and jeans or evening wear.</li>
            <li>It is feminine with a slight undertone of french quality musk (not the drugstore musk so many of us think of when we hear musk)</li>
            <li>This is much lighter and airier but the scent is still the same.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a mature scent and this is what I think she was hoping for when she put her name to this label.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smelled to me alot like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>It is quite old-fashioned - like the scent that old women wear, it&#x27;s musty as well.</li>
            <li>Old lady?  </li>
            <li>I have weird chemistry &amp; most scents are dicey on me, so I tried this half a dozen times before purchasing, and every time I tried it, I found something new to love.</li>
            <li>I was on public transport Saturday when someone came up, wafted their hand and said \\&quot;crisp apple martini flirting with silky white amber.</li>
            <li>Since I love perfume and tried quite a few over the years, it didn&#x27;t take me too long to identify it.</li>
            <li>At first they were not very receptive to doing anything because 14 days had passed.  </li>
            <li>I have used the same perfume for 15 years and had not changed because I always got compliments when wearing it, but I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, I was a bit disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as most other perfumes I have, (Happy, Pleasures)</li>
            <li>I bought this fragrance for my sister for her B-day and when I finally gave it to her it smelled just like old mothballs that you find in the back of the closet with a floral scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it without smelling it and making sure it is for you first!</li>

            <li> Old lady?  </li>
            <li> I have weird chemistry &amp; most scents are dicey on me, so I tried this half a dozen times before purchasing, and every time I tried it, I found something new to love.</li>
            <li> I was on public transport Saturday when someone came up, wafted their hand and said \\&quot;crisp apple martini flirting with silky white amber.</li>
            <li> Since I love perfume and tried quite a few over the years, it didn&#x27;t take me too long to identify it.</li>
            <li> At first they were not very receptive to doing anything because 14 days had passed.  </li>
            <li> I have used the same perfume for 15 years and had not changed because I always got compliments when wearing it, but I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, I was a bit disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as most other perfumes I have, (Happy, Pleasures)</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my sister for her B-day and when I finally gave it to her it smelled just like old mothballs that you find in the back of the closet with a floral scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it without smelling it and making sure it is for you first!</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell maybe a little more citrus like, and a little less musk like.  </li>
            <li> This is a complex, pretty scent that lasts all day for me and gets lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li> My mom loves the scent but says it doesnt last too long either.</li>
            <li> This perfume deserves a long career.</li>
            <li> And crisp middle notes of sunny tangerine with sweet base notes of juicy mango guava.</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted longer, but colognes never last long on my body due to the alcohol content.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer that it be subtle enough that only a person standing next to me smell it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected of SJP.</li>
            <li> My main complaints are: The scent is so weak that you can&#x27;t smell it almost immediately after you put it on.</li>
            <li> SJP put a lot of work into this, unlike the other celebrities who just put their names on scents.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other users are smelling!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be side-tracked by the few negative comments you see; not everyone will like the same fragrances.</li>
            <li> I put a little on and my roommate said it smelled a little like a man.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> &quot; It is not too heavy, nor does it require freshening all day.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday</li>
            <li> Leaving you with sweet base notes of blackberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Well, I am not sure what all the hype was about.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what they put on the strip, but it&#x27;s not what I got in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am usually drawn to spicy fragrances; Opium, Obsession, Shalimar, etc.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll do it again.  </li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t even do a smell test because I thought that SJP would not put a foot wrong.</li>
            <li> can anyone NOT love this perfume</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed to read the reviews that say it smells of \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; as I don&#x27;t believe mine does.</li>
            <li> Seriously...</li>
            <li> Not so... it&#x27;s appalling.</li>
            <li> I finally made it to Macy&#x27;s, and I must say I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could get my money back and let SJP just how awful her product is.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;ve never received any compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Not the worst I give that award to Tabu the worst smelling perfume ever but</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The dividing line between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fragrances has always been a very porous one. Fragrances can cross that border with the ease of a Swede into Germany after the Schengen Agreement. Why would I include such a statement before reviewing this product? It&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been wearing &#x27;Lovely&#x27; by Sarah Jessica Parker all week. I was on public transport Saturday when someone came up, wafted their hand and said \\&quot;crisp apple martini flirting with silky white amber. There is also an interloping patchouli.\\&quot; I nodded my head as I realised this person&#x27;s sentence evoked perhaps the most gender neutral connotations, validating my choice in scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I recommend this fragrance for men as well.</li>
            <li> After smelling it, my first thought was-I&#x27;ve smelled this before! Since I love perfume and tried quite a few over the years, it didn&#x27;t take me too long to identify it. It smells like a lighter version of Ysatis by Givenchy which I always liked but thought it was too strong. This is much lighter and airier but the scent is still the same. This is a nice scent, very sophisticated and for some reason, I picture it as being more suitable for mature women rather than young girls.</li>
            <li> loved the fragrance-but disappoointed that the scent did not lastpast 5 minutes even though I loaded on much more than I would normally wear.  So, I returned it to the dept store from which I had purchased it and exchanged it for a new one.  Same issue-the scent simply did not last and I considered myself foolish because I also had bought the lotion at no small expense.</li>
            <li> Well, I am not sure what all the hype was about.  First of all, I LOVE Sarah Jessica Parker and Sex and the City, so I was excited to hear of her perfume.  Just by her personality I thought I would like it, and then I saw it on Oprah and couldn&#x27;t wait to smell it.  I finally made it to Macy&#x27;s, and I must say I was disappointed.  I thought it would smell maybe a little more citrus like, and a little less musk like.  I put a little on and my roommate said it smelled a little like a man. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it without smelling it and making sure it is for you first!</li>
            <li> So many of the other perfumes out there smell like your trying to attract a bayou wolf. This scent is pleasant and it is only for the Close at hand to smell. Can you feel me on that. Yes, it is a mature scent and this is what I think she was hoping for when she put her name to this label. I love, love, love, this perfume and have now transformed it to my everyday scent not just for special occasions. PS and every scent is not for everyone. Smile. So stop trashing this one.</li>
            <li> I work at a dept store and I saw this perfume I decided to give it a smell it smells to strong and like it was made in the 80&#x27;s not like the new fresh scents of today. Not the worst I give that award to Tabu the worst smelling perfume ever but definantly something I wouldn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy this perfume after smelling a sample on a magazine strip. Not sure what they put on the strip, but it&#x27;s not what I got in the bottle. My main complaints are: The scent is so weak that you can&#x27;t smell it almost immediately after you put it on. It has an \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; scent after you spray it on--like many cheap perfumes do. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Lovely now for several months and it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents.  I have received many compliments (from men!) and they haven&#x27;t been 87!  I am disappointed to read the reviews that say it smells of \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; as I don&#x27;t believe mine does. I do believe it is a \\&quot;grown up\\&quot; scent, though - not one for a teen.  I find that the fragrance lasts.  Perhaps its my skin, but before writing this scent off, if you are looking for an upscale, clean floral fragrance, visit the perfume counter and give it a try.  I feel that it was well worth my purchase and nothing akin to the Youth Dew I remember my great-grandmother wearing.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers; if a scent does not smell good on you, it&#x27;s not an inferior product.  This is a complex, pretty scent that lasts all day for me and gets lots of compliments.  SJP put a lot of work into this, unlike the other celebrities who just put their names on scents.  This perfume deserves a long career.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews. Try it for yourself. Many fragrances smell different on many people. This scent is all at once a clean and light smell and a sexy, feminine fragrance.  It is sophisticated and not a typical \\&quot;celebrity scent\\&quot; It is not too heavy, nor does it require freshening all day. It is feminine with a slight undertone of french quality musk (not the drugstore musk so many of us think of when we hear musk) I would say it is feminine not a unisex fragrance. I own it and my husband loves it. He smelled it on someone else in a restaurant recently and said to me  \\&quot;she smells nice\\&quot; I knew it was Lovely but it smelled a bit different on her than me. It was still a wonderful smell and I confirmed it was indeed Lovely. SJP did put a lot of input and work into this fragrance in the conception of it. It is not just an endorsement!!! Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!!!</li>
            <li> I lean toward lighter scents and Lovely doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s soft, feminine, quirky and not over the top. Not cloying or overwhelming. It&#x27;s what I expected of SJP. I bought this two months ago and it&#x27;s 1/2 done. Great for daytime but can work for evenings too.</li>
            <li> SJP Lovely is simply that...lovely. It is wonderfully feminine but not overbearing like so many women&#x27;s fragrances can be. I plan to wear this on my wedding day so that I will look, feel and smell absolutely lovely. :)</li>
            <li> I expected this perfume to smell light, airy, and for some reason I had imagined some sort of citrus bent to it. Not so... it&#x27;s appalling. Another reviewer said it reminded her of old lady perfume, and it really does. It smells like rosewater mixed with hairspray. I wish I could get my money back and let SJP just how awful her product is. She&#x27;s all over the place shilling this junk, she should be ashamed.</li>
            <li> I actually had went to macys to buy another perfume and by mistake the cashier gave me this one too. It smells ok not my usual taste but this does kinda smell like something older ladies would wear. My mom loves the scent but says it doesnt last too long either. Is that the new thing to make perfumes go away fast so you have to keep re applying and have to replace them sooner lol. Oh well...</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this scent in a magazine sample, it immediately grabbed my attention. I had to get it! So, the first time I could find it at a reasonable price, I bought some on the spot. I was not disappointed. The scent is rich and earthy. Lovely has a full tone that reminds me of a greenhouse full of orchids, while at the same time being as fresh as clover. It has become my signature scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I could find with it was its lack of staying power. I bought the roll-on version of the scent, where you apply it to your pressure points. The scent would linger beautifully for an hour, then fade to nothing. Out of all the scents I have ever worn, this has to be the shortest lasting of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s worth it. For Lovely, I am willing to tote around a roll-on for re-application throughout the day. It&#x27;s a small inconvenience for a scent so beautiful and unique.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my sister for her B-day and when I finally gave it to her it smelled just like old mothballs that you find in the back of the closet with a floral scent. So it went back to the store and I got a full refund. Don&#x27;t buy this product you will be wasting your time and money.</li>
            <li> This is one of the prettiest smelling perfumes I have ever worn, very light, refreshing and intoxicating.</li>
            <li> I admit I&#x27;m not a big perfume person. I usually like more fruity scents, but I was trying to find something more romantic for Valentine&#x27;s Day. I bought this because it smelled nice on the tester strip. It was my mistake to not try it out on my wrist. Now that I have it, I think there&#x27;s a strong soap-like smell, over-powering a musky floral scent.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be side-tracked by the few negative comments you see; not everyone will like the same fragrances. Personally, Lovely is my current favorite.  I wear it everyday and I get frequent compliments on it; most of them use the word \\&quot;clean.\\&quot;  I am usually drawn to spicy fragrances; Opium, Obsession, Shalimar, etc. but this parfum just filled a void for me.  It is clean and classic.</li>
            <li> It is a really pretty smell.I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one for my sister-in-law and one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lovely</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume;very clean and light. I have used the same perfume for 15 years and had not changed because I always got compliments when wearing it, but I wanted to try something new. This is perfect for day and work.</li>
            <li> I went to the department store to test this fragrance out. I was so excited to try and thought for sure I would just love it, especially after seeing SJP on Oprah talking about the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled to me alot like old lady perfume. It was gagging. And the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell was alot like the smell of Sure Deoderant. I won&#x27;t be buying this fragrance at all. It was a real dissapointment!</li>
            <li> When I first received my fragrance I was very happy, after two weeks everything changed.  Several squirts were not lasting even two hours.  I contacted the company that supplied it with this discrepancy.  At first they were not very receptive to doing anything because 14 days had passed.  After a lengthly conversation with a higher up they agreed I could return it for testing and they would issue a new one to me.  This was my first experience purchasing fragrance online and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll do it again.  It cost me another $6.15 to ship it back and it&#x27;ll probably be another two weeks before I get it.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume for those of you who also like \\&quot;Happy\\&quot; or \\&quot;Pleasures\\&quot;.  It is a great fragrance for wearing daily...at work or out on the town.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I was a bit disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as most other perfumes I have, (Happy, Pleasures) But it&#x27;s a wonderful addition to my collection.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t been loving Lovely. It&#x27;s beautifully packaged but the smell! I actually didn&#x27;t even do a smell test because I thought that SJP would not put a foot wrong. Well, I was wrong. It is quite old-fashioned - like the scent that old women wear, it&#x27;s musty as well. The bottle is really pretty but it just is too old-style for me. I&#x27;m going to use it now that I bought it but sometimes I get embarrassed and feel like saying - \\&quot;no I do not smell musty it&#x27;s this perfume I&#x27;m determined to use up!\\&quot;. Needless to say I&#x27;ve never received any compliments on the scent. I&#x27;m giving it two stars for the bottle design.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment. I love you SJP but, to me, your Lovely perfume smells like nail polish remover. In fact, I met up with a group of friends and immediately recognized the nauseating smell of this fragrance on a friend&#x27;s girlfriend. After hanging out for a bit one of my guy friends yelled, \\&quot;Why does it smell like paint thinner in here?\\&quot; I was really embarrassed for the girl wearing it. Hopefully she remained clueless since all noses are different.</li>
            <li> I think the perfume smells nice...it&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s feminine and it&#x27;s not too floral.  I wish it lasted longer, but colognes never last long on my body due to the alcohol content.  However, I have received more compliments from guys when I wear this perfume than any other perfume I have ever worn.  Seriously...that&#x27;s what makes me continue wearing it.  I like it, but the response I get from other people is pretty darn incredible!</li>
            <li> Old lady?  A scent for a man?  I don&#x27;t know what other users are smelling! Lovely is a nice, unoffensive floral musk that is basically a toned-down version of Narciso Rodriguez for Her - for those on the fence, I&#x27;d suggest Lovely, as it is considerably less expensive.  I get a lot of favorable comments on this \\&quot;close to the skin\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> Ok..I bought into all the hype about this fragrance before it even hit the shelves.  I bought it sight and smell unseen. Mistake. I love S&amp;TC, love SJP, but DON&#x27;T love this musky scent. My former boss even told me to never wear it to work again, as it made her nauseous!</li>
            <li> Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker features breezy top notes of honeysuckle. And crisp middle notes of sunny tangerine with sweet base notes of juicy mango guava. Lovely is exciting blend with top notes of passion fruit and light middle notes of pink freesia. Leaving you with sweet base notes of blackberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can anyone NOT love this perfume is all I&#x27;m wondering?!?!?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn primarily green/citrus scents for years--Hugo Boss Woman, Happy to Be--and was very happy with them. I smelled this first on a scent strip and was intrigued; it had the crispness I like in the greener scents, but also a softness I&#x27;ve missed in my scents, an unexpected light musk richness. I have weird chemistry &amp; most scents are dicey on me, so I tried this half a dozen times before purchasing, and every time I tried it, I found something new to love. I&#x27;m 30--well beyond wishing to smell &#x27;cute&#x27;--and this fragrance is exactly what I&#x27;m growing into, a scent for a sophisticated woman. It&#x27;s not old, it&#x27;s not young; it&#x27;s mature, and equally appropriate with a sweater and jeans or evening wear. The only scent I bother with anymore. I&#x27;ve had great success with the life of the scent--I put it on at 8am and my husband can still smell it on me at bedtime--but I prefer that it be subtle enough that only a person standing next to me smell it; perhaps some who find it short-lived prefer a bolder scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with Lovely. I don&#x27;t expect to change perfumes again for years.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is aptly named. It is so much better than I even thought it would be. It is very light and pretty, not at all overbearing. Perfect for daytime.</li>
