            <li>We went to many doctors, specialists, testing of all kinds, endoscopy, colonoskopy, ultrasounds, xrays, ct scans, mri...</li>
            <li>She has not had to deal with nuasea any more...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>If diluted and applied on the abdomen,  my family members are SURE to have BM within a couple of hours!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My daughter experienced nausea on almost a daily basis for 3 months.  </li>
            <li>process is comfortable and not painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These people young living are good people to deal with.</li>
            <li>Works right every time!</li>
            <li>price (I&#x27;ll get a larger bottle at my wholesale price once it&#x27;s back in stock) and was perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>I have also been using Oil of Oregano everyday, and it is great too.</li>

            <li>It has really helped my stomach issues.  </li>
            <li>Love Young Living Essential Oils</li>
            <li>at the first sign of stomach problems, she rubs a few drops on her stomach and she is fine!  </li>
            <li>Within 15 minutes of rubbing a couple drops on her stomach she was feeling better and when I asked a short time later, her nausea was gone!  </li>
            <li>I live in Utah (home of YL)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually transferred some of the oil to my regular (15 ml) bottle to keep at home which lets me carry the more convenient smaller bottle in my purse.</li>
            <li>How&#x27;s that for a life of a 17 year old?  </li>
            <li>I have Crohn&#x27;s Disease and this stuff helps my guts not hurt and it has completely taken away my acid reflux.</li>
            <li>The ring was stretched out and there is no telling exactly what has put in my bottle instead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being introduced to Young Living Essential Oils, and particularly Di-Gize, was a turning point in our lives and like a miracle for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually a Young Living distributor, but not long ago when I went to re-order some Di-Gize oil, it was out of stock.</li>
            <li>I only bought off here instead from Young Living (which I am a distributor for them) because I needed the smaller 5ml bottle.</li>

            <li> Obviously was not new...</li>
            <li> THE DOWN SIDE</li>
            <li> I have it for a few weeks ....</li>
            <li> heartburn dead in its tracks.</li>
            <li> It came within a few days.  </li>
            <li> and i rubbed some of this on and within 30 minutes i started getting relief and the catch slowly unwound</li>
            <li> I panicked a little since it is the ONE thing that stops my occasional (but VERY painful)</li>
            <li> The smell is weak and oil didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the small 5ml bottle, so I didn&#x27;t feel too bad having to pay &amp;#34;retail&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> SO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> It helps with IBS but the smell is not great!</li>
            <li> I had a bad catch in my side from excess gas</li>
            <li> My roommate had me try hers when I was sick, it worked</li>
            <li> Go to school, come home, and go to bed because you feel like crap...</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this oil.</li>
            <li> It taste nasty if u put it in water</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have it for a few weeks .... helps my heartburn most of the time. I put a drop under my tongue. It taste nasty if u put it in water</li>
            <li> I had a bad catch in my side from excess gas and i rubbed some of this on and within 30 minutes i started getting relief and the catch slowly unwound and I am sold on this stuff!</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome! Works right every time!</li>
            <li> Love Young Living Essential Oils</li>
            <li> Find the product very helpful.</li>
            <li> My daughter experienced nausea on almost a daily basis for 3 months.  We went to many doctors, specialists, testing of all kinds, endoscopy, colonoskopy, ultrasounds, xrays, ct scans, mri... you name it, she went through it, and not only could they not determine cause, they could not give her any relief.  How&#x27;s that for a life of a 17 year old?  Go to school, come home, and go to bed because you feel like crap... if you can even make it to school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being introduced to Young Living Essential Oils, and particularly Di-Gize, was a turning point in our lives and like a miracle for my daughter.  Within 15 minutes of rubbing a couple drops on her stomach she was feeling better and when I asked a short time later, her nausea was gone!  GONE!!!  That was 3 weeks ago.  She has not had to deal with nuasea any more... at the first sign of stomach problems, she rubs a few drops on her stomach and she is fine!  Incredible!</li>
            <li> Best natural product for many stomach problems including severe nausea but super expensive.</li>
            <li> Di-Gize is wonderful for upset stomach.  My roommate had me try hers when I was sick, it worked so well I had to get my own.</li>
            <li> I have Crohn&#x27;s Disease and this stuff helps my guts not hurt and it has completely taken away my acid reflux. These people young living are good people to deal with.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy essential oils through Amazon, but...it was what it says it was and I am thoroughly enjoying it!</li>
            <li> The 5ml only had maybe 1ml of oil inside... Obviously was not new...</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with relief of stomach issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually a Young Living distributor, but not long ago when I went to re-order some Di-Gize oil, it was out of stock. I panicked a little since it is the ONE thing that stops my occasional (but VERY painful) heartburn dead in its tracks. I live in Utah (home of YL) so knew there were probably people around here who had some in stock, but frankly it was WAY easier to just order it here. It&#x27;s the small 5ml bottle, so I didn&#x27;t feel too bad having to pay &amp;#34;retail&amp;#34; price (I&#x27;ll get a larger bottle at my wholesale price once it&#x27;s back in stock) and was perfect for my needs. It came quickly and I&#x27;m so happy I bought it. I&#x27;ve actually transferred some of the oil to my regular (15 ml) bottle to keep at home which lets me carry the more convenient smaller bottle in my purse. Love this stuff and it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s available this way.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS !helps with constipation and flair from colitis !THE DOWN SIDE IT SO EXPENSIVE NO MATTER WHAT SIZE IT IS, YOU NEED TO WORK ON GETTING PRICES THAT PEOPLE AND AFFORD!!!</li>
            <li> If diluted and applied on the abdomen,  my family members are SURE to have BM within a couple of hours!&lt;br /&gt;The process is comfortable and not painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works and I shall definitely recommend it !</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping. Excellent product. Really helped with my stomach issues. Also, it smells amazing! I use it every morning. I only WISH the 5ml was still $13.</li>
            <li> I normally order from Young Living directly, however they were out of this great oil and I needed it. So glad I bought it, it works well for humans and animals! I use this for upset stomach or for constipation!</li>
            <li> I have had stomach problems for years and had my gallbladder out 7 years ago.  I read about Di-Gize oil and ordered it.  It came within a few days.  I place a drop or two on my tongue and rub it on my belly.  It has really helped my stomach issues.  I have also been using Oil of Oregano everyday, and it is great too.</li>
            <li> It helps with IBS but the smell is not great!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this oil. I only bought off here instead from Young Living (which I am a distributor for them) because I needed the smaller 5ml bottle. The bottle I received had been tampered with. The ring was stretched out and there is no telling exactly what has put in my bottle instead. The smell is weak and oil didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s not comparable to YL at all. Do not buy!!!!!!</li>
