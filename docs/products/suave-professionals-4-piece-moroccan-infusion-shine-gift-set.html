            <li>Loved how it tamed my super fine fly away hair.  </li>
            <li>I use it on myself and the kids, and it leaves my kids hair soft and smelly great!</li>
            <li>this price!They offer so many nice qualties.</li>
            <li>Plus they smell amazing.:)</li>
            <li>They also smell amazing and leave my hair nice, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have tried many argan oil products that worked great but were at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>A great price for the large size bottles and tube of product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I use the regular conditioner for my cowash and i am impressed....</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>This product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>When I found this set on Amazon, I was really impressed with the price, I still haven&#x27;t used the deep conditioner or shine spray</li>
            <li>but I am sure they both work just as well as the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love these products.  </li>
            <li>my hsir shiny &amp; healthy is a lot to ask for in a hsir care product.</li>
            <li>But i believe i found all that &amp; more in this Sauve product.  </li>
            <li>&amp; i think you&#x27;ll finc all the thingd it says it does &amp; more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a range of products from a variety of prices- from the top end stuff you find at the department stores to the cheapest of the cheapo stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Box reads $14 VALUE, it shouldn&#x27;t be going for more.</li>
            <li>But I used Suave products before and was satisfied every time.</li>
            <li>If you have curls or very wavy hair, this could be great for you.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>i had to buy more....</li>
            <li>The oil serum you just need like a quarter size and it will surely spread well.</li>
            <li>love this collection.  </li>
            <li>as a former salon owner, I am impressed,  Suave!</li>
            <li>I think it is more like 12.6 ounces.</li>
            <li>126 ounces  would be a lot of shampoo :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and it also make it smell good and fresh</li>
            <li>In addition, the conditioner is very rich and truly assists me with any knots that may arise.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and suitable for the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li>The products not only improved my hair quality but they also smell amazing and leave my hair smelling great all day even after styling.</li>
            <li>I got a lot of product for such a cheap and good price!!</li>
            <li>moisturizes  and most importantly leave my hair smelling like an exotic trip to view Moorish</li>
            <li>This is a good product and such a good deal for all that you get.</li>
            <li>its great to use before your blow dry your hair as your hair remains with a nice gloss and its very light weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves her hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>Marvelous thing, won&#x27;t buy any other product any more, from now on is suave everything for me...</li>
            <li>My hair is incredibly soft and smells great after using this set.</li>
            <li>The quality of Suave Professionals is significantly better than their regular Shampoo, and the styling oil is great for shiny and healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>My hair still smells great the day after I wash it, and makes it so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The Argon hair oil really conditions my super curly hair and makes it easy to straighten, and smells nice to boot!</li>
            <li>So I think it may end up in my own Christmas stocking ;)</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried a ton of conditioners, this deep conditioning mask is by far the best, we use it as a regular conditioner, just leave it on a bit longer to get best results.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but lots of it.  </li>
            <li>This product is such a great buy..</li>
            <li>your hair is light and shiny after just one use.</li>
            <li>Its so light that I used 10 pumps</li>
            <li>They are all full size, have a great smell, and make hair soft shiny and full.</li>
            <li>You save about $6 from Target prices and free shipping with Prime, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the real Moroccan Oil products without paying nearly as much!</li>
            <li>These bottle are huge and full size.</li>
            <li>The texture of the shampoo is creamy and rich.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair so soft and smooth and the scent is warm and comfortable if you can imagine that.  </li>
            <li>Including a very effective and clarifying shampoo, these hair products leave my normally dry hair smooth, moisturized, and conditioned.</li>
            <li>your scalp is clean for</li>
            <li>I loooooooooooooooooooooooooove this stuff it make me feel like my hair is so clean</li>
            <li>I am honestly amazed that after 2 washes it now feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Made my daughter&#x27;s hair shiny, soft, and a lot more manageable!</li>
            <li>specially when is sold in $99 stores too!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This Suave line of Argan Oil products works just as well if not better than their higher priced competitors!!!!!!</li>
            <li>my hair is so soft and the shine is amazing....</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and conditioned my hair making it soft.</li>
            <li>and the deep conditioner is a good produst also..</li>
            <li>Overall, good product, would recommend.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect such a good product from suave.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, but she likes it better than what we have been using.</li>
            <li>Oh this makes my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>love this so much</li>
            <li>Full sizes.</li>
            <li>The oil makes my hair soft, adds shine and most importantly tames my locks.</li>
            <li>Love the new lotion.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Leaves a very pleasant and long lasting fruity scent too.</li>
            <li>Moroccan shine oil, which is light and gentle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These products are excellent, however the scent is very nutty and remains a maximum of at least 4 days in your hair.</li>
            <li>all of the products in the gift pack are full size and work exactly as the product and the seller advertised.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the wait</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner and rich and thick and smell great.</li>
            <li>This line is excellent, but in particular the Moroccan deep conditioning mask, it is great for biracial hair types that tend to be dry and thick, comes out soft and shiny, just love it!</li>
            <li>I have even discovered that a quick smoothing of the conditioner over my skin before I rinse off in the shower makes my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving this to my daughter because I have very fine short hair</li>
            <li>But... for me, not so hot.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t always have to use the most expensive products to have a good result.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Same is true of this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Large bottles and long-term use.</li>
            <li>Its great, all you have to do is apply to your wet or dry hair then style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little gift for every lady.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from migraines that are triggered by scents, I highly recommend checking this out in a store first.</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re very affordable.</li>
            <li>It has too much oil in it.</li>
            <li>As I didn&#x27;t use in myself I can&#x27;t really tell so much.</li>
            <li>but i fear too much would make my hair a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really give the hair oil a chance because the scent was strongest in that item.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this purchase, as this is the hot new thing for hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing it will make your hair shine , less frizzy, , soft</li>
            <li>These are very high-quality items!!!!!I plan on purchasing a few more of these sets to stock up and as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>The main problem I have with this set is the smell.</li>
            <li>Really improves natural stylability!</li>
            <li>I am of Afro-Caribbean/ West Indian descent and my hair is highly textured,  a mix between wavy and curly.</li>
            <li>a new hero is in town.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>But my first purchase was oil infusion and only after that I decided to try all products.</li>
            <li>This set is truly a higher end quality for a low price.</li>
            <li>I am a die hard for sure and highly reccomand it to all...</li>
            <li>This product is a sufficient for hair cleansing, but if you are sensitive to smell...or rather, if you cannot tolerate a strong and very long lasting perfume bubble around your head all day, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>I often find that my hair seems too flat if I use this consistently.  </li>
            <li>It works for my hair, which is fine and limp.  </li>
            <li>The price well, do NOT let it fool you not to give much attention to this modestly packaged and redicolusly low priced product</li>
            <li>but once you apply it and leave it in for about 3 mins then rinse your hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>My mom and I really like the deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is wavy.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair shiny and soft without the cost of salon products.</li>
            <li>Too soft.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong and sometimes gives me a migraine, so I am unable to use this very often.</li>
            <li>I have been using this several weeks now and my hair is very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for my daughter who has very curly hard to control hair... has left it much softer easier to manage and very shiny.</li>
            <li>have naturally black, straight, normal hair.</li>
            <li>My son has thick wavy hair, his hair after 10 mins with the deep conditioning mask (that we use as regular conditioner) ends up super soft and wispy, the waves in his hair are much looser afterwards which he says he likes.</li>
            <li>This product leaves hair feeling thick but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave hair soft and full of knots . . .</li>
            <li>To my surprise,  I have to say this new Suave professionals line is on par with a lot of the more expensive products out there.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much thicker due to the Argan oil that is found in the products.  </li>
            <li>I have found my new hair products, now I have to try the lotion and dry oil body spray!</li>
            <li>My hair also felt very soft, but not any differently than other Suave Professionals products.</li>

            <li> Plus they smell amazing.:)</li>
            <li> They also smell amazing and leave my hair nice, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have tried many argan oil products that worked great but were at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> A great price for the large size bottles and tube of product.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I use the regular conditioner for my cowash and i am impressed....</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> When I found this set on Amazon, I was really impressed with the price, I still haven&#x27;t used the deep conditioner or shine spray</li>
            <li> but I am sure they both work just as well as the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love these products.  </li>
            <li> my hsir shiny &amp; healthy is a lot to ask for in a hsir care product.</li>
            <li> But i believe i found all that &amp; more in this Sauve product.  </li>
            <li> &amp; i think you&#x27;ll finc all the thingd it says it does &amp; more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a range of products from a variety of prices- from the top end stuff you find at the department stores to the cheapest of the cheapo stuff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Box reads $14 VALUE, it shouldn&#x27;t be going for more.</li>
            <li> But I used Suave products before and was satisfied every time.</li>
            <li> If you have curls or very wavy hair, this could be great for you.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> i had to buy more....</li>
            <li> The oil serum you just need like a quarter size and it will surely spread well.</li>
            <li> love this collection.  </li>
            <li> as a former salon owner, I am impressed,  Suave!</li>
            <li> I think it is more like 12.6 ounces.</li>
            <li> 126 ounces  would be a lot of shampoo :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> and it also make it smell good and fresh</li>
            <li> In addition, the conditioner is very rich and truly assists me with any knots that may arise.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and suitable for the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> The products not only improved my hair quality but they also smell amazing and leave my hair smelling great all day even after styling.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of product for such a cheap and good price!!</li>
            <li> moisturizes  and most importantly leave my hair smelling like an exotic trip to view Moorish</li>
            <li> This is a good product and such a good deal for all that you get.</li>
            <li> its great to use before your blow dry your hair as your hair remains with a nice gloss and its very light weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves her hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> Marvelous thing, won&#x27;t buy any other product any more, from now on is suave everything for me...</li>
            <li> My hair is incredibly soft and smells great after using this set.</li>
            <li> The quality of Suave Professionals is significantly better than their regular Shampoo, and the styling oil is great for shiny and healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> My hair still smells great the day after I wash it, and makes it so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Argon hair oil really conditions my super curly hair and makes it easy to straighten, and smells nice to boot!</li>
            <li> So I think it may end up in my own Christmas stocking ;)</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried a ton of conditioners, this deep conditioning mask is by far the best, we use it as a regular conditioner, just leave it on a bit longer to get best results.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but lots of it.  </li>
            <li> This product is such a great buy..</li>
            <li> your hair is light and shiny after just one use.</li>
            <li> Its so light that I used 10 pumps</li>
            <li> They are all full size, have a great smell, and make hair soft shiny and full.</li>
            <li> You save about $6 from Target prices and free shipping with Prime, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the real Moroccan Oil products without paying nearly as much!</li>
            <li> These bottle are huge and full size.</li>
            <li> The texture of the shampoo is creamy and rich.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair so soft and smooth and the scent is warm and comfortable if you can imagine that.  </li>
            <li> Including a very effective and clarifying shampoo, these hair products leave my normally dry hair smooth, moisturized, and conditioned.</li>
            <li> your scalp is clean for</li>
            <li> I loooooooooooooooooooooooooove this stuff it make me feel like my hair is so clean</li>
            <li> I am honestly amazed that after 2 washes it now feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Made my daughter&#x27;s hair shiny, soft, and a lot more manageable!</li>
            <li> specially when is sold in $99 stores too!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This Suave line of Argan Oil products works just as well if not better than their higher priced competitors!!!!!!</li>
            <li> my hair is so soft and the shine is amazing....</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and conditioned my hair making it soft.</li>
            <li> and the deep conditioner is a good produst also..</li>
            <li> Overall, good product, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect such a good product from suave.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, but she likes it better than what we have been using.</li>
            <li> Oh this makes my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> love this so much</li>
            <li> Full sizes.</li>
            <li> The oil makes my hair soft, adds shine and most importantly tames my locks.</li>
            <li> Love the new lotion.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Leaves a very pleasant and long lasting fruity scent too.</li>
            <li> Moroccan shine oil, which is light and gentle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These products are excellent, however the scent is very nutty and remains a maximum of at least 4 days in your hair.</li>
            <li> all of the products in the gift pack are full size and work exactly as the product and the seller advertised.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the wait</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner and rich and thick and smell great.</li>
            <li> This line is excellent, but in particular the Moroccan deep conditioning mask, it is great for biracial hair types that tend to be dry and thick, comes out soft and shiny, just love it!</li>
            <li> I have even discovered that a quick smoothing of the conditioner over my skin before I rinse off in the shower makes my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this to my daughter because I have very fine short hair</li>
            <li> But... for me, not so hot.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t always have to use the most expensive products to have a good result.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Same is true of this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> Large bottles and long-term use.</li>
            <li> Its great, all you have to do is apply to your wet or dry hair then style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little gift for every lady.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from migraines that are triggered by scents, I highly recommend checking this out in a store first.</li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re very affordable.</li>
            <li> It has too much oil in it.</li>
            <li> As I didn&#x27;t use in myself I can&#x27;t really tell so much.</li>
            <li> but i fear too much would make my hair a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really give the hair oil a chance because the scent was strongest in that item.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this purchase, as this is the hot new thing for hair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing it will make your hair shine , less frizzy, , soft</li>
            <li> These are very high-quality items!!!!!I plan on purchasing a few more of these sets to stock up and as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> The main problem I have with this set is the smell.</li>
            <li> Really improves natural stylability!</li>
            <li> I am of Afro-Caribbean/ West Indian descent and my hair is highly textured,  a mix between wavy and curly.</li>
            <li> a new hero is in town.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> But my first purchase was oil infusion and only after that I decided to try all products.</li>
            <li> This set is truly a higher end quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> I am a die hard for sure and highly reccomand it to all...</li>
            <li> This product is a sufficient for hair cleansing, but if you are sensitive to smell...or rather, if you cannot tolerate a strong and very long lasting perfume bubble around your head all day, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I often find that my hair seems too flat if I use this consistently.  </li>
            <li> It works for my hair, which is fine and limp.  </li>
            <li> The price well, do NOT let it fool you not to give much attention to this modestly packaged and redicolusly low priced product</li>
            <li> but once you apply it and leave it in for about 3 mins then rinse your hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> My mom and I really like the deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is wavy.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair shiny and soft without the cost of salon products.</li>
            <li> Too soft.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong and sometimes gives me a migraine, so I am unable to use this very often.</li>
            <li> I have been using this several weeks now and my hair is very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter who has very curly hard to control hair... has left it much softer easier to manage and very shiny.</li>
            <li> have naturally black, straight, normal hair.</li>
            <li> My son has thick wavy hair, his hair after 10 mins with the deep conditioning mask (that we use as regular conditioner) ends up super soft and wispy, the waves in his hair are much looser afterwards which he says he likes.</li>
            <li> This product leaves hair feeling thick but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave hair soft and full of knots . . .</li>
            <li> To my surprise,  I have to say this new Suave professionals line is on par with a lot of the more expensive products out there.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much thicker due to the Argan oil that is found in the products.  </li>
            <li> I have found my new hair products, now I have to try the lotion and dry oil body spray!</li>
            <li> My hair also felt very soft, but not any differently than other Suave Professionals products.</li>
            <li> It will make your hair flat and feeling like you shampooed with crisco.  </li>
            <li> it would protect my hair from heat elements from my hair dryer, flat iron, and after coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> I have around bra strap length hair when straightened with a flat iron and shoulder blade length hair when it&#x27;s in its curly state.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use conditioner because my hair ends up being too flat.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo finally quenches the thirst of my dry, dry</li>
            <li> I style my hair every day with heat (blow dry, flat iron, curl wand, etc).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the white hairs are of a slightly different texture than the black hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something to moisturize and tame my naturally frizzy mediterranean hair.</li>
            <li> This line definitely keeps my hair softer and shinier than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> i have very long hair &amp; finding a product</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who have dry hair.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your hair dry feeling</li>
            <li> It used to be dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and damaged from years of bleaching.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dense, straight, black Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product if you have course, wavy or thick hair.  </li>
            <li> i have very dry hair</li>
            <li> It has a perfume like smell that is a little different, but I like it.  </li>
            <li> No move out of the way propaganda and fancy packaging</li>
            <li> and it never left my hair heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> Not much oil content</li>
            <li> My hair is unprocessed with any color or straightening treatments.</li>
            <li> left that on for 3- 5 minutes in the shower, then conditioned finger combed my hair and dried my hair with a towel.</li>
            <li> The way that I used it was first doing a deep conditioner mask with my avocado hair treatment on my dry dirty hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner works well and actually makes my thick coarse hair softer, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> and it does not create that tangling effect like other shampoos does.</li>
            <li> oil alone is pretty expensive...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other products in the gift set.  </li>
            <li> at least the next four days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half now</li>
            <li> i sa little to dring but its</li>
            <li> I ordered this little gift for my mom-in-law</li>
            <li> I have weird hair that develops a funk if I don&#x27;t wash it daily, is dry as a desert and lacks shine.  </li>
            <li> beatuful hair after every wash a ton of money to go waste on some thing else...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extra thin for a while......</li>
            <li> My hair is on the thicker side, and heavy.  </li>
            <li> No more breakage or split ends.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable shine and softness.  </li>
            <li> Teenage daughter is bi-racial, and Ive tried all sorts of hair care products, including the REALLY expensive one that starts with a W.</li>
            <li> Very limp.  </li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner set because it includes the hair mask which is hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> I use the styling oil the least.</li>
            <li> I did that for at least 30 minutes, then showered, shampoo (2X) with this product, then applied the air mask</li>
            <li> /&gt;Circumstances forced me to use &#x27;someone&#x27; else&#x27;s shampoo and  condition.  </li>
            <li> I have used the expensive moroccan oil, but find very little difference with the oil in this kit-possibly a little lighter feel on the hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive to buy as a kit than separately.</li>
            <li> I think they did make my hair slightly shiner but also caused my hair to feel dirty quicker because of the oils in the products.</li>
            <li> but i was wrong..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the smell of this!</li>
            <li> I have been getting a morracon oil product from my salon and it was expensive</li>
            <li> I Choose suave for my hair and it wasn&#x27;t a bad idea because now my hair shine and became longer than before.</li>
            <li> and i have not been disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Including a very effective and clarifying shampoo, these hair products leave my normally dry hair smooth, moisturized, and conditioned. My strands have bounce and elasticity. Plus they&#x27;re very affordable. Large bottles and long-term use. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have tried many argan oil products that worked great but were at a much higher price. This Suave line of Argan Oil products works just as well if not better than their higher priced competitors!!!!!! I have used the shampoo and styling oil on my kid&#x27;s hair and I absolutely love the results!!!!!!!! The smell is pretty amazing too!!!!!!!! Don&#x27;t let the price fool you! These are very high-quality items!!!!!I plan on purchasing a few more of these sets to stock up and as Christmas gifts. Please do not ever discontinue carrying this set Amazon!!!!!!  :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this several weeks now and my hair is very soft and manageable.  It is so shiny and smells great too.  My hair feels so much thicker due to the Argan oil that is found in the products.  A great price for the large size bottles and tube of product.</li>
            <li> If you have oily hair (like I do) then this product is not for you.  It will make your hair flat and feeling like you shampooed with crisco.  I bought this thinking it would protect my hair from heat elements from my hair dryer, flat iron, and after coloring my hair. Not recommended for oily hair.  It has too much oil in it.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of growing out my perm and i thought i would like the oil but i was wrong.. The oil in this was not that great .. I like the conditioners though. I use the regular conditioner for my cowash and i am impressed.... the smpoo i sa little to dring but its okay and the deep conditioner is a good produst also..</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal. Just as good as the real Moroccan Oil products without paying nearly as much! I style my hair every day with heat (blow dry, flat iron, curl wand, etc). I use all 4 products intermittently. My hair is so much more manageable. It looks healthier and shinier than I can ever remember. I shower with it every day. I use the deep conditioner twice a week. I use the styling oil the least. The products not only improved my hair quality but they also smell amazing and leave my hair smelling great all day even after styling. I also use It&#x27;s a 10 with Keratin daily following this treatment. 100% recommend to anyone, this is the only product I have ever used that leaves my hair looking like the commercial says it will.</li>
            <li> This is a good value for this gift set.  It has a perfume like smell that is a little different, but I like it.  It does seem to do well on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great gift set just wish the packaging wasn&#x27;t damaged! Oh well I hope my sister in law still likes it</li>
            <li> I had purchased the Moroccan Infusion Shine shampoo and conditioner before and absolutely loved them. My hair is incredibly soft and smells great after using this set. I get compliments all the time on my hair. When I found this set on Amazon, I was really impressed with the price, I still haven&#x27;t used the deep conditioner or shine spray but I am sure they both work just as well as the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love these products.  I have fine hair, but lots of it.  Really improves natural stylability!</li>
            <li> The price well, do NOT let it fool you not to give much attention to this modestly packaged and redicolusly low priced product specially when is sold in $99 stores too!&lt;br /&gt;But in the face of all those $20 + product such as bed head, aveeno and etc that leaves you almost $50 shorter each time, and the result, errr.. No move out of the way propaganda and fancy packaging a new hero is in town.&lt;br /&gt;Well done to founder and what they delivered. Marvelous thing, won&#x27;t buy any other product any more, from now on is suave everything for me... I am a die hard for sure and highly reccomand it to all...&lt;br /&gt;A beatuful hair after every wash a ton of money to go waste on some thing else...</li>
            <li> i have very long hair &amp; finding a product thst cleans, detangles &amp; mskes my hsir shiny &amp; healthy is a lot to ask for in a hsir care product. But i believe i found all that &amp; more in this Sauve product.  The price  great &amp; i think you&#x27;ll finc all the thingd it says it does &amp; more.</li>
            <li> This product is such a great buy..&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally black, straight, normal hair. I have used products such as Matrix Sleek, Head and Shoulders, Dove, Treseme, Palmolive and I must say I have never gotten the results that I got from one use of these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The shampoo and conditioner and rich and thick and smell great. your hair is light and shiny after just one use. your scalp is clean for at least the next four days.&lt;br /&gt;2. The deep shine conditioner is not only creamy but once you apply it and leave it in for about 3 mins then rinse your hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;3. The styling oil, well all I can say is this product is so versatile you can use it as a moisturizer as well. Its so light that I used 10 pumps (recommended amount 2-3) and it never left my hair heavy and oily. Its great, all you have to do is apply to your wet or dry hair then style. its great to use before your blow dry your hair as your hair remains with a nice gloss and its very light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are excellent, however the scent is very nutty and remains a maximum of at least 4 days in your hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve used a range of products from a variety of prices- from the top end stuff you find at the department stores to the cheapest of the cheapo stuff. I&#x27;m always looking for something to moisturize and tame my naturally frizzy mediterranean hair. To my surprise,  I have to say this new Suave professionals line is on par with a lot of the more expensive products out there. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half now and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the results. After shampooing my hair, I alternate between using the mask and the conditioner- they both work wonderfully. I then towel drying my hair and I comb through a couple pumps of the argan oil that comes with the set and it has done wonders to my hair. The oil makes my hair soft, adds shine and most importantly tames my locks. Later in the day, or for next day curls, I&#x27;ve been sometimes adding pump of the oil and fingering it through my hair, just to help redefine my curls  Go for it! I&#x27;m coming back to get another box, especially since my local drugstore doesn&#x27;t carry the oil or mask.  For $10, you can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 10/31/13: FYI the price was just jacked up to $24. This Suave set was going for $10 just a week ago.  Box reads $14 VALUE, it shouldn&#x27;t be going for more.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my hair</li>
            <li> Nice packaging if giving as a gift.  Good product if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. Does the trick</li>
            <li> It came on time with no damages. On the packaging it says you can put in the moroccan argon oil in with the conditioner to add an extra deep conditioning ( which I never knew you could do). The shampoo and conditioner made my hair softer and shiner. My mom and I really like the deep conditioning treatment. Overall, good product, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this with the oil as well! I got a lot of product for such a cheap and good price!! These bottle are huge and full size. They also smell amazing and leave my hair nice, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> Excellent deal. Great shampoo. Didn&#x27;t expect such a good product from suave. The styling oil is very nice and light doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy. Smells divine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; shampoo for the last 10 years or so.  Wouldn&#x27;t change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Circumstances forced me to use &#x27;someone&#x27; else&#x27;s shampoo and  condition.  Not this brand but this formulation.  Infusion Argan Oil.  Loved how it tamed my super fine fly away hair.  And beautiful moisture and shine are a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this because I felt it was a great price and way to try Suave brand.  WOW!!!!!  I only had the shampoo/conditioner before.  The oil is so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now that  my hair fell out from the anesthia it&#x27;s extra thin for a while......Made a world of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it 6 months now.  I have left over &#x27;P&#x27; tuff.........gonna have to figure out what to do with it, because I am not going back to it.</li>
            <li> This set its just the perfect hair tamer and shiny perfection for the dollar.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it.  You wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this little gift for my mom-in-law and she liked it. It&#x27;s a nice little gift for every lady. As I didn&#x27;t use in myself I can&#x27;t really tell so much. But I used Suave products before and was satisfied every time.</li>
            <li> It had my hair frizzy. I did like how the deep conditioner had my hair feeling but the rest of it was no use to me.</li>
            <li> This gift pack is awesome. Came on time and well packaged. Gave one as a gift and kept one for me. The quality of Suave Professionals is significantly better than their regular Shampoo, and the styling oil is great for shiny and healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> This line definitely keeps my hair softer and shinier than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  However, it almost does too good of a job at giving me sleek hair.  I often find that my hair seems too flat if I use this consistently.  I started using it 1-2 times per week and alternating with another shampoo.  My natural hair is wavy.  If you have curls or very wavy hair, this could be great for you.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It works for my hair, which is fine and limp.  Not much oil content but i fear too much would make my hair a bit greasy.  Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> 5 star because I bought on sale! Good value,  quality and price.  But my first purchase was oil infusion and only after that I decided to try all products.</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals 4 Piece Moroccan Infusion Shine Gift Set is a great gift set. It&#x27;s less expensive to buy as a kit than separately. The Kit contains 1(126 ounce) Moroccan shine shampoo, 1 (126 ounce) Moroccan shine conditioner, 1 (8 ounce) Moroccan deep conditioning mask, 1 (3 ounce) Moroccan shine oil, which is light and gentle. I use this and have given to others as gifts with great results. A good value.</li>
            <li> Great to give as a gift or get for yourself and enjoy</li>
            <li> I LOVE these products! I was skeptical because of the price but I got them and they work so well. They are all full size, have a great smell, and make hair soft shiny and full. The oil is so nice for keeping my hair extentions from splitting as well. Thanks so much! I will be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> Has a terrific Smell....Purchased for my daughter who has very curly hard to control hair... has left it much softer easier to manage and very shiny.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves her hair shiny and soft! Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, but she likes it better than what we have been using.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t always have to use the most expensive products to have a good result. suave proved that. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> GREAT VALUE!  I like this shampoo and conditioner set because it includes the hair mask which is hard to find in my area. This shampoo and conditioner works well and actually makes my thick coarse hair softer, without weighing it down. I would recommend this product for anyone who have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Oh this makes my hair nice and soft.  It smells great with nice conditioning!</li>
            <li> best product ever....my hair is so soft and the shine is amazing....love this so much i had to buy more....</li>
            <li> Got this for mom as an extra Christmas gift. She loves it because her hair looks and feels like she was about to do a commercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 will be for Mom again.</li>
            <li> This line is excellent, but in particular the Moroccan deep conditioning mask, it is great for biracial hair types that tend to be dry and thick, comes out soft and shiny, just love it! My son has thick wavy hair, his hair after 10 mins with the deep conditioning mask (that we use as regular conditioner) ends up super soft and wispy, the waves in his hair are much looser afterwards which he says he likes. We&#x27;ve tried a ton of conditioners, this deep conditioning mask is by far the best, we use it as a regular conditioner, just leave it on a bit longer to get best results.</li>
            <li> I am of Afro-Caribbean/ West Indian descent and my hair is highly textured,  a mix between wavy and curly. My hair is unprocessed with any color or straightening treatments. I have around bra strap length hair when straightened with a flat iron and shoulder blade length hair when it&#x27;s in its curly state. This set is truly a higher end quality for a low price. I have always loved suave from when i was a kid but this treatment and set really is amazing. The texture of the shampoo is creamy and rich. It does not leave your hair dry feeling and it does not create that tangling effect like other shampoos does. In addition, the conditioner is very rich and truly assists me with any knots that may arise. The hair mask was great as well as the shine oil serum. The oil serum you just need like a quarter size and it will surely spread well. I must say I am completely impressed. It smells amazing and conditioned my hair making it soft. My roller set looked amazing. The way that I used it was first doing a deep conditioner mask with my avocado hair treatment on my dry dirty hair. I did that for at least 30 minutes, then showered, shampoo (2X) with this product, then applied the air mask left that on for 3- 5 minutes in the shower, then conditioned finger combed my hair and dried my hair with a towel. I used the oil serum on my hair after I took my rollers out and it produced amazing results.</li>
            <li> Great product! Even better price! Leaves your hair shiny and soft without the cost of salon products. I will continue using!</li>
            <li> I have weird hair that develops a funk if I don&#x27;t wash it daily, is dry as a desert and lacks shine.  The Moroccan Infusion Shine collection cleans, conditions, moisturizes  and most importantly leave my hair smelling like an exotic trip to view Moorish architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this collection.  I no longer have to wash my hair daily.  No more breakage or split ends.  Unbelievable shine and softness.  This shampoo finally quenches the thirst of my dry, dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you have course, wavy or thick hair.  Girls we need our moisturizers and this is definitely the answer to thirsty, thirsty hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a sufficient for hair cleansing, but if you are sensitive to smell...or rather, if you cannot tolerate a strong and very long lasting perfume bubble around your head all day, this is not the product for you. It is cheap and suitable for the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the smell of this! My hair still smells great the day after I wash it, and makes it so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> They thought of everything for this gift set. I don&#x27;t think my mom will use the deep conditioning mask... So I think it may end up in my own Christmas stocking ;)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. it leaves my hair so soft and smooth and the scent is warm and comfortable if you can imagine that.  I have even discovered that a quick smoothing of the conditioner over my skin before I rinse off in the shower makes my skin very soft and smooth. It used to be dry and flaky.  So I WILL be buying more of this!</li>
            <li> Perfect for all hair types ( mines oily ) and what a great deal! all of the products in the gift pack are full size and work exactly as the product and the seller advertised. I have found my new hair products, now I have to try the lotion and dry oil body spray!</li>
            <li> I Choose suave for my hair and it wasn&#x27;t a bad idea because now my hair shine and became longer than before. I would recommend this product at all my friend</li>
            <li> Teenage daughter is bi-racial, and Ive tried all sorts of hair care products, including the REALLY expensive one that starts with a W. She prefers Suave to everything we&#x27;ve ever tried. Id recommend this in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff more then anything!! The smell is amazing!! And I get alot of compliments on how good it smells!</li>
            <li> I have used the expensive moroccan oil, but find very little difference with the oil in this kit-possibly a little lighter feel on the hair.  I absolutely love the way the shampoo and conditioner smell on my hair all day!  Now, just want a hair spray to go with the product...haven&#x27;t seen one yet!</li>
            <li> This is a great price on these items! The Argon hair oil really conditions my super curly hair and makes it easy to straighten, and smells nice to boot! I like the deep conditioner quite a bit, too. The scent of all the products is wonderful,  and they work well... as a former salon owner, I am impressed,  Suave!</li>
            <li> This product leaves hair feeling thick but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave hair soft and full of knots . . .</li>
            <li> Made my daughter&#x27;s hair shiny, soft, and a lot more manageable!</li>
            <li> The shampoo, conditioners and oil are great products.  They smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The oil alone is pretty expensive...the set is a great price.  This is a great product by Suave.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI before you buy. This product is listed as being 126 ounce size shampoo and conditioner. I think it is more like 12.6 ounces. 126 ounces  would be a lot of shampoo :)</li>
            <li> Great set!  I have been getting a morracon oil product from my salon and it was expensive so I decided to try this Suave collection out and I love it.  You save about $6 from Target prices and free shipping with Prime, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I loooooooooooooooooooooooooove this stuff it make me feel like my hair is so clean and it also make it smell good and fresh</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner products worked well. I think they did make my hair slightly shiner but also caused my hair to feel dirty quicker because of the oils in the products. My hair also felt very soft, but not any differently than other Suave Professionals products. The main problem I have with this set is the smell. The scent is very strong and sometimes gives me a migraine, so I am unable to use this very often. I couldn&#x27;t really give the hair oil a chance because the scent was strongest in that item. (I used it once and could smell it all night so I was hesitant to use it again) I will likely be giving this away to my friends. If you suffer from migraines that are triggered by scents, I highly recommend checking this out in a store first.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing it will make your hair shine , less frizzy, , soft, it is  a  wonderful product you must buy this you will not be disappointed! !</li>
            <li> this is a great set. this is the best shampoo and conditioner i have ever used. my friend told me about the product and i have not been disappointed. i have very dry hair and this product has been great for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair is dry and damaged from years of bleaching. I am honestly amazed that after 2 washes it now feels soft and smooth. Im from Australia and we don&#x27;t have this brand here. Definitely worth the wait and I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Shampoo, conditioner and shine-mask works great/ Have not used the oil yet. Leaves a very pleasant and long lasting fruity scent too.</li>
            <li> great value for my money</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing.  I have the entire line, and use it constantly.  Love the new lotion.  Can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> Item was as described. This is a good seller.This is a good product and such a good deal for all that you get.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product line!! I use it on myself and the kids, and it leaves my kids hair soft and smelly great! The oil is excellent in keeping my kids hair moisturized. Love, Love, Love!!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this purchase, as this is the hot new thing for hair.  But... for me, not so hot.  It left my hair shiny, but unmanageable.  Very limp.  Too soft. My hair is on the thicker side, and heavy.  I can&#x27;t use conditioner because my hair ends up being too flat.  Same is true of this shampoo!  I haven&#x27;t tried the other products in the gift set.  Will do during a weekend when I don&#x27;t care what my hair looks like.  Price was good for trying the product.  Full sizes.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dense, straight, black Asian hair.  I&#x27;m finally starting to get white hairs.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the white hairs are of a slightly different texture than the black hairs.  This set really helps to condition the few white hairs and even out their texture.  The coconut scent is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I feel like these are seriousley some of the best hair care products at this price!They offer so many nice qualties.Shinyness, moisture, an a lot more! Plus they smell amazing.:)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo set. I ended up giving this to my daughter because I have very fine short hair and it did tend to over condition my hair.It does smell wonderful.</li>
