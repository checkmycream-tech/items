    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>best stuff in the world 5th time order.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the perfect bronzer or blush, then this is it, but don&#x27;t buy it as an all over makeup.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for on the go, etc.</li>
            <li>i love it !!</li>
            <li>I was always told how healthy and great I looked!!  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and the results are impressive.</li>
            <li>Although the powder feels fairly pleasant on the skin and has a good \\&quot;slip\\&quot; (it spreads well and distributes fairly evenly)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly cheap-feeling to me</li>
            <li>However, in order to give the product a fair review, I kept trying.    </li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t use it anymore if I want good coverage.</li>
            <li>It does not cover anything, or look good as a foundation.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a makeup artist for many years and haven&#x27;t come across a product that works as well as this one and for every age/ethnicity!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t find it works well there, but amazing on face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for her skin type and really does look natural.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Firstly, the brush doesn&#x27;t feel very good quality.  </li>
            <li>And I am pleased to say that this product does not irritate my skin and does cover it nicely.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, arrived in good packing.</li>
            <li>No matter what I tried, I just couldn&#x27;t get this makeup to look attractive on my skin colour and tone, despite the fact that my current tan makes me a fairly \\&quot;normal\\&quot; colour.    </li>
            <li>Love this product - will continue to purchase through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>greatprice and love this</li>
            <li>I wore the product every day on a rainy vacation without touching it up, and it never washed off until I took it off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s stunning.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m  satisfied with the look.</li>
            <li>At first sight the product looks good quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still nice for a quick powder</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of this product.  </li>
            <li>But if you want that glow all year around, lightly brush all over your face/</li>
            <li>Up until this last purchase I have been extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>It does give your skin a nice natural glow</li>
            <li>And when I don&#x27;t have to have a full face of makeup</li>
            <li>it is wonderful...and quick...</li>
            <li>This is by far the best blush/bronzer I have ever used, and I have spent hundreds of dollars on a products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seamless, is great on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Go Natural</li>
            <li>Not only does it sit lightly on your face, but it gives pale skin a beautiful shimmer!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product came quickly and was just what she expected.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>What I like is that the color is self adjusting so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you got the right shade or not.</li>
            <li>I still have not found the right blush to use with the blush look of the all in one.</li>
            <li>but if you use this right, it does what it says--</li>
            <li>This product really gives my skin a healthy and natural look.  </li>
            <li>is quick and easy for me to apply and it&#x27;s just enough makeup for my face.</li>
            <li>I usually only apply now to my cheeks, chin and top of my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I do makeup for weddings and our local news team as well as photo shoots and have worked with a few celebrities in the business and have referred them all to this amazing product that many of my clients use today.</li>
            <li>Good color, long lasting.</li>
            <li>I am a senior citizen and really feel that it makes my face look young and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>i really like this stuff for my natural/every day/at work/at home look... going out,  </li>
            <li>If too much powder got on one area, I swept again or used my fingers.</li>
            <li>applied with a very light hand, starting with the tiny brush on areas</li>
            <li>However, since I switched to more natural skincare and makeup, I&#x27;ve had no acne or other blemishes.    </li>
            <li>Two days later, I woke to find I had some cystic acne for the first time in about 5 years!  </li>
            <li>The All in One Cosmetic Magic Mineral Makeup ... just following the directions you really do not need anything else except maybe a blush ...</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and this is all that I need too look completely natural whenever I go out!!  </li>
            <li>only reservation is that the powder, though self-correcting, does not seem to be an exact match for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old, with medium-fair Caucasian skin and brown eyes/hair.</li>
            <li>Go Natural</li>
            <li>Given my current interest in simple and natural makeup, when an American friend sent me a Go-Natural compact to try out I was very excited at the idea that one simple product could revolutionise my makeup bag and simplify my cosmetic routine.    </li>
            <li>Such a shame , had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin which is currently carrying a light tan for the first time ever, and I have relatively sensitive skin which is slightly dry and used to break out.  </li>
            <li>I tried several attempts, always applying with a reasonably light hand as described on the website, but whatever I did I ended up with a dark, orangey, mask-like appearance that was nothing short of hideous.    </li>
            <li>I have been using Go Natural for several years.  </li>
            <li>I ONLY use go natural and mascara.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it adds just the right amount of glow.</li>
            <li>The entire solid powder inside was broken up into a fine powder, like baby powder.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am a long time customer of Amazon and thought maybe you could do something to help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Elaine</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I apply it lightly enough that I don&#x27;t look orange, but I do have to be careful to blend well at the edges.</li>
            <li> I ordered Go Natural through Amazon a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> Go to the store and buy pressed or loose powder!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> You have to NOT put it on heavily, or you WILL look probably strange...</li>
            <li> It not do any of the other things promised.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my granddaughter because I didn&#x27;t have time to mess with returning it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m used to Everyday Minerals brushes) and just doesn&#x27;t feel luxurious.  </li>
            <li> Not at all as advertised, waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The reality, unfortunately, was very different.    </li>
            <li> and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I spent for this crap that leaves my face red!!!!</li>
            <li> This item was marked non returnable, so I am trying to use it as is, but it is very difficult.  </li>
            <li> I could hardly get it to stick to the brush, so there was no danger of over applying it.</li>
            <li> Hardly noticed the difference .</li>
            <li> It is not good as a foundation or anything else.</li>
            <li> I got sick and tired of wasting my money on all different kinds of liquid makeups and never finding a color that matches my skin.  </li>
            <li> I then dipped the brush in the powder (the cake had broken in my luggage), tapped off the excess, and rapidly swept the brush over my face in circular motions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read negative comments, and that&#x27;s just too bad.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate the product, I hate how it was damaged when I received it.  </li>
            <li> Altogether, I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it looked absolutely terrible when finished.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I swear by this. It is so easy to use and the results are impressive. If you want just a simple look, this is the product for you. If you are after dramatic/evening makeup then you will want to use eyeliner, mascara, etc in addition to this. What I like is that the color is self adjusting so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you got the right shade or not.</li>
            <li> For the record, I&#x27;m an English woman of Irish extraction.  I have pale skin which is currently carrying a light tan for the first time ever, and I have relatively sensitive skin which is slightly dry and used to break out.  However, since I switched to more natural skincare and makeup, I&#x27;ve had no acne or other blemishes.    Given my current interest in simple and natural makeup, when an American friend sent me a Go-Natural compact to try out I was very excited at the idea that one simple product could revolutionise my makeup bag and simplify my cosmetic routine.    The reality, unfortunately, was very different.    At first sight the product looks good quality.  The compact would look at home in any woman&#x27;s makeup case, and seems to be well-suited to its purpose.    I moisturised my skin, let the cream absorb for about 15 minutes, then gently brushed the powder on with the brush provided.  Firstly, the brush doesn&#x27;t feel very good quality.  It&#x27;s fairly cheap-feeling to me (I&#x27;m used to Everyday Minerals brushes) and just doesn&#x27;t feel luxurious.  However, in order to give the product a fair review, I kept trying.    Although the powder feels fairly pleasant on the skin and has a good \\&quot;slip\\&quot; (it spreads well and distributes fairly evenly) it looked absolutely terrible when finished.  I tried several attempts, always applying with a reasonably light hand as described on the website, but whatever I did I ended up with a dark, orangey, mask-like appearance that was nothing short of hideous.    No matter what I tried, I just couldn&#x27;t get this makeup to look attractive on my skin colour and tone, despite the fact that my current tan makes me a fairly \\&quot;normal\\&quot; colour.    Two days later, I woke to find I had some cystic acne for the first time in about 5 years!  I was breaking out on my chin and forehead.  The only new item I had tried in the previous couple of weeks was the Go-Natural makeup, so it must have been that.    Altogether, I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I wanted to lovethis product, but just couldn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s sitting in my makeup drawer waiting for someone to take it off my hands.</li>
            <li> I have been using Go Natural for several years.  I love it!  I am a senior citizen and really feel that it makes my face look young and fresh.  I have even started my daughter using it.b</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time....very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all. Not worth the money I spent for this crap that leaves my face red!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate the product, I hate how it was damaged when I received it.  The entire solid powder inside was broken up into a fine powder, like baby powder.  It is suppose to be a solid compacted powder that will last several months.  This item was marked non returnable, so I am trying to use it as is, but it is very difficult.  I am a long time customer of Amazon and thought maybe you could do something to help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Elaine</li>
            <li> Love this product - will continue to purchase through Amazon.  Good color, long lasting.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Go Natural The All in One Cosmetic Magic Mineral Makeup ... just following the directions you really do not need anything else except maybe a blush ... I still have not found the right blush to use with the blush look of the all in one.</li>
            <li> have used this for years</li>
            <li> Love this product! Shipping was quick, arrived in good packing.</li>
            <li> greatprice and love this</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for a long time.  I will continue to use it in the future.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> This product really gives my skin a healthy and natural look.  Very long lasting and I use it everyday! Try it!!</li>
            <li> best stuff in the world 5th time order. i am 66 and this does wonders</li>
            <li> i really like this stuff for my natural/every day/at work/at home look... going out,  i might use something else but if you use this right, it does what it says-- took me a couple times to get the hang of it but it&#x27;s great for on the go, etc.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful...and quick...i love it !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old, with medium-fair Caucasian skin and brown eyes/hair. My skin reacts to everything. And I am pleased to say that this product does not irritate my skin and does cover it nicely. I wore the product every day on a rainy vacation without touching it up, and it never washed off until I took it off. With the addition only of mascara and a colored lip balm, I looked put-together every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied with a very light hand, starting with the tiny brush on areas I wanted to conceal. I then dipped the brush in the powder (the cake had broken in my luggage), tapped off the excess, and rapidly swept the brush over my face in circular motions. If too much powder got on one area, I swept again or used my fingers. Total time: about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reservation is that the powder, though self-correcting, does not seem to be an exact match for my skin. I apply it lightly enough that I don&#x27;t look orange, but I do have to be careful to blend well at the edges.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of this product.  Having gone thru breast cancer now twice, this powder does wonders!  Not only does it sit lightly on your face, but it gives pale skin a beautiful shimmer!  I was always told how healthy and great I looked!!  And ALWAYS had compliments on the shimmer, especially in the sun.  I&#x27;ve read negative comments, and that&#x27;s just too bad.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different.&lt;br /&gt;But I will be buying I believe my 3rd one soon.  These last forever, thank God.  You have to NOT put it on heavily, or you WILL look probably strange...which goes to say for anything makeup.  So please keep that in mind when applying.  I usually only apply now to my cheeks, chin and top of my forehead.  But if you want that glow all year around, lightly brush all over your face/neck.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s stunning.</li>
            <li> My mother has been using this for years. It&#x27;s perfect for her skin type and really does look natural.&lt;br /&gt;When she couldn&#x27;t find it in her catalogue anymore, she asked me to help.&lt;br /&gt;The product came quickly and was just what she expected.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now. This time when I purchased it, the powder was lighter in color and doesn&#x27;t cover as well as before.  It&#x27;s still nice for a quick powder but I won&#x27;t use it anymore if I want good coverage. I would definitely recommend trying it, everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  Up until this last purchase I have been extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since the1990&#x27;s. A little goes a long way, it adds just the right amount of glow.</li>
            <li> Go to the store and buy pressed or loose powder! For this price it actually did nothing! My pores looked bigger and it is not for every type of skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered Go Natural through Amazon a few months ago.  I got sick and tired of wasting my money on all different kinds of liquid makeups and never finding a color that matches my skin.  Go Natural is quick and easy for me to apply and it&#x27;s just enough makeup for my face. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do any of the things I thought it would. There was no coverage to speak of. I could hardly get it to stick to the brush, so there was no danger of over applying it. I was very disappointed. I gave it to my granddaughter because I didn&#x27;t have time to mess with returning it. Would not recommend it. Way overpriced .</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blush/bronzer I have ever used, and I have spent hundreds of dollars on a products. It is not good as a foundation or anything else. It does give your skin a nice natural glow but that is all you can expect from this product. It not do any of the other things promised. It does not cover anything, or look good as a foundation. It is so pink, that no one has natural skin color like that, unless they have a disorder. If you are looking for the perfect bronzer or blush, then this is it, but don&#x27;t buy it as an all over makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it. I was pleased with product and I don&#x27;t spend lots of time doing make up. Five minutes and I&#x27;m  satisfied with the look.</li>
            <li> This was to replace the last one I had.  It works so well and only need one compact to do it all!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and will continue. I don&#x27;t use for lip color or eyebrow. Don&#x27;t find it works well there, but amazing on face.  I do use an under eye brightener before powder. .</li>
            <li> Hardly noticed the difference . Would have returned it, but couldn&#x27;t be bothered. Not at all as advertised, waste of money.  Such a shame , had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a makeup artist for many years and haven&#x27;t come across a product that works as well as this one and for every age/ethnicity!  I do makeup for weddings and our local news team as well as photo shoots and have worked with a few celebrities in the business and have referred them all to this amazing product that many of my clients use today. It&#x27;s seamless, is great on sensitive skin and I use it to contour as well. And when I don&#x27;t have to have a full face of makeup I ONLY use go natural and mascara. A must try!!!!</li>
            <li> I would never use anything else!!  I am 47 years old and this is all that I need too look completely natural whenever I go out!!  THIS IS TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
