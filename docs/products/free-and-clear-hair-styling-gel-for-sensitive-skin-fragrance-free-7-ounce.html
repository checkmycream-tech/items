            <li>The gel is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good for those with flaky scalp</li>

            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>and they do keep my hair and scalp in good condition.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>it will hold your hair together and comes in a good size tube for the price.</li>
            <li>good product added volume will order again</li>
            <li>Truly as good as everyone else has reviewed it.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of holding hair in place</li>
            <li>A good choice for those who have skin sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>Good for someone with skin allergy.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product</li>
            <li>But still as good as the day I&#x27;d received it.</li>
            <li>This is really good for my hair ...</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with its gentleness and ability to hold my hair.</li>
            <li>Happy with it and will order more.</li>
            <li>Well, it didn&#x27;t help my skin condition, but I was pretty impressed with the products (styling gel and hair spray).</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>This is a great fragrance free product and works well.  </li>
            <li>but I am thrilled to have found something that won&#x27;t irritate my scalp or cause acne around my hairline or on my face.</li>
            <li>and she really liked it too.  </li>
            <li>but all I need is a bit of control to keep me looking tidy without all the allergy side-effects and</li>
            <li>Gel is effective in that I feel my scalp problems have been reduced.  </li>
            <li>Nice hair gel.</li>
            <li>This gel provides a nice hold.</li>
            <li>I liked that it has no scent.</li>
            <li>It has a nice hold, and if you want to run your hands through your hair, won&#x27;t flake the heck out of your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to find fragrant free products.</li>
            <li>The Vanicream fragrance free gel is quite good and does not irritate my scalp or hands (when I put it on).</li>
            <li>Perfect for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gave it top marks because it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>This the first time I tried this product and it works great.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery for a good price.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this product because my hair had so much static</li>
            <li>I actually love it.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Truly unscented but make sure you use it sparingly otherwise it might gum up your hair and for some even cause itching.  </li>
            <li>But this product is allergy safe</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any rashes and for the most part not too flaky.</li>
            <li>I love this product for everything it doesn&#x27;t contain.</li>
            <li>I have sensitivities to many hair and skin products.  </li>
            <li>Most make my scalp itch.  </li>
            <li>pleased  </li>
            <li>I have allergies to many hair products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always leery since most products break me out.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair styling gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad to have something to use for styling.</li>
            <li>The hold is just OK.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this is unscented since so many hair gels are perfumey.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair gel.</li>
            <li>most of the root cause is stress anyway.</li>
            <li>I found a baby product (Organic Sprout or something) that was suppose to be baby safe hair gel.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this.  </li>
            <li>It holds better than any mainstream product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use hair products daily, as I do, it&#x27;s probably best to minimize your exposure to toxic substances.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you have more manageable hair than me</li>
            <li>and I love that it</li>
            <li>It may well hold even better if more product is used</li>
            <li>The gel helps make my hair more manageable and doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Aggravate</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>, I think this product is ok.  </li>
            <li>a tear drop more for longer hair and it does not and should not go onto the scalp</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold all that well, but it does okay.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>simply the best styling gel ever made</li>
            <li>All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>More like glue than gel.</li>
            <li>Will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li>As for the specific performance of this gel, I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the fall exclusively for hunting season as its scent free and its effective for the non oder/neutral smell.</li>
            <li>Most gels eventually make my scalp itch.  </li>
            <li>Good product, does not flake and it washes right off.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH!!!!</li>
            <li>It is light, but holds my very fine hair in place.</li>
            <li>Most important it does not cause my eyes to burn nor my nose to run nor does it bother my skin.</li>
            <li>Works great on my sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>This is more fragrance and odor free than any leave-in product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This is close to the Clinique strong hold so use as directed, just a fingertip is great for my short abundant but fine hair.</li>
            <li>Super strong gel!</li>
            <li>Another great Free and Clear product for hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a great addition to the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner that comes from Free &amp; Clear as well.</li>
            <li>Free and Clear happy customer.</li>
            <li>It washes out easily with no build-up.</li>
            <li>Since I switched to Free &amp; Clear Hair Styling Gel, the bites have been reduced greatly.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and is easy to style.  </li>
            <li>Brushes out easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, or cause any flaking or residue in my hair, and it easily washes out.  </li>
            <li>No smell and easy to use.</li>
            <li>me and Ii would recommend this scentless styling gel for anyone who has thinner, fine hair.</li>
            <li>medium hold, works fine.</li>
            <li>It does a fine job.</li>
            <li>It works well on my fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s rather picky and says this one works for him just fine.  </li>
            <li>I figured it probably wouldn&#x27;t work, but it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>This works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll leave it with sort of a matted look, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>Each strand is fine, but I have a lot of strands.</li>
            <li>for a fragrance free product it still smells just fine.</li>
            <li>Works well and is fragrance free as advertised.</li>
            <li>&quot; works much better but the tradeoff to avoid dandruff is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Using products free of SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) has helped me to be free of scalp irritation as well.</li>
            <li>Item is fragrance free which is the number one reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>She suggested I buy this when I bought the Free &amp; Clear&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and says she loves it.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate the scalp, is light, fragrance free, and washes out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 2 weeks, I noticed a great improvement on clearing up acne on my scalp and back of my neck.</li>
            <li>I have 2b/c curls, and this gel helps to keep them in place and frizz free without adding a noxious odor or chemicals that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only non reactive to my skin, but it&#x27;s a great quality hair gel also.</li>
            <li>It works great with my short hair.  </li>
            <li>It IS non-irritating but it doesn&#x27;t perform very well as a hair gel -- doesn&#x27;t add volume or body, just kind of sits there.</li>
            <li>- it goes onto roots of hair for lift and drawn over hair lightly with hands to add any desired bulk to hair for control.</li>
            <li>Delivers a hold and is scent free.</li>
            <li>Odor free hair syling gell is hartd to come by.</li>
            <li>the hair gel, if it&#x27;s too concentrated for you, try mixing it with water to make a light gel.</li>
            <li>I use it because it is scent free.</li>
            <li>Product is good for sensitive scalp; does not flake or make scalp itch.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find it as there is not a lot out there that is free of the ingredients that can irritate.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Free and Clear Hair Styling Gel.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely odorless, but with GREAT hold.....but not stiff.  </li>
            <li>They are all great great products but difficult to find.</li>
            <li>Free and Clear has amazing products that work.  </li>
            <li>It is also has a very strong hold and still leaves your hair soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>I love this product and like how the free and clear hair products work together to make hair care easy and affordable.</li>
            <li>than I expected based on the reviews I read, which is great because I want my hair to stand up.</li>
            <li>Have true everything - salon Allure top-rated Hollywood hit list faves to drugstore stuff.</li>
            <li>(Full disclosure:</li>
            <li>I will continue experimenting and this might become my new more affordable fragrance free gel.</li>
            <li>Great for anyone with sensitivity to other hair care products.</li>
            <li>Being allergic to many hair products, Free &amp; Clear Hair Styling Gel works for me.  </li>
            <li>So I threw the melting gel in the trash and ordered more Free &amp; Clear.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the Free &amp; Clear products.</li>
            <li>I have many allergies and the Free &amp; Clear products were recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I like most of the Free &amp; Clear products</li>
            <li>Free and Clear Hair Styling Gel is fantastic in my book!  </li>
            <li>My hair needs more hold, but this is an okay gel overall.</li>
            <li>My order came quickly.  </li>
            <li>I then used it a third time to make sure it was still okay before updating my review.</li>
            <li>I brought it to my hairstylist and she tried it on my hair and was impressed with it; she said she’d recommend it to her other clients who need something for a sensitive nose or skin.</li>
            <li>no smell, has great hold and does not bother my skin like other products!</li>
            <li>This hair gel works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s not scented, which is great for sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li>Glad these products are on the market for us sensitive skinned people!</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t hold my hair very well, and I have fine blond hair.  </li>
            <li>This is scent free and works really well.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product along with the shampoo and conditioner to help calm my rosacea.</li>
            <li>This, thus far, is my favorite gel.</li>
            <li>but it is the only kind of product I can use b/c of allergies to fragrances.</li>
            <li>wish this was more natural and not so laboratory created.</li>
            <li>This gel is inexpensive and clear of most allergy-causing chemicals.</li>
            <li>and yes ALL of this from just that nickel&#x27;s worth of product).</li>
            <li>Fortunately it not only works great on my sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this gel every other day for a month just to make sure before I lose my credibility as a top reviewer.</li>
            <li>This hair gel is better than most hair gels from the beauty section of all the other stores.</li>
            <li>Right now, it is sitting in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>It is really great for styling with a round brush and blow dryer and it kind of sets my hair as I dry it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old products after I use these up, but I wanted to write this review because Free and Clear products really do a great job on your hair.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s Free &amp; Clear!!</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job holding my hair in place, although not quite as strongly as other products that have perfume.</li>
            <li>Product is good for sensitive skin, was flaking initially but after about a week of use went away,.</li>
            <li>I think this product would work best on someone with long, curly hair, who wants the \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine hair that needs some \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; as I near the end of my body wave.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I am allergic to almost everything and, since Clinique no longer makes a hypoallergenic/fragrance free styling gel (which I loved!)</li>
            <li>Then I did some research on Amazon and found Free and Clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Free &amp; Clear hair styling gel on and off for about a month.</li>
            <li>Seems that the naturally occuring ingredients in this product (despite the product&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s free of fragrance, masking fragrance, colors, etc) are much MORE offensive that the cheap-o $3 blue gunk I get at the drug store.</li>
            <li>I also use Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I find myself having to add more gel, because some times it just isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>I have reordered this product several times and really love it.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and use this every day to control frizz with a light hold.  </li>
            <li>I LIKE ALL THE FREE AND CLEAR PRODUCTS FOR VANICREAM.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li>I bought it to give volume to my hair and it did the opposite; my hair was even flatter and more lifeless than it was with nothing.</li>
            <li>The first gel I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t give me allergy symptoms.</li>
            <li>It is free &amp; clear.</li>
            <li>Works great for me to spike his hair and provides long lasting hold.</li>
            <li>It is not expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance so the Free and clear product line is exactly what I need in hygienic products for day to day use.</li>
            <li>It was, indeed, fragrant free as I had hoped, but when I applied it to my \\&quot;natural color\\&quot; color rinse I put on my hair, it began to wipe out the color in my hair, so I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>i first became aware of this brand at the mayo clinic in rochester mn...</li>
            <li>My hair actually seems poofier and more frizzy since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I used this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Free &amp; Clear</li>
            <li>I bought this product along with the Free &amp; Clear hairspray, shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I used these Free &amp; Clear products solely for well over 2 months.  </li>
            <li>in all I&#x27;ve only purchased one bottle quite a while ago and use it sparingly, so it&#x27;s lasted many months.</li>
            <li>This is the first styling gel I have found that I haven&#x27;t been allergic to.</li>
            <li>I live with a chemically sensitive person so smell on most hair products</li>
            <li>Not only does this not make me itche, but I find it leaves my short, spikey hair looking good for a couple of days in a row</li>
            <li>This is the best hair gel I have found for my thin hair and sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>It styles and holds really well with no white flakes on my shoulders, I love that.</li>
            <li>this is the first fragrance free gel that actually WORKS and keeps my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>Everything else pretty much gives me itchy skin or sets off sinus attacks/headaches so this is a real relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only get that will hold my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product out of courtesy for my husband who is very sensitive to fragrances and odors, and wants us to move as a household to using safe, earth-friendly personal care and cleaning products.</li>
            <li>This Gel is okay, but you have to be careful and  not use too much.</li>
            <li>so I really haven&#x27;t given this once a chance</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon...</li>
            <li>It holds much stiffer then the, fragrance, product that I used to use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband and he really loves it.  </li>
            <li>Makes his hair look fuller not thin</li>
            <li>This product really works for me.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sticky and gives very even hold.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this product last year at another seller but Amazon&#x27;s offer of free shipping made me change to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>and it holds my hair reasonably well.</li>
            <li>makes my hair very frizzy  </li>
            <li>It really holds your hair for styling or spiking, whatever you want to do.  </li>
            <li>Has a light, but enough hold to stay 2 days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my scalp and has adds goods volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>This hair gel works very well for me .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t go on very well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have scent, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I would like it to hold</li>
            <li>It feels very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; on the hair</li>
            <li>Also, it holds really well.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have multiple chemical sensitivites and my husband needed a fragrance free hair gel that I could tolerate.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It holds really well and does not leave my hair \\&quot;hard.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I used to use a curling gel from L&#x27;Oreal, but I found that it gave me hives if too much of it dripped onto my skin.</li>
            <li>but I use it very sparingly</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but it just isn&#x27;t much at all.  </li>
            <li>It is when I use too much, or when I use it alone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mousse since but really pefer the gell.  </li>
            <li>To get a piecey look to hair ends, put between fingers and draw just very ends of hair through your fingers there</li>
            <li>Gentle and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much and just have to wash hands after use, as it does get sticky on hands after application.</li>
            <li>Does really well on the hair though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much stickier</li>
            <li>I have a very itchy scalp and wanted to see if my hair products were causing it.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Not quite as much hold as I wanted.  </li>
            <li>have shoulder length, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the gel.</li>
            <li>As soon as it dried, it kind of just faded away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Free and Clear Gel looks natural and gives me that.  </li>
            <li>Good hold but thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li>The hairspray holds nicely, but isn&#x27;t stiff.</li>
            <li>This Free &amp; Clear hair gel works great and really is free and clear of those nasty scents that so many companies use.  </li>
            <li>I have an ultra-sensitive scalp combined with very fine hair, and have been unable to use any product for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly like that feeling on my skin as I put it on.</li>
            <li>works well for older people who have an intolerance for perfumes.</li>
            <li>found this free &amp; clear recently on Amazon, decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this gel because I have sensitive skin and want to use products free of ingredients that are potentially toxic.</li>
            <li>I started using it because it was easier than translating the arcane ingredients list of the expensive &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair products, and I&#x27;ve stayed with it because it has a nice, light hold, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Free and Clear Products are about the only skin, hair, and moisturizing products</li>
            <li>I hate most leave-in products, but I&#x27;ve figured out how to use this one, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I have recently developed a sensitivity to a whole range of beauty and cleaning products, and this product really helped me with this allergy.</li>
            <li>All in all, Free &amp; Clear does the allergen free job for me as usual.</li>
            <li>No-one uses gel anymore, shiny crusty hair is out of style (again), but if you want good thick gel with no tacky fragrance, this is it!</li>
            <li>I use the Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and like it a lot, but the gel is too strong -- once it starts to set, I can hardly comb my hair without seeing breakage.</li>
            <li>and I did not have high hopes for this product at all.  </li>
            <li>Despite the high reviews, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and others from this line.</li>
            <li>Works as well as high priced brand gel without the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this gel.</li>
            <li>I am highly alergic to chemicals and this product passes with flying colors.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair gel.</li>
            <li>only negatives I can think of are that I need to use slightly more gel than my previous toxic gunk, but its worth it to me if it lessens my exposure to cancer causing carcinogens.</li>
            <li>No problem, I just apply a little more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but just use little it dose</li>
            <li>You can mix a little in the palm of your hand, or mix more in a cup.</li>
            <li>If I first put on a small amount of leave-in conditioner (current favorite is Jessicurl&#x27;s deep conditioner, fragrance free) or even lotion (current favorite is Alaffia everyday shea moisturizing lotion, fragrance free), and then put the stying gel in, it stays soft and curly.</li>
            <li>but it works for someone who wants flexible natural looking hair.</li>
            <li>This clear gel is the answer and really works.</li>
            <li>It holds really well and does not leave my hair &amp;#34;hard.&amp;#34; I also have naturally curly hair and it leaves it manageable.</li>
            <li>This works really well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Lastly, as it has no fragarance it is ok to wear in a hospital setting where patients may be sensitive to such things.</li>
            <li>A good product, should use only a small amount.</li>
            <li>This gel is as good if not better than any standard...</li>
            <li>The next day, I tried again, thinking I might have used too much the first day.</li>
            <li>I can use it on my wet or dry hair; it&#x27;s effective either way.</li>
            <li>However, this was not easy to use and presents too many problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to everything under the sun, it feels like -- certainly to the chemicals commonly used in most hair products.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is the new Gluten.  </li>
            <li>Overall it holds my curls in shape well even in moderate humidity and is odorless and relatively light weight.  </li>
            <li>Plus I love that there are no fragrances or any of the more dangerous chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>Its not a super strong hold</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and also have curly hair</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and anything that I put in my hair that touches my skin</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It does not leave the residue that I have noticed from many other hair gels but still holds hair the same.  </li>
            <li>gel combined with the Free &amp; Clear hair spray (the firm hold one) have really helped out.</li>
            <li>Not a small at all.</li>
            <li>This is what I put in my first review, which at the time I gave only 3 stars:</li>
            <li>/&gt;But do be aware that this is a very thick gel, thicker than most.  </li>
            <li>I have slightly frizzy wavy hair, and I wish I could find a moisturizing styling cream to add some smooth texture.</li>
            <li>I typically like using chemical free or organic products.  </li>
            <li>only positive for me was there is almost no odor--</li>
            <li>It holds my baby&#x27;s hair just fine.. pretty stiff actually.</li>
            <li>get all-day hold for my short, spiky hair by using a bit (about half a teaspoon) before blow-drying and a bit more (another half-teaspoon) for definition after.</li>
            <li>Its not too heavy for fine hair</li>
            <li>Probably will work different  on certain skin types.</li>
            <li>I needed a firm gel for my fine short hair, and I can&#x27;t have much scent because I do have skin allergies.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very economical and as stated previously, a little bit goes</li>
            <li>so I was not too happy that I had to give them up, but I was desperate.</li>
            <li>This product works well for holding natural curls and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a hypoallergenic gel for over a year since I developed an allergy to the hair products I was using.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp and this has not caused any irritation.  </li>
            <li>Drugstore brands were causing itchy eyes and face rashes for my sensitive and allergy prone child.</li>
            <li>I did a twist and untwisted after 4 days and it definitely kept the frizz away and held the style very well.</li>
            <li>and this let&#x27;s me finger curl my hair into soft waves.</li>
            <li>My wife takes care of her 90 year old mother&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this stuff for my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>This does not bother my allergies or sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to use gel because of frizzy hair, paired with hairspray - and it bothers my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My youngest has had coarse straight hair since he was born.</li>
            <li>This product works wonderfully on natural hair..</li>
            <li>I also have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and started looking into both hypo-allergenic gel and shampoo.</li>
            <li>The gel is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Holds my wavy hair in soft curls in a natural look, bouncy and &amp;#34;hair-colored&amp;#34; (not shiny glossy).  </li>
            <li>my extraordinarily sensitive skin can tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No itching for my sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>my sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>works well so far, no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this brand, as it has nearly cured my chronic urticaria.</li>
            <li>My scalp has gotten so sensitive to hair products.  </li>
            <li>For people with eczema or simply sensitive scalp -- this is for you.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to chemicals and fragrances but this product does not bother me</li>
            <li>will say, it is completely unscented, not just \\&quot;no fragrance added.\\</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, but doesn&#x27;t hold for a long time.  </li>
            <li>This gel is a good, basic gel; not stick or irritating to my skin and not visible or flaky on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I wish there were other hair styling products for eczema users, this is a bit more than my thin, fine hair can handle</li>
            <li>a little crunchy if you use too much, but it holds VERY VERY well.</li>
            <li>The gel tends to dry quickly, so rather than adding more (which would make a heavy, stiff mess), I add a few drops of water to my hands and continue styling, but it&#x27;s  better to work quickly then leave it alone.</li>
            <li>Clear gel, good hold on wet or dry hair, and the shape can be touched up with a little water.</li>
            <li>The consistency is different than most gels, but if you can get past needing it to be what you are accustomed to and judge it strictly on performance alone, its a winner.</li>
            <li>I am ultra sensitive and normal over the counter hair gels cause my face and scalp to become red and itchy.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t get a little crinkly during the day, then it isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold shape, this does it all.</li>
            <li>Im highly allergic to gels and laundry detergent, this is the only one I can use where I wont break out.</li>
            <li>My hair actually looks normal now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is no different: you need only a TINY amount (ex., TINY&#x3D;nickel size dollop for short fine hair &amp; only</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a strong hold for spiky thick hair</li>
            <li>Although I used very little for my whole head, it did make my hair kind of crunchy and was hard to disperse all over.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance free products are hard to find.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find fragrance free products that work well.</li>
            <li>but I think you would be hard pressed to find a hair gel that doesn&#x27;t do this on light hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was baby safe, but the smell was horrible and it didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li>It did not seem to affect my scalp - either making it better or worse.  </li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp, my hair feels a bit weighed down after I apply it (even after it dries) and my hair smells funny after a day.</li>
            <li>Works well to help hold curl (from curling iron)as long as I blow dry hair first.</li>
            <li>Ever since I found out I have allergies to fragerance, I searched high and low to find products that work on my thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Slight alcohol scent when first applied, no fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair though and have had to use got2b glue Mohawk gel in the past to keep my hair in regulation.</li>
            <li>Much preferable than what other items</li>
            <li>Be very careful not to get too much in hair.</li>
            <li>and it does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>I’m very sensitive to perfume and hair-care-product aromas, and I can’t smell this at all once it’s on and dry.</li>
            <li>Not overly excited about the entire Free and Clear line so far, and I&#x27;ve tried this and the conditioner, which is also worthless.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, this gel doesn&#x27;t spread very well like conventional gels.</li>
            <li>During the month, I have gotten stung twice by bees, and bugs in general are just attracted to my hair when I&#x27;m outside.</li>
            <li>The set lasts several days, much longer than with any other product I have tried in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides a firm hold (some would say &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;) this way, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>(Fresh out of the tube, there’s no more scent than a hypoallergenic soap.)</li>
            <li>This works very well for natural curly hair (very tight curls--pencil width curls)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I had that initial bad experience, but it might have been that the first dab had more of some ingredient in it.</li>
            <li>help my fine, thin hair stay put.</li>
            <li>So if you need hair products without certain chemicals don&#x27;t be afraid to try Free and Clear--it might just work for</li>
            <li>I find a little goes a long way, on my fine hair, which does go down my back.  </li>
            <li>Most hair products cause contact dermatitis around my eyes and forehead, but I have fine, naturally curly hair that looks awful without something to give it some weight and definition.</li>
            <li>I tried to blow dry it, like normal, but it wouldn&#x27;t dry properly.</li>

            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> Free&amp;Clear and Vanicream products are perfect for me because I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances.</li>
            <li> Good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The gel is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good for those with flaky scalp</li>
            <li> The best part of it is that it is indeed fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> and they do keep my hair and scalp in good condition.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> it will hold your hair together and comes in a good size tube for the price.</li>
            <li> good product added volume will order again</li>
            <li> Truly as good as everyone else has reviewed it.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of holding hair in place</li>
            <li> A good choice for those who have skin sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> Good for someone with skin allergy.  </li>
            <li> It is a good product</li>
            <li> But still as good as the day I&#x27;d received it.</li>
            <li> This is really good for my hair ...</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with its gentleness and ability to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> Happy with it and will order more.</li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t help my skin condition, but I was pretty impressed with the products (styling gel and hair spray).</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance free product and works well.  </li>
            <li> but I am thrilled to have found something that won&#x27;t irritate my scalp or cause acne around my hairline or on my face.</li>
            <li> and she really liked it too.  </li>
            <li> but all I need is a bit of control to keep me looking tidy without all the allergy side-effects and</li>
            <li> Gel is effective in that I feel my scalp problems have been reduced.  </li>
            <li> Nice hair gel.</li>
            <li> This gel provides a nice hold.</li>
            <li> I liked that it has no scent.</li>
            <li> It has a nice hold, and if you want to run your hands through your hair, won&#x27;t flake the heck out of your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to find fragrant free products.</li>
            <li> The Vanicream fragrance free gel is quite good and does not irritate my scalp or hands (when I put it on).</li>
            <li> Perfect for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Gave it top marks because it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> This the first time I tried this product and it works great.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery for a good price.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this product because my hair had so much static</li>
            <li> I actually love it.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Truly unscented but make sure you use it sparingly otherwise it might gum up your hair and for some even cause itching.  </li>
            <li> But this product is allergy safe</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any rashes and for the most part not too flaky.</li>
            <li> I love this product for everything it doesn&#x27;t contain.</li>
            <li> I have sensitivities to many hair and skin products.  </li>
            <li> Most make my scalp itch.  </li>
            <li> pleased  </li>
            <li> I have allergies to many hair products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always leery since most products break me out.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair styling gel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad to have something to use for styling.</li>
            <li> The hold is just OK.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is unscented since so many hair gels are perfumey.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair gel.</li>
            <li> most of the root cause is stress anyway.</li>
            <li> I found a baby product (Organic Sprout or something) that was suppose to be baby safe hair gel.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this.  </li>
            <li> It holds better than any mainstream product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use hair products daily, as I do, it&#x27;s probably best to minimize your exposure to toxic substances.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you have more manageable hair than me</li>
            <li> and I love that it</li>
            <li> It may well hold even better if more product is used</li>
            <li> The gel helps make my hair more manageable and doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Aggravate</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> , I think this product is ok.  </li>
            <li> a tear drop more for longer hair and it does not and should not go onto the scalp</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold all that well, but it does okay.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> simply the best styling gel ever made</li>
            <li> All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> More like glue than gel.</li>
            <li> Will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li> As for the specific performance of this gel, I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the fall exclusively for hunting season as its scent free and its effective for the non oder/neutral smell.</li>
            <li> Most gels eventually make my scalp itch.  </li>
            <li> Good product, does not flake and it washes right off.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH!!!!</li>
            <li> It is light, but holds my very fine hair in place.</li>
            <li> Most important it does not cause my eyes to burn nor my nose to run nor does it bother my skin.</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> This is more fragrance and odor free than any leave-in product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is close to the Clinique strong hold so use as directed, just a fingertip is great for my short abundant but fine hair.</li>
            <li> Super strong gel!</li>
            <li> Another great Free and Clear product for hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a great addition to the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner that comes from Free &amp; Clear as well.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear happy customer.</li>
            <li> It washes out easily with no build-up.</li>
            <li> Since I switched to Free &amp; Clear Hair Styling Gel, the bites have been reduced greatly.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and is easy to style.  </li>
            <li> Brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, or cause any flaking or residue in my hair, and it easily washes out.  </li>
            <li> No smell and easy to use.</li>
            <li> me and Ii would recommend this scentless styling gel for anyone who has thinner, fine hair.</li>
            <li> medium hold, works fine.</li>
            <li> It does a fine job.</li>
            <li> It works well on my fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s rather picky and says this one works for him just fine.  </li>
            <li> I figured it probably wouldn&#x27;t work, but it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> This works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll leave it with sort of a matted look, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> Each strand is fine, but I have a lot of strands.</li>
            <li> for a fragrance free product it still smells just fine.</li>
            <li> Works well and is fragrance free as advertised.</li>
            <li> &quot; works much better but the tradeoff to avoid dandruff is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Using products free of SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) has helped me to be free of scalp irritation as well.</li>
            <li> Item is fragrance free which is the number one reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> She suggested I buy this when I bought the Free &amp; Clear&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and says she loves it.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate the scalp, is light, fragrance free, and washes out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 2 weeks, I noticed a great improvement on clearing up acne on my scalp and back of my neck.</li>
            <li> I have 2b/c curls, and this gel helps to keep them in place and frizz free without adding a noxious odor or chemicals that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only non reactive to my skin, but it&#x27;s a great quality hair gel also.</li>
            <li> It works great with my short hair.  </li>
            <li> It IS non-irritating but it doesn&#x27;t perform very well as a hair gel -- doesn&#x27;t add volume or body, just kind of sits there.</li>
            <li> - it goes onto roots of hair for lift and drawn over hair lightly with hands to add any desired bulk to hair for control.</li>
            <li> Delivers a hold and is scent free.</li>
            <li> Odor free hair syling gell is hartd to come by.</li>
            <li> the hair gel, if it&#x27;s too concentrated for you, try mixing it with water to make a light gel.</li>
            <li> I use it because it is scent free.</li>
            <li> Product is good for sensitive scalp; does not flake or make scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find it as there is not a lot out there that is free of the ingredients that can irritate.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Free and Clear Hair Styling Gel.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely odorless, but with GREAT hold.....but not stiff.  </li>
            <li> They are all great great products but difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear has amazing products that work.  </li>
            <li> It is also has a very strong hold and still leaves your hair soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> I love this product and like how the free and clear hair products work together to make hair care easy and affordable.</li>
            <li> than I expected based on the reviews I read, which is great because I want my hair to stand up.</li>
            <li> Have true everything - salon Allure top-rated Hollywood hit list faves to drugstore stuff.</li>
            <li> (Full disclosure:</li>
            <li> I will continue experimenting and this might become my new more affordable fragrance free gel.</li>
            <li> Great for anyone with sensitivity to other hair care products.</li>
            <li> Being allergic to many hair products, Free &amp; Clear Hair Styling Gel works for me.  </li>
            <li> So I threw the melting gel in the trash and ordered more Free &amp; Clear.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love the Free &amp; Clear products.</li>
            <li> I have many allergies and the Free &amp; Clear products were recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I like most of the Free &amp; Clear products</li>
            <li> Free and Clear Hair Styling Gel is fantastic in my book!  </li>
            <li> My hair needs more hold, but this is an okay gel overall.</li>
            <li> My order came quickly.  </li>
            <li> I then used it a third time to make sure it was still okay before updating my review.</li>
            <li> I brought it to my hairstylist and she tried it on my hair and was impressed with it; she said she’d recommend it to her other clients who need something for a sensitive nose or skin.</li>
            <li> no smell, has great hold and does not bother my skin like other products!</li>
            <li> This hair gel works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s not scented, which is great for sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> Glad these products are on the market for us sensitive skinned people!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t hold my hair very well, and I have fine blond hair.  </li>
            <li> This is scent free and works really well.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product along with the shampoo and conditioner to help calm my rosacea.</li>
            <li> This, thus far, is my favorite gel.</li>
            <li> but it is the only kind of product I can use b/c of allergies to fragrances.</li>
            <li> wish this was more natural and not so laboratory created.</li>
            <li> This gel is inexpensive and clear of most allergy-causing chemicals.</li>
            <li> and yes ALL of this from just that nickel&#x27;s worth of product).</li>
            <li> Fortunately it not only works great on my sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this gel every other day for a month just to make sure before I lose my credibility as a top reviewer.</li>
            <li> This hair gel is better than most hair gels from the beauty section of all the other stores.</li>
            <li> Right now, it is sitting in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> It is really great for styling with a round brush and blow dryer and it kind of sets my hair as I dry it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old products after I use these up, but I wanted to write this review because Free and Clear products really do a great job on your hair.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s Free &amp; Clear!!</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job holding my hair in place, although not quite as strongly as other products that have perfume.</li>
            <li> Product is good for sensitive skin, was flaking initially but after about a week of use went away,.</li>
            <li> I think this product would work best on someone with long, curly hair, who wants the \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine hair that needs some \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; as I near the end of my body wave.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am allergic to almost everything and, since Clinique no longer makes a hypoallergenic/fragrance free styling gel (which I loved!)</li>
            <li> Then I did some research on Amazon and found Free and Clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Free &amp; Clear hair styling gel on and off for about a month.</li>
            <li> Seems that the naturally occuring ingredients in this product (despite the product&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s free of fragrance, masking fragrance, colors, etc) are much MORE offensive that the cheap-o $3 blue gunk I get at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I also use Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I find myself having to add more gel, because some times it just isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> I have reordered this product several times and really love it.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and use this every day to control frizz with a light hold.  </li>
            <li> I LIKE ALL THE FREE AND CLEAR PRODUCTS FOR VANICREAM.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li> I bought it to give volume to my hair and it did the opposite; my hair was even flatter and more lifeless than it was with nothing.</li>
            <li> The first gel I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t give me allergy symptoms.</li>
            <li> It is free &amp; clear.</li>
            <li> Works great for me to spike his hair and provides long lasting hold.</li>
            <li> It is not expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance so the Free and clear product line is exactly what I need in hygienic products for day to day use.</li>
            <li> It was, indeed, fragrant free as I had hoped, but when I applied it to my \\&quot;natural color\\&quot; color rinse I put on my hair, it began to wipe out the color in my hair, so I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> i first became aware of this brand at the mayo clinic in rochester mn...</li>
            <li> My hair actually seems poofier and more frizzy since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;I used this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Free &amp; Clear</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the Free &amp; Clear hairspray, shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I used these Free &amp; Clear products solely for well over 2 months.  </li>
            <li> in all I&#x27;ve only purchased one bottle quite a while ago and use it sparingly, so it&#x27;s lasted many months.</li>
            <li> This is the first styling gel I have found that I haven&#x27;t been allergic to.</li>
            <li> I live with a chemically sensitive person so smell on most hair products</li>
            <li> Not only does this not make me itche, but I find it leaves my short, spikey hair looking good for a couple of days in a row</li>
            <li> This is the best hair gel I have found for my thin hair and sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> It styles and holds really well with no white flakes on my shoulders, I love that.</li>
            <li> this is the first fragrance free gel that actually WORKS and keeps my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> Everything else pretty much gives me itchy skin or sets off sinus attacks/headaches so this is a real relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only get that will hold my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product out of courtesy for my husband who is very sensitive to fragrances and odors, and wants us to move as a household to using safe, earth-friendly personal care and cleaning products.</li>
            <li> This Gel is okay, but you have to be careful and  not use too much.</li>
            <li> so I really haven&#x27;t given this once a chance</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon...</li>
            <li> It holds much stiffer then the, fragrance, product that I used to use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he really loves it.  </li>
            <li> Makes his hair look fuller not thin</li>
            <li> This product really works for me.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky and gives very even hold.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product last year at another seller but Amazon&#x27;s offer of free shipping made me change to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> and it holds my hair reasonably well.</li>
            <li> makes my hair very frizzy  </li>
            <li> It really holds your hair for styling or spiking, whatever you want to do.  </li>
            <li> Has a light, but enough hold to stay 2 days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my scalp and has adds goods volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair gel works very well for me .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t go on very well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have scent, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I would like it to hold</li>
            <li> It feels very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; on the hair</li>
            <li> Also, it holds really well.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have multiple chemical sensitivites and my husband needed a fragrance free hair gel that I could tolerate.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It holds really well and does not leave my hair \\&quot;hard.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I used to use a curling gel from L&#x27;Oreal, but I found that it gave me hives if too much of it dripped onto my skin.</li>
            <li> but I use it very sparingly</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but it just isn&#x27;t much at all.  </li>
            <li> It is when I use too much, or when I use it alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mousse since but really pefer the gell.  </li>
            <li> To get a piecey look to hair ends, put between fingers and draw just very ends of hair through your fingers there</li>
            <li> Gentle and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much and just have to wash hands after use, as it does get sticky on hands after application.</li>
            <li> Does really well on the hair though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much stickier</li>
            <li> I have a very itchy scalp and wanted to see if my hair products were causing it.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Not quite as much hold as I wanted.  </li>
            <li> have shoulder length, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the gel.</li>
            <li> As soon as it dried, it kind of just faded away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Free and Clear Gel looks natural and gives me that.  </li>
            <li> Good hold but thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> The hairspray holds nicely, but isn&#x27;t stiff.</li>
            <li> This Free &amp; Clear hair gel works great and really is free and clear of those nasty scents that so many companies use.  </li>
            <li> I have an ultra-sensitive scalp combined with very fine hair, and have been unable to use any product for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly like that feeling on my skin as I put it on.</li>
            <li> works well for older people who have an intolerance for perfumes.</li>
            <li> found this free &amp; clear recently on Amazon, decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this gel because I have sensitive skin and want to use products free of ingredients that are potentially toxic.</li>
            <li> I started using it because it was easier than translating the arcane ingredients list of the expensive &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair products, and I&#x27;ve stayed with it because it has a nice, light hold, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Free and Clear Products are about the only skin, hair, and moisturizing products</li>
            <li> I hate most leave-in products, but I&#x27;ve figured out how to use this one, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have recently developed a sensitivity to a whole range of beauty and cleaning products, and this product really helped me with this allergy.</li>
            <li> All in all, Free &amp; Clear does the allergen free job for me as usual.</li>
            <li> No-one uses gel anymore, shiny crusty hair is out of style (again), but if you want good thick gel with no tacky fragrance, this is it!</li>
            <li> I use the Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and like it a lot, but the gel is too strong -- once it starts to set, I can hardly comb my hair without seeing breakage.</li>
            <li> and I did not have high hopes for this product at all.  </li>
            <li> Despite the high reviews, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and others from this line.</li>
            <li> Works as well as high priced brand gel without the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this gel.</li>
            <li> I am highly alergic to chemicals and this product passes with flying colors.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair gel.</li>
            <li> only negatives I can think of are that I need to use slightly more gel than my previous toxic gunk, but its worth it to me if it lessens my exposure to cancer causing carcinogens.</li>
            <li> No problem, I just apply a little more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but just use little it dose</li>
            <li> You can mix a little in the palm of your hand, or mix more in a cup.</li>
            <li> If I first put on a small amount of leave-in conditioner (current favorite is Jessicurl&#x27;s deep conditioner, fragrance free) or even lotion (current favorite is Alaffia everyday shea moisturizing lotion, fragrance free), and then put the stying gel in, it stays soft and curly.</li>
            <li> but it works for someone who wants flexible natural looking hair.</li>
            <li> This clear gel is the answer and really works.</li>
            <li> It holds really well and does not leave my hair &amp;#34;hard.&amp;#34; I also have naturally curly hair and it leaves it manageable.</li>
            <li> This works really well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Lastly, as it has no fragarance it is ok to wear in a hospital setting where patients may be sensitive to such things.</li>
            <li> A good product, should use only a small amount.</li>
            <li> This gel is as good if not better than any standard...</li>
            <li> The next day, I tried again, thinking I might have used too much the first day.</li>
            <li> I can use it on my wet or dry hair; it&#x27;s effective either way.</li>
            <li> However, this was not easy to use and presents too many problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything under the sun, it feels like -- certainly to the chemicals commonly used in most hair products.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is the new Gluten.  </li>
            <li> Overall it holds my curls in shape well even in moderate humidity and is odorless and relatively light weight.  </li>
            <li> Plus I love that there are no fragrances or any of the more dangerous chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Its not a super strong hold</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and also have curly hair</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and anything that I put in my hair that touches my skin</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It does not leave the residue that I have noticed from many other hair gels but still holds hair the same.  </li>
            <li> gel combined with the Free &amp; Clear hair spray (the firm hold one) have really helped out.</li>
            <li> Not a small at all.</li>
            <li> This is what I put in my first review, which at the time I gave only 3 stars:</li>
            <li> /&gt;But do be aware that this is a very thick gel, thicker than most.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly frizzy wavy hair, and I wish I could find a moisturizing styling cream to add some smooth texture.</li>
            <li> I typically like using chemical free or organic products.  </li>
            <li> only positive for me was there is almost no odor--</li>
            <li> It holds my baby&#x27;s hair just fine.. pretty stiff actually.</li>
            <li> get all-day hold for my short, spiky hair by using a bit (about half a teaspoon) before blow-drying and a bit more (another half-teaspoon) for definition after.</li>
            <li> Its not too heavy for fine hair</li>
            <li> Probably will work different  on certain skin types.</li>
            <li> I needed a firm gel for my fine short hair, and I can&#x27;t have much scent because I do have skin allergies.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very economical and as stated previously, a little bit goes</li>
            <li> so I was not too happy that I had to give them up, but I was desperate.</li>
            <li> This product works well for holding natural curls and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hypoallergenic gel for over a year since I developed an allergy to the hair products I was using.  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp and this has not caused any irritation.  </li>
            <li> Drugstore brands were causing itchy eyes and face rashes for my sensitive and allergy prone child.</li>
            <li> I did a twist and untwisted after 4 days and it definitely kept the frizz away and held the style very well.</li>
            <li> and this let&#x27;s me finger curl my hair into soft waves.</li>
            <li> My wife takes care of her 90 year old mother&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this stuff for my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> This does not bother my allergies or sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to use gel because of frizzy hair, paired with hairspray - and it bothers my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My youngest has had coarse straight hair since he was born.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully on natural hair..</li>
            <li> I also have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and started looking into both hypo-allergenic gel and shampoo.</li>
            <li> The gel is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holds my wavy hair in soft curls in a natural look, bouncy and &amp;#34;hair-colored&amp;#34; (not shiny glossy).  </li>
            <li> my extraordinarily sensitive skin can tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No itching for my sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> my sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> works well so far, no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this brand, as it has nearly cured my chronic urticaria.</li>
            <li> My scalp has gotten so sensitive to hair products.  </li>
            <li> For people with eczema or simply sensitive scalp -- this is for you.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to chemicals and fragrances but this product does not bother me</li>
            <li> will say, it is completely unscented, not just \\&quot;no fragrance added.\\</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but doesn&#x27;t hold for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This gel is a good, basic gel; not stick or irritating to my skin and not visible or flaky on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wish there were other hair styling products for eczema users, this is a bit more than my thin, fine hair can handle</li>
            <li> a little crunchy if you use too much, but it holds VERY VERY well.</li>
            <li> The gel tends to dry quickly, so rather than adding more (which would make a heavy, stiff mess), I add a few drops of water to my hands and continue styling, but it&#x27;s  better to work quickly then leave it alone.</li>
            <li> Clear gel, good hold on wet or dry hair, and the shape can be touched up with a little water.</li>
            <li> The consistency is different than most gels, but if you can get past needing it to be what you are accustomed to and judge it strictly on performance alone, its a winner.</li>
            <li> I am ultra sensitive and normal over the counter hair gels cause my face and scalp to become red and itchy.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t get a little crinkly during the day, then it isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold shape, this does it all.</li>
            <li> Im highly allergic to gels and laundry detergent, this is the only one I can use where I wont break out.</li>
            <li> My hair actually looks normal now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is no different: you need only a TINY amount (ex., TINY&#x3D;nickel size dollop for short fine hair &amp; only</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a strong hold for spiky thick hair</li>
            <li> Although I used very little for my whole head, it did make my hair kind of crunchy and was hard to disperse all over.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance free products are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find fragrance free products that work well.</li>
            <li> but I think you would be hard pressed to find a hair gel that doesn&#x27;t do this on light hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was baby safe, but the smell was horrible and it didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li> It did not seem to affect my scalp - either making it better or worse.  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp, my hair feels a bit weighed down after I apply it (even after it dries) and my hair smells funny after a day.</li>
            <li> Works well to help hold curl (from curling iron)as long as I blow dry hair first.</li>
            <li> Ever since I found out I have allergies to fragerance, I searched high and low to find products that work on my thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Slight alcohol scent when first applied, no fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair though and have had to use got2b glue Mohawk gel in the past to keep my hair in regulation.</li>
            <li> Much preferable than what other items</li>
            <li> Be very careful not to get too much in hair.</li>
            <li> and it does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> I’m very sensitive to perfume and hair-care-product aromas, and I can’t smell this at all once it’s on and dry.</li>
            <li> Not overly excited about the entire Free and Clear line so far, and I&#x27;ve tried this and the conditioner, which is also worthless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, this gel doesn&#x27;t spread very well like conventional gels.</li>
            <li> During the month, I have gotten stung twice by bees, and bugs in general are just attracted to my hair when I&#x27;m outside.</li>
            <li> The set lasts several days, much longer than with any other product I have tried in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides a firm hold (some would say &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;) this way, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> (Fresh out of the tube, there’s no more scent than a hypoallergenic soap.)</li>
            <li> This works very well for natural curly hair (very tight curls--pencil width curls)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I had that initial bad experience, but it might have been that the first dab had more of some ingredient in it.</li>
            <li> help my fine, thin hair stay put.</li>
            <li> So if you need hair products without certain chemicals don&#x27;t be afraid to try Free and Clear--it might just work for</li>
            <li> I find a little goes a long way, on my fine hair, which does go down my back.  </li>
            <li> Most hair products cause contact dermatitis around my eyes and forehead, but I have fine, naturally curly hair that looks awful without something to give it some weight and definition.</li>
            <li> I tried to blow dry it, like normal, but it wouldn&#x27;t dry properly.</li>
            <li> This is another product that I have not had a problem with breaking out due to my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> : sit down and bend over so your hair is hanging down towards floor and apply that way thus avoiding getting the stuff onto scalp or weighing down too much hair with too much product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube and have not developed any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and doesn&#x27;t do much to help manage hair, except make it look glued.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother my scalp but it left my hair sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> Holds well but left my hair dry; don&#x27;t care for the scent, either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried less toxic, organic, natural hair products before.</li>
            <li> If this is not a new product, I wish I&#x27;d found it earlier.  </li>
            <li> I have between wavy and curly hair that isn&#x27;t thin, but can get weighted down easily.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to be careful to use the smallest amount possible.</li>
            <li> If you feel a need for more than this amount of product, you may want to get a second opinion about whether your idea of style is outdated or as helpful to your image as you may think, know what I mean...</li>
            <li> Other similar products gave me skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned with a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products ability to perform in the same way that I am used to with my current (now legacy) hair gel.</li>
            <li> This is basically the only hair gel I can use due to my psoriasis and was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> It is drying for my scalp and causes very minor itching, but I&#x27;ve never found a gel or hair spray</li>
            <li> The downside is that it takes longer for my hair to dry.  </li>
            <li> Smells like rubbing alcohol but this scent dissipates when dry.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit of the product on my damp palms is enough to tame the frizz in my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I used this for years, because my choices were limited due to strange allergies.  </li>
            <li> I applied just a bit on wet hair and then blew it dry.  </li>
            <li> so I use only a small amount and apply it to my roots only.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry</li>
            <li> Stays looking wet after it is dry, therefore looks greasy.</li>
            <li> But it provides that little extra body I want.</li>
            <li> Each time, there is a hard cover on my hair that I have to clear before I can style my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find completely unscented products but this one truly has no scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the look of wet hair just because it&#x27;s curly</li>
            <li> Really holds my thin hair in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to avoid fragrances, so using a product with them is not really an option.  </li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> It tends to be a bit sticky if you aren&#x27;t careful how you apply it.</li>
            <li> Works on my hair for a few hours If Im not doing anything, but my hair instant frizzes if Im outside/</li>
            <li> They have minimal ingredients, so fewer things to be allergic to.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to any one, who is concerned with all the bad ingredients in most of the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I have tried wet, damp, slightly damp and dry.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to find this gel because I am trying to go fragrance-free where I can, but in the end this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only awarding 4 stars though because it&#x27;s a little too heavy-duty and stiff for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I found that I had to use VERY little of this product because it left my hair with a \\&quot;crispy\\</li>
            <li> and I was looking for something that did not contain alcohol or other drying factors.</li>
            <li> The gel helps me create any hair style and works just like any other hair gel I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The insect likes the smell of perfume in other hair gels.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t made up my mind as to trying other of their products.....</li>
            <li> It works just as well as other styling gels without all the added scents and chemicals that he doesn&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to the alcohol in other hair jel products.  </li>
            <li> Usually they are ineffective, don&#x27;t hold strongly enough, or flake.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> I may try some of their other products.  </li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;dermatologist recommended\\&quot; but not sure if it&#x27;s a Derm association or just one local Derm saying that.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> From now on I will use a much smaller amount and dilute it with water, to thin it out even further,  then apply to my wet hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but without the fragrance of other products, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Have senstive skin and other gels tend to cause my scalp to break out.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and this works well without the irritating content of other gels.</li>
            <li> not perfumey, does not smell bad, washes out easily, makes me ITCH</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but in this case you really get what you pay for...plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s harder to apply than other gels and at the end of the day, my hair feels frizzy and dried out.</li>
            <li> With other gels, I apply them with my hair slightly moist and the gel just glides through evenly.</li>
            <li> I only use this sparingly on my roots, and usually mix it with a little water.</li>
            <li> But if you have a sensitive scalp and need to give your poor hair or scalp a rest but still need a styling product, try this gel out.</li>
            <li> The product gives me some body without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
            <li> Virtually ALL other gels turn to water in your hand, this one has umph!</li>
            <li> Perhaps any gel will weigh hair down and/or produce an undesirable odor, so I will try using less of it</li>
            <li> I tried this gel hoping it would work just as well, but I found that even though it didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, it was just a mediocre gel with little holding power that makes my hair look sort of greasy and adds no moisture or real benefit to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just use less and deal with the stiffness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used less also, but it just doesn&#x27;t spread the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> I use it less as a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; than as a &amp;#34;curl keeper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product is so thick and difficult to use that it isn&#x27;t worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> I have severe eczema due to product allergies...and got this to tame my hair...</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a little lift.</li>
            <li> Once I comb through it, the hold is released, but the shape remains for a little while.</li>
            <li> Expensive, gel is very stiff when applied so you don&#x27;t need much of it.</li>
            <li> and he uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> It is a firm hold gel.</li>
            <li> Another waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has few chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Styling Gel is a firm hold product.  </li>
            <li> You can even comb through your hair because its not sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something that adds gloss and stiff styling, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product holds the hair in place but does not look stiff which is a plus.</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair was stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> No matter what I did, I couldn&#x27;t tame it.</li>
            <li> But it is just way too thick for me in my short hair or for my husband with his slightly balding thin hair.</li>
            <li> No more burning head.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy it again, though.</li>
            <li> I put my usual amount on and couldn&#x27;t get the styling brush through it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got the same results, except now</li>
            <li> This product holds hair very firmly in place.  </li>
            <li> I can style my hair with out the irritating ingredients that are found in other gels.</li>
            <li> So I look for hair products that don&#x27;t contain scent and let me tell you that is no easy task until you search on Amazon, thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped it&#x27;d have a stronger hold and be less irritating.</li>
            <li> It does, however, seems to dull my hair a bit</li>
            <li> Thick gel that when applied, turned to hard guck.  </li>
            <li> The gel is kinda thick to put on, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Some folks have complained about this being too thick and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Also if you have thick, curly hair, you could put in a dab of conditioner to lower the volume and make it into a softer hold.</li>
            <li> This is not a very happy outcome.  </li>
            <li> I will say this - this is the least irritating hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand of hair care products to me because they are the least irritating to the scalp.</li>
            <li> It was also very hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> I rub a dab around in my hands before applying so that I can evenly distribute a thin coating to my hair without getting a concentrated glob of it somewhere.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might be from working out--sweat mingling with the styling products in my hair and irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is the consistency of glue.  </li>
            <li> Even after thinning it out with water, it is difficult to use.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but it doesn&#x27;t make the boy&#x27;s face get a rash.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s body, was dry and sticking out and just horrible.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for someone who suffers from eczema or psoriasis.</li>
            <li> My scalp no longer feels uncomfortable now that I am using this product!</li>
            <li> can make her very ill.</li>
            <li> I did use it for a couple of years when my eye excema was bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> I got sick by just inhaling it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for all hair types and you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The gel works just like the scented crap on the market.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> This gel is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do.  It has no smell and had never given me any sort of allergy problem.</li>
            <li> Being allergic to many hair products, Free &amp; Clear Hair Styling Gel works for me.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works well and is fragrance free as advertised.</li>
            <li> Most hair products cause contact dermatitis around my eyes and forehead, but I have fine, naturally curly hair that looks awful without something to give it some weight and definition. This product works well for holding natural curls and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash. I&#x27;m on my second tube and have not developed any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Wow! No more burning head. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for a while and finally found a place I can purchase the styling gel. I am very pleased with its gentleness and ability to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I switched to this product because my hair had so much static and I was looking for something that did not contain alcohol or other drying factors. For that alone, it was a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, I was expecting to have to compromise on performance and I did not have high hopes for this product at all.  But I was wrong.  I actually love it.  It is really great for styling with a round brush and blow dryer and it kind of sets my hair as I dry it.  The set lasts several days, much longer than with any other product I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But do be aware that this is a very thick gel, thicker than most.  I rub a dab around in my hands before applying so that I can evenly distribute a thin coating to my hair without getting a concentrated glob of it somewhere.  The consistency is different than most gels, but if you can get past needing it to be what you are accustomed to and judge it strictly on performance alone, its a winner.</li>
            <li> This product recommended by my dermatologist.  Only get that will hold my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery for a good price.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This gel is a good, basic gel; not stick or irritating to my skin and not visible or flaky on my hair.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I recently had a flare-up with red flaky skin around my eyes. I thought it might be from working out--sweat mingling with the styling products in my hair and irritating my skin. I only use premium hair products(Fekkai, Phyto, Davines, Philip B, etc) so I was not too happy that I had to give them up, but I was desperate. Then I did some research on Amazon and found Free and Clear. Well, it didn&#x27;t help my skin condition, but I was pretty impressed with the products (styling gel and hair spray). The styling gel isn&#x27;t sticky and gives my hair volume and shine. The hairspray holds nicely, but isn&#x27;t stiff. I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old products after I use these up, but I wanted to write this review because Free and Clear products really do a great job on your hair. So if you need hair products without certain chemicals don&#x27;t be afraid to try Free and Clear--it might just work for you and your hair will look great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Free &amp; Clear hair styling gel on and off for about a month. I prefer a spray in product so I really haven&#x27;t given this once a chance but I am thrilled to have found something that won&#x27;t irritate my scalp or cause acne around my hairline or on my face. I will be ordering the shampoo as soon as finances permit! Glad these products are on the market for us sensitive skinned people!</li>
            <li> Ugh. I bought this product out of courtesy for my husband who is very sensitive to fragrances and odors, and wants us to move as a household to using safe, earth-friendly personal care and cleaning products. Seems that the naturally occuring ingredients in this product (despite the product&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s free of fragrance, masking fragrance, colors, etc) are much MORE offensive that the cheap-o $3 blue gunk I get at the drug store. Let&#x27;s put it this way: this product offended him to such a degree that he slept on the couch the one time that I used it (I take my showers at night). Back to the blue gunk...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hypoallergenic gel for over a year since I developed an allergy to the hair products I was using.  Not only does this not make me itche, but I find it leaves my short, spikey hair looking good for a couple of days in a row so I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> Thick gel that when applied, turned to hard guck.  I couldn&#x27;t comb my hair so I threw the product away.</li>
            <li> Love it!! My grandchild and I share some allergies and fragrance on our scalp is one of them. this is the first fragrance free gel that actually WORKS and keeps my hair in place.  If it doesn&#x27;t get a little crinkly during the day, then it isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold shape, this does it all. I am very happy and we are both ITCH FREE now!!</li>
            <li> This gel has all the holding power of regular gels. But...it does not irritate my scalp or cause dandruff! It lives up to its promise. My dermatologist recommended it for me and it works. I also use Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and Conditioner. They are all great great products but difficult to find. Thanks to Amazon...my search was cut short.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.  When I started using it I was having a dandruff problem that I didn&#x27;t understand since it came on suddenly.  Then I ran out of it and went back to \\&quot;Loreal Melting Gel\\&quot;.  My dandruff was back within days. So I threw the melting gel in the trash and ordered more Free &amp; Clear.  I&#x27;m only awarding 4 stars though because it&#x27;s a little too heavy-duty and stiff for my long hair.  I like the way \\&quot;Melting Gel\\&quot; works much better but the tradeoff to avoid dandruff is worth it.  I&#x27;ll just use less and deal with the stiffness.</li>
            <li> The Vanicream fragrance free gel is quite good and does not irritate my scalp or hands (when I put it on). Good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this gel every other day for a month just to make sure before I lose my credibility as a top reviewer. LOL&lt;br /&gt;Can I say this factually?? NO, but every time I wear this gel all different types of bugs go in my hair, on me, bees have stung me etc. During the month, I have gotten stung twice by bees, and bugs in general are just attracted to my hair when I&#x27;m outside. When I wear another gel, nothing happens.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this gel doesn&#x27;t spread very well like conventional gels. With other gels, I apply them with my hair slightly moist and the gel just glides through evenly. I find myself having to add more gel, because some times it just isn&#x27;t enough.I&#x27;ve used less also, but it just doesn&#x27;t spread the way I want it to. Despite the high reviews, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it. So happy to have found unscented hair gel!</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp and this has not caused any irritation.  It does not leave the residue that I have noticed from many other hair gels but still holds hair the same.  Lastly, as it has no fragarance it is ok to wear in a hospital setting where patients may be sensitive to such things.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear happy customer. This is a great product for anyone with scented product allergies. This is scent free and works really well. I will continue to use the shampoo, too!</li>
            <li> Drugstore brands were causing itchy eyes and face rashes for my sensitive and allergy prone child. This works just as well without all the chemicals and allergens.  I will never use anything else for him.</li>
            <li> Very good at what it has to do.</li>
            <li> The gel is a good product. It holds my baby&#x27;s hair just fine.. pretty stiff actually. The gel is kinda thick to put on, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Im highly allergic to gels and laundry detergent, this is the only one I can use where I wont break out.</li>
            <li> Truly unscented but make sure you use it sparingly otherwise it might gum up your hair and for some even cause itching.  But this product is allergy safe plus there are no fluorocarbon chemicals!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a fragrance allergy.  It holds much stiffer then the, fragrance, product that I used to use.  I decided to try a variety of products because I can handle some fragrances but not others.  Right now, it is sitting in my cabinet. I did use it for a couple of years when my eye excema was bad.</li>
            <li> a little crunchy if you use too much, but it holds VERY VERY well. I did a twist and untwisted after 4 days and it definitely kept the frizz away and held the style very well. I didn&#x27;t get any rashes and for the most part not too flaky. I will continue experimenting and this might become my new more affordable fragrance free gel. for a fragrance free product it still smells just fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he really loves it.  Makes his hair look fuller not thin and he uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Good product, does not flake and it washes right off. Good for those with flaky scalp</li>
            <li> I love this product for everything it doesn&#x27;t contain. There are no ingredients that I react to, and that&#x27;s saying something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get all-day hold for my short, spiky hair by using a bit (about half a teaspoon) before blow-drying and a bit more (another half-teaspoon) for definition after. The gel tends to dry quickly, so rather than adding more (which would make a heavy, stiff mess), I add a few drops of water to my hands and continue styling, but it&#x27;s  better to work quickly then leave it alone. It provides a firm hold (some would say &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;) this way, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. It washes out easily with no build-up. I find I need to adapt the application when I am in windy, humid conditions, but I haven&#x27;t worked out a fool-proof recipe for that.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Clear gel, good hold on wet or dry hair, and the shape can be touched up with a little water. Keeps my pop-up hair in place. I’m very sensitive to perfume and hair-care-product aromas, and I can’t smell this at all once it’s on and dry. (Fresh out of the tube, there’s no more scent than a hypoallergenic soap.) I brought it to my hairstylist and she tried it on my hair and was impressed with it; she said she’d recommend it to her other clients who need something for a sensitive nose or skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and like how the free and clear hair products work together to make hair care easy and affordable. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitivities to many hair and skin products.  Most make my scalp itch.  This product really works for me.  I was excited to find it as there is not a lot out there that is free of the ingredients that can irritate. It isn&#x27;t sticky and gives very even hold. Using products free of SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) has helped me to be free of scalp irritation as well.</li>
            <li> This is the weirdest gel I have ever used.  The best part of it is that it is indeed fragrance free.  Unfortunately, it is the consistency of glue.  Even after thinning it out with water, it is difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I have an ultra-sensitive scalp combined with very fine hair, and have been unable to use any product for many years.  My hair has body and I don&#x27;t need to wash it every day. My hair actually looks normal now.&lt;br /&gt;It is very economical and as stated previously, a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;So pleased  I found it.</li>
            <li> No irritants and holds well! I can style my hair with out the irritating ingredients that are found in other gels.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance free product and works well.  I took it to my hair dresser and she really liked it too.  I have reordered this product several times and really love it.  Fragrance free products are hard to find.  The gel helps me create any hair style and works just like any other hair gel I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Mah.  On my hunt for hair product that does not give my neck a rash.  This gave me a rash. If you are susceptible to rashes from hair products, I would try the Kiss My Face mousse or the Alba Botanica styling cream.  both are lightweight and did not give me a rash.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product last year at another seller but Amazon&#x27;s offer of free shipping made me change to Amazon.  Product arrived quickly.  My use of the product stems from avoiding a flying insect that likes to nip at my head leaving welts.  The insect likes the smell of perfume in other hair gels.  Since I switched to Free &amp; Clear Hair Styling Gel, the bites have been reduced greatly.  It does a pretty good job holding my hair in place, although not quite as strongly as other products that have perfume.</li>
            <li> good product. works like a charm. no smell, has great hold and does not bother my skin like other products!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and use this every day to control frizz with a light hold.  I don&#x27;t like the look of wet hair just because it&#x27;s curly and this let&#x27;s me finger curl my hair into soft waves.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or give me an allergic reaction.  Gives my hair a little lift.</li>
            <li> The product gives me some body without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a year now.  I have allergies to many hair products so I was happy to find one that works for me.</li>
            <li> Item is fragrance free which is the number one reason I bought it. Its not a super strong hold but it works for someone who wants flexible natural looking hair. You can even comb through your hair because its not sticky and stiff. I really like the product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have an issue with scented products - they give me migraines and asthma attacks.  So I look for hair products that don&#x27;t contain scent and let me tell you that is no easy task until you search on Amazon, thank you Amazon! This Free &amp; Clear hair gel works great and really is free and clear of those nasty scents that so many companies use.  The gel works just like the scented crap on the market.  Just use a dollop and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I LIKE ALL THE FREE AND CLEAR PRODUCTS FOR VANICREAM.&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT AND WILL LAST FOREVER.&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES MAKE MY HAIR SOMEWHAT WAVY.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair gel I have found for my thin hair and sensitive scalp. I highly recommend this product and others from this line.</li>
            <li> Other similar products gave me skin irritation. I purchased in hopes this wouldn&#x27;t but it did.</li>
            <li> The product is a great value for both the quantity and quality.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky, flaky or crunchy.  I will recommend this to all my friends</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this gel because I am trying to go fragrance-free where I can, but in the end this was a disappointment. I used it a couple of times before I threw it in the trash. I bought it to give volume to my hair and it did the opposite; my hair was even flatter and more lifeless than it was with nothing.</li>
            <li> I needed a firm gel for my fine short hair, and I can&#x27;t have much scent because I do have skin allergies.  Works well for me and Ii would recommend this scentless styling gel for anyone who has thinner, fine hair.</li>
            <li> And does she like it! She has been looking for one that works for her&lt;br /&gt;for some time. She suggested I buy this when I bought the Free &amp; Clear&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and says she loves it.</li>
            <li> This, thus far, is my favorite gel. It&#x27;s hard to find fragrance free products that work well. This one tames my curls and keeps the frizz under control.</li>
            <li> Gave it top marks because it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far. Everything else pretty much gives me itchy skin or sets off sinus attacks/headaches so this is a real relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp doesn&#x27;t feel any level of discomfort at all and it holds my hair reasonably well. I go to the gym with this on, keeps it&#x27;s hold through a sweat session which is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a strong hold for spiky thick hair then this is definitely not your product but all I need is a bit of control to keep me looking tidy without all the allergy side-effects and this does the best job out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. It didn&#x27;t bother my scalp but it left my hair sticky and dry. I applied just a bit on wet hair and then blew it dry.  My hair lost all it&#x27;s body, was dry and sticking out and just horrible. It was also very hard to wash out. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> makes my hair very frizzy  sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a while and finally used it.  I&#x27;m always leery since most products break me out.  This didn&#x27;t bother me at all and it is so good!  It really holds your hair for styling or spiking, whatever you want to do.  Happy with it and will order more.</li>
            <li> I Would definitely recommend this product for curly hair with out chemicals!  Has a light, but enough hold to stay 2 days.</li>
            <li> This the first time I tried this product and it works great.</li>
            <li> I love this hair styling gel.  It&#x27;s gentle on my scalp and has adds goods volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> This is another product that I have not had a problem with breaking out due to my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Product is good for sensitive skin, was flaking initially but after about a week of use went away,. Probably will work different  on certain skin types.</li>
            <li> This hair gel works very well for me .I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything ,but this keeps my face around my hair line from burning .</li>
            <li> I love the Free &amp; Clear products. I have many allergies and the Free &amp; Clear products were recommended by my dermatologist. I also bought the shampoo and hair conditioner, which is great for my scalp. I am not enamored by this gel because it is rather sticky and I don&#x27;t particularly like that feeling on my skin as I put it on. I am not knocking the product. It is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t go on very well.  I have tried wet, damp, slightly damp and dry.  Each time, there is a hard cover on my hair that I have to clear before I can style my hair.  I like most of the Free &amp; Clear products and they do keep my hair and scalp in good condition.  However, this was not easy to use and presents too many problems.</li>
            <li> My wife takes care of her 90 year old mother&#x27;s hair.  Her mother hair white hair and all setting lotions or gel with color turns her mothers hair that color.  This is not a very happy outcome.  This clear gel is the answer and really works.</li>
            <li> This product holds hair very firmly in place.  I would recommend for all hair types and you will not be disappointed.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> I wish there were other hair styling products for eczema users, this is a bit more than my thin, fine hair can handle but it is the only kind of product I can use b/c of allergies to fragrances. I&#x27;m just glad to have something to use for styling.</li>
            <li> Gel is effective in that I feel my scalp problems have been reduced.  The downside is that it takes longer for my hair to dry.  Even considering that, I am going to continue to order and use the product.</li>
            <li> Great!  Works as well as high priced brand gel without the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like this gel. I have a very sensitive scalp and this works well without the irritating content of other gels.</li>
            <li> Really holds my thin hair in place.</li>
            <li> Holds well but left my hair dry; don&#x27;t care for the scent, either.  For me, this is a throwaway.</li>
            <li> So I bought this stuff for my sensitive scalp. I will say this - this is the least irritating hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used. That being said, it still irritates my scalp if worn for over 12 hours (i.e. must remove before bed). The hold is just OK. I&#x27;d hoped it&#x27;d have a stronger hold and be less irritating. Bummer.</li>
            <li> medium hold, works fine. not perfumey, does not smell bad, washes out easily, makes me ITCH</li>
            <li> This does not bother my allergies or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;BUT...when I see the label with all the chemicals, I am a bit bothered.  Haven&#x27;t made up my mind as to trying other of their products.....wish this was more natural and not so laboratory created.</li>
            <li> The first gel I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t give me allergy symptoms. My scalp no longer itches because it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is unscented since so many hair gels are perfumey.  I wanted something to use in the outdoors in the summertime that wouldn&#x27;t attract bugs.  I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars, however, because it still seems a bit sticky to me.  I have to be careful to use the smallest amount possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use it to straighten my hair. And go over it with a straightening iron. The good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t smell. But it&#x27;s harder to apply than other gels and at the end of the day, my hair feels frizzy and dried out. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for people who have sensitive skin. I love this hair gel.</li>
            <li> works great non comedogenic</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have scent, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I would like it to hold</li>
            <li> I have lichen planus, a dermatological scalp condition. My dermatologist recommended this brand of hair care products to me because they are the least irritating to the scalp. I use their shampoo and conditioner, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair styling gel is great. It is light, but holds my very fine hair in place. I can use it on my wet or dry hair; it&#x27;s effective either way. Once I comb through it, the hold is released, but the shape remains for a little while. No problem, I just apply a little more. One tube has lasted me over two months, but I don&#x27;t use a lot of product (my hair is short and I don&#x27;t fuss with it much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone who spends a lot of time on your hair and are fussy about styling it, this may not be the product for you. But if you have a sensitive scalp and need to give your poor hair or scalp a rest but still need a styling product, try this gel out. It does a fine job.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband with skin allergies.  It works just as well as other styling gels without all the added scents and chemicals that he doesn&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> I have to use gel because of frizzy hair, paired with hairspray - and it bothers my sensitive skin. Even if I don&#x27;t exert energy during the day, without hair gel I look like I just ran 10 miles - the hair is everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel combined with the Free &amp; Clear hair spray (the firm hold one) have really helped out. The problem isn&#x27;t totally gone but most of the root cause is stress anyway.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive scalp and this didn&#x27;t give me a rash or itchiness, even after an entire day. It feels very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; on the hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down. I highly recommend it to everyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is great!  My husband and daughter have sensitivities to chemical scents, so this is perfect for us.  Also, it holds really well.</li>
            <li> This gel has holding power.  It goes on easily and is easy to style.  Most important it does not cause my eyes to burn nor my nose to run nor does it bother my skin.</li>
            <li> This great as non allergenic but does not hold as well as I would like.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is the new Gluten.  I am sensitive to fragrance.  This product has none.  &#x27;enough said.</li>
            <li> works well for older people who have an intolerance for perfumes.</li>
            <li> My youngest has had coarse straight hair since he was born. He has a built in mohawk. No matter what I did, I couldn&#x27;t tame it. I found a baby product (Organic Sprout or something) that was suppose to be baby safe hair gel. I&#x27;m sure it was baby safe, but the smell was horrible and it didn&#x27;t really work. As soon as it dried, it kind of just faded away.&lt;br /&gt;I found this free &amp; clear recently on Amazon, decided to try it. Works great! It is free &amp; clear. No smells. Works great for me to spike his hair and provides long lasting hold. Just what I wanted. Will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Nice hair gel. Not a small at all. Love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this gel because I have sensitive skin and want to use products free of ingredients that are potentially toxic. I&#x27;ve used this product a couple of times. While it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp, my hair feels a bit weighed down after I apply it (even after it dries) and my hair smells funny after a day. Perhaps any gel will weigh hair down and/or produce an undesirable odor, so I will try using less of it and maybe that will improve things. I&#x27;m trying to avoid fragrances, so using a product with them is not really an option.  I&#x27;m generally satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! It works well on my fine, curly hair.  I would buy it again!  I had an allergic reaction to the alcohol in other hair jel products.  This one did the job and left no flakes or itchy scalp!!</li>
            <li> I used this for years, because my choices were limited due to strange allergies.  I don&#x27;t love this.  It is very heavy and doesn&#x27;t do much to help manage hair, except make it look glued.</li>
            <li> I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp. It styles and holds really well with no white flakes on my shoulders, I love that. It holds better than any mainstream product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and also have curly hair so I must use a combination of hair products every day. This gel provides a nice hold.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have very sensitive skin and anything that I put in my hair that touches my skin can cause a rash, but this did not at all!  I have curly to frizzy hair and this gel gave me perfect curls!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t hold my hair very well, and I have fine blond hair.  I liked that it has no scent.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully on natural hair..The gel takes the place of setting lotion..</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected. A good product, should use only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have multiple chemical sensitivites and my husband needed a fragrance free hair gel that I could tolerate.  He&#x27;s rather picky and says this one works for him just fine.  In addition, not only do I not smell anything, I&#x27;m not reacting to it either.  That makes it awesome!</li>
            <li> This gel is as good if not better than any standard... plus it&#x27;s Free &amp; Clear!!</li>
            <li> Free and Clear Hair Styling Gel is fantastic in my book!  I have lots of fine hair that needs some \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; as I near the end of my body wave.  Free and Clear Gel looks natural and gives me that.  It does not irritate the scalp, is light, fragrance free, and washes out.  There is no product build up.  You can&#x27;t beat it!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find completely unscented products but this one truly has no scent. It is also has a very strong hold and still leaves your hair soft and easy to style. Highly recommend this gel.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of shampoo allergies and this is one of the only products I can use.  It holds really well and does not leave my hair \\&quot;hard.\\&quot;  I also have naturally curly hair and it does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> Great product, I will continue to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 weeks, I noticed a great improvement on clearing up acne on my scalp and back of my neck. If you research ingredients that are likely to irritate your skin, this product actually doesn&#x27;t contain any of them. Lanolin can irritate your skin, and this is the only hair gel I found that doesn&#x27;t contain that ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best gel in terms of hold, and it gives a shiny look. If you have short hair, this is no problem.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair gel that I can use.  It has no fragrance and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes red and watery. It does, however, seems to dull my hair a bit so I use only a small amount and apply it to my roots only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually remarkably happy with this product. I figured it probably wouldn&#x27;t work, but it seems to work just fine. I combine this with Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie, and my curls look great! I have 2b/c curls, and this gel helps to keep them in place and frizz free without adding a noxious odor or chemicals that irritate my skin. I used to use a curling gel from L&#x27;Oreal, but I found that it gave me hives if too much of it dripped onto my skin. I am not having that issue with this product.</li>
            <li> Slight alcohol scent when first applied, no fragrance. Holds well.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I was a little concerned with a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products ability to perform in the same way that I am used to with my current (now legacy) hair gel. It worked wonders!  Try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried less toxic, organic, natural hair products before. Usually they are ineffective, don&#x27;t hold strongly enough, or flake. I have been very impressed with this product all around. It is not expensive. It holds quite well and doesn&#x27;t flake at all. It is a firm hold gel. If you&#x27;re going to use hair products daily, as I do, it&#x27;s probably best to minimize your exposure to toxic substances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives I can think of are that I need to use slightly more gel than my previous toxic gunk, but its worth it to me if it lessens my exposure to cancer causing carcinogens. I plan to purchase this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> My scalp no longer feels uncomfortable now that I am using this product! I have a lot of allergies and this product is perfect.  It holds really well and does not leave my hair &amp;#34;hard.&amp;#34; I also have naturally curly hair and it leaves it manageable.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Altho I would prefer it was a foam or spray rather then a gel.  It tends to be a bit sticky if you aren&#x27;t careful how you apply it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance so the Free and clear product line is exactly what I need in hygienic products for day to day use.</li>
            <li> It was, indeed, fragrant free as I had hoped, but when I applied it to my \\&quot;natural color\\&quot; color rinse I put on my hair, it began to wipe out the color in my hair, so I stopped using it.  Other then that, if you&#x27;re not coloring your hair or if you&#x27;re using a stronger permanent color, it wouldn&#x27;t matter.  I may try some of their other products.  It&#x27;s great to be able to find fragrant free products.</li>
            <li> I am ultra sensitive and normal over the counter hair gels cause my face and scalp to become red and itchy. I do not react to this product at all. It&#x27;s not only non reactive to my skin, but it&#x27;s a great quality hair gel also.</li>
            <li> Works on my hair for a few hours If Im not doing anything, but my hair instant frizzes if Im outside/doing any sort of activity. I have super curly hair though and have had to use got2b glue Mohawk gel in the past to keep my hair in regulation. It was the only thing that works. So if you have more manageable hair than me Id imagine it would work quite well.</li>
            <li> a hair saver because this is the only unscented hair gel out there...i first became aware of this brand at the mayo clinic in rochester mn...that is saying something...the product works great too...</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Free and Clear Hair Styling Gel.  It works great with my short hair.  Will order it again.</li>
            <li> If you like something like what they used to call sticky pomade stuff for your hair you&#x27;d like this. But it is just way too thick for me in my short hair or for my husband with his slightly balding thin hair. Once on, even with a light touch of it, it feels like a thin plastic layer or liner  on your head.&lt;br /&gt;The only positive for me was there is almost no odor--and that&#x27;s a good thing. It says \\&quot;dermatologist recommended\\&quot; but not sure if it&#x27;s a Derm association or just one local Derm saying that.  Hope this helped you.</li>
            <li> This Gel is okay, but you have to be careful and  not use too much. Working well for my allergy problems. I would recommend it to any one, who is concerned with all the bad ingredients in most of the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and started looking into both hypo-allergenic gel and shampoo. This gel product works...it will hold your hair together and comes in a good size tube for the price.</li>
            <li> Did not like the feel of it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this product holds as well as well as traditional gels but holds well enough for my needs and I love that it us hypo-allergenic. It may well hold even better if more product is used but I use it very sparingly and it still accomplishes my desires. I think it is very fairly priced too.</li>
            <li> I get a maddening itchy scalp and stinging sores from any hair product containing fragrance.  I really wanted to like this product, but it just isn&#x27;t much at all.  I have slightly frizzy wavy hair, and I wish I could find a moisturizing styling cream to add some smooth texture. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find an unscented one anywhere.  I tried this gel hoping it would work just as well, but I found that even though it didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, it was just a mediocre gel with little holding power that makes my hair look sort of greasy and adds no moisture or real benefit to my hair.  My hair actually seems poofier and more frizzy since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I&#x27;m sad it didn&#x27;t work.  Not overly excited about the entire Free and Clear line so far, and I&#x27;ve tried this and the conditioner, which is also worthless.  Too bad.  Another waste of money.  The search is still on.</li>
            <li> Product is sticky. Be very careful not to get too much in hair.</li>
            <li> It said it is unscented, but it was not. I got sick by just inhaling it.</li>
            <li> This hair gel works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s not scented, which is great for sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> This hair gel is better than most hair gels from the beauty section of all the other stores. It&#x27;s great for me with my hand eczema.</li>
            <li> Ever since I found out I have allergies to fragerance, I searched high and low to find products that work on my thin fine hair.  This one does and I&#x27;m thrilled!!  Yay!!</li>
            <li> Super strong gel! Works great! No itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> good product added volume will order again</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that works the way it was advertised.  The gel is not heavy or sticky. Brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything under the sun, it feels like -- certainly to the chemicals commonly used in most hair products. This gel is inexpensive and clear of most allergy-causing chemicals. I started using it because it was easier than translating the arcane ingredients list of the expensive &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair products, and I&#x27;ve stayed with it because it has a nice, light hold, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something that adds gloss and stiff styling, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds my wavy hair in soft curls in a natural look, bouncy and &amp;#34;hair-colored&amp;#34; (not shiny glossy).  I use it less as a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; than as a &amp;#34;curl keeper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear Products are about the only skin, hair, and moisturizing products my extraordinarily sensitive skin can tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;This is lightweight, not sticky and does the trick great!  Wet or dry it is the perfect companion for &amp;#34; the hair challenged&amp;#34;  It won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but it doesn&#x27;t make the boy&#x27;s face get a rash.  (eczema)</li>
            <li> No itching for my sensitive scalp.  Provides lasting hold for curls.  Does not flake.  Does not change make my blonde hair brassy.  Have used it for three years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pro in the hair biz. No-one uses gel anymore, shiny crusty hair is out of style (again), but if you want good thick gel with no tacky fragrance, this is it! Virtually ALL other gels turn to water in your hand, this one has umph!</li>
            <li> My hair needs more hold, but this is an okay gel overall. Great for anyone with sensitivity to other hair care products.</li>
            <li> Great product. Product is good for sensitive scalp; does not flake or make scalp itch. Product holds the hair in place but does not look stiff which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This works very well for natural curly hair (very tight curls--pencil width curls)</li>
            <li> My order came quickly.  The gel helps make my hair more manageable and doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Aggravate my sensitive scalp.  I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Salon quality.  Fantasic product.  I am highly alergic to chemicals and this product passes with flying colors.  Free and Clear has amazing products that work.  My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Truly as good as everyone else has reviewed it.  Absolutely odorless, but with GREAT hold.....but not stiff.  Works great on my sensitive scalp and I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s expensive, but in this case you really get what you pay for...plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product along with the shampoo and conditioner to help calm my rosacea. It IS non-irritating but it doesn&#x27;t perform very well as a hair gel -- doesn&#x27;t add volume or body, just kind of sits there.</li>
            <li> Good hold but thick and sticky.  Unfortunately I am allergic to almost everything and, since Clinique no longer makes a hypoallergenic/fragrance free styling gel (which I loved!), this is the only one that I have found that I can tolerate.</li>
            <li> This is what I put in my first review, which at the time I gave only 3 stars: \\&quot;I used this product for the first time today. It does a good job of holding hair in place but I had a respiratory reaction to it that will keep me from using it again. (I have asthma and it caused constriction in my bronchial tubes.)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve raised the stars to five because I gave the product another chance and it didn&#x27;t affect my asthma. I then used it a third time to make sure it was still okay before updating my review. It was, so I feel I can recommend the product without reservation. I don&#x27;t know why I had that initial bad experience, but it might have been that the first dab had more of some ingredient in it. This is a product I will be reordering and using with confidence.</li>
            <li> I like this product cause I like that it has few chemicals.  I typically like using chemical free or organic products.  But I wanted to give this product a try.  I found that I had to use VERY little of this product because it left my hair with a \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; feel to it.  Other than that, I think this product is ok.  Not sure if I would buy it again, though.</li>
            <li> I have severe eczema due to product allergies...and got this to tame my hair...works well so far, no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I have between wavy and curly hair that isn&#x27;t thin, but can get weighted down easily. I hate most leave-in products, but I&#x27;ve figured out how to use this one, and it&#x27;s great. Some folks have complained about this being too thick and crunchy. It is when I use too much, or when I use it alone. If I first put on a small amount of leave-in conditioner (current favorite is Jessicurl&#x27;s deep conditioner, fragrance free) or even lotion (current favorite is Alaffia everyday shea moisturizing lotion, fragrance free), and then put the stying gel in, it stays soft and curly. This is more fragrance and odor free than any leave-in product I&#x27;ve found. Big plus.</li>
            <li> If this is not a new product, I wish I&#x27;d found it earlier.  Clinique used to have hypo allergenic gell but discontinued it years ago. I&#x27;ve used mousse since but really pefer the gell.  This is close to the Clinique strong hold so use as directed, just a fingertip is great for my short abundant but fine hair.</li>
            <li> Have true everything - salon Allure top-rated Hollywood hit list faves to drugstore stuff. This beats them all and is truly fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People complaining about stickiness or ineffectiveness likely do not truly understand how to use styling products period. This one is no different: you need only a TINY amount (ex., TINY&#x3D;nickel size dollop for short fine hair &amp; only a tear drop more for longer hair and it does not and should not go onto the scalp - it goes onto roots of hair for lift and drawn over hair lightly with hands to add any desired bulk to hair for control. To get a piecey look to hair ends, put between fingers and draw just very ends of hair through your fingers there and yes ALL of this from just that nickel&#x27;s worth of product). If you feel a need for more than this amount of product, you may want to get a second opinion about whether your idea of style is outdated or as helpful to your image as you may think, know what I mean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: sit down and bend over so your hair is hanging down towards floor and apply that way thus avoiding getting the stuff onto scalp or weighing down too much hair with too much product.</li>
            <li> Hair Styling Gel is sticky.</li>
            <li> Gentle and does the job.  Like it because it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of extra ingredients or fragrances.  Doesn&#x27;t hold all that well, but it does okay.  Kind of expensive.  Satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with people that can&#x27;t have any scents and it&#x27;s become a big hit! Don&#x27;t need much and just have to wash hands after use, as it does get sticky on hands after application. Does really well on the hair though. Delivers a hold and is scent free.</li>
            <li> I use the Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and like it a lot, but the gel is too strong -- once it starts to set, I can hardly comb my hair without seeing breakage.</li>
            <li> simply the best styling gel ever made</li>
            <li> This is basically the only hair gel I can use due to my psoriasis and was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  Fortunately it not only works great on my sensitive scalp it is also a very good hair product. I find a little goes a long way, on my fine hair, which does go down my back.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, or cause any flaking or residue in my hair, and it easily washes out.  I will say that it darkens my hair some but I think you would be hard pressed to find a hair gel that doesn&#x27;t do this on light hair.  Overall it holds my curls in shape well even in moderate humidity and is odorless and relatively light weight.  My only concern is what will happen if the company stops making it!!!</li>
            <li> Odor free hair syling gell is hartd to come by. This works fine. I can recommend this to anyone who has airborne allergies.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! I live with a chemically sensitive person so smell on most hair products can make her very ill. This stuff doesn&#x27;t both her at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but just use little it dose help my fine, thin hair stay put.</li>
            <li> Free&amp;Clear and Vanicream products are perfect for me because I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances. They have minimal ingredients, so fewer things to be allergic to. And they work well. I use the Hair Gel, Shampoo, Conditioner, Skin Cream, Lite Lotion, Vaniply Ointment, and Liquid Cleanser. All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the hair gel, if it&#x27;s too concentrated for you, try mixing it with water to make a light gel. You can mix a little in the palm of your hand, or mix more in a cup. Also if you have thick, curly hair, you could put in a dab of conditioner to lower the volume and make it into a softer hold.</li>
            <li> It definitely has no scent.  Smells like rubbing alcohol but this scent dissipates when dry.  Free &amp; Clear Styling Gel is a firm hold product.  I put my usual amount on and couldn&#x27;t get the styling brush through it.  From now on I will use a much smaller amount and dilute it with water, to thin it out even further,  then apply to my wet hair.&lt;br /&gt; It is drying for my scalp and causes very minor itching, but I&#x27;ve never found a gel or hair spray, that worked, that didn&#x27;t do this.  All in all, Free &amp; Clear does the allergen free job for me as usual.</li>
            <li> A good choice for those who have skin sensitivity issues. The brand was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s allergy doctor. It works for me.</li>
            <li> This product is so thick and difficult to use that it isn&#x27;t worth the effort.  More like glue than gel.</li>
            <li> Will be a repeat customer for sure. No smell and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has helped with my scalp to reduce occurrences of eczema and dandruff. Would recommend for someone who suffers from eczema or psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Good for someone with skin allergy.  It isn&#x27;t the best hair gel and I prefer to use hair wax, but my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch anymore.</li>
            <li> I have recently developed a sensitivity to a whole range of beauty and cleaning products, and this product really helped me with this allergy. I will continue to use this brand, as it has nearly cured my chronic urticaria. Great value for a great product! Thank you for the relief!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this product. It&#x27;s much stickier than I expected based on the reviews I read, which is great because I want my hair to stand up. (Full disclosure: I&#x27;m in California, so I don&#x27;t know how local weather conditions affect how the gel performs.) Plus I love that there are no fragrances or any of the more dangerous chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I use it because it is scent free. It is a good product</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the Free &amp; Clear hairspray, shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I have a very itchy scalp and wanted to see if my hair products were causing it.  I used these Free &amp; Clear products solely for well over 2 months.  It did not seem to affect my scalp - either making it better or worse.  As for the specific performance of this gel, I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  I used it for an  all-over curl definition with my perm.  Although I used very little for my whole head, it did make my hair kind of crunchy and was hard to disperse all over.  I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> No fragrance and is a great styling product.  It doesn&#x27;t give me the volume I like but without the fragrance of other products, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I only use this sparingly on my roots, and usually mix it with a little water. But it provides that little extra body I want.</li>
            <li> My scalp has gotten so sensitive to hair products.  This works great and not rash!</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!! THANKS SO MUCH!!!!</li>
            <li> Expensive, gel is very stiff when applied so you don&#x27;t need much of it. I use it in the fall exclusively for hunting season as its scent free and its effective for the non oder/neutral smell.</li>
            <li> Another great Free and Clear product for hair.  Most gels eventually make my scalp itch.  Not this one.  A tiny bit of the product on my damp palms is enough to tame the frizz in my curly hair.  The 7-ounce tube should last for months.  I highly recommend this hair gel.</li>
            <li> Not quite as much hold as I wanted.  Stays looking wet after it is dry, therefore looks greasy.</li>
            <li> For people with eczema or simply sensitive scalp -- this is for you. Having eczema, I&#x27;ve tried to find products that won&#x27;t irritate my scalp, no matter the cost. This is a great addition to the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner that comes from Free &amp; Clear as well. It has a nice hold, and if you want to run your hands through your hair, won&#x27;t flake the heck out of your hair. It&#x27;ll leave it with sort of a matted look, which is fine by me. Much preferable than what other items do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;ve only purchased one bottle quite a while ago and use it sparingly, so it&#x27;s lasted many months. But still as good as the day I&#x27;d received it.</li>
            <li> Works well to help hold curl (from curling iron)as long as I blow dry hair first. Otherwise hair glues together and cannot comb thru. I am sensitive to chemicals and fragrances but this product does not bother me</li>
            <li> This gel is awful. After using this, my hair was stiff and sticky. I tried to blow dry it, like normal, but it wouldn&#x27;t dry properly. I finally gave up and pulled my hair into a bun. The next day, I tried again, thinking I might have used too much the first day. Unfortunately, I got the same results, except now I had gel in clumps on only parts of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length, straight hair. Each strand is fine, but I have a lot of strands. I think this product would work best on someone with long, curly hair, who wants the \\&quot;wet look.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, it is completely unscented, not just \\&quot;no fragrance added.\\&quot; There is no scent at all.</li>
            <li> I really like the gel. Its not too heavy for fine hair</li>
            <li> This is the first styling gel I have found that I haven&#x27;t been allergic to. It works pretty well, but doesn&#x27;t hold for a long time.  You will need hairspray or something to hold the style in place.</li>
            <li> Have senstive skin and other gels tend to cause my scalp to break out.  This works really well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is really good for my hair ... no alcohol and holds well!</li>
