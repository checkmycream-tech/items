            <li>my favorite being Regina Harris - Frankincense Myrrh Rose Maroc)</li>
            <li>warm, sexy and spicy.</li>
            <li>so I would say suitable for men to use.</li>
            <li>She said it smelled so clean and good that she wanted to go get some.</li>
            <li>Too many flowery notes, very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>I LIKE INDIGO WILD PRODUCTS VERY GOOD PRODUCTS...</li>
            <li>Spicy, exotic, sexy, calming.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite scent of Indigo Wilds.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love Avignon</li>
            <li>Bar none, Zum is the fragrance I have received the most compliments and comments on.</li>
            <li>All Zum has done is place those oils together with a lovely carrier oil (Jojoba, also known for</li>
            <li>I may be biased, I love all Zum products.</li>
            <li>I love this smell.</li>
            <li>LOVE to add this to some unscented dryer sheets</li>
            <li>I have used this for over 10 years and LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - so does everyone who smells it.</li>
            <li>If it smells okay in soaps, I may consider reordering when this is used up, but otherwise, I don&#x27;t intend to buy it again.</li>
            <li>All Zum has done is place those oils together with a lovely carrier oil (Jojoba, also known for</li>
            <li>my suprised the Zum alleviated a lot of the emotional/mental side effects of chemotherapy and puts me into a state of calm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It DOES smell better after being on a while.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, and I receive compliments on it all the time. :-)</li>
            <li>Love this one...</li>
            <li>I totally LOVE this so much!!!!</li>
            <li>I was hoping I would love this, but it is way too strong.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents fast shipping and good product</li>
            <li>It smells so good and comes in large bottle for the price</li>
            <li>This is a VERY sweet  smell and not the earthly, musky scent that I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Also, layering a dab of this and a spray of Avignon by Comme des Garcons is pretty amazing :)  </li>
            <li>arrived on time, smells awesome and not much is needed.</li>
            <li>A lovely natural fragrance, warm and woodsy-- rather head-shoppish, but in the best possible way.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s incredible beneficial properties for human skin), a touch of phtalate free fragrance oil, and put them in a convenient roller bottle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s incredible beneficial properties for human skin), a touch of phtalate free fragrance oil, and put them in a convenient roller bottle.</li>
            <li>Too strong for me to wear.</li>
            <li>Both were gifted to baby Jesus, both were worth a year&#x27;s wages in their time of glory, and both still produce a fragrance fit for royalty.</li>
            <li>Both were gifted to baby Jesus, both were worth a year&#x27;s wages in their time of glory, and both still produce a fragrance fit for royalty.</li>
            <li>I find I need to reapply after 3-4 hours, but the bottle has a huge amount (1.3 ounces)</li>
            <li>Or very sparingly during warm weather.</li>
            <li>The smell last all day and the roll on bottle with the fat roller is great.</li>
            <li>The dominant note I get is like overscented baby powder meets cheap air freshener, both on my body and on fabric.</li>
            <li>It is so soothing, so refreshing, so calming, so complimentary...</li>
            <li>she nailed it as Skin So Soft bug repellant, which to be fair probably contains some frankincense and/or myrrh</li>
            <li>I wear this on almost a daily basis and have had so many compliments on it because it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>If you want something that is chemical free with a clean smell</li>
            <li>It is super strong.</li>
            <li>You will need to reapply if your day is longer than 10 hours, but I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay for that perfect signature scent.</li>
            <li>Will stain your clothes, VERY strong, good to put on your pillows (if dark colored) b/c of staining.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean......</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it online for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>A quick roll on the wrist and done.</li>
            <li>The very first time I wore it</li>
            <li>Problem is that it is very strong when you first put it on (no discreet application - even though it is a roll on) but it totally fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of their cleaning products but this one smells too strong and is a different scent.</li>
            <li>This smells as good as the other products in the Zum line, the scents are exceptional and last.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Not really crazy about this.  </li>
            <li>I get tons of compliments when I wear frankincense and myrrh its rich&lt;br /&gt;and spicy fragrance, Fellas it will may the ladies smile...</li>
            <li>Perfumery is a highly subjective experience and even the greatest perfumes in the world have negative reviews on sites like luckyscent.</li>
            <li>I find it fairly strong, and the scent lingers for a good long while, so I just dab a tiny bit on.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure an essential oils body perfume from your brand line would be right up my alley.</li>
            <li>It is hard to explain but great product.  </li>
            <li>but occasionally I wish it had just a touch more sweetness to it</li>
            <li>Because I like the idea that Frankincense &amp; Myrrh were two of the first three gifts of Christmas I decided to try the perfume oil.</li>
            <li>, I was very pleasantly surprised when my order arrived with a free sample soap tucked into the package.</li>
            <li>My mother has a pretty insightful palette</li>
            <li>this is EXACTLY the scent i have been searching for.</li>
            <li>I think it smells better at the end of the day, actually.</li>
            <li>and it really is a unisex smell!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant in purchasing this item before actually being able to smell it</li>
            <li>It is not the tiny roll-on&#x27;s that are the size of a lip stick, it is more the size of that glue which comes in a tube</li>
            <li>All the reviews were positive...</li>
            <li>old bottle is full but I ordered another bottle as backup/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>THEY ARE MADE OF PURE INGREDIENTS NO CHEMICALS..GREAT STUFF</li>
            <li>It looks like it&#x27;s going to last a good long time, tool, as it doesn&#x27;t take much to reach saturation point with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>frangrance is exotic, spicy, light and very long lasting.</li>
            <li>It is an unusual scent that gets noticed.  </li>
            <li>the roll-on at my pulse points, and one application lasts the whole day</li>
            <li>So thank you to the sellers who carry it and got it here fast.</li>
            <li>I like your laundry products so, so much.</li>
            <li>its a very calming smell and also a very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li>I have not used any of this the smell is too much, I have tried applying with a cotton ball</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced really well, too.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the near future!</li>
            <li>It is a generous bottle and you will enjoy using it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>Some Good Oil and fragrance u can even use it for your underarms a fragrance that will last all day it has roll on so you don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend Zum Frankincense/Myrhh to any who needs a</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM HIGHLY....</li>
            <li>Love the scent (a little goes a loooooooooong way, but I must have an allergy to something in this</li>
            <li>I first tried this scent at a local Whole Foods Market.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong, and I&#x27;m always worried that I&#x27;ve put on too much.  </li>
            <li>Goes on strong but dies down to a close-to-skin aura in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>The bottle is larger than it looks and smells a bit exotic like Egyptian musk, I think next time I will try a different brand  .</li>
            <li>This is the only perfume I have ever worn that consistently gets complimented everywhere I go.</li>
            <li>A little strong</li>
            <li>Also, the sellers were nice enough to include a small Zum soap sample.</li>
            <li>NO KIDDING, wherever I go, people (young and old) mention it!</li>
            <li>Less familiar with Myrrh - thought I&#x27;d take a chance - well.  </li>
            <li>and I melt real frankincense resin in an oil burner regularly and this just comes nowhere near my hopes.</li>
            <li>If you order directly from the Zum company Web site they add $20 to ship to Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Smells like old women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, but not too light</li>
            <li>No one can stand to be near me when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>Commercial perfumes have about 150 very TOXIC chemicals in them which I am working to avoid.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe a little more essential oil next time?</li>
            <li>price is very reasonable to dept store fragrances and is very long lasting yet not cloying.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cross between Coty&#x27;s Emeraude and Chantilly perfumes, but natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d bought a bottle of Eau de Zum a few years back at Whole Foods and put it up.&lt;br /&gt;Recently found it among my large collection of oils and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Both were gifted to baby Jesus, both were worth a year&#x27;s wages in their time of glory, and both still produce a fragrance fit for royalty.</li>

            <li> I find I need to reapply after 3-4 hours, but the bottle has a huge amount (1.3 ounces)</li>
            <li> Or very sparingly during warm weather.</li>
            <li> The smell last all day and the roll on bottle with the fat roller is great.</li>
            <li> The dominant note I get is like overscented baby powder meets cheap air freshener, both on my body and on fabric.</li>
            <li> It is so soothing, so refreshing, so calming, so complimentary...</li>
            <li> she nailed it as Skin So Soft bug repellant, which to be fair probably contains some frankincense and/or myrrh</li>
            <li> I wear this on almost a daily basis and have had so many compliments on it because it smells so good.  </li>
            <li> If you want something that is chemical free with a clean smell</li>
            <li> It is super strong.</li>
            <li> You will need to reapply if your day is longer than 10 hours, but I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay for that perfect signature scent.</li>
            <li> Will stain your clothes, VERY strong, good to put on your pillows (if dark colored) b/c of staining.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean......</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find it online for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> A quick roll on the wrist and done.</li>
            <li> The very first time I wore it</li>
            <li> Problem is that it is very strong when you first put it on (no discreet application - even though it is a roll on) but it totally fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of their cleaning products but this one smells too strong and is a different scent.</li>
            <li> This smells as good as the other products in the Zum line, the scents are exceptional and last.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Not really crazy about this.  </li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments when I wear frankincense and myrrh its rich&lt;br /&gt;and spicy fragrance, Fellas it will may the ladies smile...</li>
            <li> Perfumery is a highly subjective experience and even the greatest perfumes in the world have negative reviews on sites like luckyscent.</li>
            <li> I find it fairly strong, and the scent lingers for a good long while, so I just dab a tiny bit on.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure an essential oils body perfume from your brand line would be right up my alley.</li>
            <li> It is hard to explain but great product.  </li>
            <li> but occasionally I wish it had just a touch more sweetness to it</li>
            <li> Because I like the idea that Frankincense &amp; Myrrh were two of the first three gifts of Christmas I decided to try the perfume oil.</li>
            <li> , I was very pleasantly surprised when my order arrived with a free sample soap tucked into the package.</li>
            <li> My mother has a pretty insightful palette</li>
            <li> this is EXACTLY the scent i have been searching for.</li>
            <li> I think it smells better at the end of the day, actually.</li>
            <li> and it really is a unisex smell!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant in purchasing this item before actually being able to smell it</li>
            <li> It is not the tiny roll-on&#x27;s that are the size of a lip stick, it is more the size of that glue which comes in a tube</li>
            <li> All the reviews were positive...</li>
            <li> old bottle is full but I ordered another bottle as backup/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> THEY ARE MADE OF PURE INGREDIENTS NO CHEMICALS..GREAT STUFF</li>
            <li> It looks like it&#x27;s going to last a good long time, tool, as it doesn&#x27;t take much to reach saturation point with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> frangrance is exotic, spicy, light and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> It is an unusual scent that gets noticed.  </li>
            <li> the roll-on at my pulse points, and one application lasts the whole day</li>
            <li> So thank you to the sellers who carry it and got it here fast.</li>
            <li> I like your laundry products so, so much.</li>
            <li> its a very calming smell and also a very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> I have not used any of this the smell is too much, I have tried applying with a cotton ball</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced really well, too.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more in the near future!</li>
            <li> It is a generous bottle and you will enjoy using it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Some Good Oil and fragrance u can even use it for your underarms a fragrance that will last all day it has roll on so you don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend Zum Frankincense/Myrhh to any who needs a</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM HIGHLY....</li>
            <li> Love the scent (a little goes a loooooooooong way, but I must have an allergy to something in this</li>
            <li> I first tried this scent at a local Whole Foods Market.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong, and I&#x27;m always worried that I&#x27;ve put on too much.  </li>
            <li> Goes on strong but dies down to a close-to-skin aura in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The bottle is larger than it looks and smells a bit exotic like Egyptian musk, I think next time I will try a different brand  .</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I have ever worn that consistently gets complimented everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> A little strong</li>
            <li> Also, the sellers were nice enough to include a small Zum soap sample.</li>
            <li> NO KIDDING, wherever I go, people (young and old) mention it!</li>
            <li> Less familiar with Myrrh - thought I&#x27;d take a chance - well.  </li>
            <li> and I melt real frankincense resin in an oil burner regularly and this just comes nowhere near my hopes.</li>
            <li> If you order directly from the Zum company Web site they add $20 to ship to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Smells like old women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, but not too light</li>
            <li> No one can stand to be near me when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> Commercial perfumes have about 150 very TOXIC chemicals in them which I am working to avoid.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe a little more essential oil next time?</li>
            <li> price is very reasonable to dept store fragrances and is very long lasting yet not cloying.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cross between Coty&#x27;s Emeraude and Chantilly perfumes, but natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bought a bottle of Eau de Zum a few years back at Whole Foods and put it up.&lt;br /&gt;Recently found it among my large collection of oils and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only issue is it does not last very long</li>
            <li> a tiny amount goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be wearing this as my signature scent for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be wearing this as my signature scent for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> Very subtle and sweet with a tinge of woodsy.  </li>
            <li> BUT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE HONEST IN HOW BAD THIS STUFF SMELLS AND NOT BE DOOPED INTO BUYING</li>
            <li> It lasts long, I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> it rubbed onto 16 hours ago and these terrible baby-meets-grandmashouse fumes are still dominating any trace of that uplifting old churchy scent I love so much.</li>
            <li> Just the other day, I was at a clothing store, just doing some shopping, and one of the salespeople walked up and asked me point blank what I was wearing.</li>
            <li> This little bottle is going to last me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then, I developed a serious illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s my bad that I didn&#x27;t track this one down in a store before dropping $20 on it, but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate my opinion.</li>
            <li> so evidently I&#x27;m not overdoing.  </li>
            <li> I have other frankincense myrrh perfumes that I adore (</li>
            <li> will be ordering other products in the frankincense and myrrh family.</li>
            <li> &quot; It should mean that it is an unhelpful review for future prospective buyers.</li>
            <li> and since I like Stetson I would say it&#x27;s less perfumey smelling than that</li>
            <li> THE REVIEWS WERE REALLY DEAD ON..............</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overwhelming and almost sickening.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> it sure smells awful.</li>
            <li> Hard to put into words</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of  Nature&#x27;s Gate conditioner, which I&#x27;ve been using since the late &#x27;70s.  </li>
            <li> That really stinks because I knew I wanted to return it even before the UPS dude had left our driveway, and Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow returns on this item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, downvoting doesn&#x27;t mean</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-toxic perfume replacement that was not $100 like my Dior or other expensive perfumes which I no longer use.  </li>
            <li> Although everyone wears scents differently - this one smelled bad even in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but there seem to be different varieties - one smells bad and one heavenly.  </li>
            <li> Who could fault products made with essential oils as the base?</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and she was not happy with the scent.</li>
            <li> Who could fault products made with essential oils as the base?</li>
            <li> NO MORE on line perfume purchases for me  - buying scent unknown is a bad idea, isn&#x27;t it?!  </li>
            <li> I am addicted!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Not even a faint bit leftover unless you get some on your clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> STINKS</li>
            <li> IS THAT BAD</li>
            <li> I knew what to expect and I am in no ways ever disappointed by Zum&#x27;s products.</li>

            <li> This smells sooooooooo good.  Spicy, exotic, sexy, calming.  It is an unusual scent that gets noticed.  I also have the room spray.  I am addicted!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice now. It&#x27;s my favorite scent of Indigo Wilds. I have almost all of their sprays. I love this oil. It lasts long, I get compliments all the time. I love this scent. I will continue to purchase it</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift from my son. :)  The scent reminds me of  Nature&#x27;s Gate conditioner, which I&#x27;ve been using since the late &#x27;70s.  Warm and spicy, best for cool/cold weather.  Also, layering a dab of this and a spray of Avignon by Comme des Garcons is pretty amazing :)  I love Avignon and it&#x27;s the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to a good church incense resin blend, but occasionally I wish it had just a touch more sweetness to it and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of their cleaning products but this one smells too strong and is a different scent. It is sitting in my cupboard, unloved.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not I purchased this perfume oil on the recommendation of another customer review. I ordered a Frankincense &amp; Myrrh candle from Amazon by Yum Scents. It smells so beautiful that I ordered two more to burn during the holidays. Because I like the idea that Frankincense &amp; Myrrh were two of the first three gifts of Christmas I decided to try the perfume oil. This oil smells just like the candle, but keep in mind that it is a spicy scent from the Orient and a tiny amount goes a long, long way. And it is a perfect scent to use during the cool weather months. Or very sparingly during warm weather. It is a generous bottle and you will enjoy using it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> it has an amazing smell - people tell me that i smell wonderful - it does not take a lot - i have given up my $75.00 perfunes for this -</li>
            <li> Smells like bug spray and gasoline. Gave me the biggest headache in the world!</li>
            <li> My mother purchased this from WholeFoods and every time she came over she smelled so good.  I purchased one and absolutely love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil</li>
            <li> This brand is all I ever wear. It has a scent that will leave people wondering or asking what you are wearing. I also use the soap and body mist. When sprayed on clothes it stays on forever! It is clearly the best!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume--it&#x27;s a very warm, spicy, woodsy scent. I find it fairly strong, and the scent lingers for a good long while, so I just dab a tiny bit on. This little bottle is going to last me forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was very pleasantly surprised when my order arrived with a free sample soap tucked into the package.</li>
            <li> THIS SMELLS WORSE THAN THE SPRAY BOTTLE!!!!  IT REMINDS ME OF BODY ODOR WITHOUT DEODORANT.  OH MY GOD, I HAVE NEVER PUT UP A REVIEW FOR SOMETHING THAT TO ME IS THAT BAD BUT THIS IS ONE OF THEM.  I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE VENDORS AT ALL BUT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE HONEST IN HOW BAD THIS STUFF SMELLS AND NOT BE DOOPED INTO BUYING THIS LIKE I WAS THINKING THE REVIEWS WERE REALLY DEAD ON..............I WAS SOOOOOOO WRONG WITH THIS ONE!!!!  DON&#x27;T LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS, THIS ONE STINKS SO BAD!!!!</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this oil I get compliments. The smell last all day and the roll on bottle with the fat roller is great.</li>
            <li> Not really crazy about this.  The scent is a little strong, and I&#x27;m always worried that I&#x27;ve put on too much.  Haven&#x27;t had any comments on it, so evidently I&#x27;m not overdoing.  Probably will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I first tried this scent at a local Whole Foods Market. It was one of the perfume offerings the store had just put up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, man. It smells absolutely wonderful: clean, spicy, woodsy. Perfect. It&#x27;s a great unisex scent, but when I wear it, I get the nicest compliments from women who think it smells feminine. Just the other day, I was at a clothing store, just doing some shopping, and one of the salespeople walked up and asked me point blank what I was wearing. She said it smelled so clean and good that she wanted to go get some. At that point, I wasn&#x27;t using the roll-on but rather the spray, and it was still getting compliments in spite of its lightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this, I layer the scent with the body spray all over my upper body and the roll-on at my pulse points, and one application lasts the whole day through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!</li>
            <li> I have other frankincense myrrh perfumes that I adore (my favorite being Regina Harris - Frankincense Myrrh Rose Maroc) and I melt real frankincense resin in an oil burner regularly and this just comes nowhere near my hopes. The dominant note I get is like overscented baby powder meets cheap air freshener, both on my body and on fabric. It&#x27;s overwhelming and almost sickening. I just picked up my sweater it rubbed onto 16 hours ago and these terrible baby-meets-grandmashouse fumes are still dominating any trace of that uplifting old churchy scent I love so much. Yuck. My mother has a pretty insightful palette and I asked her opinion - she nailed it as Skin So Soft bug repellant, which to be fair probably contains some frankincense and/or myrrh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, downvoting doesn&#x27;t mean \\&quot;I disagree.\\&quot; It should mean that it is an unhelpful review for future prospective buyers. I&#x27;m not downvoting the five star reviews just because my experience differs and you shouldn&#x27;t either. Perfumery is a highly subjective experience and even the greatest perfumes in the world have negative reviews on sites like luckyscent. All of them together help us make decisions. Sure, it&#x27;s my bad that I didn&#x27;t track this one down in a store before dropping $20 on it, but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate my opinion.</li>
            <li> this is EXACTLY the scent i have been searching for. warm, sexy and spicy. have gotten rave reviews from others. keep up the good work. will be ordering other products in the frankincense and myrrh family.</li>
            <li> Bar none, Zum is the fragrance I have received the most compliments and comments on. I was pleased to find it online for a reasonable cost. NO KIDDING, wherever I go, people (young and old) mention it! I just had to get some more! So thank you to the sellers who carry it and got it here fast. If you order directly from the Zum company Web site they add $20 to ship to Hawaii. These sellers sent it USPS so it was under $6. Also, the sellers were nice enough to include a small Zum soap sample. Thank you again!  Aloha from Hawaii</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents fast shipping and good product</li>
            <li> The bottle is larger than it looks and smells a bit exotic like Egyptian musk, I think next time I will try a different brand  .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance! It is so soothing, so refreshing, so calming, so complimentary...I will purchase more in the near future!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Eau de Zum&#x27;s Frankincense and Myrrh roll on perfume via Quality Goods LLC. It shipped incredibly quickly in safe packaging, and arrived in perfect condition. I knew what to expect and I am in no ways ever disappointed by Zum&#x27;s products. Who could fault products made with essential oils as the base? Frankincense and Myrrh are time honored resins/oils from antiquity used even by the Egyptians in anti-aging facials. Frankincense was used for centuries as incense in a variety of sacred settings. Both were gifted to baby Jesus, both were worth a year&#x27;s wages in their time of glory, and both still produce a fragrance fit for royalty. All Zum has done is place those oils together with a lovely carrier oil (Jojoba, also known for it&#x27;s incredible beneficial properties for human skin), a touch of phtalate free fragrance oil, and put them in a convenient roller bottle. I&#x27;ll definitely be wearing this as my signature scent for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> The best roll on a ever had..very powerful</li>
            <li> My yoga teacher wears this and it haunts me, especially during the final savasana. It helps me to relax and calms my mind.</li>
            <li> In love...sweet and spicy. Last all day. I think it smells better at the end of the day, actually. Great bargain for the quality. I may be biased, I love all Zum products.</li>
            <li> This has become my signature fragrance. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that Eau de Zum has a wonderful rich aroma, the roll on dispenser provides a &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; application amount. I&#x27;m constantly receiving compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Oh Zum. I like your laundry products so, so much. I thought for sure an essential oils body perfume from your brand line would be right up my alley. I was wrong. Too many flowery notes, very strong fragrance. It stuffs my nose up instantly. I tried to give it to my mom and she didn&#x27;t want it either. That really stinks because I knew I wanted to return it even before the UPS dude had left our driveway, and Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow returns on this item. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. It is amazing, especially in the winter. It just warms you up!</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again. It smells so good and comes in large bottle for the price</li>
            <li> It is super strong. Too strong for me to wear. Smells like old women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> Oh...this is incredible!  I&#x27;m a guy and it really is a unisex smell!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and she was not happy with the scent. She said it was very strong.</li>
            <li> This body oil is amazing!  I was hesitant in purchasing this item before actually being able to smell it but I ended up being very happy with it.  I wear this on almost a daily basis and have had so many compliments on it because it smells so good.  People have told me that (to them) its a very calming smell and also a very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, but not too light either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this body oil again!</li>
            <li> arrived on time, smells awesome and not much is needed. Will purchase again/ Thank you</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments when I wear frankincense and myrrh its rich&lt;br /&gt;and spicy fragrance, Fellas it will may the ladies smile...</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with my Zum cleaner that was in the same scent...  LOVE to add this to some unscented dryer sheets... makes my clothes smell even more like Frankincense &amp; Myrrh!!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping I would love this, but it is way too strong.  No one can stand to be near me when I wear it.  Going to try to return.</li>
            <li> If you want something that is chemical free with a clean smell this is it.  I have used this for over 10 years and LOVE IT.  NO skin irritation.  Smells nice and worth the buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I totally LOVE this so much!!!! :) I Love the fragrance, it&#x27;s Amazing!!! Some of the best smelling fragrance I&#x27;ve EVER smelled!:) It sort of reminds me of the perfume Opium. The scent stays on too, it doesn&#x27;t fade after an hour or two, it stays all day, it stays fresh, I am very impressed and excited!!:) I will buy this again for sure!!!:)</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a &amp;#34;frankincense &amp; myrrh&amp;#34; type fragrance for years and was tickled to death to find this Zum product.  It looks like it&#x27;s going to last a good long time, tool, as it doesn&#x27;t take much to reach saturation point with the fragrance.  A quick roll on the wrist and done. You will need to reapply if your day is longer than 10 hours, but I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay for that perfect signature scent.</li>
            <li> This smells as good as the other products in the Zum line, the scents are exceptional and last.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - so does everyone who smells it. Problem is that it is very strong when you first put it on (no discreet application - even though it is a roll on) but it totally fades very quickly. Not even a faint bit leftover unless you get some on your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a little more essential oil next time? dont think I&#x27;d buy again. But it does smell awesome...</li>
            <li> This is a VERY sweet  smell and not the earthly, musky scent that I was expecting.  I bought it to use as a body perfume but may end up using it in soaps in smaller quantities.  If it smells okay in soaps, I may consider reordering when this is used up, but otherwise, I don&#x27;t intend to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Probably won&#x27;t buy again though.</li>
            <li> These items worked as advertised, I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Eau de Zum&#x27;s Frankincense and Myrrh roll on perfume via Quality Goods LLC. It shipped incredibly quickly in safe packaging, and arrived in perfect condition. I knew what to expect and I am in no ways ever disappointed by Zum&#x27;s products. Who could fault products made with essential oils as the base? Frankincense and Myrrh are time honored resins/oils from antiquity used even by the Egyptians in anti-aging facials. Frankincense was used for centuries as incense in a variety of sacred settings. Both were gifted to baby Jesus, both were worth a year&#x27;s wages in their time of glory, and both still produce a fragrance fit for royalty. All Zum has done is place those oils together with a lovely carrier oil (Jojoba, also known for it&#x27;s incredible beneficial properties for human skin), a touch of phtalate free fragrance oil, and put them in a convenient roller bottle. I&#x27;ll definitely be wearing this as my signature scent for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bought a bottle of Eau de Zum a few years back at Whole Foods and put it up.&lt;br /&gt;Recently found it among my large collection of oils and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a wonderful scent.  At the time, I was not into earth scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I developed a serious illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my suprised the Zum alleviated a lot of the emotional/mental side effects of chemotherapy and puts me into a state of calm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old bottle is full but I ordered another bottle as backup/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also ordered the Frankincense/Myrhh and mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are all wonderful products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Zum Frankincense/Myrhh to any who needs a lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable to dept store fragrances and is very long lasting yet not cloying.</li>
            <li> just something I wanted to try and since I like Stetson I would say it&#x27;s less perfumey smelling than that so I would say suitable for men to use.</li>
            <li> Although everyone wears scents differently - this one smelled bad even in the bottle.  NO MORE on line perfume purchases for me  - buying scent unknown is a bad idea, isn&#x27;t it?!  I like frankincense scent a lot - but there seem to be different varieties - one smells bad and one heavenly.  This perfume uses the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; frankincense.  Less familiar with Myrrh - thought I&#x27;d take a chance - well.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with my purchase. . .and it sure smells awful.</li>
            <li> A little strong but,I like it.Nice to have roll on.Hard to put into words the scent.but i do like it</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I have ever worn that consistently gets complimented everywhere I go. &lt;br /&gt;In fact, that&#x27;s how I discovered it: on someone else. I had to know what it was and get some myself. &lt;br /&gt;The frangrance is exotic, spicy, light and very long lasting. &lt;br /&gt;And just a touch like wearing Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have not used any of this the smell is too much, I have tried applying with a cotton ball but still I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> EAU de ZUM roll on perfume ~~ just received it and have tried it.  All the reviews were positive...guess you have to get used to the scent.  It DOES smell better after being on a while. Smells clean...... It&#x27;s Frankincense and Myrrh.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, and I receive compliments on it all the time. :-) It&#x27;s priced really well, too.</li>
            <li> Some Good Oil and fragrance u can even use it for your underarms a fragrance that will last all day it has roll on so you don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-toxic perfume replacement that was not $100 like my Dior or other expensive perfumes which I no longer use.  Commercial perfumes have about 150 very TOXIC chemicals in them which I am working to avoid.  This product smells amazing, earthy, musky yet feminine.  It is hard to explain but great product.  My only issue is it does not last very long so if you have a larger purse you can take this roll-on with you.  It is not the tiny roll-on&#x27;s that are the size of a lip stick, it is more the size of that glue which comes in a tube and you can roll on to paper.  Excellent price, great value and non-toxic!</li>
            <li> Love this one...it&#x27;s a cross between Coty&#x27;s Emeraude and Chantilly perfumes, but natural! Will order again!</li>
            <li> Have received lots of compliments on the fragrance.  Very subtle and sweet with a tinge of woodsy.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Will stain your clothes, VERY strong, good to put on your pillows (if dark colored) b/c of staining.  But smell lasts!!</li>
            <li> A lovely natural fragrance, warm and woodsy-- rather head-shoppish, but in the best possible way. If the Zum Mist in this scent is too strong for you, the oil-based perfume is perfect. Goes on strong but dies down to a close-to-skin aura in about 10 minutes. I find I need to reapply after 3-4 hours, but the bottle has a huge amount (1.3 ounces) so no worries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get TONS of compliments on this. Way more than with my costly designer fragrances!</li>
            <li> Yes I bought this for myself but tried it on my husband and it smelled great on him.  The very first time I wore it I received complements, and have continued to get them.</li>
            <li> I LIKE INDIGO WILD PRODUCTS VERY GOOD PRODUCTS...I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM HIGHLY....THEY ARE MADE OF PURE INGREDIENTS NO CHEMICALS..GREAT STUFF</li>
            <li> Love the scent (a little goes a loooooooooong way, but I must have an allergy to something in this....my eyes are itchy and watery and my nose gets runny.  Will be giving this away</li>
            <li> Love love!  Use as deodorant, perfume, and all over freshener.  Smells wonderful!</li>
