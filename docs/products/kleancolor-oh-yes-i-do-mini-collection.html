            <li>This is very cheap nail polish and so, so smelly.</li>
            <li>:-))</li>
            <li>like most glitters</li>
            <li>The picture does it no justice, in person the polishes are absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li>Omg.. this nail Polish is so cute..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Again, the colors are lovely, but the  finished nails didn&#x27;t wear well.</li>
            <li>I definetly reccomened it!! :)</li>
            <li>Love when that happens.</li>
            <li>The colors are cute but only stay on my nails for one day even with a good top and bottom coat!!</li>
            <li>We have one happy 13 yr old!</li>
            <li>The colors are absolutely gorgeous and the nail polish works really well</li>
            <li>but unfortunately very quickly chopped off.</li>
            <li>and I got it very quickly.</li>
            <li>They were super clumpy and the brushes on most of them were frayed, would NOT buy again..</li>
            <li>Super cute colors.</li>
            <li>Used the product immediately and it seems to be good so far!</li>
            <li>The product goes on smooth and dries well.</li>
            <li>Christmas gift for my Daughter in law - she is recently in to the girly stuff - this should be a great gift</li>
            <li>They are a bit light and reminded me a lot of bridal shades.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nail polish set and found these all the colors contain glitters and are in light tone</li>
            <li>These colors are awesomely unique, they remind me of barbie doll and princess colors.</li>
            <li>This would be cute for a child, but the polish isn&#x27;t that great (runny and requires a few coats to cover then nail).</li>
            <li>The shipping was great but the product was not very well taken care of before hand.</li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t show true</li>
            <li>I love the colors and it wears very well.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The quality was decent and the girls enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li>it chips to quick</li>
            <li>Small bottles but a perfect small gift with great colors.</li>
            <li>Colors are very pretty - looks just like the photo.</li>
            <li>Although very pretty when first applied, does not wear well at all!  </li>
            <li>Not meant to use on french manicure, glamorous on their own.</li>
            <li>very nice little but still worth it</li>
            <li>I got these as a favor for a bridal shower, and since the labels of the color names (several are cute, like Mr. Right) are on the bottoms of the bottles, they&#x27;re very thematically appropriate.</li>
            <li>Right-</li>
            <li>Great small favors for a shower</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t receive the exact colors from the photo.</li>
            <li>The nail polishes are really cute and simple.</li>
            <li>Might buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Came as expected, girlfriend liked them</li>
            <li>But still pretty.</li>
            <li>The colors were really pretty in person.</li>
            <li>and she loved this little baby polishes!</li>
            <li>Shockingly good for such cheap little bottles!</li>
            <li>These are so cute and dry fast</li>
            <li>actually i expected better stuff.</li>
            <li>a happy person my bottle didn&#x27;t come broken or leak  </li>
            <li>I think they are really pretty.im not a bride,but I lke bling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>Really like these polishes.</li>
            <li>Takes a few coats to get it on nicely.</li>
            <li>Just right when you want something a little more on the demure side.</li>
            <li>The white you do have to put on a few coats for it to show completely, but the glitter polishes are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>does not dry up as quickly before using all</li>
            <li>But the polish was smooth and dried quick.</li>
            <li>The colors are super cute- and as mentioned, the size is very small.</li>
            <li>The bottles are very small but they are so cute, love the colors if you want to get a french style.</li>
            <li>Decent sized bottles in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Chipped after 4 days which is normal for me regardless of the brand.</li>
            <li>Love the color scheme, and they last for a long time.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;ty enough to wear one of a kind of the lime green color</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t re commend these because most of my polishes were already dried out and the sparkles were so clumpy and old</li>
            <li>so i purchased this for my 4 yr old niece.</li>
            <li>I bought this set for my 10 year old granddaughter for Christmas...</li>
            <li>Bought these for my step daughter for Christmas, she really likes them especially the glittery and shimmery ones..</li>
            <li>This small sampler of nail polish chips easily.  </li>
            <li>Got these for my 6 year old last summer she loves them such soft innocent colors for little girls!</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;d buy the regular bottle sets for just a few more dollar.</li>
            <li>It dried EXTREMELY fast--much faster than most of the drugstore professional brands.</li>
            <li>Great when you want something a little on the subtle side!  </li>
            <li>it really makes me upset because I bought 2 boxes at the sam  time and really was not expecting such a disappointment because I&#x27;v bought three other box sets of KleanColor and loved them.</li>
            <li>the other glitter has big silver dots in it and it just does not apply right.</li>
            <li>I later actually used the leftovers to paint my nails--the formula is a little thin, but not bad, and I actually like it well enough that I&#x27;m keeping them for my own use.</li>
            <li>and they are small but well worth it</li>
            <li>I know I didn&#x27;t pay that much and the bottles are little</li>
            <li>Some bottles came less than half full.</li>

            <li> and they are small but well worth it</li>
            <li> I know I didn&#x27;t pay that much and the bottles are little</li>
            <li> Some bottles came less than half full.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s different sizes of glitter, small, medium, large &amp;</li>
            <li> some glitter what I received was one with only one pink and its really clear pink ,is that way to clear that unless I put a lot of coats of it on or mixed it with another shade of pink</li>
            <li> These are tiny bottles of nail polish with about half of them being clear glitter coats.  </li>
            <li> i like these colors so much while nail polish container is small in size.</li>
            <li> I really do like the colors but the bottles are really small, smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Also the colors are so similar to each other they are almost the same!!</li>
            <li> I bought this box up because to me it looks like there&#x27;s two shades of pink a white and</li>
            <li> Even so, only half of the bottles were usable for this purpose since half were clear with glitter and no color once applied.  </li>
            <li> I love pairing them and the only bad thing I have to say is</li>
            <li> it takes like 5 or 10 minutes to dry</li>
            <li> Very thick need but pretty colors</li>
            <li> The picture shown shows two bottles of pink two shades of  white one shiney with light glitter and two bottles of glitter that also were a disappointment</li>
            <li> Amazon returned the bad 6-pack, and I was mostly okay</li>
            <li> Smaller then I expected but the bigger issue was that a few of them were dried up and not useable when they arrived.</li>
            <li> and i think a gold, silver and dif shades of pink.</li>
            <li> Some were dried solid on the inside.</li>
            <li> also the other box set I bought were the shades of green out of 6 bottles only two of them were pr</li>
            <li> On the smaller size but not too small.  </li>
            <li> the other was the glitter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy this brand again if so not two different sets</li>
            <li> 3D nail art and other rhinestones would go well with.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have left such a bad review  because there weren&#x27;t that expensive the shipping and handling was almost more than the two box sets</li>
            <li> Very sheer delicate colors.</li>
            <li> The polish remained on nails an average length of time.</li>
            <li> The bottles are so tiny they are difficult to open.</li>
            <li> And they are mini, but you can get quite a few uses out of them.</li>
            <li> my glitter ones were dried up when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> These were half gone and crusty!</li>

            <li> They were super clumpy and the brushes on most of them were frayed, would NOT buy again..</li>
            <li> Very sheer delicate colors. Dries quickly. Chipped after 4 days which is normal for me regardless of the brand. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very thick need but pretty colors</li>
            <li> Super cute colors. We perfect for my friends Bridal shower giveaway.</li>
            <li> The bottles are very small but they are so cute, love the colors if you want to get a french style. Very fast shipping i got it in 3 days. And also a good price :-))</li>
            <li> these are the perfect mini size, pretty colors. sugar coat and bridal shower like most glitters the chunky glitter was difficult to get off and on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Right- the tiny glitter went on with lots of glitter.</li>
            <li> This is very cheap nail polish and so, so smelly. I bought it to make &#x27;makeup&#x27; in used up makeup containers for my daughter and it worked well for that, but I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my nails!</li>
            <li> Decent sized bottles in my opinion. On the smaller size but not too small.  The product goes on smooth and dries well. The glitter polishes are beautiful and add a nice touch to any color.</li>
            <li> This small sampler of nail polish chips easily.  The bottles are so tiny they are difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Perfect for shower gift bag!</li>
            <li> Color chipped after 12 hours of wear and I was only typing on a touch pad.  The colors; very nice feminine with just the right sparkle.</li>
            <li> These were half gone and crusty! I&#x27;m not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> Smaller then I expected but the bigger issue was that a few of them were dried up and not useable when they arrived.</li>
            <li> The color went on extremely perfect. The white you do have to put on a few coats for it to show completely, but the glitter polishes are gorgeous! The picture does it no justice, in person the polishes are absolutely stunning. It dried EXTREMELY fast--much faster than most of the drugstore professional brands.</li>
            <li> the nail polish bottles are small so i purchased this for my 4 yr old niece. the colors are so nice. i didn&#x27;t receive the exact colors from the photo. i received a white and i think a gold, silver and dif shades of pink. but i was happy regardless</li>
            <li> Omg.. this nail Polish is so cute.. I love it. Wish I would have got bigger bottles. This nail Polish is awesome !!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter she loves the colors. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> See pastel summer collection.</li>
            <li> Great when you want something a little on the subtle side!  Just right when you want something a little more on the demure side.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my 10 year old granddaughter for Christmas...she uses it all the time and likes colors</li>
            <li> We have one happy 13 yr old!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like them. but they don&#x27;t smell. actually i expected better stuff. never buy it again. Only will buy loreal.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my step daughter for Christmas, she really likes them especially the glittery and shimmery ones.. would purchase again</li>
            <li> The colors are cute but only stay on my nails for one day even with a good top and bottom coat!! Also the colors are so similar to each other they are almost the same!!</li>
            <li> Although very pretty when first applied, does not wear well at all!  Again, the colors are lovely, but the  finished nails didn&#x27;t wear well.</li>
            <li> I bought this box up because to me it looks like there&#x27;s two shades of pink a white and some glitter what I received was one with only one pink and its really clear pink ,is that way to clear that unless I put a lot of coats of it on or mixed it with another shade of pink there&#x27;s no sense in me the same with the white. The picture shown shows two bottles of pink two shades of  white one shiney with light glitter and two bottles of glitter that also were a disappointment I know I didn&#x27;t pay that much and the bottles are little but I swear I&#x27;ve only used one of the glitters maybe 3 or 4 times and it&#x27;s halfway gone. the other glitter has big silver dots in it and it just does not apply right. it really makes me upset because I bought 2 boxes at the sam  time and really was not expecting such a disappointment because I&#x27;v bought three other box sets of KleanColor and loved them. I don&#x27;t know if it was because I was using my cell phone and the colors just didn&#x27;t show true but I did read the descriptions. I wouldn&#x27;t have left such a bad review  because there weren&#x27;t that expensive the shipping and handling was almost more than the two box sets also the other box set I bought were the shades of green out of 6 bottles only two of them were pr&lt;br /&gt;ty enough to wear one of a kind of the lime green color the other was the glitter the others were such anr ugly shade of green one might be ok.for St Patricks Day. I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy this brand again if so not two different sets</li>
            <li> Too thick a glittery for my taste.  Was hard to evenly apply to your nails.  However, it was inexpensive so I guess you get what you paid for!</li>
            <li> The colors are super cute- and as mentioned, the size is very small. They are maybe around 3/4 of the size of a big nail polish bottle- but the colors are very cute. Takes a few coats to get it on nicely.</li>
            <li> I love these mini polish and I real love them im a happy person my bottle didn&#x27;t come broken or leak  I am a happy customer I will order from them again</li>
            <li> Made a great gift for a friend!</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my Daughter in law - she is recently in to the girly stuff - this should be a great gift</li>
            <li> Ver bridal colors. I think they are really pretty.im not a bride,but I lke bling</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. but unfortunately very quickly chopped off. It is not resistant lacquer.</li>
            <li> I got my package in seven days. The package came good with no damages. The nail polishes are really cute and simple. I definetly reccomened it!! :)</li>
            <li> As advertised.  I recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> I love these things they&#x27;re really awesome. Might buy more in the future. And now I will ramble for enough words.</li>
            <li> I love the colors! And they are mini, but you can get quite a few uses out of them. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t re commend these because most of my polishes were already dried out and the sparkles were so clumpy and old looking .. Very disappointed because they would have been cute if they were fresh :(</li>
            <li> These are so cute and dry fast</li>
            <li> aweful and clumpy, takes forever to get off even with nail polish remover</li>
            <li> The are great value and are beautiful, this one particular set I bought it for a group of girls I teach in the afternoons, and ended up using it myself!!! love it!!</li>
            <li> Love the color scheme, and they last for a long time. The only thing is that one of the nail polishes came too thick and sticky, like when it has gone bad. So i was kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> Even though the nail polish is cute and has great color my glitter ones were dried up when I opened the package. When I tried to open one the wand brissles stuck in the polish and came out of the wand. :( I&#x27;m very dissappointed. The shipping was great but the product was not very well taken care of before hand.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but small size</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone works great I love pairing them and the only bad thing I have to say is it takes like 5 or 10 minutes to dry and they are small but well worth it</li>
            <li> These colors are awesomely unique, they remind me of barbie doll and princess colors. When I used them, it seemed like a fairy tale brilliance. Not meant to use on french manicure, glamorous on their own. 3D nail art and other rhinestones would go well with. If you insist to use them as a french, Try to water marble the coat so to soften it.</li>
            <li> Small bottles but a perfect small gift with great colors.</li>
            <li> Came as expected, girlfriend liked them</li>
            <li> Shockingly good for such cheap little bottles! I got these as a favor for a bridal shower, and since the labels of the color names (several are cute, like Mr. Right) are on the bottoms of the bottles, they&#x27;re very thematically appropriate. Tied a mini emery board to each one with ribbon and they were perfect. I later actually used the leftovers to paint my nails--the formula is a little thin, but not bad, and I actually like it well enough that I&#x27;m keeping them for my own use.</li>
            <li> These are tiny bottles of nail polish with about half of them being clear glitter coats.  I purchased 2 sets to use at a birthday party for my daughter so that each girl would have her own.  Even so, only half of the bottles were usable for this purpose since half were clear with glitter and no color once applied.  The quality was decent and the girls enjoyed them.  The polish remained on nails an average length of time.</li>
            <li> Chips off with in a day.</li>
            <li> Pretty but almost impossible to remove.  I use nail polish remover, a LOT of it, then have to sand it off.</li>
            <li> Much smaller in person. But still pretty.</li>
            <li> I liked the product. The item was shipped on time and I got it very quickly. Love when that happens. Used the product immediately and it seems to be good so far!</li>
            <li> These colors are really nice. They are a bit light and reminded me a lot of bridal shades. But the polish was smooth and dried quick. I would buy another mini collection for sure!</li>
            <li> i sent this to a friend in australia for christmas.. she&#x27;s a nail polish enthuisiast and she loved this little baby polishes!</li>
            <li> Putting these colors on, you actually see the correct color on your nails. This is very good nail polish, we bought 3 sets and love them all. I do nails and would put this on a client happily!</li>
            <li> it chips to quick wont buy it  again</li>
            <li> This would be cute for a child, but the polish isn&#x27;t that great (runny and requires a few coats to cover then nail).</li>
            <li> I really do like the colors but the bottles are really small, smaller than what I expected. Next time I&#x27;d buy the regular bottle sets for just a few more dollar.</li>
            <li> Three of the colors were already dried out :(</li>
            <li> Bought 2, had to mix &amp; match to get one good one. Some bottles came less than half full. Some had polish on the outside. Some were dried solid on the inside. Amazon returned the bad 6-pack, and I was mostly okay with the 6 that were given as a Christmas gift. The colors were really pretty in person.</li>
            <li> Really like these polishes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nail polish set and found these all the colors contain glitters and are in light tone i like these colors so much while nail polish container is small in size.</li>
            <li> Great small favors for a shower</li>
            <li> The nail polish is great. I love the colors and it wears very well. I recommend  it and think its a good deal and value.</li>
            <li> like the smaller bottles. does not dry up as quickly before using all</li>
            <li> very nice little but still worth it</li>
            <li> Got these for my 6 year old last summer she loves them such soft innocent colors for little girls!</li>
            <li> Polish is not a good quality, very thick and tacky...never seems to dry.</li>
            <li> Colors are very pretty - looks just like the photo.</li>
            <li> The colors are absolutely gorgeous and the nail polish works really well</li>
            <li> Loved, loved loved this polish. The glitter nail polish is awesome. There&#x27;s different sizes of glitter, small, medium, large &amp; they are great!! I placed my order on 12/29/2012 &amp; recieved it 3days later. It was great!!</li>
