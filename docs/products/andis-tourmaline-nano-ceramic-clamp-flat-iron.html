            <li>Best Hairdryer I have purchase in my life.&lt;br /&gt;Found it once in a hotel and searched it on internet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>best dryer i&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>Want this forceful wind speed which does this job wonderfully.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for styling.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair frizzy</li>
            <li>Anyway, just wanted to say about the great wind speed it has and great motor description.</li>
            <li>It is quite and the the med heat is perfect for my fine 4A type hair.</li>
            <li>Just the Andis I was looking for and in a good price range.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy.  </li>
            <li>I know a good hairdryer when I use one.  </li>
            <li>I had heard so many great things about it... that it reduced frizz and saved drying time... didn&#x27;t do anything for the frizz...</li>
            <li>Bought 3/31/2015 elsewhere for $3 more !</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>Speaking of settings, heat and air power options are perfect and I love the cool air button.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the dryer is light and fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>End can easily pops off to brush screen filter, which worked great to brush off fine leaf dust particles after that use.</li>
            <li>Works good, nothing special, does the job</li>
            <li>Love the heat and settings, dislike the design with the buttons all on the handle where you are trying to hold.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I bought this model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is a value price blow dryer with all the latest blow drying technologies.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Awesome ... :)</li>
            <li>I have had conairs that do a better job.</li>
            <li>I love my andis hairdryer.</li>
            <li>works ok,</li>
            <li>the Andis 75370 is much better</li>
            <li>Nothing magical about this dryer.</li>
            <li>I loved this so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and to control the settings with one hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and still going strong after all this time.</li>
            <li>If you switch it to high, it is equivalent to medium on a good dryer.</li>
            <li>Everything is fine.  </li>
            <li>Really light and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>A moms best friend, it even smoothes my wavy mess of a hairdo.</li>
            <li>Most dryers are to powerful.</li>
            <li>They are reversed, like turning on a light in your house by flipping the switch down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fabulous blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Straightens quickly and leaves hair shiny.</li>
            <li>It drys my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li>Blow dryer cracked during the first month, and combs will not stay put!</li>
            <li>It is OK for me (with short fine hair) but with her medium-length heavier hair it is a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dryer is lightweight but powerful.</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel and is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>anytime is nice if you feel your head is getting too hot, suddenly !</li>
            <li>For those who are looking for a good price on the ceramic tourmaline type dryer without the 200$ plus expense of the higher end, I have bought my third one, the first a gift for my mom, the second for my sister for she loved it for her long hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is lightweight, has a sleek look, the cord is plenty long, the vent is removable and easy to clean, it is shipped quickly and I am 46, so as I get more gray, I get my hair colored lighter blonde now.  </li>
            <li>I certainly recommend this product and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I will infrequently use for hair drying though, as hair rather short-does do fine job though, and short burst button for cool air</li>
            <li>It sounds like the motor and fan have plastic bearings that quickly get loose and make more noise as time goes on.</li>
            <li>I used it yesterday for the first time and the attachment keeps coming off.</li>
            <li>Motor description appears great for long lasting use.</li>
            <li>I have had a flat top since 1990.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and use it all winter long</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this $40 dryer to last forever, nor did I expect it to be as powerful as salon-quality dyers; but I did expect it to last longer than six months and to be more powerful than it was.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I notice any less &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; - but, still a good product so far!  </li>
            <li>The comb attachment easily and constantly pops off which defeats the purpose of my purchase.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my hair in a smooth manor.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t give reviews, but this dryer is exceptional.</li>
            <li>We really like it.</li>
            <li>Not As much power as expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DRIES THE AIR FAST WITHOUT LEAVING IT FRIZZY AND STATIC-CLINGY.</li>
            <li>dryer has gotten very noisy.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair.</li>
            <li>NOT VERY LOUD AND IS RATHER LIGHT WEIGHT.</li>
            <li>Dries long hair in no time, and leaves it smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend I purchased this andis hairdryer at amazon.</li>
            <li>If everything is fine, not much one can say.</li>
            <li>and it really finishes the drying softly without an oily look.</li>
            <li>I am not sure which of the many features is responsible for the result that this dryer produces, but I know it works.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side but not heavy to where you aren&#x27;t able to do hair.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer gets really hot and has a low speed.</li>
            <li>Blow dried my hair very  quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a professional blow dryer</li>
            <li>Even before the dryer began to spark, it was not as powerful as other Andis dryers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly with less flyaways.  </li>
            <li>I did not use any wind diffuser for additional wind force - just regular end worked fine for my little leaf blow job.</li>
            <li>When the barber first cuts it, it looks great but a few days later it is difficult to replicate at home.  </li>
            <li>Max positions produce plenty heat and wind speed, although less setting might be better for other hair control options.</li>
            <li>The comb attachment is a major bonus.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair, so finding a blow dryer that doesn&#x27;t blow my hair all over the place hard.</li>
            <li>Love it, and seems to fluff up my small amount of hair.</li>
            <li>It actually reminds me of a professional one.</li>
            <li>it may dry hair a little faster... extremely light weight.</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable compared to other dryers with similar features.  </li>
            <li>I am male 70 yrs old, and have missed having a hair dryer around for multiple uses.</li>

            <li> I am male 70 yrs old, and have missed having a hair dryer around for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on those of us who get it salon colored, have long or short, and I used to need to dry my hair in stages from the length, but this literally takes as they say, 40% less time</li>
            <li> Same power as my old dryer, with less noise.  </li>
            <li> &quot; - it does not have enough heat to dry her hair.</li>
            <li> Just to add, i recently added jojoba Oil for hair and skin and use a bit before I dry</li>
            <li> and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> &gt; Not a professional dryer at  all</li>
            <li> the minus side, The dryer does not put out enough heat.</li>
            <li> I air dry myself.</li>
            <li> This dryer definitely cuts down on the time.</li>
            <li> It did what I needed, I just expected longer use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Sparks are flying out of the nozzle after one year.</li>
            <li> so no one goes to bed or leaves the house with wet hair.</li>
            <li> Specifically picked this one to blow leaves from small garden of several plants with mulch bedding below.</li>
            <li> I already has the pressing comb from this brand and it has yet to let me down.</li>
            <li> very weak, even on high setting.</li>
            <li> It cuts my hair drying time in half</li>
            <li> I bought this in May and the heat stopped working in less than a year.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and do not like spending a lot of time drying it.</li>
            <li> Dries well a little heavy</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is not secure at all .. Does not stay on if your blow drying curly hair</li>
            <li> I wasted my money .I</li>
            <li> Even dried out engine parts, when got stuck from damp weather &amp; car would not start.  </li>
            <li> no need to dry hair here in Florida before going outside, but used dryer often in Illinois bad weather.</li>
            <li> That itself is hard on one&#x27;s hair, so this dryer is helpful on the breakage of colored hair.</li>
            <li> One negative-</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment when I thought I would give this brand a chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  not happy  with it.</li>
            <li> Not a good blow dryer!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately all the perks that I bought it for with the ion, tourmaline etc... doesn&#x27;t stand a chance with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> i hate that the comb doesnt stay intact..</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Not a good blow dryer! The comb attachment falls off constantly. I would like a refund.</li>
            <li> Straightens quickly and leaves hair shiny. We really like it. One negative- the comb comes off if hair is not detangeled.</li>
            <li> Also a purchase after a hotel stay. Love the heat and settings, dislike the design with the buttons all on the handle where you are trying to hold. You can hear me cussing and fussing every morning as I keep hitting the button that turns it off!</li>
            <li> very weak, even on high setting.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;ve used Andis products over the years and I&#x27;m glad that I bought this model. It&#x27;s easy to hold and to control the settings with one hand. Speaking of settings, heat and air power options are perfect and I love the cool air button. It cuts my hair drying time in half and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay. Not As much power as expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Not a professional dryer at  all</li>
            <li> Works good, nothing special, does the job</li>
            <li> Still have it to this day and it works!</li>
            <li> The comb attachment easily and constantly pops off which defeats the purpose of my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just the Andis I was looking for and in a good price range.</li>
            <li> This is a value price blow dryer with all the latest blow drying technologies. My wife is in hair heaven - I air dry myself.</li>
            <li> I got this because the last blow dryer I had was the Connair mini and while blowing out my hair, it just stopped. I saw this and what immediately got me was that it is tourmaline. Another factor was the price and also the brand. I already has the pressing comb from this brand and it has yet to let me down. It is a professional blow dryer so it&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side but not heavy to where you aren&#x27;t able to do hair. Blow dried my hair very  quickly. I certainly recommend this product and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> After one year of use, I&#x27;m replacing this blow dryer. Should have stuck with what I know, but decided to try something different. It was like any regular blow dryer. It did what I needed, I just expected longer use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Sparks are flying out of the nozzle after one year.</li>
            <li> The dryer began to spark after only 6 months of use. Even before the dryer began to spark, it was not as powerful as other Andis dryers I&#x27;ve had. I didn&#x27;t expect this $40 dryer to last forever, nor did I expect it to be as powerful as salon-quality dyers; but I did expect it to last longer than six months and to be more powerful than it was. Skip this one!</li>
            <li> Dries long hair in no time, and leaves it smooth as silk. I love it, and use it all winter long so no one goes to bed or leaves the house with wet hair. A moms best friend, it even smoothes my wavy mess of a hairdo.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately all the perks that I bought it for with the ion, tourmaline etc... doesn&#x27;t stand a chance with this hair dryer.  Rather if make my have even frizzier and unmanagable, the drying time is longer !!!! Such a disappointment when I thought I would give this brand a chance.</li>
            <li> Everything is fine.  It was a good buy.  I would recommend it to my friends and family.  Why there is a requirement for a number of words?  If everything is fine, not much one can say.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is not secure at all .. Does not stay on if your blow drying curly hair</li>
            <li> DRIES THE AIR FAST WITHOUT LEAVING IT FRIZZY AND STATIC-CLINGY. NOT VERY LOUD AND IS RATHER LIGHT WEIGHT. I LIKE THE DIFFERENT SETTINGS FROM COOL-HOT. GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> I have had a flat top since 1990.  When the barber first cuts it, it looks great but a few days later it is difficult to replicate at home.  This hair dryer does the job perfectly.  I use the comb attachment and the lowest setting drying front to back.  I am not sure which of the many features is responsible for the result that this dryer produces, but I know it works.  The price is also very reasonable compared to other dryers with similar features.  This is the best dryer I have ever used.  I usually don&#x27;t give reviews, but this dryer is exceptional.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is awesome. It is quite and the the med heat is perfect for my fine 4A type hair. The comb attachment is a major bonus.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> very happy with this dryer</li>
            <li> Awesome hair dryer!  I had no idea different hair dryers can have different effects on your hair.</li>
            <li> Blow dryer cracked during the first month, and combs will not stay put!</li>
            <li> Great value! Received on time.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much I got one for both of my daughters.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works great! I have thick, long hair and do not like spending a lot of time drying it. This dryer definitely cuts down on the time. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> i hate that the comb doesnt stay intact.. It was purposeless</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer. It has a nice feel and is pretty quiet. I am very happy with Andis products.</li>
            <li> Best Hairdryer I have purchase in my life.&lt;br /&gt;Found it once in a hotel and searched it on internet.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome ... :)</li>
            <li> It blowed up as soon as I pluged it</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair, so finding a blow dryer that doesn&#x27;t blow my hair all over the place hard. Most dryers are to powerful. This blow dryer gets really hot and has a low speed. It&#x27;s great for styling.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the dryer is light and fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;On the minus side, The dryer does not put out enough heat. If you switch it to high, it is equivalent to medium on a good dryer. Another thing that is a pain is the switches; they are reversed from what the rest of the industry has. Intuitively one would think that switching up would increase the heat or air volume. Instead they are just the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my wife try it. She likes that it is lighter than her dryer but she says it is \\&quot;wussy\\&quot; - it does not have enough heat to dry her hair. It is OK for me (with short fine hair) but with her medium-length heavier hair it is a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/13 update&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has gotten very noisy. It sounds like the motor and fan have plastic bearings that quickly get loose and make more noise as time goes on. The switches for heat and fan are counter intuitive. They are reversed, like turning on a light in your house by flipping the switch down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair frizzy</li>
            <li> My hair dries quickly with less flyaways.  The dryer is lightweight but powerful.</li>
            <li> Dries well a little heavy</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this hairdryer.  It does not dry my hair in a smooth manor.  I have curly hair which I blow out every day.  I know a good hairdryer when I use one.  If you don&#x27;t have curly of frizzy hair, this dryer may work for you.  I would not purchase this dryer again.  I have had conairs that do a better job.</li>
            <li> I had heard so many great things about it... that it reduced frizz and saved drying time... didn&#x27;t do anything for the frizz...it may dry hair a little faster... extremely light weight.</li>
            <li> Fabulous blow dryer. It&#x27;s lightweight and still going strong after all this time.</li>
            <li> Same power as my old dryer, with less noise.  Can&#x27;t say I notice any less &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; - but, still a good product so far!  Will update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> For those who are looking for a good price on the ceramic tourmaline type dryer without the 200$ plus expense of the higher end, I have bought my third one, the first a gift for my mom, the second for my sister for she loved it for her long hair.  It is gentle on those of us who get it salon colored, have long or short, and I used to need to dry my hair in stages from the length, but this literally takes as they say, 40% less time and i don&#x27;t even need a brush, I just run my fingers through.&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight, has a sleek look, the cord is plenty long, the vent is removable and easy to clean, it is shipped quickly and I am 46, so as I get more gray, I get my hair colored lighter blonde now.  That itself is hard on one&#x27;s hair, so this dryer is helpful on the breakage of colored hair. Just to add, i recently added jojoba Oil for hair and skin and use a bit before I dry and it really finishes the drying softly without an oily look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  not happy  with it. I used it yesterday for the first time and the attachment keeps coming off.I wasted my money .I have to go and buy another dryer with an attachment</li>
            <li> best dryer i&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> I love my andis hairdryer. It drys my hair so quickly. It actually reminds me of a professional one. I would highly recommend I purchased this andis hairdryer at amazon. Com</li>
            <li> Bought 3/31/2015 elsewhere for $3 more ! I am male 70 yrs old, and have missed having a hair dryer around for multiple uses. Specifically picked this one to blow leaves from small garden of several plants with mulch bedding below. Want this forceful wind speed which does this job wonderfully. I will infrequently use for hair drying though, as hair rather short-does do fine job though, and short burst button for cool air anytime is nice if you feel your head is getting too hot, suddenly ! Max positions produce plenty heat and wind speed, although less setting might be better for other hair control options. Motor description appears great for long lasting use. End can easily pops off to brush screen filter, which worked great to brush off fine leaf dust particles after that use. Really light and easy to hold. I did not use any wind diffuser for additional wind force - just regular end worked fine for my little leaf blow job. After research online, this unit recommended often. Love it, and seems to fluff up my small amount of hair. no need to dry hair here in Florida before going outside, but used dryer often in Illinois bad weather. Even dried out engine parts, when got stuck from damp weather &amp; car would not start.  Anyway, just wanted to say about the great wind speed it has and great motor description. Try one !</li>
            <li> works ok, the Andis 75370 is much better</li>
            <li> Nothing magical about this dryer. It works. It&#x27;s quiet on the ears.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer!  It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this in May and the heat stopped working in less than a year.</li>
