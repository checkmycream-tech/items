            <li>The color came out beautifully!</li>
            <li>The best dye I have ever used &amp; I have had alternative colored hair since age 11 &amp; I am 32 now.</li>

            <li>Pravana is simply amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>my delight and surprise, it turned out Amazingly!</li>
            <li>When I showed off this colour online, a good friend of mine mentioned another bonus: THIS COLOUR GLOWS UNDER BLACKLIGHT.</li>
            <li>Good product and shipping</li>
            <li>(&amp; more colors!)</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>awesome color, very vibrant.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t trash on an amazing product if you don&#x27;t know how to apply it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own sometime though.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best dye iv ever used</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, service was great.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I must say it&#x27;s my favorite brand for unnatural hair colors.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this dye.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells better...</li>
            <li>and then I took more antihistamine and a ibuprofen pill with my mothers advisement.  </li>
            <li>was it out with a neutralizing shampoo and leave apple cider vinegar on hair for 20 minutes or more to get thecolor out  and listen to your body.</li>
            <li>The color went over okay, but the tone is off.</li>
            <li>I love love love this.</li>
            <li>best dye iv used in a long time.</li>
            <li>:) the UV glow is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no wimpy implication, you can see it for a good 50 feet in decent blacklight</li>
            <li>Best neon dye hands down</li>
            <li>but I used the chroma silk vivids in my hair and it took just fine.</li>
            <li>My package arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different brands over the years, and this is great.</li>
            <li>Blue/purple shampoo is great for this, or if you&#x27;re ratchet like me, just google DIY toner that involves white conditioner and neon food dye, easy-peasy.</li>
            <li>The best green hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Fantastic color, My hair doesn&#x27;t like color by any means</li>
            <li>its super vibrant and  lasts a good amount time.</li>
            <li>I am actually thinking of buying more soon!!</li>
            <li>vivid, great price, easy packaging, salon quality, true to color, and pravana has so many different shades</li>
            <li>Totally worth the buy, overall quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Pure  magic.</li>
            <li>If you happen to get it on anything like your skin,floor,or sink, just put toothpaste on it and it will wash right off!</li>
            <li>mixed it with jerome russel turquoise for a BEAUTIFUL bright green</li>
            <li>Manic Panic fades too quick and stains literally everything all the time.</li>
            <li>It washed out quickly.</li>
            <li>This color is much more vibrant and bright than I even expected.</li>
            <li>I washed this dye out twice and then begin to feel tension in my head and neckle almost like tension but a certain dull tightness is best I can describe it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this color, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>ALWAYS leave fun color hair dye on a lot longer than instructions say if you want it as saturated as possible-left this on my head for an hour and a half&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>when it does start to fade it still looks pretty cool...........</li>
            <li>It came out about as brightly as the other users&#x27; pictures.</li>
            <li>I have this color on my hair right now</li>
            <li>Only downside is that the perfume inside it is extremely strong!</li>
            <li>color totally true to package sticker and could stop traffic with how vivid it comes out!</li>
            <li>only caution I would offer is to MAKE SURE you tone your hair before you dye.</li>
            <li>Try doing a quarter of a tube this mixed with conditioner then a turquoise on top after you&#x27;ve rinsed.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a great slow fading mint.</li>
            <li>and I was debating on bleaching the streaks first or not.</li>
            <li>Bright limey lemony green.</li>
            <li>So my hair is like a light ash blonde right now</li>
            <li>It is very vibrant and springtime.  </li>
            <li>Very vibrant.</li>
            <li>If done correctly this dye is really bright and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Real pravana dye.</li>
            <li>Bleaching gives that orangey/yellow hue which really effects the outcome because the dye is thinner than the darker colors and wont cover it up.</li>
            <li>like most do, it still fades to an extent but not much.</li>
            <li>I did a patch test and didnt really notice and then proceeded to put all over mu head.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely terrified to try such a bold colour on myself.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the dye itself reeked to high hell.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with with Pravana&#x27;s ChromaSilk Neon Green.</li>
            <li>That makes a very nice grass green, but nothing like the highlighter green this color comes out as.</li>
            <li>This color is insanely vivid.</li>
            <li>Lights up like nothing else under black light.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, but color faded after a few washes.</li>
            <li>This dye is super vibrant, last a long time and apparently glows under UV.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I am a 20 year old 4b-4c natural and this dye caused an allergic reaction immediately.  </li>
            <li>I took antihistamine allergy relief medicine which I havent took anytype of drugdtore medicine for two years because I take natural approach to my health before the antihistamine I even tried aloe</li>
            <li>Color stays true and stays pretty with very little fading!</li>
            <li>I have medium/little longer than shoulder length hair and didn&#x27;t use a full tube for half</li>
            <li>Also the only brand I&#x27;ve (easily) found in the USA that is neon green.</li>
            <li>and I mean everything..keep rubbing alcohol on hand for wiping dye off your counters/sinks/tubs, bled for an annoyingly long time when I washed my hair, wish there was more in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>I had a shorter pixie cut with the side of my head shaved and did this color all over with various shades of lightened blonde/orangey brunette (hair disaster long story) and this covered decently even.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair all the time and this had been the first green that has lasted.  </li>
            <li>Overall the color is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for since I was mixing their green with a yellow to get this color before.</li>

            <li> A little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Around twilight, standing out side when the sun is just about to go down, it nearly glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Manic Panic&#x27;s electric lizard mixed with a bit of their teal.</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist, these products do not work without reaching a pale yellow blonde + toner.</li>
            <li> Also if you use cheep shampoo like the ones you buy at walmart then you&#x27;re going to loose color way faster also washing your hair</li>
            <li> a lot will also cause you to loose color.</li>
            <li> Previously I had only used the Neon Orange on a client, and it was brighter than the sun</li>
            <li> Longest lasting neon green I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I liked how this green has a yellow base.</li>
            <li> I first washed my hair in cold water with the neutralizing shampoo but then opted to shower with warmer water and then used garnier fructis yellow bottle shampoo and cleanesd with nutribiotic ph balanced skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Lasts as well as other Pravana shades.</li>
            <li> Pravana Neon Green is the brightest green i could ever hope for and is lasting a lot longer than expected!</li>
            <li> I ended up mixing the neon green and regular green.</li>
            <li> I tried their non-neon green and it fades into a blue which is not the color I was trying to achieve (a dark forest green).</li>
            <li> I buy at least 4 boxes since my hair is medium thick and is down to my middle back.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> I also tried another dye by awatar funky fruit in green and causef this reaction and they both have HYDROLYZED KERATIN keratin mixef with other chemicals</li>
            <li> My hair turned out so neon green</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to do green chunks in my hair</li>
            <li> After a few hours I began to pray that the horriable aching and tension would go away and used some blessing oil and it helped.</li>
            <li> After I kept a towel wrapped on my head til it dried and twist my hair with no product in it</li>
            <li> I would call it a highlighter green.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lime green hair for about 7 months now.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a lot and usually stops within a couple washes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been too lazy..</li>
            <li> I usually buy Manic Panic dyes, but this one was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Brightest green ever!</li>
            <li> I think it was outdated, it faded quicker than when I&#x27;ve uses it previously.</li>
            <li> The pain was still kinda there hours later and at 2 am I was up because it hurt so bad and was continuous tight feeling in brain</li>
            <li> My advice is to always do a patch test at the back of your head and if it feels weird tingly feeling or you feel something is wrong</li>
            <li> This dye doesn&#x27;t fade to be an ugly shade of green</li>
            <li> But the product was CRAP.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Shipping was fast, service was great. But the product was CRAP. It did not take at all in my hair and I followed the directions verbatim. Maybe it was my hair but I used the chroma silk vivids in my hair and it took just fine.</li>
            <li> Awesome color. It is very vibrant and springtime.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Real pravana dye. Great. Works so well.</li>
            <li> This color is insanely vivid. Lights up like nothing else under black light. Around twilight, standing out side when the sun is just about to go down, it nearly glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Manic Panic&#x27;s electric lizard mixed with a bit of their teal. That makes a very nice grass green, but nothing like the highlighter green this color comes out as.</li>
            <li> Pravana is simply amazing! I used to use ion brilliance but this brand and color puts all others to shame. My hair turned out so neon green and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I liked how this green has a yellow base. I tried their non-neon green and it fades into a blue which is not the color I was trying to achieve (a dark forest green). I ended up mixing the neon green and regular green. Will try on it&#x27;s own sometime though. Lasts as well as other Pravana shades. I&#x27;ve used Pravana before and I must say it&#x27;s my favorite brand for unnatural hair colors. Manic Panic fades too quick and stains literally everything all the time. Initially you&#x27;ll have some color that bleeds using Pravana but it&#x27;s not a lot and usually stops within a couple washes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but color faded after a few washes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this dye. I&#x27;ve been told to try Pravana for awhile and finally found it here on Amazon (since it&#x27;s a professional/licensed only product). There&#x27;s about 3oz in the tube and it goes a LOOONG WAYYYY. I have medium/little longer than shoulder length hair and didn&#x27;t use a full tube for half my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different brands over the years, and this is great. Also the only brand I&#x27;ve (easily) found in the USA that is neon green. This dye is super vibrant, last a long time and apparently glows under UV.&lt;br /&gt;The only caution I would offer is to MAKE SURE you tone your hair before you dye. Bleaching gives that orangey/yellow hue which really effects the outcome because the dye is thinner than the darker colors and wont cover it up. Blue/purple shampoo is great for this, or if you&#x27;re ratchet like me, just google DIY toner that involves white conditioner and neon food dye, easy-peasy.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the buy, overall quite happy with this product. I had a shorter pixie cut with the side of my head shaved and did this color all over with various shades of lightened blonde/orangey brunette (hair disaster long story) and this covered decently even. color totally true to package sticker and could stop traffic with how vivid it comes out! I only wash my hair every week or so, and the color lasted. ALWAYS leave fun color hair dye on a lot longer than instructions say if you want it as saturated as possible-left this on my head for an hour and a half&lt;br /&gt;PROS: vivid, great price, easy packaging, salon quality, true to color, and pravana has so many different shades&lt;br /&gt;CONS: stains EVERYTHING. and I mean everything..keep rubbing alcohol on hand for wiping dye off your counters/sinks/tubs, bled for an annoyingly long time when I washed my hair, wish there was more in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;will buy again!</li>
            <li> mixed it with jerome russel turquoise for a BEAUTIFUL bright green</li>
            <li> Best neon dye hands down</li>
            <li> The color came out beautifully! A little really does go a long way. I let it soak in my hair for about four hours before rinsing it out. Very vibrant. Bleached my hair with 40 vol. beforehand.</li>
            <li> The best dye I have ever used &amp; I have had alternative colored hair since age 11 &amp; I am 32 now. Color stays true and stays pretty with very little fading!</li>
            <li> awesome color, very vibrant. I get compliments everywhere</li>
            <li> Wow. No words can describe this dye. Lasts forever and a little bit goes a long way. Try doing a quarter of a tube this mixed with conditioner then a turquoise on top after you&#x27;ve rinsed. You&#x27;ll get a great slow fading mint. Pure  magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied! My package arrived quickly! Pravana Neon Green is the brightest green i could ever hope for and is lasting a lot longer than expected! Great purchase! I am actually thinking of buying more soon!! (&amp; more colors!)</li>
            <li> This color is much more vibrant and bright than I even expected. Pravana is the only way to go for unnatural hair colors</li>
            <li> Finally got around to using this dye today. I&#x27;ve been wanting to do green chunks in my hair but I&#x27;ve been too lazy.. anyway. So my hair is like a light ash blonde right now and I was debating on bleaching the streaks first or not. I didn&#x27;t, just to try it, and see if it came out. It came out about as brightly as the other users&#x27; pictures. I&#x27;m quite happy I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair prior. I usually buy Manic Panic dyes, but this one was cheaper. Only downside is that the perfume inside it is extremely strong! I couldn&#x27;t wait to get the smell out of my head.</li>
            <li> It washed out quickly.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Longest lasting neon green I&#x27;ve had. Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery! Once again Pravana reigns supreme over all hair colors. Definitely recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> I think it was outdated, it faded quicker than when I&#x27;ve uses it previously.</li>
            <li> The best green hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used. Hands down. This dye doesn&#x27;t fade to be an ugly shade of green like most do, it still fades to an extent but not much. Also, it smells better...</li>
            <li> Brightest green ever!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with with Pravana&#x27;s ChromaSilk Neon Green. I was absolutely terrified to try such a bold colour on myself. Previously I had only used the Neon Orange on a client, and it was brighter than the sun afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my delight and surprise, it turned out Amazingly! When I showed off this colour online, a good friend of mine mentioned another bonus: THIS COLOUR GLOWS UNDER BLACKLIGHT. It&#x27;s no wimpy implication, you can see it for a good 50 feet in decent blacklight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> Please do a patch test on the back of your head before covering entire head with this dye. I am a 20 year old 4b-4c natural and this dye caused an allergic reaction immediately.  I did a patch test and didnt really notice and then proceeded to put all over mu head. BIG MISTAKE!! I washed this dye out twice and then begin to feel tension in my head and neckle almost like tension but a certain dull tightness is best I can describe it. After a few hours I began to pray that the horriable aching and tension would go away and used some blessing oil and it helped. The pain was still kinda there hours later and at 2 am I was up because it hurt so bad and was continuous tight feeling in brain it seemed like everytime I touchef my hair it was a ripple affect to my brain. I took antihistamine allergy relief medicine which I havent took anytype of drugdtore medicine for two years because I take natural approach to my health before the antihistamine I even tried aloe but it did not help. ANYWAY after antihistamine helped calmed the pain abit and I slept the next  morning it was hurting til later that night and then I took more antihistamine and a ibuprofen pill with my mothers advisement.  I woke up this morning and a lot of the tightness feeling had subsided but later in the day when I bent my head back I could feel tension so I asked my mother to buy me a neutralizing shampoo which helped a ton. I first washed my hair in cold water with the neutralizing shampoo but then opted to shower with warmer water and then used garnier fructis yellow bottle shampoo and cleanesd with nutribiotic ph balanced skin cleanser. After I kept a towel wrapped on my head til it dried and twist my hair with no product in it no leave in, creams, conditioners nothing! I say this to say now I am healed because of god. Please read ingrident s in these products people I believe the hydrolyzed kerating I want cause it: hydrolyzed meaning chemical breakdown with water I also tried another dye by awatar funky fruit in green and causef this reaction and they both have HYDROLYZED KERATIN keratin mixef with other chemicals cause formaldehyde gases to occur. My advice is to always do a patch test at the back of your head and if it feels weird tingly feeling or you feel something is wrong was it out with a neutralizing shampoo and leave apple cider vinegar on hair for 20 minutes or more to get thecolor out  and listen to your body.</li>
            <li> If done correctly this dye is really bright and last a long time. I would call it a highlighter green.</li>
            <li> I have this color on my hair right now and it is the brightest color I have ever seen! If you happen to get it on anything like your skin,floor,or sink, just put toothpaste on it and it will wash right off!</li>
            <li> The color went over okay, but the tone is off. Additionally, the dye itself reeked to high hell.</li>
            <li> love it! best dye iv used in a long time. would/will recommend it to everyone i know..... its super vibrant and  lasts a good amount time. when it does start to fade it still looks pretty cool........... this is by far the best dye iv ever used</li>
            <li> I love love love this. I&#x27;ve had lime green hair for about 7 months now. As a hairstylist, these products do not work without reaching a pale yellow blonde + toner. It lasts quite a while since it is semi-permanent. Overall the color is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for since I was mixing their green with a yellow to get this color before. I haven&#x27;t had it drip or get everywhere with application (which if you do, hairspray grabs stains off floors). I buy at least 4 boxes since my hair is medium thick and is down to my middle back. I can&#x27;t say enough about this color, it&#x27;s amazing. :) the UV glow is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> Fantastic color, My hair doesn&#x27;t like color by any means but this color will stay for over a month before it starts fading. If you&#x27;re someone that doesn&#x27;t know how to do color then you really need to read the directions, For this Neon Green to take you&#x27;ll have to have your hair lightened to a 9 but I recommend a 10. Also if you use cheep shampoo like the ones you buy at walmart then you&#x27;re going to loose color way faster also washing your hair a lot will also cause you to loose color. Don&#x27;t trash on an amazing product if you don&#x27;t know how to apply it. If you don&#x27;t know how to apply it then ask a stylist if they wouldn&#x27;t mind. Also use heat once applied.</li>
            <li> Good product and shipping</li>
            <li> Bright limey lemony green. It was paler than picture but hair was highest white. It washed out sooner than pravana violet.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair all the time and this had been the first green that has lasted.  It stayed in for about 2 mths And didn&#x27;t bleed.</li>
