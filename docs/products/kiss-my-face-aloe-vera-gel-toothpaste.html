            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure it&#x27;s the best thing out there for whitening, but I was just loking for something to get my teeth clean, so it works well for me :)</li>
            <li>It is a nice refreshing gel.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is fluoride-free, but it also tastes amazing</li>
            <li>This is the best  natural toothpaste - no fluoride and even has some organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>The bottle stands up nicely on my counter and the toothpaste comes out easily.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I love aloe and use it wherever I can because of its healing properties.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>

            <li>It tastes okay</li>
            <li>This is, without a doubt, my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to remember to get some more before it runs out.</li>
            <li>I love this product though I prefer the one with COQ10.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste that I have ever used, it has great taste, leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh, it contains many natural herbs that help to keep your mouth and gums healthy, and best of all NO fluoride to cause cancer and other diseases.</li>
            <li>It foams up nicely and my teeth feel clean when I am finished.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great natural toothpaste, don&#x27;t know about the whitening part.  </li>
            <li>It is a gel and has a great mix of natural products..such as aloe vera, tea tree oil, etc.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is amazing, not too minty, just right.</li>
            <li>This also does not have fluoride which is important to me.</li>
            <li>I like the taste of this product, and after using it my mouth feels great - unlike using commercial toothpastes.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>and I find myself brushing just because I just love the toothpaste so much!  </li>
            <li>It was not seven shades loghter, but it was significantly whiter than before my brushing.</li>
            <li>This leaves my teeth clean and mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste and knowing that it is made with natural ingredients and NOT laiden with toxic chemicals makes this toothpaste fantastic!  </li>
            <li>My mouth felt dentist clean after using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste so much.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soft and gentle on my gums, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste after brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has a pretty strong minty flavor.</li>
            <li>The mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>After using it for several months I am very pleased and will order it again.</li>
            <li>and we love the taste its all natural and safe for my kids ,and the price is so awsome every time i buy this toothpaste i buy 6 at a time to stock up on it ,and it lasts for a long time ,and the shipping was very fast ,i will be buying more ...</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone who wants a clean fresh mouth without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably my imagination, but it kinda feels like it leaves a coating of aloe on my teeth, not a bad feeling, just different from most toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Really pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;Usually natural products don&#x27;t get foamy enough and I was worried</li>
            <li>I really wanted a more natural option since I use it 2x per day.</li>
            <li>I like the toothpaste very much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting more concerned all the time out what is in the various products that I use.</li>
            <li>I realize we need to be aware of that as well as what is in the foods we eat.</li>
            <li>I have used many toothpastes and frequented different brands depending on what was on sale.</li>
            <li>Very Minty and fresh.</li>
            <li>We bought the 6 pack so that we wouldn&#x27;t run out ;)</li>
            <li>first I thought the gel texture a bit strange, but I like it much more than the grainy paste of dept store toothpastes</li>
            <li>it really does make them white and its NATURAL :) its a must have!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would certainly purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>They are certainly whiter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a vegan product with gentle ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Mainstream toothpaste tastes like chemicals, especially once you get used to this smooth, minty gel.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very competitive price.</li>
            <li>I have been trying different toothpaste without carrageenan and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>To be honest I can&#x27;t even tell the difference between this toothpaste and the traditional one.&lt;br /&gt;Other than this one has tons of pros as far as natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It not only leaves your teeth squeaky clean, but also your gums.  </li>
            <li>I have even used this paste with my 2 year old son as it is floride free, and it is gentle enough even for him.</li>
            <li>After trying many different natural toothpaste brands, my husband and I think this is the go-to ONE for natural toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li>I was surprised because I have a bridge in front, yet I swear it has whitened along with the &#x27;real&#x27; teeth there.</li>
            <li>I have tried to go green and healthy and organic where I can.</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth feeling fresh and white.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a whitening of my teeth after using this product for several weeks and also leaves you with fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely no mess, no struggling to get the toothpaste out and no chemicals!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste that I always stock up on, because this product is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really expect a toothpaste to make that big of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No build up in your mouth, no after taste and doesn&#x27;t disrupt the natural flora of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals or additives.</li>
            <li>I buy it not so much for the whitening aspect but for the ingredients left out (flouride, parabens, etc.).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone switching over from big brands to healthier brands.</li>
            <li>It keeps the mouth and breath fresh for hours, which other natural toothpastes often fall short on.  </li>
            <li>Makes me wonder about Kiss My Face products in general.</li>
            <li>Works just like conventional ones but is NATURAL!!</li>

            <li> Works just like conventional ones but is NATURAL!!</li>
            <li> I am using it a lot quicker than I anticipated, so the 6 pack may not last as long as I thought.</li>
            <li> The taste is something to get used to, but doesn&#x27;t take long to adapt.</li>
            <li> It reduces the price to about $1-$1.50 per unit less than the price in the store.</li>
            <li> Switched from Toms of Maine to this because kiss my face has less</li>
            <li> I never like to use any other toothpaste as others just pale in comparison.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of months (I had 6 packages of this to use), I switched back to my old brand of toothpaste and the bad breath issue was resolved.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that the whitening aspect is working</li>
            <li> I am guilty of banging it against the sink trying to open it.</li>
            <li> A lot of non-main stream tooth pastes taste -- how should I put this -- not very good.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Suspicious of packaging so tough and shiny.</li>
            <li> dont use harsh, chemical loaded, commerical toothpaste brands!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was a bit skeptical  </li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to squeeze out paste.</li>
            <li> Over time, I noticed that it did not freshen my breath for any length of time and in fact I started noticing a bad odor.</li>
            <li> Terrible packaging.</li>

            <li> After trying many different natural toothpaste brands, my husband and I think this is the go-to ONE for natural toothpaste brands. It feels very refreshing, cleans your teeth excellently, and is not a thick paste but a creamy gel. I highly recommend it as it&#x27;s definitely worth the money. Take care of your teeth! dont use harsh, chemical loaded, commerical toothpaste brands!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste that I have ever used, it has great taste, leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh, it contains many natural herbs that help to keep your mouth and gums healthy, and best of all NO fluoride to cause cancer and other diseases. I&#x27;ll never switch.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many toothpastes. I really wanted a more natural option since I use it 2x per day. I have tried to go green and healthy and organic where I can. This tastes great. It whitens. It is a nice refreshing gel. The bottle stands up nicely on my counter and the toothpaste comes out easily. There is absolutely no mess, no struggling to get the toothpaste out and no chemicals! I love aloe and use it wherever I can because of its healing properties. This also does not have fluoride which is important to me. I buy a case of these. Highly recommend to anyone switching over from big brands to healthier brands. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is fluoride-free, but it also tastes amazing and I find myself brushing just because I just love the toothpaste so much!  I subscribe to it and this is all my family uses.  Mainstream toothpaste tastes like chemicals, especially once you get used to this smooth, minty gel.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a toothpaste that didn&#x27;t have fluoride.  After searching around I thought I&#x27;d try Kiss My Face. Glad I did.  I have been a user for a couple years now and guess what? I didn&#x27;t get a bunch of cavities after ditching fluoride!  My dentist says my teeth are as healthy and good looking as they have ever been.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting more concerned all the time out what is in the various products that I use. I realize we need to be aware of that as well as what is in the foods we eat. I like this toothpaste and will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great natural toothpaste, don&#x27;t know about the whitening part.  But it&#x27;s natural. I would certainly purchase it again.  It&#x27;s better than those on the market.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste !! I&#x27;ve been buying this toothpaste for 2 yrs now for me and my kids and we all love it and we love the taste its all natural and safe for my kids ,and the price is so awsome every time i buy this toothpaste i buy 6 at a time to stock up on it ,and it lasts for a long time ,and the shipping was very fast ,i will be buying more ...</li>
            <li> I have used many toothpastes and frequented different brands depending on what was on sale. This is now my go to toothpaste. Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride and doesn&#x27;t have that pasty, chalky taste and texture. This leaves my teeth clean and mouth refreshed. I am not sure that the whitening aspect is working but I don&#x27;t really expect a toothpaste to make that big of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will  buy every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I signed up for subscribe and save on this one to help with the added cost. It reduces the price to about $1-$1.50 per unit less than the price in the store.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Good stuff. Fast shipping. Very competitive price. I like the toothpaste very much, it&#x27;s soft and gentle on my gums, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste after brushing. The mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I like the taste of this product, and after using it my mouth feels great - unlike using commercial toothpastes. I would certainly buy it again. I am using it a lot quicker than I anticipated, so the 6 pack may not last as long as I thought.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing, buy it immediately. However, what is up with the cap on it?!?! I&#x27;m all like, let me use this amazing toothpaste, and it&#x27;s all like, noooo. I am guilty of banging it against the sink trying to open it. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfy with this item. Good price for this package, will order more when my stock ends . Good buy.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and knowing that it is made with natural ingredients and NOT laiden with toxic chemicals makes this toothpaste fantastic!  I&#x27;ve given it to family members who are all now hooked as well.  Brightens your teeth and even eliminates coffee stains.  No build up in your mouth, no after taste and doesn&#x27;t disrupt the natural flora of your mouth.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I dont have to worry about any toxic ingredients in it. WOuld recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different toothpaste without carrageenan and so far this is my favorite. It does an excellent job whitening teeth and cleaning and I would definitely buy again. I feel that the price is fair for the bulk amount as well.</li>
            <li> i Love this .. it feels good on your teeth! it really does make them white and its NATURAL :) its a must have!</li>
            <li> A lot of non-main stream tooth pastes taste -- how should I put this -- not very good.  Of course if you want the befits of not having  poison in your toothpaste sometimes you have to make sacrifices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no sacrifices to be made with this toothpaste.  It has a nice minty flavor.  It foams up nicely and my teeth feel clean when I am finished.</li>
            <li> Terrible packaging. Extremely difficult to squeeze out paste. And, of what is it made? Suspicious of packaging so tough and shiny. Will never order again. Makes me wonder about Kiss My Face products in general.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Switched from Toms of Maine to this because kiss my face has less (none) of the chemicals that I am looking to get away from.  Leaves teeth feeling fresh and white.  I use this with a tea tree dental tape/floss, great combo and feeling of freshness!</li>
            <li> Tastes great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this from my local co-op. I immediately purchased this on Amazon. This is the best  natural toothpaste - no fluoride and even has some organic ingredients. It honestly whitened my teeth after one use. It was not seven shades loghter, but it was significantly whiter than before my brushing. The flavor is amazing, not too minty, just right. My mouth felt dentist clean after using this toothpaste. I absolutely love it, and will be using it permanently.</li>
            <li> Really pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;Usually natural products don&#x27;t get foamy enough and I was worried this toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t either - but it does.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a pretty strong minty flavor. To be honest I can&#x27;t even tell the difference between this toothpaste and the traditional one.&lt;br /&gt;Other than this one has tons of pros as far as natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet seen the whitening effect but I just started using it, so I think it will just take some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone. I don&#x27;t plan on switching back to a regular toothpaste anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a couple years. It tastes okay and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. It&#x27;s probably my imagination, but it kinda feels like it leaves a coating of aloe on my teeth, not a bad feeling, just different from most toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Kiss my Face Whitening is one of the best toothpastes I have ever used.  It is a gel and has a great mix of natural products..such as aloe vera, tea tree oil, etc.  It not only leaves your teeth squeaky clean, but also your gums.  I noticed a whitening of my teeth after using this product for several weeks and also leaves you with fresh breath.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product.  I recommend it to everyone who wants a clean fresh mouth without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> This was a great smelling gel toothpaste that I felt did whiten my teeth. Over time, I noticed that it did not freshen my breath for any length of time and in fact I started noticing a bad odor. I started rinsing regularly with mouthwash to offset this issue. After a couple of months (I had 6 packages of this to use), I switched back to my old brand of toothpaste and the bad breath issue was resolved.</li>
            <li> This is, without a doubt, my favorite toothpaste. LOVE IT!! Works just like conventional ones but is NATURAL!! Yippee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could purchase just one pack but having more on hand is always good too. You don&#x27;t have to remember to get some more before it runs out.</li>
            <li> Best Fluoride Free toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried! Very Minty and fresh. No harsh chemicals or additives. We bought the 6 pack so that we wouldn&#x27;t run out ;)</li>
            <li> Good product. Our standard daily toothpaste. I buy it not so much for the whitening aspect but for the ingredients left out (flouride, parabens, etc.).</li>
            <li> I started looking for a toothpaste without flouride in it, and decided to try this one. The taste is something to get used to, but doesn&#x27;t take long to adapt. I&#x27;m not too sure it&#x27;s the best thing out there for whitening, but I was just loking for something to get my teeth clean, so it works well for me :)</li>
            <li> Great tasting! I love this product though I prefer the one with COQ10. My family doesn&#x27;t use anything else. We all love it!</li>
            <li> I was surprised because I have a bridge in front, yet I swear it has whitened along with the &#x27;real&#x27; teeth there. They are certainly whiter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the gel texture a bit strange, but I like it much more than the grainy paste of dept store toothpastes and I admit it works well. My husband is hooked on it now, too.</li>
