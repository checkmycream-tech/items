            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I can use all of them but for the price, it was a good value.</li>
            <li>For the price, it was a good deal, though.</li>
            <li>Anyway good hair style kit.</li>

            <li>but I don&#x27;t know how to use most of the things in it and there is no instructions so this would be good for someone more educated on how to use all this stuff just not me</li>
            <li>The package that says \\&quot;flaxen hair\\&quot; is the equivalent of a Topsy Turvy and is great for making the popular chignon that&#x27;s in style right now.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Very cheap product</li>
            <li>I just wish they had better directions included and one that did not require a magnifying glass to read.  </li>
            <li>Would have been better if there were suggestions and instructions for hair styles for each product</li>
            <li>Ok for the price.</li>
            <li>Much more durable than anticipated.</li>
            <li>but I am still satisfied.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s more sturdy and doesn&#x27;t need pinning.&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>
            <li>8)</li>
            <li>I gave this 3 stars because they don&#x27;t give you instructions for many of the items in the package.</li>
            <li>Love the headband, and the bun maker.  </li>

            <li>Still trying to figure out what everything does, but daughter loved the whole set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like getting a treasure chest full of hair toys!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really easy to find videos on YouTube for everything else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the whole kit and am having a great time playing with new looks.</li>
            <li>Cheap cheap cheap from china.</li>
            <li>Lots of great hair accessories for a very low price.  </li>
            <li>Cheap quality.</li>
            <li>Seems cheap</li>
            <li>They were cheap.</li>
            <li>Lots of different products included at a great price.</li>
            <li>Cheap material, but it does the job</li>
            <li>I am going to order the original</li>
            <li>it is easy to figure out hairstyles, so I am giving it 5 stars, its so worth the money.</li>
            <li>These are not built to last and honestly I don&#x27;t know what most of the pieces are for</li>
            <li>but it has other items that are great</li>

            <li>This is so much fun..</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>Only issue was that I would have really liked two of the spirals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have lots of fun figuring it all out with Youtube, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well the box was fun</li>
            <li>I had fun playing around with these hair tools.  </li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>Exactly the items listed, all with cute packaging and clear instructions for use.</li>
            <li>Great little package of hair implements!</li>
            <li>got the whole thing for less than the cost of the hair bun thing by itself (which is super easy to figure out and is amazing)</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t understand how to or for for certain things are for!</li>
            <li>Very cheap packaging - no instructions in English,</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to spend very much in case</li>
            <li>Now if I could read Chinese :)</li>
            <li>I would check shipping time more closely next time.</li>
            <li>Directions in Chinese, but able to figure them out.  </li>
            <li>but there is so much variety of things to make your hair look pretty.</li>
            <li>I used the bun maker, topsy tail and French bun maker on my 7 year old daughter who has very fine hair</li>
            <li>u get so many stuff for less than 5$, shipping takes couple of weeks but worth the wait...</li>
            <li>Nice little set for the price.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about the quality, but all of it is well made, and it is a great start to anyone who wants to do basic hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Only the packaging is cheap</li>
            <li>Makes my morning much faster.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I use these regularly and despite looking cheap they&#x27;ve held up well.</li>
            <li>They came really fast.</li>
            <li>Meh i guess I expected a bit better</li>
            <li>Just right for a 10year old.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the only useful item in the packet was the donut bun maker.  </li>
            <li>then you grab a piece of hair from the left side of your head and slip it in the first notch on right.</li>
            <li>The main thing is that they worked.</li>
            <li>I lack even the most basic hair styling abilities but these are mostly very simple.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it was very inexpensive and my young daughter is a ballerina.  </li>
            <li>Yes, there are pictures for a few, but not tir most of them...</li>
            <li>my daughter loved this set but was confused on how some of the stuff worked</li>
            <li>The different items are not very sturdy; the quality left me wanting more, but again for the price, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I use these regularly and despite looking cheap they&#x27;ve held up well.</li>
            <li>Only complain is that the donut was already unraveling after the first use.</li>
            <li>They were excited to try the different hairstyles with the different hair tools that was in the package.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to spending some quality time with my 12 year old daughter trying and figuring this stuff out!</li>
            <li>You simply twist it in your hair and it really stays put.</li>
            <li>This really holds hair in place and lasted through my daily mile run.</li>
            <li>This really holds hair in place and lasted through my daily mile run.</li>
            <li>Normally, each individual thing would cost $5!</li>
            <li>After reading the content descriptions (which are a little confusing probably because their English terms aren&#x27;t precise or clear enough for me) and googling, we know how to start using most of the tools except the bands hooked together, headband tool (?)</li>
            <li>To use it you grab a small piece of hair from the right side of your head and slip it in the first notch on the left</li>
            <li>When removing, I&#x27;m left with soft curls, which is an added benefit.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by how simple they are to use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mainly for the topsy tail, the little one works perfectly fine but the big one gets caught in the hair because the point is not smooth.</li>
            <li>The plastic version of #6 does the exact same thing but can only be used for buns because the ends hook onto each other.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, not good quality at all, instructions are in chinese, not helpful.</li>

            <li> Wish there were 1. English instructions 2. Made yo not break after one use. Yes, there are pictures for a few, but not tir most of them...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great deal!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get a hair donut, small elastics, and topsy tail tools, but they were $5 for each one! I found this and it has literally EVERYTHING I want, for $5! Normally, each individual thing would cost $5! I was a little worried about the quality, but all of it is well made, and it is a great start to anyone who wants to do basic hairstyles. Each piece works just how it should, and each are amazing quality. Though the instructions are in chinese, you don&#x27;t need them, as you can just look up how to use the stuff on youtube. Thank you niceeshop!</li>
            <li> I think it was a pretty good deal</li>
            <li> The instructions are all in Japanese, impossible to tell how to use most of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is so much fun..u get so many stuff for less than 5$, shipping takes couple of weeks but worth the wait... i am loving experimenting so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All instructions are in chinese but if you google or see videos on youtube it is easy to figure out hairstyles, so I am giving it 5 stars, its so worth the money. Loving it.</li>
            <li> Fun little assortment and at a great price.  Still trying to figure out what everything does, but daughter loved the whole set.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if directions weren&#x27;t inChinese..don&#x27;t know how to use them</li>
            <li> This is excellent!!! Instructions in chinese but pictures illustrate what to do. Great bundle, awesome deal.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, not good quality at all, instructions are in chinese, not helpful.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive any pins as depicted in the image</li>
            <li> Very cheap packaging - no instructions in English, so I have no idea how to utilize some of these when doing my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, with an excellent sampling of styling tools (that work) to give the economically-sensible buyer plenty to experiment with. I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the whole kit and am having a great time playing with new looks. For anyone sick of getting hairstyle-frustrated and finally going with a ponytail, AGAIN, this is a guilt-free (read: low-cost) way to try some new, just-as-easy-as-ponytail-when-you&#x27;ve-got-right-tools looks!</li>
            <li> Lots of great hair accessories for a very low price.  I had this shipped to my daughter at college for a surprise and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Directions could be easier to use</li>
            <li> It took a while to get here but there is so much variety of things to make your hair look pretty.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was very inexpensive and my young daughter is a ballerina.  Pretty much the only useful item in the packet was the donut bun maker.  There were several items in the packet that we had no idea what to do with.  Since the package was in a foreign language we couldn&#x27;t read what they were fore.  Our cat however was amused with a few of the items.</li>
            <li> not sure how to even use have the items directions were microscopic and in Chinese</li>
            <li> Nice little set for the price. I don&#x27;t know how to use a few things though.</li>
            <li> Super Happy with my purchase. The only downside is there were no instructions for every single item and I only knew what a few of them were for.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing and exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Cheap quality. Some of the tools are very hard to use!</li>
            <li> Parts were missing beware of niceeshop...contacted them an they wanted pics an etc an act like you have the time to fix their mistake...the idems that did come I had to google how to use...it was not worth the time or money or even the minute it took to reveiw</li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t so bad considering the items that are included. I just wish they had better directions included and one that did not require a magnifying glass to read.  The instructions were also vague.</li>
            <li> Great deal!  Dozens of uses!</li>
            <li> a lot of things with no instructions</li>
            <li> Great set, got here before the delivery  date. Great stuff in the kit.</li>
            <li> Would have been better if there were suggestions and instructions for hair styles for each product</li>
            <li> These are not built to last and honestly I don&#x27;t know what most of the pieces are for but I wanted a topsy-turvy tool and a rat-tailed comb and it was cheaper to order this set.</li>
            <li> I received all of the products as pictured. I don&#x27;t know if I can use all of them but for the price, it was a good value. The different items are not very sturdy; the quality left me wanting more, but again for the price, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The instructions are not clear or non-existent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all of these things are for or how to use them cuz everything is in Chinese but I&#x27;m going to find out</li>
            <li> Ok for the price. Not the best quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly the items listed, all with cute packaging and clear instructions for use. Much more durable than anticipated. I have thick, long A2 type hair- all pieces function with it as expected. 10/10</li>
            <li> Very cheap product no support in doing different styles easily break and worst of all the instructions come in Chinese so I don&#x27;t understand how to or for for certain things are for! I am going to order the original</li>
            <li> Seems cheap but it does the job. Not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Incredible amount of stuff for the price.  Worth the wait.  Only issue was that I would have really liked two of the spirals.  One isn&#x27;t enough to hold up my bun (I have long hair).</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Took a while to get here but I am still satisfied. So many cool items that allow you to get creative with your look. They even work with my hair which is extremely thick and long (I&#x27;m apostolic)! Only complain is that the donut was already unraveling after the first use. Nothing a little fishing string can&#x27;t fix though. And the directions are in a foreign language but a few of them have an English translation and I think all of them had pictures with the instructions. Not too difficult to understand if you have some common sense.</li>
            <li> Has great little pieces.</li>
            <li> I like this product I can do whatever style in my hair and so helpful and makes me easier to do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> my daughter loved this set but was confused on how some of the stuff worked</li>
            <li> This set is awesome. I dont know what to do with some of the stuff, but you definitely get a bang for your buck</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Use them all the time. Not cheap at all. Only the packaging is cheap but I don&#x27;t care about that. Would totally recommend. Makes my morning much faster.</li>
            <li> Got it all packaged nice. Now if I could read Chinese :)</li>
            <li> Great quality, now I just have to learn how to use it all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a treasure chest full of hair toys!  Only, you know, in a bag.  All good quality, too - Most of it&#x27;s flexible plastic.  The round hair bun maker is soft plastic netting.  The long foamy looking thing is thin foam over flexible plastic.  The hair pins and the wavy headband looking thing are metal.  It even comes with a comb, a bunch of elastic hair ties, and a couple different kinds of bobby pins.  I&#x27;m not sure what half of it is since most of the packaging is in Chinese, but I&#x27;m not sure it matters - At least one of them had instructions in English with pictures and I still can&#x27;t figure out what it&#x27;s telling me to do.  I&#x27;m going to have lots of fun figuring it all out with Youtube, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the whole thing for less than the cost of the hair bun thing by itself (which is super easy to figure out and is amazing) so definitely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Instructions are in another language</li>
            <li> Just right for a 10year old. Took over a month to ship. I would check shipping time more closely next time.</li>
            <li> need at least one open-ended loop</li>
            <li> Great Product! I have 3 daughters that shared the hair tools. They were excited to try the different hairstyles with the different hair tools that was in the package. All of the different hair design tools worked and still lasting. Thanks for the package.</li>
            <li> I love the kit I just can&#x27;t read the instructions on how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;If I knew the names to each hair clip I could look it up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still waiting on the other bridal hair comb.&lt;br /&gt;Is there any way I can get the names of the hair piece&#x27;s?</li>
            <li> garbage, don&#x27;t waste your money, also It does not have instructions</li>
            <li> This is an assortment of odd looking hair tools/accessories and they don&#x27;t come with any instructions. After some Internet investigating I love it all! I&#x27;ll break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The rat-tail comb, hair ties, rubber bands, and bobby pins are self-explanatory but I should mention the little ball on the 2 rubber bands are simply a Japanese trend with no purpose.&lt;br /&gt;2) The hair donut is to make a perfect bun and is easy to use. It has a texture of a softer version of a plastic brillo sponge that helps grip the hair and the color matches black hair if you miss any spots.&lt;br /&gt;3) The package that says \\&quot;flaxen hair\\&quot; is the equivalent of a Topsy Turvy and is great for making the popular chignon that&#x27;s in style right now.&lt;br /&gt;4) There is a spin pin that works a million times better than bobby pins but there is only one. You simply twist it in your hair and it really stays put. To take it out you just untwist it out.&lt;br /&gt;5) There is a tiny tool that looks like a scribble made into metal and it&#x27;s supposed to be a braiding tool. To use it you grab a small piece of hair from the right side of your head and slip it in the first notch on the left then you grab a piece of hair from the left side of your head and slip it in the first notch on right. Continue slipping hair onto the third notch then fourth, etc. This takes some practice but the result is like a fishtail french braid. The tool stays in your hair and you can finish with a ponytail or braid.&lt;br /&gt;6) The long piece of foam with a slit in it can be used to make a bun or a french twist. To use place your hair in a ponytail (optional) and put it in the slit then twist once or twice to tighten, pull halfway out and roll it back towards your head. At this point you can just tuck the ends in and pin in place or wrap the ends together for a bun, tuck under and pin.&lt;br /&gt;7) The plastic version of #6 does the exact same thing but can only be used for buns because the ends hook onto each other. Since it&#x27;s plastic it&#x27;s more sturdy and doesn&#x27;t need pinning.&lt;br /&gt;8) The metal wavy headband is to keep hair back during sports or heavy activity. It gives your hair a textured look while still being sleek. This really holds hair in place and lasted through my daily mile run. It can even be used to keep hair in place under a flimsy cloth headband or scarf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I use these regularly and despite looking cheap they&#x27;ve held up well. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Hope this review is helpful.eed pinning.  8) The metal wavy headband is to keep hair back during sports or heavy activity.

            <li> Cheap cheap cheap from china. I threw it all away.</li>
            <li> Great little package of hair implements!</li>
            <li> The products are resistent but some of them I do know how to use them.</li>
            <li> got what i paid for.!</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for. They were cheap. The directions are in Chinese, but the pictures were universal LOL! The main thing is that they worked. You have to handle these with care or they are minimal use items. I wanted them for job interviews and vacation and they lasted that long, but my hair is long and thin so they worked for me. Price was right.</li>
            <li> The instructions are impossible to read. &amp; I have no idea what half of it is for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for one of the products in it. It met my expectations.</li>
            <li> great products works good</li>
            <li> Well the box was fun I must admit but I don&#x27;t know how to use most of the things in it and there is no instructions so this would be good for someone more educated on how to use all this stuff just not me</li>
            <li> No directions for use. But Google works to get directions!</li>
            <li> Some pieces are hard to use, especially since the instructions are not in English. For the price, it was a good deal, though.</li>
            <li> Everything was great. I got everything that was advertised.</li>
            <li> Lots of different products included at a great price.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because they don&#x27;t give you instructions for many of the items in the package.</li>
            <li> Lots to choose from.  I had fun playing around with these hair tools.  Directions in Chinese, but able to figure them out.  Love the headband, and the bun maker.  When removing, I&#x27;m left with soft curls, which is an added benefit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for the topsy tail, the little one works perfectly fine but the big one gets caught in the hair because the point is not smooth. I mean for the price i guess i can&#x27;t complain. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Great bag of hair goodies for the price.  Not high quality, but it&#x27;s sufficient to give it a try and see how they work for a while. Maybe we&#x27;ll upgrade on the things we like later.&lt;br /&gt;Instruction in Chinese, but there are pictures for the foam twist, donut, &amp;#34;tipsy turvies&amp;#34; and spiral pin.  After reading the content descriptions (which are a little confusing probably because their English terms aren&#x27;t precise or clear enough for me) and googling, we know how to start using most of the tools except the bands hooked together, headband tool (?) and the pin pictured inside the headband.&lt;br /&gt;Quantity description is a little misleading or maybe I&#x27;m just missing items.  I only got one spiral pin. TI ordered 2 sets and neither had 2 spiral pins. The 2 hair ropes, I guess are the 2 bands attached to each other, which I would count as 1 item.&lt;br /&gt;Took a while to get here, about a month, but that&#x27;s ok for the bargain.  Looking forward to spending some quality time with my 12 year old daughter trying and figuring this stuff out!</li>
            <li> Very good product. They came really fast. But I don&#x27;t figure it out how to put it on my hair and style with them, I have to look on some videos for that. Anyway good hair style kit.</li>
            <li> Meh i guess I expected a bit better</li>
            <li> Nice product for a nice price I recommend this</li>
            <li> Cheap material, but it does the job</li>
            <li> Has somethings I have no idea how to use but it has other items that are great and I love to use.</li>
            <li> I wish there was some direction with this buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Pretty good quality for the price though. If only the direction was in english.</li>
            <li> Love the tipsy tails and the pins and hair ties it comes wth. Great price... But some of the stuff just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try several of these products for a while but I didn&#x27;t want to spend very much in case I didn&#x27;t like them. I lack even the most basic hair styling abilities but these are mostly very simple. I used the bun maker, topsy tail and French bun maker on my 7 year old daughter who has very fine hair and I was pleasantly surprised by how simple they are to use. The only downside is that, as several other reviewers have noted, the instructions aren&#x27;t in English. Several of the tools have pictorial instructions but it&#x27;s really easy to find videos on YouTube for everything else. For the price, these tools are really great!</li>
