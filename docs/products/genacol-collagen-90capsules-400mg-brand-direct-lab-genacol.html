            <li>I understand that Genacol is the only collagen manufacturer to have successfully &amp;#34;stabilized&amp;#34; type 1 collagen, which is the majority of collagen in the body.</li>

            <li> now take one every other nite for the last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I trust him,so when I started martial arts training, I was extremely sore due to lack of flexibility, this product works...take at bedtime when beginning...</li>
            <li> Okay, I am taking this product for painful feet.  </li>
            <li> just be careful.</li>
            <li> The capsules do not taget wrinkles but other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> I will never order again from this supplier and would like to warn other prospective buyers to avoid at all costs this supplier.</li>
            <li> It might work for other conditions, but not for mine.  </li>
            <li> But when you eat protein it gets broken down into amino acids in your stomach, so I&#x27;m not sure how whole collagen would get into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> Other collagen products waste of money.</li>
            <li> and i have always had less mobility and pain.  </li>
            <li> Last year while doing martial arts, I developed plantar fasciitis in my left foot and the pain was terrible.</li>
            <li> I am also taking iron supplementation and a green drink</li>
            <li> Just a few capsules every night does the trick.</li>
            <li> Before this I use to take fish oil, chondrotin, glucosamine and MSM for my joints for at least 10yrs.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Try, do not think you will be disappointed, however after 3 months had to cut down dosage.</li>
            <li> I was without them about 4 days and my hands and feet hurt so bad from the arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li> Afraid to consume it !!!!!</li>

            <li> Genacol brand really worked to stop my hip joint pain. I understand that Genacol is the only collagen manufacturer to have successfully &amp;#34;stabilized&amp;#34; type 1 collagen, which is the majority of collagen in the body.</li>
            <li> After taking one capsule per day at night and the end of two weeks I notice the bust line was increased to a whole size bigger then before.  I stopped taking them.  The capsules do not taget wrinkles but other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, I personally know the doctor who did his own study, I called him before I bought this product. He is a very honest doctor and has a World Renowned reputation, he has given me tons of FREE information, and has NEVER tried to sell me anything. I trust him,so when I started martial arts training, I was extremely sore due to lack of flexibility, this product works...take at bedtime when beginning...I have more flexibility and recover better from intense workouts.</li>
            <li> All indications show that this is excellent for rebuilding bone for people with osteoporosis.</li>
            <li> Noticed more strength in my legs within a few days of using. Recommended by my doctor. Try, do not think you will be disappointed, however after 3 months had to cut down dosage. started getting dizzy, my legs do miss the regular dosage of 3 at nite, but the site does talk about side effects. always do your research so that you are comfortable in what your taking. now take one every other nite for the last 2 weeks. just be careful. depends on your system and your body.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the product before. this time the product ordered did not show on the outside label CRITICAL and REQUIRED specifications like 400 MG as advertised and a a product expiration date. I will never order again from this supplier and would like to warn other prospective buyers to avoid at all costs this supplier.</li>
            <li> I discovered this stuff in Windsor, Canada because a friend of mine lives across the river from Detroit so I would go to see her often. Last year while doing martial arts, I developed plantar fasciitis in my left foot and the pain was terrible. I never had foot pain in the 25 years of taking martial arts. While in Windsor one particular weekend, I noticed the ad for this stuff so I tried it. After one week, the pain in my feet was about 80% gone - and yes it worked that fast on me. I finished the bottle and after about three weeks of not taking it, some of the pain returned so that told me that this stuff works. Overall Genacol is a really good product and I would recommend you to try it. Last year I searched for this on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t find it so I assumed that it wasn&#x27;t available in the U.S. I just got back from my local Vitamin Shoppe and they don&#x27;t have it so I am going to see if they can carry this stuff.</li>
            <li> This really works well for lubricating joints.  It is a good product that I would buy again some time. one</li>
            <li> I did not know what benefits I was receiving until I stopped taking them.  They are great for my skin, joints and nails.  I love it and will probably continue to take for life.  I am post menopausal this supplement offsets the effects.</li>
            <li> Every time we have an ache or problem in my family, we take Genacol, and every time we are pleased by the quick results we get. I am suffering from osteoarthritis in my lower back, and this time I thought that maybe it would take months to get some relief. Not so! I started taking Genacol 7 days ago, and I am already feeling so much better! I went from being in pain after just standing for a couple of minutes, to being able to lead a normal life now! This is a product I recommend to all my friends!</li>
            <li> It is very good for arthritis and not only that I give it to my dog who also has arthritis and has done amazing things for her .</li>
            <li> Received on time and good condition and I am very satisfied with the quality of the product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Okay, I am taking this product for painful feet.  I have taken it about two weeks now and my skin is beautiful!  I have actual color on my face rather than a paperbag brown.  The bloodflow has improved so much that my beginning wrinkles have filled in, my cheeks are rosey and my lips are like dark wine where they used to have absolutely no color at all!  I know it will take a little more time to get rid of the plantar foot pain but this beginning perk is amazing!  I am also taking iron supplementation and a green drink but I am laying my complexion on Genacol.    I will come back and update when the plantar pain goes away  I am sure it will.</li>
            <li> Genacol Collagen was recommended to my wife  by our doctor, improves skin tone, at this point it seems to be quite effective</li>
            <li> I noticed the same fresh glow to my cheeks that someone else mentioned. I think it also helps my sleep. So I am happy about the improvements to my complexion - even if I still need hip surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends have said &amp;#34;Wow, you look so healthy!&amp;#34; So that does make it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and decided to try the Genecol with Calcium that&#x27;s just out in the market&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the new product upsets my stomach and I am reverting to this good old trusty original version&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s works well and has been very helpful with my knee and neck degeneration</li>
            <li> Best product for joint maintenance. Other collagen products waste of money. Should combine with good quality calcium and MSM/glucosamin/HA product. As well as NEW BALANCE shoes. The Best!</li>
            <li> There is no expiration date! I think they are all expired!! Afraid to consume it !!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my family member, she says that it works so, that&#x27;s all there is to it! It helps her with arthritis specifically.</li>
            <li> receved it quickly thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work to help make my old bones feel better. Even friends who doubt that any of this kind of thing can work, swear by this product. Just a few capsules every night does the trick.</li>
            <li> I took this stuff for back pain and knee troubles.  Since I am a big guy 291 lbs. I was told to take double the dose every night for the first week (6 caps) and then go back down to 4.  In the first week I noticed less pain in my back when I woke up in the morning but it still did not take it totally away.  The biggest difference I noticed a change was in my knees.  I have had 2 knee surgeries on my meniscus on both knees and i have always had less mobility and pain.  Before this I use to take fish oil, chondrotin, glucosamine and MSM for my joints for at least 10yrs.&lt;br /&gt;They helped, but in the first week of taking Genacol I have a lot less pain and more flexibility.  When you have more flexibility in your knees you can do exercises a lot more effective.&lt;br /&gt;I am a believer in Genacol!</li>
            <li> Genacol has done it right. It removes all the pain in my knee and hip It really works.I will not be caught without it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I was very happy with your price.  I will probably order again when needed</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for my acute athritis due to heavy playing of basketball. It has worked wonders for me cause i was able to play again.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me for chronic nerve and muscle pain in my legs.  I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.  It might work for other conditions, but not for mine.  I&#x27;m skeptical of some of the claims because collagen is a protein, the most abundant protein in the body.  But when you eat protein it gets broken down into amino acids in your stomach, so I&#x27;m not sure how whole collagen would get into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these about 4 months and realized their great benefit to me when I ran out - thought I had ordered more but hadn&#x27;t.  I was without them about 4 days and my hands and feet hurt so bad from the arthritis pain.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my delivery when I reordered.  Glad to have found this product!</li>
            <li> I feel that the Genacol Gel has helped me.  Perhaps it has been the combination with the capsules.  I hope so!</li>
