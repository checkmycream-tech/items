            <li>I ABSOLUTELY love this hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>Covers more thoroughly and hair feels better afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m worth it!!</li>
            <li>and Im pretty sure this conditioner had a lot to do with that!</li>
            <li>Super happy that I found this product on amazon for WAY cheaper than you can get at any salon near me!</li>
            <li>I wish it came in paraben free.</li>
            <li>It works immediately, leaving my hair soft, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Especially for little girls age 5 who have super tangled fine hair.</li>
            <li>I like it even better than Pure ology!</li>
            <li>It smells great, makes my hair super easy to comb through and it seems to be less frizzy when it dries.  </li>
            <li>Awesome for thick curly brittle hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really helps!!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>but you absolutely get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I have been buying Enjoy conditioner from my professional salon for three years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally gave in!</li>
            <li>My hair is light and not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li>I like this conditioner - it is similar to Pureology&#x27;s Hydration Conditioner (purple bottle) but without Pureology&#x27;s strong peppermint scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never spent this much money on Conditioner... but its completely worth it!</li>
            <li>It left residue build-up, which the Enjoy line eliminates.  </li>
            <li>Really gets the tangles out.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly</li>
            <li>so I use Keratin to keep it straight.  </li>
            <li>My 24 year old daughter called me crying about her beautiful waist length auburn hair that was being totally damaged by chlorine.  </li>
            <li>It is significantly cheaper purchasing it on Amazon, especially if you Subscribe and Save than purchasing it from a Salon.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair - medium-thickness - and this conditioner is really nice for overall manageability and tangle resistance!</li>
            <li>However, I will hold off on making that determination until I have used it for a while, which I feel is only fair to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on the bottle indicated to comb the product through your hair - I do recommend following those instructions as it does make a big difference as compared to just smoothing it on.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m biting the bullet and switching to a far more expensive, yet much better, line of hair products.</li>
            <li>we have curly hair and a few products work for us, but this one is fantastic!</li>
            <li>For years, I&#x27;ve put my hair through all the usual abuse, still expecting it to look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and prevents breaking!</li>
            <li>I keep trying other ones thinking they&#x27;ll do more for my hair only to come back to using this again.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick, course hair and Enjoy makes my hair soft shiny and</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended it to me, I refused to purchase due to the high price.  </li>

            <li> I have finally found the best conditioner in the world... After 15 years! It works immediately, leaving my hair soft, and it smells good. I love love love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> My stylist used this line of products on my hair and suggested I continue to use them. For years, I&#x27;ve put my hair through all the usual abuse, still expecting it to look and feel healthy. I was using Dove shampoo and conditioner, as well as a leave-in conditioner. It left residue build-up, which the Enjoy line eliminates.  So I&#x27;m biting the bullet and switching to a far more expensive, yet much better, line of hair products. I&#x27;m worth it!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great customer service!</li>
            <li> This is great conditioner for curly hair. Really gets the tangles out. can comb through hair when wet, no problem.</li>
            <li> I use this for color treated hair. My 24 year old daughter called me crying about her beautiful waist length auburn hair that was being totally damaged by chlorine.  I had some delivered to her and it works just as well.  Her hair is restored to beauty again!!  Pricey but you absolutely get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I have curly/frizzy/dry hair and have a very hard time finding products that work well.  Enjoy is amazing.  I use the shampoo as well, but especially love the conditioner.  It smells great, makes my hair super easy to comb through and it seems to be less frizzy when it dries.  I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> This conditioner is the only one that gets the tangles out of my hair.  My hair is long and thick</li>

            <li> This is the best conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Especially for little girls age 5 who have super tangled fine hair. Plus mom loves it too. I wish it came in paraben free.</li>
            <li> Always a favorite. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Super happy that I found this product on amazon for WAY cheaper than you can get at any salon near me! It makes my hair so soft and prevents breaking! My hair has now grown to the middle of my back and Im pretty sure this conditioner had a lot to do with that!</li>
            <li> My hair is highlighted &amp; going grey at 49. This conditioner hydrates &amp; nourishes it.  The best I&#x27;ve used comparing it to Aveda, Pureology, &amp; most salon brands-too many to list!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, course hair and Enjoy makes my hair soft shiny and awesome!.......&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s kind of costly but a nice treat....a little goes a long way, and I have a ton&lt;br /&gt;of hair.</li>
            <li> we have curly hair and a few products work for us, but this one is fantastic! good bye hair knots!!</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked or felt healthier. I&#x27;ve never spent this much money on Conditioner... but its completely worth it!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair - medium-thickness - and this conditioner is really nice for overall manageability and tangle resistance!</li>
            <li> I have been buying Enjoy conditioner from my professional salon for three years. Three years! I know what the conditioner should look like, smell like, and what the consistency should be. This crap is so fake. It looks like Vaseline lotion in the bottle AND the label on the bottle appears to not be shower proof! Hmmmm a conditioner bottle label that isn&#x27;t water proof. Fake Fake Fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for years!  I keep trying other ones thinking they&#x27;ll do more for my hair only to come back to using this again.  My hair is very curly so I use Keratin to keep it straight.  With that an highlights, my hair gets dry.  This conditioner really helps!!</li>
            <li> This calms my crazy thick and frizzy hair. It&#x27;s about the only conditioner that could do it. I almost don&#x27;t even need the bio-oil for hair taming.</li>
            <li> Great product for all hair types..</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this hair conditioner. My hairdresser recommended it to me, I refused to purchase due to the high price.  I&#x27;m glad I finally gave in! My hair is light and not dry or greasy. I have a difficult time with conditioners as some make my scalp itch, no problem with this one! Am definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner - it is similar to Pureology&#x27;s Hydration Conditioner (purple bottle) but without Pureology&#x27;s strong peppermint scent.  I am still debating the term \\&quot;luxury\\&quot;....not sure if it applies.  However, I will hold off on making that determination until I have used it for a while, which I feel is only fair to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on the bottle indicated to comb the product through your hair - I do recommend following those instructions as it does make a big difference as compared to just smoothing it on.  Covers more thoroughly and hair feels better afterwards.</li>
            <li> BEST conditioner ever!</li>
