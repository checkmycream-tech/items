            <li>I just want to say one good thing..</li>
            <li>It is very cheap material.</li>
            <li>the one on top that you will receive,</li>
            <li>Thought it was of better quality.</li>
            <li>The tape itself is OK.</li>
            <li>its ok, wider than I wanted</li>
            <li>The posting came quick ..</li>
            <li>The picture is misleading first and foremost.</li>
            <li>Guess I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for nail tape but what I received was literally a roll of duct tape that had been cut to a smaller width.</li>
            <li>Not the others... Very displeased..</li>
            <li>I gave this one star because it took forever to come &amp; when it did get it, I only got 1 super small top of tape, the pics showed 2 bigger rolls.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing more than masking tape that has been cut really thin on the spool and passed off as Nail Art Tape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for different tape in the near future.</li>

            <li> There was only 1 row and was too wide for nail art?</li>
            <li> Is not very sticky and lets nail polish get underneath it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time of money.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe someone would send something in such poor quality.</li>
            <li> Seriously, its just a role of masking tape cut in half.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Should have paid attention to bad the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely disappointed with the misconception that this is Nail Art Tape.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

            <li> I gave this one star because it took forever to come &amp; when it did get it, I only got 1 super small top of tape, the pics showed 2 bigger rolls.  I&#x27;ve included a pic of the item I received.</li>
            <li> There was only 1 row and was too wide for nail art?</li>
            <li> The item that is sent is not what you see in the picture. It&#x27;s the wider tape the one on top that you will receive, and it&#x27;s masking tape cut into a strip. Not worth the time of money.</li>
            <li> Seriously, its just a role of masking tape cut in half. Dont bother.</li>
            <li> It is very cheap material. I couldn&#x27;t believe someone would send something in such poor quality. the tape was damaged and falling apart! I wish I could rate 0 stars</li>
            <li> thought it would be like the picture but it wasnt only one roll of tape</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  Should have paid attention to bad the reviews.</li>
            <li> Thought it was of better quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely disappointed with the misconception that this is Nail Art Tape. It&#x27;s nothing more than masking tape that has been cut really thin on the spool and passed off as Nail Art Tape.</li>
            <li> Received 1 tiny roll was expecting 2.</li>
            <li> The picture is misleading first and foremost. The tape itself is OK. I found I got a lot of bleeding no matter what polish I used. I&#x27;ll be looking for different tape in the near future.</li>
            <li> Basically a roll of masking tape sliced into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> Some basically just cut up a roll of masking tape up is all and it was all bent when I got it. Haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> I just want to say one good thing.. The posting came quick .. But then I opened the package to have only one roll of tape .. Not the others... Very displeased..</li>
            <li> Guess I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for nail tape but what I received was literally a roll of duct tape that had been cut to a smaller width.</li>
            <li> Still have not reserved it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> its ok, wider than I wanted</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Is not very sticky and lets nail polish get underneath it. I threw it out.</li>
