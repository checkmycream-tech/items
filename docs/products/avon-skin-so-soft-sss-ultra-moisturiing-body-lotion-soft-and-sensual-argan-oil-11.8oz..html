            <li> My hands are slippery now.  Don&#x27;t ask why I needed that in my life.  Thanks AVON!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent of this and the result is very soft skin, as promised.  The side benefit is that fleas and mosquitoes stay away.</li>
            <li> This lotion is totally amazing! Immediate moisture the name says for itself. Awesome! My skin remains smooth all day long till about the next day. I&#x27;m definitely gonna buy more</li>
            <li> I have not been without Avon Skin So Soft for 15+ years!  It is a staple in my daily routine.  As soon as I come out of the shower I lotion up for all over moisturization.  Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  Leaves the slighest sheen however does not feel oily or greasy in any way.  It is light and not quite as thick as many other lotions.  A little goes a long way.  Do not hesitate if you are on the fence.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Thanks  I love it and it was fast shipping :-)</li>
            <li> The name pretty much says it. This lotion is very moisturizing and smells very pleasant. It&#x27;s great for when you&#x27;re just getting out of the shower or bath. It is just right for me.</li>
            <li> Nice gift smells good on you body long lasting scent  Can re-apply all through-out the day for freshness Thanks</li>
            <li> Avon skin so soft is always great. Feels good putting it on. Not greasy and seems to keep the bugs away</li>
            <li> Just lotion.  Nothing phenomenal, not bad either.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent, it really works. Only thing not quite right is the perfume.  It&#x27;s very flowery (like lilies) and a bit overpowering!</li>
            <li> I love the Avon Skin so soft body lotion!  Makes my skin feel so soft and I love the scent. With the cold weather this has really helped!</li>
            <li> We had a lot of rain this summer which brought out the mosquitoes - I used this lotion instead of using a deet spray and was never bit. My husband and his workers all apply the lotion to their arms before they stucco because after work the stucco comes right off without scrubbing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It&#x27;s the only body lotion I know of that keeps my skin moisturized all day.  Perfect for dry winters and sun-worshipped skin in the summers.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and it leaves my skin thirsty &amp; dry.  Avon&#x27;s Skin So Soft line is the only lotion that works on it.  It leaves my elbows &amp; knee caps soft &amp; smooth without that greasy feeling that other lotions seem to leave behind.  The Soft &amp; Sensual scent is womanly enough to make you feel sexy but light &amp; versable enough to use on the whole family.  Spray on any perfume after use &amp; the scents blend together wonderfully.  Perfect for that thrifty mom who wants to smell like a Victoria Secret Angel without paying the price.</li>
            <li> Heard it was to heal against mosquitoes. Didn&#x27;t work well for me for that purpose. Smell good and do makes the skin soft</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use it year round after shower and/or shaving.  Also good to use daily when in Colorado or other dry climates.  Very helpful after a bad sunburn too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that Avon decided to put this item back in production. I was heart broken when they discontinued the Soft &amp; Sensual scent of their Skin So Soft product line. I love it. The scent is soft and alluring. I get compliments each time I have it on. Kudos!!</li>
            <li> Love the light scent and my legs and arms stay moisturized through the night and into the next day. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was an &amp;#34;add on product&amp;#34; and I am so grateful that I purchased it. I love the silky smooth feeling that it gives me, without all the &amp;#34;oily feel&amp;#34;. This item was well worth the purchase.</li>
