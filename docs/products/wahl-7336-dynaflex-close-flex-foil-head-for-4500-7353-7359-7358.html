            <li>Still a good buy.</li>
            <li>They work and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>good product but not for me .</li>
            <li>This is a good product for use with the wahl shaver.</li>
            <li>This was excellent value for the money got it quickly and worked well on my existing wahl with no problems.</li>
            <li>Love them, and great price</li>
            <li>This was a great way to have an excellent shaver again without having to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>one of the best that&#x27;s out right now</li>
            <li>This product works great and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The foil works great and provides a close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>This is why it is best to make purchases in a store, for items that are sold in stores near your home.</li>
            <li>I need to make sure this cuts better.</li>
            <li>Much better then</li>
            <li>Also stand out from most barbers.</li>
            <li>the foil stays in place and even seems to provide a better cut.  </li>
            <li>good price fast delivery</li>
            <li>Ok it fit my Wahl just fine</li>
            <li>The shave is nice and close, and really helps in minimizing my &amp;#34;black man&#x27;s&amp;#34; shaving problem.</li>
            <li>fit my trimmer.</li>
            <li>I suspect that the super close version of the foil is thinner to achieve the super closeness, &amp; therefore will probably wear through more rapidly than the close version.  </li>
            <li>he always gets good reviews and pretty much what did I want him to do about it.</li>
            <li>I paid fifty-dollars for my Wahl Super Close shaver about seven years ago, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t last a GOOD month.  </li>
            <li>It came quick.</li>
            <li>but its ok it works the same it fit</li>
            <li>The ten-dollars for the replacement foil was well worth it, and I hope to get another seven years out of it.</li>
            <li>I was aware that I was buying a Burgundy foil that was super close.</li>
            <li>I believe I caused the original foil to break from the plastic head by applying too much pressure with the razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering more foils in the near future.</li>
            <li>I really like the Wahl super close electric razor.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much!</li>
            <li>Came very fast.</li>
            <li>For some strange reasons, these screen foil breaks very easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to replace and cost saving because you don&#x27;t have to purchase a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>I think it is more of a quality issues because I get some that works well from certain sellers, and some breaks easily from other sellers.  </li>
            <li>exactly what my husband needed</li>
            <li>Fast shipping product just as described A+++!</li>
            <li>Works well, my husband like is pleased, dose not matter what the color is, they cut the same.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as I asked.</li>
            <li>My shaves are really close!  </li>
            <li>Snapped right on and seems to be very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It does not cut as close as the red super clean one cuts.</li>
            <li>The picture clearly says &#x27;super close&#x27; on it below the foil.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly as it is exactly the same as the original that came in the packaging when I bought the shaver.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is strictly about the seller not so much the product.</li>
            <li>But the real products should be made in America.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It may last longer but you will find yourself having to shave more frequently.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical because my shaver is burgundy with gold foil, the replacement is black with silver foil, but the fit was perfect.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if some of these products were cheaply made/copied/faked by the cheap chinese companies (that&#x27;s why they breaks easily).  </li>
            <li>fits my shaver works like new again</li>
            <li>LIKE NEW</li>
            <li>So far the new foil seems to be holding up.  </li>
            <li>I think you can save more by buying the regular gillette razor in costco, this wahl foil will not last that long, i am just saying...</li>
            <li>What I received a black foil that is ultra clean.</li>
            <li>so I had no trouble shaving again.</li>
            <li>So far not one problem with product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut any where near close.</li>
            <li>Careful this is not the golden one that comes with the shaver.</li>
            <li>I did have a few when I first started using this product.</li>

            <li> Ok it fit my Wahl just fine</li>
            <li> Great and cost effective</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. But it does not cut as close as I like. I need to make sure this cuts better.</li>
            <li> The foil keeps on ripping on the fold of the head. Don&#x27;t last. Please work on quality. Don&#x27;t just take our money.</li>
            <li> Product works perfectly. Although it says black it shows a maroon foil. Still a good buy.</li>
            <li> Picture and Description doesn&#x27;t match, you will not receive this head it will be a black head &amp;#34;Ultra Clean&amp;#34; again not what&#x27;s pictured!!</li>
            <li> This is strictly about the seller not so much the product. The seller I have come in contact with was homewares. I was aware that I was buying a Burgundy foil that was super close. What I received a black foil that is ultra clean. When contacting the seller he proceeds to tell me that this has never happened before,  he always gets good reviews and pretty much what did I want him to do about it. I had read previous reviews that other people had felt duped by this guy because he sends out wrong items and now this guy comes at me like im in the wrong for making the complaint! I have seen now that the previous complaints have been erased. Hope you guys read this before you get taken by this guy and he erases this too</li>
            <li> This shaves a lot shorter then my other razors. The interchange to my razor was perfect so I had no trouble shaving again. The delivery was very good.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly as it is exactly the same as the original that came in the packaging when I bought the shaver.</li>
            <li> I want it them burgundy and I got them black but its ok it works the same it fit my shaver tgats all it marters</li>
            <li> The product is the only electric razor that gives my face a bald feel when shaved . Only duplicated by regular razors .</li>
            <li> This product works great and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering more foils in the near future.</li>
            <li> Much better then the stock burgundy color foil. It seems as tho it takes hair off faster as well.. A little closer then the stock foil. Also stand out from most barbers. Gives the machine an attracting color way.</li>
            <li> very nice, my son is a barber and will use this every day he also teaches barbering and loves this product by wahl</li>
            <li> I really like the Wahl super close electric razor. I have suffered with shaving bumps for years. This is the only product that I have found that keeps the problem to a minimum. Found the replacement heads here. They work and fit perfectly. At first I was skeptical because my shaver is burgundy with gold foil, the replacement is black with silver foil, but the fit was perfect.</li>
            <li> The head broke already.  Material not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping product just as described A+++!</li>
            <li> Works well, my husband like is pleased, dose not matter what the color is, they cut the same. Thank you.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last a GOOD month.  I even had to replace the Head.  NO GOOD!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The foil works great and provides a close, comfortable shave.  However, I should point out that the photo does not match the description.  The foil that was actually sent to me was the one pictured, which is &amp;#34;super close&amp;#34;, maroon colored.  The description&lt;br /&gt;says &amp;#34;close, black&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> For some strange reasons, these screen foil breaks very easily.  I think it is more of a quality issues because I get some that works well from certain sellers, and some breaks easily from other sellers.  I am not sure if some of these products were cheaply made/copied/faked by the cheap chinese companies (that&#x27;s why they breaks easily).  But the real products should be made in America.</li>
            <li> I received the &amp;#34;super close&amp;#34; (purple) replacement foil, instead of the &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; (black) foil pictured in the listing.  I kept what I received, since  I don&#x27;t care that the color doesn&#x27;t match the shaver, and didn&#x27;t want to bother returning the item.  I suspect that the super close version of the foil is thinner to achieve the super closeness, &amp; therefore will probably wear through more rapidly than the close version.  This is why it is best to make purchases in a store, for items that are sold in stores near your home.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but the wrong was shipped, I ordered &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; but I received &amp;#34;very close&amp;#34; no worries I am still happy.</li>
            <li> I paid fifty-dollars for my Wahl Super Close shaver about seven years ago, and it is still going strong. The shave is nice and close, and really helps in minimizing my &amp;#34;black man&#x27;s&amp;#34; shaving problem. The ten-dollars for the replacement foil was well worth it, and I hope to get another seven years out of it.</li>
            <li> great product, great price! thanks</li>
            <li> THE WAHL FOIL CLOSE BLACK 3OUNCE WAHL SOLVE MY PROBLEM. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I do like  80%  wish same color as shown. When I received this come black.</li>
            <li> good price fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love them, and great price</li>
            <li> So far the new foil seems to be holding up.  I believe I caused the original foil to break from the plastic head by applying too much pressure with the razor.  By reducing the pressure and just allowing the weight of the razor to go over the skin the foil stays in place and even seems to provide a better cut.  One note:  The foils are not gold as pictured.  It could have just been my order but mine arrived in silver.</li>
            <li> Came very fast. fit my trimmer. Snapped right on and seems to be very sturdy. So far not one problem with product.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my Wahl. LIKE NEW</li>
            <li> Careful this is not the golden one that comes with the shaver. The picture clearly says &#x27;super close&#x27; on it below the foil. When I opened the box the the foil that came was silver and said &#x27;Close&#x27;. This one doesn&#x27;t shave as closely to the skin because it is thicker .. It may last longer but you will find yourself having to shave more frequently.</li>
            <li> good product but not for me . I think you can save more by buying the regular gillette razor in costco, this wahl foil will not last that long, i am just saying...</li>
            <li> It was defective. The foil broke after the 2nd week.</li>
            <li> just like the the one that came with  the saver</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  It came exactly as I asked. The product meets my needs.  I&#x27;d purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> It does not cut as close as the red super clean one cuts. Plus my razor body only works when plugged in. Never been dropped nor mishandled it just stopped working not happy. How can I get it replaced?</li>
            <li> This is a good product for use with the wahl shaver. It&#x27;s easy to replace and cost saving because you don&#x27;t have to purchase a whole new shaver. Makes for a great shave and cost savings.</li>
            <li> My shaves are really close!  A must have!</li>
            <li> Hard to find replacements for my shaver. This was perfect</li>
            <li> best thing since sliced bread!</li>
            <li> Useless. Doesn&#x27;t cut any where near close.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this shaver. It gives a close shave. Your akin has to get use to it but I don&#x27;t have issues w bumps now. I did have a few when I first started using this product.</li>
            <li> one of the best that&#x27;s out right now</li>
