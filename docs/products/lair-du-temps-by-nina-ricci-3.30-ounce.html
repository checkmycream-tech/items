            <li>GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li>Always perfect - my favorite fragrance.............</li>
            <li>Used this years ago delighted to find it still avsilabl</li>
            <li>But if you love it anyway, this is a beautiful bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>I will continue shopping here for my favorite fragrances!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love the sophisticated look and will be happy to buy the refill when I need it.  </li>
            <li>Make someone happy buy this lovely scent for someone special.  </li>
            <li>For My wife on Valentines Day, it&#x27;s Her favorite.</li>
            <li>It is both lovely and practical.</li>
            <li>My favorite for many years.</li>
            <li>The point is, this ISN&#x27;T the famous bottle with the pair-of-doves cap; it&#x27;s the copper/gold spray canister.</li>
            <li>nothing more  to say.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s love this, she has been wearing it for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>This is actually a better buy for that reason.  </li>
            <li>Smells great without covering the whole room.  </li>
            <li>They will love it and so will you.</li>
            <li>Beautiful - my favorite scent in such quality packaging!</li>
            <li>but you get a bottle with a huge dove.  </li>
            <li>So I regularly look out for great deals on Amazon and this option turned up.</li>
            <li>I recieved the product on time and wrapped securely.</li>
            <li>Lovely, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I just love this fragrance and this was such a good price.</li>
            <li>It has been my favorite perfime for over 25 years, and this is the first time I recieved this bottle type.</li>
            <li>~smile!~</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the original L&#x27;Air Du Temps fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the original fragrance.</li>
            <li>Give yourself something special today...</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s been in existence for many years, I believe it is still a modern scent.</li>
            <li>This parfum is the cleanest ,softest.. most gentle parfum on planet earth...  </li>
            <li>My mom loved the present</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re a first time buyer and you want the doves, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to smell the same whether you buy the bottle with the sculpted birds on top, or not.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a long time favorite of my wife.  </li>
            <li>Similar, but very light and not lasting.  </li>
            <li>Very classy looking.</li>
            <li>Everyone who&#x27;s used and loved L&#x27;air du Temps for the past 40 years will recognize that the edt (eau de toilette) is not particularly long lasting anymore.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s core fragrance and while she dabbles in others, old or new, this will always be her number one.</li>
            <li>I wanted the canister shown on the photo, which is convenient for traveling,  and received the one with the pair-of-doves top, which is hard to pack unless kept in the box (too bulky).</li>
            <li>Purchased this as an unexpected gift.  </li>
            <li>As expected, this product met our expectation at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The eau de parfum concentration (found elsewhere) is just barely any stronger than the edt.  </li>
            <li>It is very flowery, but also has some other undertones.</li>

            <li> For My wife on Valentines Day, it&#x27;s Her favorite.</li>
            <li> Always perfect - my favorite fragrance.............</li>
            <li> Beautiful - my favorite scent in such quality packaging! I love the sophisticated look and will be happy to buy the refill when I need it.  It is both lovely and practical.</li>
            <li> My favorite for many years. Delicate and fresh.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;L&#x27;Air Du Temps\\&quot; needs no introduction. It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s core fragrance and while she dabbles in others, old or new, this will always be her number one. So I regularly look out for great deals on Amazon and this option turned up. The point is, this ISN&#x27;T the famous bottle with the pair-of-doves cap; it&#x27;s the copper/gold spray canister. So if you&#x27;re a first time buyer and you want the doves, don&#x27;t buy this. If you are already overflowing with doves, then this will add a different dimension to your senses.</li>
            <li> I recieved the product on time and wrapped securely. It has been my favorite perfime for over 25 years, and this is the first time I recieved this bottle type. Very classy looking.</li>
            <li> OH! How I love this fragrance!!! Have been using it for ever and ever...(Can&#x27;t count the years.)  GREAT PRICE TOO!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It is very flowery, but also has some other undertones. Although it&#x27;s been in existence for many years, I believe it is still a modern scent. As regards longevity, it does not stay on too long, but definitely a few hours. That&#x27;s why I gave it four and not five stars. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and have used it for a long time. However, the product I received was not the one I ordered. I wanted the canister shown on the photo, which is convenient for traveling,  and received the one with the pair-of-doves top, which is hard to pack unless kept in the box (too bulky). I&#x27;m assuming amazon didn&#x27;t have what I ordered and sent what they had in the same amount. I would prefer to be informed of the change beforehand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because of the container.  It is not what you get!  This type container would have been useable in a travel kit etc but you get a bottle with a huge dove.  The round style container is why I ordered it and did not get the same container.  I could have made my purchase at any drug store and got the &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34;.  P. U.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t forget  the smell  for this  perfume</li>
            <li> This parfum is the cleanest ,softest.. most gentle parfum on planet earth...  There isn&#x27;t a day goes by that someone doesn&#x27;t  compliment me on the fragrance... ladies... Sometimes a man will make an excuse to get close to me just for a scent. ~smile!~ If your looking for the perfect gift ...this is it ! Give yourself something special today...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the original L&#x27;Air Du Temps fragrance.  Similar, but very light and not lasting.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the original fragrance.</li>
            <li> Only fragrance I wear.........nothing more  to say.  Perfume splash is preferable to spray.  Spray is a waste.  But the business of America is business..............huh!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s love this, she has been wearing it for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> As expected, this product met our expectation at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Everyone who&#x27;s used and loved L&#x27;air du Temps for the past 40 years will recognize that the edt (eau de toilette) is not particularly long lasting anymore.  And it is not exactly the same fragrance as it once was.  But if you love it anyway, this is a beautiful bottle.

            <li> have used before prefer Norell which is basically unavailable</li>
            <li> I just love this fragrance and this was such a good price. I will continue shopping here for my favorite fragrances!</li>
            <li> Lovely, fresh scent.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Used this years ago delighted to find it still avsilabl</li>
            <li> My mom loved the present</li>
            <li> This is a long time favorite of my wife.  Purchased this as an unexpected gift.  Smells great without covering the whole room.  Make someone happy buy this lovely scent for someone special.  They will love it and so will you.</li>
