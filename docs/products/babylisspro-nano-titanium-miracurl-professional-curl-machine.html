            <li>Excellent!!!</li>
            <li>This product works great!</li>
            <li>I found a very good Youtube video, which helped me to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li>However, the results are beautiful.</li>
            <li>not Amazon&#x27;s fault, and a functioning MiraCurl is probably great.  </li>
            <li>take time and the results are great</li>
            <li>Great curls.  </li>
            <li>For thicker and longer hair it takes FOREVER to use, but great curler all around.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll figure it out  GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I love the Babyliss Miracurl!!</li>

            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair when I use this - works great.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It literally is perfect for beginners, those who always burn themselves with curling iron&#x27;s, those who can&#x27;t really get use to the wands or curling irons, or people who are just in a rush!</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>but I love this product!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>It does NOT hold curl for more than 5 minutes, until I bought this!  </li>
            <li>Great product, strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Amazing gadgets</li>
            <li>i tried it out on my unruly, frizzy, curly hair and it STILL made nice curls.  </li>
            <li>I have every think hair so takes a while to curl, but results are nice.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money!!!  </li>
            <li>have a pretty good hand when it comes to esthetics: makeup, hair, wax... everything!</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve had three days of perfect Barbie hair.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use!</li>
            <li>I have tried for as many years as I could work my hands to try and get my hair to hold a curl and NOTHING worked.</li>
            <li>I tried this and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Either it isn&#x27;t authentic or this one is a lemon.</li>
            <li>I have to tell you that I love it.  </li>
            <li>love the curls ....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But I like the Babyliss much better,  </li>
            <li>your like me &amp; can&#x27;t get the perfect curl with a regular curling iron...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am going to buy the spray to go along with this curling iron for more hold.</li>
            <li>Be sure the item you are purchasing is authentic.  </li>
            <li>I love the curls I get from this.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again, but I feel like there is probably still a better product out there.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>but I will say it is FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to start close to your scalp about 3 inches out or</li>
            <li>So every time I saw somebody with perfect curls/waves in a regular day (like they did it by themselves)</li>
            <li>Can I give more than 5 stars?  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I do wish you could put more than an inch of hair in the machine at a time.</li>
            <li>Amazing, fun product!  </li>
            <li>I was a huge skeptic of this product - seemed too good to be true</li>
            <li>I was REALLY impressed also because my hair ( with other curling irons) does not hold a curl whatsoever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO easy to use, does&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Easy to use and curls</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>This makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>STRONGLY.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with each purchase and delivery of merchindise&lt;br /&gt;Prices are reasonable</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and it curls well.  </li>
            <li>I always mess it up, but this makes it perfect every time.</li>
            <li>It is extremely important to follow the instruction though.  </li>
            <li>Works great, faster than using a regular curling iron because my hair is so thick.&lt;br /&gt;Curl</li>
            <li>I made sure I was doing it right.</li>
            <li>I made sure I was doing it right</li>
            <li>style remains for a long while and that is great :</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, arrived ahead of schedule!!!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s smart &amp; won&#x27;t let your hair get stuck.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to all who posted on here letting others know</li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s is really cool.</li>
            <li>but my hair looses curl quick.</li>
            <li>Wonderful  creation for hard to curl hair!</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really say that made a huge difference seems to work well either way.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I got a nice spiral curl, the next one would curl just the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I wash it at night, let it dry on its own and hit the ends with this.  </li>
            <li>Curls are not only PERFECT but super long lasting!!!</li>
            <li>The miracurl is easy to use, quick and my hair stays curly until the next wash.</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference in keeping the look natural.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy straight from the dealer!</li>
            <li>I truly tried to like this MIRACURL from one of the third party seller, i thought it was legit and authentic but not.</li>
            <li>First review ever.  </li>
            <li>Recommend the prep curl, definitely makes it look &amp; hold better.</li>
            <li>I tried it out first thing</li>
            <li>Otherwise I would say it works exactly like it&#x27;s suppose to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had curling irons from different sizes and brands, and I&#x27;ve gotten better, but my curls never got salon-looking.</li>
            <li>First off, I bought this at overstock, so I would be guaranteed the real thing.  </li>
            <li>This curling machine works really well, just as described.</li>
            <li>This curls really well.  </li>
            <li>I really tried to like this</li>
            <li>This thing was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>If you try to curl too much hair, it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>We have a dedicated team ready to assist you.</li>
            <li>Too much hair, and it won&#x27;t curl.</li>
            <li>some research and mine is the real deal.</li>
            <li>holds really well.</li>
            <li>it has a warning beep if you put too much hair in</li>
            <li>but the curls look better and seem to stay in longer - especially for my daughter who has a natural curl to her hair.</li>
            <li>it works so much better on my above the shoulder hair length, with beautifully consistent waves that last a couple days.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>This was a used curler marked new!!!</li>
            <li>I live in FL and my hair holds up even in the humidity!  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But mine doesn&#x27;t get hot enough; neither the adjustments for time or heat are working (they stay the same...too short, and too cool...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new curling my hair.</li>
            <li>Comparatively, well, the Curl Secret made beautiful curls on my daughter, who has long hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s fast, it is easy and if you&#x27;re smarter than the tool it doesn&#x27;t yank any hair (only once and it was the strays next to ten strand</li>
            <li>Well, this was definitely the first</li>
            <li>Even at 9 PM it was way more wavy than in regular basis (when doing it by any other method),&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not know if its original babyliss or imitation but the seller refund me the money for the product</li>
            <li>I recommend getting the MiraCurl spray Baby Bliss offers - it makes a difference.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Miracurl, the product that I received is different from the one on the pictures.</li>
            <li>Bought this to style my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>They really are about the same thing.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, do not put too much hair in at one time.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I have been flat ironing for years - and I&#x27;ve been having trouble getting fat, bouncy curls back on my own.  </li>
            <li>have been a prime member of amazon for almost 3 years now, and honestly after this ridiculous mistake I will definitely cancel it.</li>
            <li>I studied the directions carefully and did exactly what they instructed me to do.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent!!</li>
            <li>I have very long VERY straight blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>The option to alternate curl direction makes them look so natural.</li>
            <li>I also have the Conair Curl Secret, but wanted to give this a try, mostly because you can have alternating curls.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was concerned because it didn&#x27;t seem like the curls were staying really tight (on the highest setting)</li>
            <li>The unit simply produces a section of hair that is kind of wavy, not at all curly, like I just slept weird on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Takes awhile since only a small amount of hair can curl at a time but results are much better than any other styling tool used.</li>
            <li>confess I&#x27;m not a frequent reviewer, nonetheless, I am a frequent user of reviews...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have thick hair, but I think it would take me much longer to do my entire head using this styling tool than it does using my curling iron, which I&#x27;m very used to.</li>
            <li>You have to use it right such as it only curls a small portion of the hair at a time.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Curls are not only PERFECT but super long lasting!!!</li>
            <li> The miracurl is easy to use, quick and my hair stays curly until the next wash.</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference in keeping the look natural.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy straight from the dealer!</li>
            <li> I truly tried to like this MIRACURL from one of the third party seller, i thought it was legit and authentic but not.</li>
            <li> First review ever.  </li>
            <li> Recommend the prep curl, definitely makes it look &amp; hold better.</li>
            <li> I tried it out first thing</li>
            <li> Otherwise I would say it works exactly like it&#x27;s suppose to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had curling irons from different sizes and brands, and I&#x27;ve gotten better, but my curls never got salon-looking.</li>
            <li> First off, I bought this at overstock, so I would be guaranteed the real thing.  </li>
            <li> This curling machine works really well, just as described.</li>
            <li> This curls really well.  </li>
            <li> I really tried to like this</li>
            <li> This thing was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> If you try to curl too much hair, it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> We have a dedicated team ready to assist you.</li>
            <li> Too much hair, and it won&#x27;t curl.</li>
            <li> some research and mine is the real deal.</li>
            <li> holds really well.</li>
            <li> it has a warning beep if you put too much hair in</li>
            <li> but the curls look better and seem to stay in longer - especially for my daughter who has a natural curl to her hair.</li>
            <li> it works so much better on my above the shoulder hair length, with beautifully consistent waves that last a couple days.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li> This was a used curler marked new!!!</li>
            <li> I live in FL and my hair holds up even in the humidity!  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But mine doesn&#x27;t get hot enough; neither the adjustments for time or heat are working (they stay the same...too short, and too cool...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Comparatively, well, the Curl Secret made beautiful curls on my daughter, who has long hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s fast, it is easy and if you&#x27;re smarter than the tool it doesn&#x27;t yank any hair (only once and it was the strays next to ten strand</li>
            <li> Well, this was definitely the first</li>
            <li> Even at 9 PM it was way more wavy than in regular basis (when doing it by any other method),&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not know if its original babyliss or imitation but the seller refund me the money for the product</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the MiraCurl spray Baby Bliss offers - it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Miracurl, the product that I received is different from the one on the pictures.</li>
            <li> Bought this to style my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> They really are about the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, do not put too much hair in at one time.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I have been flat ironing for years - and I&#x27;ve been having trouble getting fat, bouncy curls back on my own.  </li>
            <li> have been a prime member of amazon for almost 3 years now, and honestly after this ridiculous mistake I will definitely cancel it.</li>
            <li> I studied the directions carefully and did exactly what they instructed me to do.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent!!</li>
            <li> I have very long VERY straight blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> The option to alternate curl direction makes them look so natural.</li>
            <li> I also have the Conair Curl Secret, but wanted to give this a try, mostly because you can have alternating curls.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was concerned because it didn&#x27;t seem like the curls were staying really tight (on the highest setting)</li>
            <li> The unit simply produces a section of hair that is kind of wavy, not at all curly, like I just slept weird on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Takes awhile since only a small amount of hair can curl at a time but results are much better than any other styling tool used.</li>
            <li> confess I&#x27;m not a frequent reviewer, nonetheless, I am a frequent user of reviews...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair, but I think it would take me much longer to do my entire head using this styling tool than it does using my curling iron, which I&#x27;m very used to.</li>
            <li> You have to use it right such as it only curls a small portion of the hair at a time.</li>
            <li> On my above the shoulder hair, it made either ringlets or strange looking curl/waves.  </li>
            <li> however far down you want to start curling (DO NOT START FROM THE BOTTOM</li>
            <li> It takes getting used to using, especially for someone with really long hair, but the curls come out just like the pictures!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting my hair to hold curl and this device delivers, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Conair for long hair, to save money,  </li>
            <li> It was not clear to me that the product was not bi-volt.</li>
            <li> Not only does it curl, it is fast (I can do thick waist length hair in under 30 mins) and lasts for days!  </li>
            <li> The curls were so tight that I brushed out my hair and went to bed, because I wanted to see how well they held the next morning.  </li>
            <li> It would curl the top half of the hair and left the bottom half done and weirdly curved.</li>
            <li> tried this product on myself and on others and it would curl the top half of the hair strand and left the bottom half all weirdly curved.  </li>
            <li> but I realized you have to wait for 5 single beeps then</li>
            <li> I have overall cut the time I spend styling my hair way down.  </li>
            <li> Conair is actively working with local, state, federal and international law enforcement, as well as U.S and foreign customs officials, to stop the sale and manufacture of counterfeit and imitation goods.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only thing you have to do is READ the directions carefully, they&#x27;re not that long, and help a lot!</li>
            <li> Took a few tries to master it but not long.  </li>
            <li> and I have long hair!!!  </li>
            <li> I will be returning it and may or may not have it replaced; it takes a long time since you have to section your hair into such small sections per curl.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 1 from a few different sellers and they were all imitations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really faster than a curling iron</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what it would do if I actually blow dried my hair and used it then like you are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not use to stay curled, because is too thin and straight.</li>
            <li> would really like Amazon&#x60;s response to this very serious issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but still it was not consistent.  </li>
            <li> I plugged in and it esas never hot</li>
            <li> Not made by Babyliss®.&lt;br /&gt;Although the product works, ir is clearly an imitation.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and never curled well with regular irons.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, and I still have to use very small sections to get it to curl.</li>
            <li> but now I can curl my hair in less than 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I can spend an hour with a curling iron and in less than 20 mins.</li>
            <li> It beeps and stops, which is telling you to use less hair or comb thoroughly before trying again.  </li>
            <li> First, if you&#x27;re afraid of getting a &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34;, review the sellers and purchase from another seller.  </li>
            <li> not happy it is not what I expected poor volume control and very sensitive to lair length and amount of hair sections.</li>
            <li> but it gets a little heavy after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> This is not a cheap product for you to be playing with your customers like that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Last thing I want is my hair fried, destroyed or worse</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also, it is rather heavy.</li>
            <li> So, I decided I&#x27;d start reviewing at least the either sooo good or sooo terrible products.</li>
            <li> It would beep intermittently and wind the hair half way then slow down to a stop.</li>
            <li> This curling rod has done the work in half the time it takes to curl my daughters hair!</li>
            <li> it happened a few times, but if you stick to the instructions and use small sections of hair, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem</li>
            <li> This replica, according to reviews, is not good for the hair and it ruins the hair.</li>
            <li> Even though you do have to pull in small strips of hair and that can take a while</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t emergency bottom to stop, then you&#x27;ll end up cutting your hair to open.</li>
            <li> and I have coarse crazy thick hair that does not hold a curl</li>
            <li> And I mean forever.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to hold my arm over my head for extended amounts of time (I have short hair, but a lot of it), and so I always get very tired by the time I finish my hair.</li>
            <li> FAKE NOT ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good with a curling iron because I always accidentally crimp the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> My arms don&#x27;t get tired anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted.</li>
            <li> I felt like a dumb!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this when buying it.  </li>
            <li> This is a fake product and didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product and didn&#x27;t work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You will get your hair twisted in this once or twiice before you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Such a bad habit!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> Very Bad!!!</li>
            <li> Used 2 times, turns on, does not rotate  to curl hair very disappointed! !</li>

            <li> The best curler I have had! The curls stay in for 2 days and the various settings allow for such different curls. It takes getting used to but now I can curl my hair in less than 15 minutes and I have hair to my shoulder blades. My arms don&#x27;t get tired anymore. My hair is thick and never curled well with regular irons. Some reviews claimed it was a knock off but the box and even the cord were legitimate.</li>
            <li> Excelente!!! Very happy...</li>
            <li> I received a lemon...not Amazon&#x27;s fault, and a functioning MiraCurl is probably great.  But mine doesn&#x27;t get hot enough; neither the adjustments for time or heat are working (they stay the same...too short, and too cool...no matter what settings I try).  The unit simply produces a section of hair that is kind of wavy, not at all curly, like I just slept weird on my hair.  I will be returning it and may or may not have it replaced; it takes a long time since you have to section your hair into such small sections per curl.  I don&#x27;t have thick hair, but I think it would take me much longer to do my entire head using this styling tool than it does using my curling iron, which I&#x27;m very used to.</li>
            <li> I have tried for as many years as I could work my hands to try and get my hair to hold a curl and NOTHING worked. I tried this and LOVE IT. I can&#x27;t say enough good things. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s fast, it is easy and if you&#x27;re smarter than the tool it doesn&#x27;t yank any hair (only once and it was the strays next to ten strand I was working with that got caught. Lesson learned. I ordered from beautitronic and it&#x27;s as legit as if I bought it at ulta.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! If you follow the instructions it works! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Babyliss&amp;#34; curl is a knock off! Buyer beware!! I ordered 1 from a few different sellers and they were all imitations.</li>
            <li> loving my curls!  I have naturally curly hair that I have been flat ironing for years - and I&#x27;ve been having trouble getting fat, bouncy curls back on my own.  MiraCurl solves that.  I can be beautfully cruly whenever I choose.  I recommend getting the MiraCurl spray Baby Bliss offers - it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> This product is a total knock off! This is not the real Miracurl, the product that I received is different from the one on the pictures. This replica, according to reviews, is not good for the hair and it ruins the hair. I gave to my girlfriend as a birthday gift and I don&#x60;t want her to try it, since it may burn her hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have been a prime member of amazon for almost 3 years now, and honestly after this ridiculous mistake I will definitely cancel it. This is not a cheap product for you to be playing with your customers like that.&lt;br /&gt;I would really like Amazon&#x60;s response to this very serious issue.&lt;br /&gt;Attached to this review there are two pictures that show that the design is different, also the product is lighter than the official one.</li>
            <li> Knock Off. Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Best hair curling device ever! I have a hard time getting my hair to hold curl and this device delivers, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. The miracurl is easy to use, quick and my hair stays curly until the next wash. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Extremely easy to use! It literally is perfect for beginners, those who always burn themselves with curling iron&#x27;s, those who can&#x27;t really get use to the wands or curling irons, or people who are just in a rush! I love it and recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;SO easy to use, does&#x27;t take time and the results are great&lt;br /&gt;The style remains for a long while and that is great :D&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. STRONGLY.</li>
            <li> Item never worked. It would beep intermittently and wind the hair half way then slow down to a stop. Either it isn&#x27;t authentic or this one is a lemon.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with each purchase and delivery of merchindise&lt;br /&gt;Prices are reasonable</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this when buying it.  I have to tell you that I love it.  Have not had any issues with it at all.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> love the curls .... Amazing gadgets</li>
            <li> Very Bad!!! hasn&#x27;t emergency bottom to stop, then you&#x27;ll end up cutting your hair to open.</li>
            <li> Used 2 times, turns on, does not rotate  to curl hair very disappointed! !</li>
            <li> I will never use another styling product for curls. The option to alternate curl direction makes them look so natural. You HAVE to heed the instructions about amount of hair for each curl but I love this product!</li>
            <li> Many thanks to all who posted on here letting others know it&#x27;s a FAKE!!! Last thing I want is my hair fried, destroyed or worse burn myself! I&#x27;m going to buy straight from the dealer!</li>
            <li> Wonderful  creation for hard to curl hair!</li>
            <li> Great curls.  Takes awhile since only a small amount of hair can curl at a time but results are much better than any other styling tool used.</li>
            <li> I truly tried to like this MIRACURL from one of the third party seller, i thought it was legit and authentic but not. There&#x27;s a Qrcode where you can check but it is unrecognized/unvalidated. This is a fake product and didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I tried this miracurl on myself and even with my daughter.. It would curl the top half of the hair and left the bottom half done and weirdly curved. I made sure I was doing it right. I already tried each settings, but got the same result each time. The product also took forever to heat up.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> not happy it is not what I expected poor volume control and very sensitive to lair length and amount of hair sections. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This curling machine works really well, just as described. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This curls really well.  It&#x27;s not really faster than a curling iron but the curls look better and seem to stay in longer - especially for my daughter who has a natural curl to her hair.</li>
            <li> I was a huge skeptic of this product - seemed too good to be true and I have coarse crazy thick hair that does not hold a curl so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  This was foolproof to use - in my opinion way easier than a curling iron.  Hair held a curl for 2 days.  There&#x27;s some criticism out there about getting hair stuck - yes it happened a few times, but if you stick to the instructions and use small sections of hair, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem and it only happened twice when i tried.  Great product, strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> This curling rod has done the work in half the time it takes to curl my daughters hair! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this but it&#x27;s probably just going to end up in the garbage.  This is a fake product and didn&#x27;t work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product on myself and on others and it would curl the top half of the hair strand and left the bottom half all weirdly curved.  I made sure I was doing it right but got the same result each time.  This product also took forever to heat up.  And I mean forever.</li>
            <li> Bought this to style my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  Easy to use and curls come out perfect.  Follow directions and you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Everything is good. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> product broke after 5 months</li>
            <li> First review ever.  This thing was better than I expected.  i tried it out on my unruly, frizzy, curly hair and it STILL made nice curls.  Did not tangle or pull.  You can tell it&#x27;s a quality product.  I can&#x27;t imagine what it would do if I actually blow dried my hair and used it then like you are supposed to.  Amazing, fun product!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Arrived not working and looks used.</li>
            <li> First off, I bought this at overstock, so I would be guaranteed the real thing.  I also have the Conair Curl Secret, but wanted to give this a try, mostly because you can have alternating curls.  Comparatively, well, the Curl Secret made beautiful curls on my daughter, who has long hair.  On my above the shoulder hair, it made either ringlets or strange looking curl/waves.  I would recommend the Conair for long hair, to save money,  They really are about the same thing.  The Babyliss gave me the waves I was looking for, and I didn&#x27;t have to have it on the longest setting to achieve my look.  With the Conair, I used the highest heat and the longest setting  but still it was not consistent.  Sometimes I got a nice spiral curl, the next one would curl just the bottom.  If I hadnt used the Conair on my daughter I wouldn&#x27;t have recommended it.  But I like the Babyliss much better,  it works so much better on my above the shoulder hair length, with beautifully consistent waves that last a couple days.</li>
            <li> This produc is waist your time. Not recommended</li>
            <li> It gets stuck if the hair is too tick for the spinner. For thicker and longer hair it takes FOREVER to use, but great curler all around.</li>
            <li> Just have to get use to it.  My hair is fine and it curls well.  but my hair looses curl quick.</li>
            <li> Great product! It takes getting used to using, especially for someone with really long hair, but the curls come out just like the pictures! I would have given it a 5 but it gets a little heavy after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> Received in one day!!&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderfully, beautiful curls! Recommend the prep curl, definitely makes it look &amp; hold better. Love that it&#x27;s smart &amp; won&#x27;t let your hair get stuck.&lt;br /&gt;If your like me &amp; can&#x27;t get the perfect curl with a regular curling iron... This is for you 😉</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!! So easy to use.</li>
            <li> I plugged in and it esas never hot I do not know if its original babyliss or imitation but the seller refund me the money for the product</li>
            <li> Knock off product. Facek. Not made by Babyliss®.&lt;br /&gt;Although the product works, ir is clearly an imitation.</li>
            <li> This was a used curler marked new!!! Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Wife loved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new curling my hair. This makes it so easy. I love it. I found a very good Youtube video, which helped me to learn how to use it. You have to use it right such as it only curls a small portion of the hair at a time. If you try to curl too much hair, it won&#x27;t work. But it curls very nicely...</li>
            <li> Bought this in December before the holidays.  Took a few tries to master it but not long.  I absolutely love this thing.  Even though you do have to pull in small strips of hair and that can take a while I have overall cut the time I spend styling my hair way down.  I wash it at night, let it dry on its own and hit the ends with this.  Takes me maybe 15 minutes in the morning.  I looked at several of these on line but decided to go with this one because of the alternating directions on the curl.  Makes a huge difference in keeping the look natural.  I get so many compliments on my hair when I use this - works great.  I did also order the prep spray but I can&#x27;t really say that made a huge difference seems to work well either way.  I live in FL and my hair holds up even in the humidity!  Also, read the intructions (they are simple) and follow them.  You will get your hair twisted in this once or twiice before you get the hang of it but you&#x27;ll figure it out  GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! At first, I was concerned because it didn&#x27;t seem like the curls were staying really tight (on the highest setting) but I realized you have to wait for 5 single beeps then once you hear one longer beep, then you unclamp and let the hair out. I was REALLY impressed also because my hair ( with other curling irons) does not hold a curl whatsoever. After 6 hours later, the curls are still there! I am going to buy the spray to go along with this curling iron for more hold. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> FAKE NOT ORIGINAL, i hope they will return money</li>
            <li> Works like charm! Best investment I ever made!</li>

            <li> This product does not work. Period.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It truly is a Miracurl!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product. I have short hair, and I still have to use very small sections to get it to curl. Too much hair, and it won&#x27;t curl. Also, it is rather heavy. It is difficult to hold my arm over my head for extended amounts of time (I have short hair, but a lot of it), and so I always get very tired by the time I finish my hair. However, the results are beautiful. I love the curls I get from this. I&#x27;m not good with a curling iron because I always accidentally crimp the ends of my hair. This eliminates the problems that come with a curling iron, but also comes with a different set of problems. I would buy this again, but I feel like there is probably still a better product out there.</li>
            <li> Love this. I stink at doing hair and now j look like a pro.</li>
            <li> It was not clear to me that the product was not bi-volt.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, arrived ahead of schedule!!! I tried it out first thing and it&#x27;s is really cool. I can&#x27;t wait to fix my daughters hair. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Was great! Just what my mother in law wanted!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. She said it is one of the best product that she had in her life.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money!!!  I have long, fine hair and I have never had any luck getting it to hold a curl.  I can spend an hour with a curling iron and in less than 20 mins. the curls will fall out.  I have only used my MiraCurl twice (just got it yesterday) but I will say it is FABULOUS!  It is extremely important to follow the instruction though.  Be sure to start close to your scalp about 3 inches out or however far down you want to start curling (DO NOT START FROM THE BOTTOM, I MADE THAT ERROR INITIALLY).  And have the Miracurl in the correct direction so  that the circular side is facing your scalp.  Lastly, do not put too much hair in at one time.  Otherwise I would say it works exactly like it&#x27;s suppose to.  I slept on it and still had gorgous curls when I woke up this morning :D</li>
            <li> OMG! This has to be one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I confess I&#x27;m not a frequent reviewer, nonetheless, I am a frequent user of reviews... Such a bad habit!!! I know. So, I decided I&#x27;d start reviewing at least the either sooo good or sooo terrible products. Well, this was definitely the first case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty good hand when it comes to esthetics: makeup, hair, wax... everything! I just love it! Curls however have always been a challenge! I&#x27;ve had curling irons from different sizes and brands, and I&#x27;ve gotten better, but my curls never got salon-looking. So every time I saw somebody with perfect curls/waves in a regular day (like they did it by themselves) I felt like a dumb! There&#x27;s no way I can&#x27;t learn how to do this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this machine, which was also fully recommended by my beauty-stylist and decided to try it despite of what I consider a pricey tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the machine two days ago, and god! I&#x27;ve become addicted. Curls are not only PERFECT but super long lasting!!! My hair does not use to stay curled, because is too thin and straight. But with the Miracurl (which is an actual miracle) it stayed from 9 to 9! That&#x27;s 12 hrs of perfection! I&#x27;m just amazed! Even at 9 PM it was way more wavy than in regular basis (when doing it by any other method),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve had three days of perfect Barbie hair. Everybody (included my husbie) has to do with it, I get compliments everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing you have to do is READ the directions carefully, they&#x27;re not that long, and help a lot! Specifically the three faces brochure that explains how to get every style successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Can I give more than 5 stars?  This curling iron is amazing!  I did some research and mine is the real deal. I have very long VERY straight blonde hair.  It does NOT hold curl for more than 5 minutes, until I bought this!  Not only does it curl, it is fast (I can do thick waist length hair in under 30 mins) and lasts for days!  Best hair tool I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Love it...</li>
            <li> This product works great! I have every think hair so takes a while to curl, but results are nice.</li>
            <li> Works great, faster than using a regular curling iron because my hair is so thick.&lt;br /&gt;Curl holds really well.</li>
            <li> Couple things:  First, if you&#x27;re afraid of getting a &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34;, review the sellers and purchase from another seller.  Second....this tool is AMAZING!  I studied the directions carefully and did exactly what they instructed me to do.  Oh my gosh, I ended up with curls all over my head in a short period of time and I have long hair!!!  This is going to save me a TON of time getting curls in my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model does not let your locks tangle......it has a warning beep if you put too much hair in or you&#x27;re approaching a tangle.  It beeps and stops, which is telling you to use less hair or comb thoroughly before trying again.  I became proficient at using it after about 5 curls.  It also takes away the frizz.  The curls were so tight that I brushed out my hair and went to bed, because I wanted to see how well they held the next morning.  Upon waking, the curls had relaxed a bit and I didn&#x27;t have to do anything except run a brush through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the time-saver I&#x27;ve been looking for!  Well worth the money spent!!</li>
            <li> I love the Babyliss Miracurl!! I can&#x27;t curl hair. I always mess it up, but this makes it perfect every time. I do wish you could put more than an inch of hair in the machine at a time.</li>
