            <li>This product works great!</li>
            <li>As a hairy woman, I am so happy.  </li>
            <li>Delivers great results</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Use sparingly and enjoy!!</li>
            <li>I am so so pleased with this product and will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li>I love Princereigns</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found Clearasil benzoyl peroxide creams coupled with Tend Skin to work better.</li>
            <li>To my great surprise and absolute relief, it works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product is better than using nothing, but it has not met my expectations.</li>
            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>Prince Reigns is way better.</li>
            <li>It feels great going on the skin, but I really couldn&#x27;t tell that it made any difference for me.</li>
            <li>I found that it worked fine, but one ingrown hair I&#x27;ve had for months is still around and after two months of using it</li>
            <li>It is a smooth gel serum, no odor, goes on light and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>ok, you get what you pay for right,</li>
            <li>Definitly didn&#x27;t smell like the original serum.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews and maybe it works better for some than others, but for the first week it seemed like it had cleared up some darker spots from the razor-bumps  or may be</li>
            <li>It does have a pleasant smell, however I like seeing results sooner than later.</li>
            <li>I love it, I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>It does a good job, still evaluating it, so far it very good, it goes a long way, been using it twice daily, and some ingrown problems have stopped.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is, it looks pretty.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product about a year ago when it was referred to me by my aesthetician during a waxing visit.</li>
            <li>I have pretty severe ingrowns all over my legs</li>
            <li>This product really works for me.</li>
            <li>Price is way too high for quality!</li>
            <li>Started to use this product the ingrown hairs stopped, it doesn&#x27;t stop the hair growing, it makes the hair stand up straight instead of curling inward.  </li>
            <li>All in all I don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>right, Ive tried Magic shave, tend skin and a few other crappy cheap products and when i saw this and</li>
            <li>Bought it from this company and  when I opened it, it was more than half gone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for ingrown hair issues or after-shave \\&quot;itches\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The product also looked very light green</li>
            <li>(And yuck.)&lt;br /&gt;Try a new deodorant, new razor, new shaving routine?  </li>
            <li>I feel like it does lighten the hair bump scars a bit, but I am not sure if I like it better than Tend Skin.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars, is because the product shoots out when you press down on the pump, so it gives you more than you need.</li>
            <li>The product was way too expensive to not have any kind of positive effect.</li>
            <li>It is definitely allergy friendly to those who are limited to products that you put on your skin.</li>
            <li>Likely to last a while because less is more in the case of application.</li>
            <li>The thing you press to get the stuff out is extremely sensitive so it squirts out a whole pump even if you just need a little drop.</li>
            <li>but the hair is no long curled up in a bump that I have to dig out!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> This is so similar to another one (the European wax center&#x27;s brand) that I already had in my house.</li>
            <li> Let me start with saying that I&#x27;ve tried it all, I&#x27;ve had problems with ingrowns hairs in my pubic area for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wear it as often as the bottle recommends, I only put it on once a day or every other day</li>
            <li> I used to have dark blemishes from when i picked at my scabs and such and those went away in about a week or 2</li>
            <li> and I did notice a lightening of dark spots on my skin after several uses.</li>
            <li> The bottle it came in was taller than I expected.</li>
            <li> so i spent the money and thank god i did.</li>
            <li> After reading great reviews for this, I bought it hoping it would finally help my awful ingrown issues all over the bikini area (I epilate, and lately have fallen off my exfoliating routine).  </li>
            <li> I had dark, brown ingrown hair scars on my stomach for years.</li>
            <li> The spots used to be dark and now, they are grayish.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> They leave dark marks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 days, and already the ingrown hairs are coming out, and the dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> Also fades dark area.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I now MUST have this product at all times.</li>
            <li> I like the product, however I think it takes at least a month before you actually see results  </li>
            <li> Feels soothing but dries a little sticky.</li>
            <li> Helps little by little</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the money I wasted on this nonsense.</li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs in the bikini area actually got worse.</li>
            <li> I get waxed and was continually suffering from ingrowns that became pretty painful, so</li>
            <li> Within a few days the pain had receded and the ingrown and decreased in size.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have been plagued with horrible ingrown hairs in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> do not even use it every day, I have used it approximately 3-5 times and that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I seriously recommend it to anyone who suffers from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I had some weird razor rash for about a month on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> morning and night I got two MASSIVE horrible ingrowns.</li>
            <li> It was absolutely infuriating and nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop shaving?  </li>
            <li> It is sticky smells bad and as I said IT DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> , they get infected, it&#x27;s awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This stuff is amazing! I get waxed and was continually suffering from ingrowns that became pretty painful, so I read the reviews for this product and decided to give it a shot - and it works! Within a few days the pain had receded and the ingrown and decreased in size. I don&#x27;t even wear it as often as the bottle recommends, I only put it on once a day or every other day and it still keeps the ingrowns away! I am so so pleased with this product and will continue to buy more. If you suffer from ingrowns you should try this stuff!</li>
            <li> The bottle it came in was taller than I expected. I had dark, brown ingrown hair scars on my stomach for years. After using it for two weeks after every shower and in the afternoon, the spots have been lighter and my stomach has been smoother. The spots used to be dark and now, they are grayish. They are disappearing! I use it on my legs, too. My legs are smoother. After three weeks use, I need to buy another bottle, however. This depends on how severe your ingrown hairs are, I guess. I love Princereigns and I seriously recommend it to anyone who suffers from ingrown hairs. Imagine how they&#x27;ll look after another three weeks of continuous use.</li>
            <li> I had some weird razor rash for about a month on my underarms.  It was absolutely infuriating and nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop shaving?  Nope, worse.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wear deodorant for awhile?  Nope, no change.  (And yuck.)&lt;br /&gt;Try a new deodorant, new razor, new shaving routine?  Nope.  No change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at a loss.  I decided to try this on a whim.  It took around 2 weeks of daily application for it to work, but FINALLY the razor burn is GONE.</li>
            <li> These guys are the innovators and started this concept in Brazil so I thought Hey give it a try right, Ive tried Magic shave, tend skin and a few other crappy cheap products and when i saw this and the price i was like ok, you get what you pay for right, so i spent the money and thank god i did. My bumps went away in 2 days and ive never had an ingrown since. I used to have dark blemishes from when i picked at my scabs and such and those went away in about a week or 2 so I cant complain. In this intsance you def get what you pay for. 10 stars Awesome</li>
            <li> I first tried this product about a year ago when it was referred to me by my aesthetician during a waxing visit. I told her about my problems with ingrown hairs and discoloration of my underarms. This product has helped with those issues. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. This is so similar to another one (the European wax center&#x27;s brand) that I already had in my house. I can&#x27;t believe the money I wasted on this nonsense.</li>
            <li> It does a good job, still evaluating it, so far it very good, it goes a long way, been using it twice daily, and some ingrown problems have stopped.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have been plagued with horrible ingrown hairs in the bikini area. They leave dark marks, they get infected, it&#x27;s awful. I needed to find something without salicylic acid. This product really works for me. It&#x27;s been 3 days, and already the ingrown hairs are coming out, and the dark spots are fading. The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars, is because the product shoots out when you press down on the pump, so it gives you more than you need.</li>
            <li> Feels soothing but dries a little sticky. No visible results with repeated use, however. I have pretty severe ingrowns all over my legs and I&#x27;ve found Clearasil benzoyl peroxide creams coupled with Tend Skin to work better.</li>
            <li> After reading great reviews for this, I bought it hoping it would finally help my awful ingrown issues all over the bikini area (I epilate, and lately have fallen off my exfoliating routine).  To my great surprise and absolute relief, it works.  IT WORKS.  It literally makes ingrowns resurface.  Started noticing it working after about a week of use morning and night after showering/epilating.  My bikini line looks so much better - fewer bumps, fewer marks from past battles with ingrowns, few ingrowns themselves!  As a hairy woman, I am so happy.  I love it, I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Let me start with saying that I&#x27;ve tried it all, I&#x27;ve had problems with ingrowns hairs in my pubic area for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve stopped shaving and only wax or get sugared. The lady who sold me on this product made it seem like it would be a miracle worker. I found that it worked fine, but one ingrown hair I&#x27;ve had for months is still around and after two months of using it morning and night I got two MASSIVE horrible ingrowns. I&#x27;m sure this product is better than using nothing, but it has not met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed that I have not had one ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have had hair grow but the hair is no long curled up in a bump that I have to dig out!&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff it is WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;I also gave my son in law one and I have yet to ask him how it is working.&lt;br /&gt;I do not even use it every day, I have used it approximately 3-5 times and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Princereigns for helping me with this severe problem!!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great! It is definitely allergy friendly to those who are limited to products that you put on your skin. I highly recommend this product for ingrown hair issues or after-shave \\&quot;itches\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Product did not work as described.  Price is way too high for quality!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. Can&#x27;t complain! Likely to last a while because less is more in the case of application.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. It is sticky smells bad and as I said IT DOES NOT WORK. The only good thing is, it looks pretty.</li>
            <li> My personal experience, it does not work. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I recently read about this product and wanted to try it. Bought it from this company and  when I opened it, it was more than half gone. There was no leakage in the packaging so this leads me to believe someone bought it, used it and returned it, and the company did not check the package before reselling. The product also looked very light green so I opened it and smelled it. Definitly didn&#x27;t smell like the original serum. Thank goodness for amazon prime because they took it back and refunded me, no questions asked</li>
            <li> I always get 3 ingrown hairs in the same place, underneath my chin and they were always a BIG problem.  Started to use this product the ingrown hairs stopped, it doesn&#x27;t stop the hair growing, it makes the hair stand up straight instead of curling inward.  Also fades dark area.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all after a month of use. Ingrown hairs in the bikini area actually got worse. The product was way too expensive to not have any kind of positive effect.</li>
            <li> This product did none of the things it promised. It&#x27;s basically aloe and nothing else that matters. It didn&#x27;t help with any razor burn or any skin bumps even after weeks of continued used. The thing you press to get the stuff out is extremely sensitive so it squirts out a whole pump even if you just need a little drop. A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Item works just like it says it will on the packaging. It gets rid of in-growns and I did notice a lightening of dark spots on my skin after several uses. I have tried Tend Skin and it does not work for me at ALL. That and I couldn’t stand the horrendous smell. Prince Reigns is way better. It is a smooth gel serum, no odor, goes on light and gets the job done. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I am starting to shave against the hair now and not with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product. Delivers great results and it&#x27;s only been 2 days. My only complaint is I now MUST have this product at all times. Use sparingly and enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I like the product, however I think it takes at least a month before you actually see results  I feel like it does lighten the hair bump scars a bit, but I am not sure if I like it better than Tend Skin.  It does have a pleasant smell, however I like seeing results sooner than later.</li>
            <li> Helps little by little</li>
            <li> It feels great going on the skin, but I really couldn&#x27;t tell that it made any difference for me. I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and maybe it works better for some than others, but for the first week it seemed like it had cleared up some darker spots from the razor-bumps  or may be it was what I wanted to see. All in all I don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
