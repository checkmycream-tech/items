    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell and good for my skin.  Whitens?  Good enough!</li>
            <li> This soap really does work! I think it has kept me from getting tanner but I&#x27;m not sure about it physically whitening my skin. Beware that it does make you very dry and sensitive, sometimes itchy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a lot when I ordered but it is a good skin lightener....then why the 3 stars, I just want to brighten it.  But good when overexposed to the sun.  And it lighten my skin a shade and I want to maintain my color.</li>
            <li> I received this soap on March 18th and started using it that day. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with shipping and it came fast. The box it came in looked a little damaged but I did not mind at all. Just as long as the product inside wasn&#x27;t damage. I took the soap out of the box and it was in fine condition. I used the soap all over, (face, neck, body, etc.) After the first time of using the soap, I noticed that my skin was extremely soft. I also noticed that I did get a little itch afterward but I know that is from dry skin--it&#x27;s the 3rd day of me using it and I don&#x27;t feel that &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; anymore. (Btw, if you use it on your face, try not to get it in your eyes. Trust me, it will sting for a minute.) When you use the soap, it doesn&#x27;t take much because when you rub it on your skin, it will foam up a lot, so this soap should last you for a while. It also doesn&#x27;t melt as fast as regular soap and the smell isn&#x27;t strong at all. You&#x27;ll smell as small hint of papaya. After using it for 3 days now, my skin tone has become a little bit brighter (not as noticeable to anyone else but I can see the difference. I am African American and was a dark chocolate tone from spend too much time in the sun, had a few burn marks, acne (on my back) and scars here and there, but now I starting to turn a brownish color and the scars/burn marks/acne is starting to go away) clearer, and baby soft skin. Now, I must warn you. You have to use a lotion afterward taking a shower/bath or your skin will look dry and feel tight. (Especially the face) and I know, that a lot of people may not agree with my review but it&#x27;s different for many people and for me, this product is doing exactly what it was made to do, and I&#x27;m glad that I purchased it. I also purchased Mena and will see how well that skin cream and this soap will work together. Will buy more soap from you soon. ^ω^</li>
            <li> I love the soap, it&#x27;s a good one</li>
            <li> I have used the soap for about two weeks now.I have these very stubborn dark spots under my chin.I have not seen much difference.Am still believing that with time it might  work for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought this in hopes that it will lighten the dark spots on my face. After two months of using this, I have not noticed any difference. It initially burns, but the sensation goes away. You need to moisturize or your skin will dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a while now. I do see little difference my dark areas are brighter but it didn&#x27;t make my skin white like it claims I would give it 4 stars if the price wasn&#x27;t so much.. The price is high for the results it gives you.</li>
            <li> It met my expectation</li>
            <li> This soap is perfect .it make my skin so white .and i will buy it more and more.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I can&#x27;t stop ordering it. My mom even noticed the difference in my skin and I am a caramel brown. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product very good at making the skin feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li> It is a good soap notice my skin lighten a little with in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This soap is really good it lighten within seven days</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I had dark spot on my face. I used this soap together with other Glupa products, so far it improve the appearance of dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.....i ordered it on June 15th 2015 and received it on June 18th 2015. The soap came wrapped inside its box (as seen in my pic). I keep the bar in a soap traveling container so I&#x27;ll know my regular soap from this one. I love the smell, which isnt strong just faint fruity smell, so I use it in the am, sometimes in the afternoon( when I&#x27;m bored or hot from the summer heat),  and when I shower just before bed...pm (mainly 2 times a day). With each use...I use sunblock even if I don&#x27;t go outdoor except at night as I&#x27;m going to sleep and the sun has gone.</li>
            <li> I  enjoy &amp;#34;my skin whitening soap&amp;#34; because.it make my skin looks  clean  and clear.The delivery was fast and  promply.Glad I bought them from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Using this as a body soap so far so good had 2 bars and my skin went to medium to light medium..#asian#make sure to wear sunscreen and apply every two hours if your going outside.. Will buy another one.. Great product.. Thanks..</li>
