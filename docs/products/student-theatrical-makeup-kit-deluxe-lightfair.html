            <li>very cool for 11yo going into some theatre stuff as well as Halloween.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product, but you guys really need to make sure you put all the things you say that are included with the package in it because I didn&#x60;t get some of the items that it said I would get.</li>

            <li>We were very surprised and pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>very good choice for someone needing to establish a basic set of essential makeup for the stage.</li>
            <li>The kit itself seems okay for a beginner, even if a lot of the stuff is cheaply made, but they did not seal up the spirit gum remover, and they did not seal the bag around the spirit gum remover, so when the kit arrived in its plastic zippered pouch, the entire contents had been lubricated by the stuff.</li>
            <li>but he still loved the time spent with his sister</li>
            <li>She loves this kit and has had so much fun making everyone up including herself, and she has learned a lot.  </li>

            <li>With this kit, although not every color in the rainbow is included, most basic needs are met.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>And comes with so much stuff!  </li>
            <li>that is exactly what we needed for the show.  </li>
            <li>This kit had exactly what my daughter needed to take to theatre school and was a much better value than other kits we looked at online</li>
            <li>i really dont want to be there</li>
            <li>seems like a decent kit, but the price seemed way too high for what was in the kit.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my high school theater student</li>
            <li>well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 12 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I suspected this was old stock as some if the product was cracked.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice kit and it pretty handy. However, how can they give the wax but no latex or wax sealer? I don&#x27;t needed two big containers of remover. Wax sealer would&#x27;ve been nice.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 12 year old daughter. She loves it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my high school theater student and she said it has everything she needs!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, and ended up being bitterly disappointed. The kit itself seems okay for a beginner, even if a lot of the stuff is cheaply made, but they did not seal up the spirit gum remover, and they did not seal the bag around the spirit gum remover, so when the kit arrived in its plastic zippered pouch, the entire contents had been lubricated by the stuff. I needed her gift, so I cleaned everything as best I could, but trying to grab those oily jars and containers was like trying to grab flopping fish. Everything was slipping around. I will not buy from this place again.</li>
            <li> I have not look for kit in awhile and this one is very good and serve the purchase for the use it made for.</li>
            <li> the kit was perfect and these guys are fabulous!  they went out of their way to make sure i got this kit in time for a makeup job and were super nice, fast, and great to deal with.  love the product and the company!</li>

            <li> This kit included everything to get you started on makeup-- except for liquid latex and instructions. I needed to look up videos on youtube on how to use the makeup. You have to buy liquid latex seprately. You don&#x27;t have to, but it is less sticky and easier to use than modeling wax. Although, the kit is fairly priced and I would consider the makeup good quality.</li>
            <li> love this kit! perfect for the once in a while make up zombie project. my skin is super sensitive and breaks out easily. This product was great on my skin! No breakouts and no stinging!</li>
            <li> Great quality kit. We were very surprised and pleased with the result. Wore it for 5 hours...no dripping smearing or other issues.</li>
            <li> seems like a decent kit, but the price seemed way too high for what was in the kit.Will work for what we need though</li>
            <li> Love the make up, thanks!</li>
            <li> My daughter does 4-6 shows a year, and is always needing something. With this kit, although not every color in the rainbow is included, most basic needs are met.&lt;br /&gt;A very good choice for someone needing to establish a basic set of essential makeup for the stage.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, who&#x27;s a theater major in college.  It&#x27;s perfect for her.</li>
            <li> Really great set!  And comes with so much stuff!  Great pigments and everything was in it that was suppose to be. Would buy frim them again</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter starting in Theatre.  Everything looked great. The spirit oil did leak a little, but it was in a separate baggy.</li>
            <li> I have a very happy granddaughter.  She just loves her makeup kit.  Especially likes walking around with &amp;#34;one tooth&amp;#34; missing.  Delivery was timely.  Product a little pricey, but she&#x27;s lovin&#x27; it.</li>
            <li> Literally everything you could ever need with great quality!</li>
            <li> I suspected this was old stock as some if the product was cracked.  I used it anyway, and it worked just fine. You cannot beat the quality for the price!</li>
            <li> now I am anxious to use it</li>
            <li> very cool for 11yo going into some theatre stuff as well as Halloween.  of course my 4yo boy will never be the same now but he still loved the time spent with his sister</li>
            <li> This kit had exactly what my daughter needed to take to theatre school and was a much better value than other kits we looked at online</li>
            <li> A gift for my granddaughter, who is in theatre.  She loves this kit and has had so much fun making everyone up including herself, and she has learned a lot.  Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> Professional grade make-up that is exactly what we needed for the show.  This is an excellent product and well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> alwsome for a unigue person in mind. instantly went through the instructions looking for all those tips.need some practice,  i really dont want to be there but if i must.</li>
