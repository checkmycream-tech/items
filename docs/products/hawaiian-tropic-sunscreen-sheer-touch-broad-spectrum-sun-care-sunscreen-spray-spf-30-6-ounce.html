    <ol>
            <li>BEST spray sunscreen we&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead with very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and does a great job protecting the kids from the rays of the sun.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, feels awesome on your skin, the SCENT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best.. smells good and isn&#x27;t sticky</li>
            <li>Smells really good, and works was out in the sun for 4hrs</li>
            <li>If you wait the required time it works really good.</li>
            <li>I had always had problems finding a good sun protector.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, pleasant scent!</li>
            <li>and no burn just nice tan.</li>
            <li>Keeps me from getting a burn, smells nice.</li>
            <li>so I can enjoy the nice smell of coconut and flowers again.</li>
            <li>Island Sport version gave us better protection than this.</li>
            <li>After my latest trip to the Florida Keys, take this from me...</li>
            <li>favorite sunscreen ever.</li>
            <li>love the smell of this over any other sunscreen, has a tropical scent and the mist/areosol is great, but don&#x27;t forget to rub it in!  </li>
            <li>I was eager to try their local product, where else should they know more about sun protection than this beautiful area.  </li>
            <li>After three days in the direct sunlight, I wasn&#x27;t sunburned and felt great.</li>
            <li>I love it so much and have purchased it many many times.</li>
            <li>Reapply every hour and you should be fine in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beach bum and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Instead, it has a non-offensive mild coconut scent.</li>
            <li>I had to go to a grocery shop many miles from the resort to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t have that powerful chemical smell that coppertone and others have that screams \\&quot;I&#x27;m going to the beach!!!\\&quot; to everyone in your vicinity.</li>
            <li>This goes on more smoothly than the other sprays I&#x27;ve tried, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It should absolutely have lasted longer if the bottle was full?</li>
            <li>Special price for a normal sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Not only after several minutes does the smell turn somewhat pleasant.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is your typical light-skinned/freckled fair hair sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sprays well to the very end.</li>
            <li>i had thrown away all of the shipping stuff and figured i couldnt return or get a refund after the safety wrap was off.  very disapponted.</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t find that it covered very well...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the alcohol used in this Hawaiian Tropic spray overpowers the beautiful scent.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, I like the sheer touch aspect because it isn&#x27;t nearly as sticky and slimy as other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>and we live at the lake all summer!</li>
            <li>The actual sheer touch lotion is even better, but the spray on is so convenient that it works for me.</li>
            <li>So I have a child who will not use the other traditional kind of sustain lotion.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok, but not fantastic.</li>
            <li>I recently took a cruise on the surface of Mercury and needed some decent sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>and I generally use this spray for my shoulders and back.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, the alcohol used in this Hawaiian Tropic spray overpowers the beautiful scent.  Next time I&#x27;ll buy the lotion so I can enjoy the nice smell of coconut and flowers again.</li>

            <li> This smells DEVINE!!!! I love it so much and have purchased it many many times. I&#x27;m a beach bum and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Also,my he mist doesn&#x27;t gunk up like some of the aerosols do and quit spraying. It&#x27;s sprays well to the very end.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, and works was out in the sun for 4hrs + and no burn just nice tan. Will be buying this from now on</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after I took the safety wrapping off the sunscreen, unlocked the nozzle and pressed the spray button nothing dispensed.  There did not seem to be any pressure in the can at all.  i had thrown away all of the shipping stuff and figured i couldnt return or get a refund after the safety wrap was off.  very disapponted.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t find that it covered very well... For some reason the SPF 15 Island Sport version gave us better protection than this.</li>
            <li> Keeps me from getting a burn, smells nice.</li>
            <li> Arrived and the sun tan lotion was leaking out of the can.</li>
            <li> and an added use: I recently travelled without aromas; I used a spray here and a spray there of Hawaiian Tropic and it doubled as an air freshener</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with very fair skin.  I&#x27;ve tried every sunscreen you can think of. After my latest trip to the Florida Keys, take this from me... THIS STUFF IS MONEY! Not greasy, feels awesome on your skin, the SCENT IS AMAZING! Try this once and you won&#x27;t want to go back to your generic brand.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t burn when wearing it. The smell is ok, but not fantastic. For the price, store brand cheapo stuff works just as well. Special price for a normal sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I went to an isolated island in the Caribbean. I used this product one time and it didn&#x27;t work anymore. It was like an empty bottle. I had to go to a grocery shop many miles from the resort to get a new one. Don&#x27;t buy it. You will waste your money.</li>
            <li> The smell of this sunscreen brings me back to my childhood.  It smells wonderful and does a great job protecting the kids from the rays of the sun.  Especially like that its spray on and I don&#x27;t have to get my hands all greasy rubbing sunscreen all over everyone before slipping and sliding into the pool with greasy hands.  Hardest part is having the kids wait the required time before jumping into the pool and washing it off.  If you wait the required time it works really good.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, pleasant scent!</li>
            <li> My complexion is your typical light-skinned/freckled fair hair sensitive to the sun.  I had always had problems finding a good sun protector.  Then on a vacation trip to Hawaii I was eager to try their local product, where else should they know more about sun protection than this beautiful area.  Because of its effectiveness on me from that point on I was sold on the Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen in any way shape or form.</li>
            <li> My husband got about 3 used out of this before it was empty. Disappointed as we love the spray. It should absolutely have lasted longer if the bottle was full?</li>
            <li> I recently took a cruise on the surface of Mercury and needed some decent sunscreen.  I like coconut smell to be tropical, and I like a locking spray cap like this one has.  After three days in the direct sunlight, I wasn&#x27;t sunburned and felt great.</li>
            <li> BEST spray sunscreen we&#x27;ve found and we live at the lake all summer! It&#x27;s not greasy and I apply it once and not again the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.. smells good and isn&#x27;t sticky</li>
            <li> I use sunscreen every day (don&#x27;t know how this would be on the beach). This goes on more smoothly than the other sprays I&#x27;ve tried, and dries quickly. Scent is subtle or none - not a problem.</li>
            <li> So I have a child who will not use the other traditional kind of sustain lotion.  The sprays work.  I thought this would have a tropical smell.  Not only after several minutes does the smell turn somewhat pleasant.  But in the meantime kids are coughing and gagging on smell.  But it does prevent burn and protect their skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big Hawaiian Tropic fan and I generally use this spray for my shoulders and back.  It goes on evenly and isn&#x27;t too sticky.  Reapply every hour and you should be fine in the sun.  The reason that it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.  That&#x27;s why I use the lotion for the rest of my body and face.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this over any other sunscreen, has a tropical scent and the mist/areosol is great, but don&#x27;t forget to rub it in!  favorite sunscreen ever.</li>
    </ol>
