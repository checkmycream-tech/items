    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This has been the best mascara I have used.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews and that&#x27;s what pushed me to go for it and spend the $30, but let me tell you this mascara is SOOO wonderful.</li>
            <li>Still cant find the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li>The best mascara I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>* Beautiful metallic gold tube that your friends will try to steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is the BEST looking mascara if you blot it and do one coat.</li>
            <li>Best on the market in my opinion and love the tie dye nail polish if I could find it.  </li>
            <li>Better to buy the one that works best for me instead of wasting my money on something I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I truly loved how this mascara went on, and how it looked-</li>
            <li>* Gives lashes that gorgeous “falsies” effect.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I even tried talking myself into keeping this for just nights out, but if you are dancing, or going to be somewhere warm, forget it.</li>
            <li>Nice lash builder without clumping.</li>
            <li>Best thing is that your lashes stay soft.  </li>
            <li>It delivers everything I was hoping for, and also smells pretty great which is an added bonus for me while applying it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am easily able to remove it</li>
            <li>Otherwise, grocery-store stuff is better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter loves it always sold out.</li>
            <li>This mascara was okay.</li>
            <li>I think I would be more accepting of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I tried it</li>
            <li>I mention that the metallic gold tube is absolutely stunning?</li>
            <li>Last note, Trish McEvoy lash curling mascara is very good if you blot and do 2 coats-</li>
            <li>The application is smooth and it does not clump no matter how many layers are used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The nylon fiber brush is extremely easy to use, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the top department store mascaras and this isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>* Remastered formula glides on smooth from root to</li>
            <li>However, there is a waterproof version available online for anyone that’s interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, there is a waterproof version available online for anyone that’s interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It’s so classy and elegant!</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re having a portrait shot (or something) and would cautiously recommend it if you&#x27;re dropping by a special event for an hour or two.</li>
            <li>Anyway, dont love the price, but i have to use four times as much of the drugstore brand to even come close to this, so it&#x27;s even.</li>
            <li>It really lengthened my lashes a lot more</li>
            <li>Not only does it add maximum volume and length that gives my lashes that gorgeous “falsies” effect, it also strengthens and protects by coating each lash with B5 Pro-Vitamin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could see maybe paying $15 or even $20, but for $30 it better be coated with real gold.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell and light texture but it didn&#x27;t make a big change to my lashes.</li>
            <li>* Nylon fiber brush is easy to use and very versatile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I use Nars eye makeup remover (blue and clear kind that you shake, love it).</li>
            <li>It is worth the cost, but not at $47, get it for $30.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>It wont flake off and it really makes lashes look full.</li>
            <li>The new and improved remastered formula glides on smooth from root to tip - no clumping and no flaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found my favorite so far, Benefit they&#x27;re Real.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done but nothing fancy, your better off buying a volumizing mascara at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>Versatile enough to apply the product to both top and bottom lashes without smudging.</li>
            <li>I must admit, this YSL mascara was my first &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I had some pretty high expectations.</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara that gives you a lot with only a few coats.</li>
            <li>Give it an hour or two, though, and it&#x27;s straight to the heroin-chic, \\&quot;Are you OK?\\</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot but not for the price.</li>
            <li>I really hoped to like this</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t relatively expensive one it would be a good option fo light make up</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products because of the cost of this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, if you can afford it.es was not waterproof.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, if you can afford it.</li>
            <li>it goes on thick, it also combs your lashes quite nicely.</li>
            <li>It will not give loads of volume though, but very natural looking-</li>
            <li>As far as the raccoon eyes another person mentioned, I haven&#x27;t had that experience.</li>
            <li>I only apply 1 coat and it&#x27;s more than enough, leaving them like fake eyelashes.. :)</li>
            <li>It is a great pity Dior has not fixed this or added a small water resistant element to the formula..</li>
            <li>Truly, no other brand works this well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, my roommate as well as a very sweet boyfriend finally suggested I stop using YSL mascara - in separate conversations - because at first glance, they thought something was physically WRONG.</li>
            <li>I was VERY upset that I spent $30 for mascara and can not use it.</li>
            <li>Whenever I whip this little beauty out in public for a quick touch up, I get nothing but envious “oohs” and “aahs” from the ladies around me.</li>
            <li>I could easily envision black streaks running down my face..</li>
            <li>Most other mascaras make your lashes hard like spikes.  </li>
            <li>But the mascara was old and DRY.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;m a huge fan now!</li>

            <li> I wanted waterproof that wouldn&#x27;t flake off during the day, something that would make my lashes pop a bit more, and I wanted a thin brush because I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble with the thicker wands on some department store mascaras.</li>

            <li> Some people complain that it&#x27;s clumpy, but this brand isnt for a clean look, it&#x27;s for a false lash effect!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this mascara for ages and I finally broke down and tried it.</li>
            <li> First, some credit where it&#x27;s due: When you apply this product, it looks TV-good - you&#x27;ll seem to be wearing modest artificial eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I use fake lashes to give extra volume to my lashes but sometimes it&#x27;s just too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> and I wish the black was darker or that they had another dark black version.</li>
            <li> And there were still black smudges under my eyes.</li>
            <li> So basically I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I received my YSL Mascara Volume Effet Faux Cils from Influenster and Yves Saint Laurent Fragrances &amp; Beauty a few days ago</li>
            <li> I usually buy Yves Saint Laurent mascara all the time.</li>
            <li> I was not able to use it.</li>
            <li> I usually get.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that comes close to the results i get with the fake lashes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I received a bad tube or an old tube?</li>
            <li> It goes on thick (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, if you&#x27;re not do NOT purchase this!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was the most shocking part, how one coat could produce so much black!!!!</li>
            <li> What I usually do and recommend before making an expensive purchase</li>
            <li> This tube is going back tomorrow :(</li>
            <li> Your lashes look like false lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I was NOT happy with this mascara purchase.</li>
            <li> The bad news is yes it really does smudge terribly.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s way too expensive.</li>
            <li> * Too expensive.</li>
            <li> This was awful to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the price for this mascara is simply outrageous!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I swear by this mascara. The application is smooth and it does not clump no matter how many layers are used. It is expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara that gives you a lot with only a few coats. It is only $30 at other stores, so I don&#x27;t know why one would pay $47 here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am easily able to remove it but I use Nars eye makeup remover (blue and clear kind that you shake, love it). As far as the raccoon eyes another person mentioned, I haven&#x27;t had that experience. This has been the best mascara I have used. It is worth the cost, but not at $47, get it for $30.</li>

But the mascara was old and DRY. I was not able to use it. I was VERY upset that I spent $30 for mascara and can not use it. I am going to try to return this. This was awful to me.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews and that&#x27;s what pushed me to go for it and spend the $30, but let me tell you this mascara is SOOO wonderful. It goes on thick (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, if you&#x27;re not do NOT purchase this!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it goes on thick, it also combs your lashes quite nicely. I can&#x27;t stop raving about it. I only apply 1 coat and it&#x27;s more than enough, leaving them like fake eyelashes.. :)</li>
            <li> First, some credit where it&#x27;s due: When you apply this product, it looks TV-good - you&#x27;ll seem to be wearing modest artificial eyelashes. Give it an hour or two, though, and it&#x27;s straight to the heroin-chic, \\&quot;Are you OK?\\&quot; sort of look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my roommate as well as a very sweet boyfriend finally suggested I stop using YSL mascara - in separate conversations - because at first glance, they thought something was physically WRONG. Ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An exception: I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re having a portrait shot (or something) and would cautiously recommend it if you&#x27;re dropping by a special event for an hour or two. Otherwise, grocery-store stuff is better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different from the Dior mascara I usually get. This doesn&#x27;t come close to the quality of Dior. It gets the job done but nothing fancy, your better off buying a volumizing mascara at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. It&#x27;s my favorite. No clumps.</li>
            <li> I use fake lashes to give extra volume to my lashes but sometimes it&#x27;s just too much of a hassle. This is the only mascara that comes close to the results i get with the fake lashes. Truly, no other brand works this well.

Anyway, dont love the price, but i have to use four times as much of the drugstore brand to even come close to this, so it&#x27;s even.</li>
            <li> I truly loved how this mascara went on, and how it looked- While it lasted....Honestly, this is the BEST looking mascara if you blot it and do one coat. I was shocked at how amazing my lashes looked... The bad news is yes it really does smudge terribly. I even tried talking myself into keeping this for just nights out, but if you are dancing, or going to be somewhere warm, forget it. I could easily envision black streaks running down my face.. I say that because it is a nightmare to take off. I am talking 4-5+ eye make up remover pads (PER EYE ladies), plus washing my face and sudsing my lids 2- 3 times. And there were still black smudges under my eyes. That was the most shocking part, how one coat could produce so much black!!!! It is a great pity Dior has not fixed this or added a small water resistant element to the formula..What I usually do and recommend before making an expensive purchase : Go to the make up counter, with out mascara, try 2 types, one on each eye. Wear for the day and see how it comes off... This tube is going back tomorrow :( Last note, Trish McEvoy lash curling mascara is very good if you blot and do 2 coats- no smudging or flaking and washes off like a dream...It will not give loads of volume though, but very natural looking-</li>
            <li> I have tried practically every brand of mascara on the market and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Only use YSL mascara and lip stain.  Best on the market in my opinion and love the tie dye nail polish if I could find it.  My grand daughter loves it always sold out.</li>
            <li> This mascara was okay. I liked the smell and light texture but it didn&#x27;t make a big change to my lashes. If it wasn&#x27;t relatively expensive one it would be a good option fo light make up</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this mascara for ages and I finally broke down and tried it. I really like it a lot but not for the price. If it was $18-21 I think I would be more accepting of it. It really lengthened my lashes a lot more then I was expecting. I didn&#x27;t like how fast that it dried and I wish the black was darker or that they had another dark black version. I&#x27;m glad that I tried it but I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Nice lash builder without clumping. Doesn&#x27;t last too long though.  It wont flake off and it really makes lashes look full.</li>
            <li> It did not do what it promise. Still cant find the perfect mascara. I&#x27;ll keep looking, maybe Dior will have the answer ??</li>
            <li> I really hoped to like this but it is just o.k. I&#x27;ve tried all the top department store mascaras and this isn&#x27;t anything special. This is over $30.00 and it doesn&#x27;t compete with Lancôme or Dior. I have found my favorite so far, Benefit they&#x27;re Real. It makes lashes super long and thick.</li>
            <li> The best mascara I have ever used.  Your lashes look like false lashes.  Best thing is that your lashes stay soft.  Most other mascaras make your lashes hard like spikes.  I have tried so many other products because of the cost of this product.  But, none that I have purchased work like this one.  So basically I wasted my money.  Better to buy the one that works best for me instead of wasting my money on something I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Yay! I received my YSL Mascara Volume Effet Faux Cils from Influenster and Yves Saint Laurent Fragrances &amp; Beauty a few days ago and I already adore it! Not only does it add maximum volume and length that gives my lashes that gorgeous “falsies” effect, it also strengthens and protects by coating each lash with B5 Pro-Vitamin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nylon fiber brush is extremely easy to use, too. Versatile enough to apply the product to both top and bottom lashes without smudging. The new and improved remastered formula glides on smooth from root to tip - no clumping and no flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that the metallic gold tube is absolutely stunning? It’s so classy and elegant! I’ve owned plenty of mascara brands in my life, but YSL is definitely #1 when it comes to pleasing packaging and presentation. Whenever I whip this little beauty out in public for a quick touch up, I get nothing but envious “oohs” and “aahs” from the ladies around me. I’ve even had girlfriends tell me to “Guard that tube with your life!” else they’ll be too tempted to steal it when I’m not looking. Of course, they were only kidding…or were they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the price for this mascara is simply outrageous! $30 for one 0.2 oz tube of product? Come on! That&#x27;s way too expensive. I could see maybe paying $15 or even $20, but for $30 it better be coated with real gold. Otherwise, I won&#x27;t be purchasing it on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Adds maximum volume and length.&lt;br /&gt;* Gives lashes that gorgeous “falsies” effect.&lt;br /&gt;* Strengthens and protects lashes with B5 Pro-Vitamin.&lt;br /&gt;* Nylon fiber brush is easy to use and very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;* Remastered formula glides on smooth from root to tip.&lt;br /&gt;* No clumping, smudging, or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;* Beautiful metallic gold tube that your friends will try to steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Too expensive. You get only 0.2 oz of product for $30.&lt;br /&gt;* The mascara I received for testing purposes was not waterproof. However, there is a waterproof version available online for anyone that’s interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I couldn’t be happier with the results. I feel like a glamorous movie star every time I wear this. Highly recommended, if you can afford it.es was not waterproof.

            <li> I must admit, this YSL mascara was my first &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; mascara purchase, so I had some pretty high expectations. I wanted waterproof that wouldn&#x27;t flake off during the day, something that would make my lashes pop a bit more, and I wanted a thin brush because I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble with the thicker wands on some department store mascaras. Well, after using this YSL mascara, I am in eyelash heaven! It delivers everything I was hoping for, and also smells pretty great which is an added bonus for me while applying it. Needless to say, I&#x27;m a huge fan now! Definitely worth the splurge.</li>
