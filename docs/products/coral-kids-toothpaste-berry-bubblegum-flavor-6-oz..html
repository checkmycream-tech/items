            <li>and I know this product is great for my kids.</li>
            <li>Taste is good.</li>
            <li>I credit this good fortune to Coral toothepaste.  </li>
            <li>That was a &#x27;good&#x27; change-up.  </li>
            <li>He swallows the paste a lot so having one with no fluoride or harmful chemicals in it is important to me :) try it!!!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is gentle, tastes great (wonderful fruity bubble gum flavor), and has no saccharine.</li>
            <li>Safe ingredients, cleans good and tastes great.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with the ingredients and this spares me from trying to make a safer toothpaste at home.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes great, the kids love it, and it remineralizes without added chemicals.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste and it&#x27;s ingredients!</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste - tastes good and doesn&#x27;t contain all the yucky ingredients I don&#x27;t want my child to have.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this toothpaste-I just started using it so time will tell about its true effectiveness-</li>
            <li>Safe ingredients</li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t have soy, and many toothpastes contain glycerine that is derived from soy.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s safe if swallowed.  </li>
            <li>We love Coral brand toothpaste because it&#x27;s fluoride AND glycerine free!</li>
            <li>Kids love it.  </li>
            <li>I love how this toothpaste cleans my children&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s fluoride-free, too.</li>
            <li>More like fruity mint with a chalky after  taste.</li>
            <li>My kids love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I got this stuff after reading more about the help concerns surrounding fluoride and even glycerine in toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>the response from my kids has been interesting - they love the flavor.  </li>
            <li>My kids LOVE this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>There is no way to effectively get toothpaste onto your toothbrush without smearing it on the cap and if you don&#x27;t sit there and clean it with a q-tip</li>
            <li>This is a great tooth paste because it is fluoride and glycerin free witch are two very harmful substances to your body and teeth.</li>
            <li>Lots of natural kids&#x27; toothpastes that are fluoride-free don&#x27;t do a great job of cleaning in my opinion ...</li>
            <li>My son who has intense sensory difficulties found no issue with the flavor or texture, which makes brushing more effective in his case.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the consistency issue and mess, I would give this 5 stars because the ingredients are AWESOME</li>
            <li>And it is fluoride free, so</li>
            <li>but this seems like a safer/healthier option to the kid toothpaste options available at the stores around me.</li>
            <li>But the good part of it was she had just started using Coral Kids toothepaste at the time, and knowing how she slips-in the sweets, I made sure she brushed her teeth every morning and night.  </li>
            <li>Their teeth are doing great, and I&#x27;m happy they are brushing like crazy and enjoying the process.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s favorite, and I love the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>Was surprised both of my boys liked it also, as they both have sensory issues and finding a flavor they like</li>
            <li>Just too many things, too fast and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fluoride free + keeps his teeth nice and white.</li>
            <li>At around $9 per tube, this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, but the list of ingredients is great - natural coral, xylitol, various herbs, silica.  </li>
            <li>He likes the taste and the colorful packaging.  </li>
            <li>Good Product, quality I expected.....</li>
            <li>no toxic fluoride, worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I had a nice visit at the dentist&#x27;s last week.</li>
            <li>Who am I to argue with success?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not to have them hiding from brushing, and just as importantly, they&#x27;ve developed the habit of doing it every morning and every evening - to me, the fact that this toothpaste has helped them develop that habit, without fights, is critical.  </li>
            <li>so I let them try the adult version which has a mild sweet mint flavor.</li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t like the flavor very much, but she will tolerate it.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer to use a fluoride free toothpaste for her as she is 5 years old.</li>
            <li>Safe for my 9 year old and 3 year old twins too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty certain you could mortar a brick house with this stuff.</li>
            <li>This seemed to be pretty decent toothpaste, but my kids didn&#x27;t really like it very much.  </li>
            <li>This time he said zilch, nada, nothing, and I was in and out in record time, and to be honest, I&#x27;m spending less time brushing and flossing than before.</li>
            <li>Who am I to argue with success?be honest, I&#x27;m spending less time brushing and flossing than before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>My kids have only ever used fluoride free toothpastes (ie the baby versions and spry kids, before I found out about Coral)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Used this since my 3 1/2 year old first had teeth.</li>
            <li>What I do know is that this toothpaste has no strange additives, and that every time I have contacted customer service I have received friendly and professional care.</li>
            <li>and she has super white teeth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended toothpaste, nothing compares to it that you will find on the shelf.</li>
            <li>Although I love this product, I was a little upset that it was shipped to me with some of the toothpaste all crusty around the edge.</li>
            <li>My son loves it and its all natural!  </li>
            <li>but we are sold on the adult stuff!</li>
            <li>this toothpaste is a huge mess maker.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be clear, I&#x27;ve changed a lot about my family&#x27;s oral care -</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be clear, I&#x27;ve changed a lot about my family&#x27;s oral care -</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this for my three year old since she started getting her teeth in.</li>
            <li>However.... I must say that I would like to see the formula improved somehow as far as consistency or the container/tube and cap needs to be modified.</li>
            <li>Of course, this wasn&#x27;t a problem after it dried on the crack because it pretty much sealed itself, cause like I said, this stuff turns to glue.</li>
            <li>My item arrived in fine condition and while it may be pricier than average toothpaste-this item has above average ingredients, which makes the money spent worth it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my young daughter was seeing him too and we lapsed 2 years before starting back in.  </li>
            <li>Helping him rebuild the enamel  on his little teeth and is working very well.</li>
            <li>My kids (4 and 7) are not messy wild little hellions</li>

            <li> My kids (4 and 7) are not messy wild little hellions</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive teeth due to eroded enamel).</li>
            <li> When my dentist of 25 years retired I was much too slow to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I think tastes good, but my kids hate it.</li>
            <li> Previous dental visits were about 1.5 hours long, or longer - this took all of 30 minutes, and that counts wait time prior to seeing anyone.  </li>
            <li> It does not wash down the sink so if there is even a tiny bit of it that hits the sink and hasn&#x27;t been dissolved, it sticks to the sink like glue.</li>
            <li> my kids&#x27; teeth look yellow after a few days.</li>
            <li> I wish they had other flavors too.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a toothpaste without all the junk that we actually like the taste of.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other toothpaste!</li>
            <li> But my last visit he groused about stains, (alleged) poor brushing and flossing, despite me using the fluoride toothpaste he recommended, flossing 2X/day, using a water pik, etc.</li>
            <li> I experimented over the past year with and without using this toothpaste, and for our family, the added bonus of clearing the mental fog has become invaluable.</li>
            <li> and although she had no complaints or toothe pains, I was afraid the new dentist would find a mouthful of cavities.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the coral calcium itself, but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> The dentist, who usually spends his time chastising me for not brushing and flossing, sort of poked around, said nothing, and sent me on my way.</li>
            <li> Eventually, this leads to the opening for the toothpaste to be so small that the kids need to apply a lot of pressure to get it out of the tube which resulted in our tube of toothpaste developing a crack and exploding.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 3 or 4 tubes of it in the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> Seriously, they fight to brush their teeth now.  </li>
            <li> Previously unheard of, given our dentist, who always manages to find something wrong and let us know about</li>
            <li> once a week, you can&#x27;t even get the cap to shut which makes the problem even worse because this stuff literally turns to glue when it dries.</li>
            <li> They spit it out.  :(</li>
            <li> At some point, even if they switch to another toothpaste (doubtful), the habit should continue since it&#x27;s automatic.  </li>
            <li> I was a really bad dad!  </li>
            <li> Kids hated the flavor.  </li>
            <li> my kids were disgusted with the flavor</li>
            <li> I have terribly picky kids though.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> my kids don&#x27;t like the flavor</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste - tastes good and doesn&#x27;t contain all the yucky ingredients I don&#x27;t want my child to have.  The best part - no cavities!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this toothpaste-I just started using it so time will tell about its true effectiveness-but I&#x27;m very pleased with the ingredients and this spares me from trying to make a safer toothpaste at home. My son who has intense sensory difficulties found no issue with the flavor or texture, which makes brushing more effective in his case. My item arrived in fine condition and while it may be pricier than average toothpaste-this item has above average ingredients, which makes the money spent worth it.</li>
            <li> My grandson loves the taste this tooth paste.  Helping him rebuild the enamel  on his little teeth and is working very well.</li>
            <li> Kids like this toothpaste.  Safe ingredients</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, who is still getting the hang of spitting out toothpaste.  He can&#x27;t have soy, and many toothpastes contain glycerine that is derived from soy.  This one doesn&#x27;t have soy!  And it is fluoride free, so it&#x27;s safe if swallowed.  He likes the taste and the colorful packaging.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Kids hated the flavor.  They spit it out.  :(</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for my three year old since she started getting her teeth in. She loves it!</li>
            <li> My son loves it and its all natural!  A win - win!</li>
            <li> An unexpected surprise is that this toothpaste provides mental clarity...no joke. I experimented over the past year with and without using this toothpaste, and for our family, the added bonus of clearing the mental fog has become invaluable. I think it&#x27;s the coral calcium itself, but I&#x27;m not sure. What I do know is that this toothpaste has no strange additives, and that every time I have contacted customer service I have received friendly and professional care. I highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t like the flavor very much, but she will tolerate it.  I still prefer to use a fluoride free toothpaste for her as she is 5 years old.</li>
            <li> We love Coral brand toothpaste because it&#x27;s fluoride AND glycerine free! My kids have only ever used fluoride free toothpastes (ie the baby versions and spry kids, before I found out about Coral) so they don&#x27;t know the difference with the frothing. Best ingredient list I&#x27;ve found aside from maybe making your own!</li>
            <li> My toddler loves it. Great ingredients. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I started using this toothpaste on the recommendation of my dental hygienist (I have sensitive teeth due to eroded enamel). This toothpaste is gentle, tastes great (wonderful fruity bubble gum flavor), and has no saccharine. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes great, the kids love it, and it remineralizes without added chemicals. I strongly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste and it&#x27;s ingredients! Was surprised both of my boys liked it also, as they both have sensory issues and finding a flavor they like has been a challenge.</li>
            <li> Good Product, quality I expected.....</li>
            <li> Used this since my 3 1/2 year old first had teeth. Only toothpaste she loves. She has never had a cavity and she has super white teeth.</li>
            <li> Kids love it.  Great toothpaste, great ingredients...no toxic fluoride, worth the price.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love how this toothpaste cleans my children&#x27;s teeth. We&#x27;ve had no cavities. I love that it&#x27;s fluoride-free, too. Lots of natural kids&#x27; toothpastes that are fluoride-free don&#x27;t do a great job of cleaning in my opinion ... my kids&#x27; teeth look yellow after a few days. Not with this toothpaste, their teeth stay pearly white!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended toothpaste, nothing compares to it that you will find on the shelf. Safe ingredients, cleans good and tastes great. My son loves it! He swallows the paste a lot so having one with no fluoride or harmful chemicals in it is important to me :) try it!!!</li>
            <li> I purshased this toothpaste for my son. We are working on helping his teeth. It will take a while to work so I don&#x27;t know If this product helps in that reguard but my son loves the Flavor and I don&#x27;t have to fight to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;t taste anything like bubble gum. More like fruity mint with a chalky after  taste. my kids were disgusted with the flavor so I let them try the adult version which has a mild sweet mint flavor. They all like it! Safe for my 9 year old and 3 year old twins too! won&#x27;t use this product again but we are sold on the adult stuff!</li>
            <li> My kids love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Taste is good. My kids don&#x27;t mind it. I&#x27;m still learning but this seems like a safer/healthier option to the kid toothpaste options available at the stores around me. I plan to keep using it for my kids.</li>
            <li> This seemed to be pretty decent toothpaste, but my kids didn&#x27;t really like it very much.  They used it up only because I didn&#x27;t let them use anything else, but given the option, they would rather have gone without brushing their teeth than use this stuff.  I won&#x27;t be getting it again, but only because my kids didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a toothpaste without all the junk that we actually like the taste of.  This one is a winner!</li>
            <li> Great, helped my kids&#x27; teeth remineralize.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth paste because it is fluoride and glycerin free witch are two very harmful substances to your body and teeth.</li>
            <li> Although I love this product, I was a little upset that it was shipped to me with some of the toothpaste all crusty around the edge. There was no sign of tampering but I think the company should have a safety seal for protection. I wish they had other flavors too.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff after reading more about the help concerns surrounding fluoride and even glycerine in toothpaste.  At around $9 per tube, this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, but the list of ingredients is great - natural coral, xylitol, various herbs, silica.  Practically everything you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the response from my kids has been interesting - they love the flavor.  Seriously, they fight to brush their teeth now.  Their teeth are doing great, and I&#x27;m happy they are brushing like crazy and enjoying the process.  It&#x27;s nice not to have them hiding from brushing, and just as importantly, they&#x27;ve developed the habit of doing it every morning and every evening - to me, the fact that this toothpaste has helped them develop that habit, without fights, is critical.  At some point, even if they switch to another toothpaste (doubtful), the habit should continue since it&#x27;s automatic.  Problem solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who can argue with that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW-UP: November 18, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had a nice visit at the dentist&#x27;s last week. The shortest visit I can ever remember having - there was nothing for the hygienist to do - she sort of made a half-hearted effort and then called the dentist. The dentist, who usually spends his time chastising me for not brushing and flossing, sort of poked around, said nothing, and sent me on my way. Previous dental visits were about 1.5 hours long, or longer - this took all of 30 minutes, and that counts wait time prior to seeing anyone.  My kids&#x27; visits have been comparable - in and out with no complaints.  Previously unheard of, given our dentist, who always manages to find something wrong and let us know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the dentist rave about my teeth? No, he said nothing. But my last visit he groused about stains, (alleged) poor brushing and flossing, despite me using the fluoride toothpaste he recommended, flossing 2X/day, using a water pik, etc. This time he said zilch, nada, nothing, and I was in and out in record time, and to be honest, I&#x27;m spending less time brushing and flossing than before. That says a lot in and of itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear, I&#x27;ve changed a lot about my family&#x27;s oral care - we use Theraneem tooth powder Theraneem Neem Tooth &amp; Gum Powder, cinnamon, 40g, followed by Coral toothpaste Coral White Toothpaste Mint Flavor 6 oz, and before bed we suck on a probiotic lozenge Dr. David Williams&#x27; Probiotic Advantage Oral Sinus, 50 Lozenges (50-Day Supply). Given the results, I don&#x27;t plan on changing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, every morning I wake up and there&#x27;s no coat on my tongue. My teeth feel slippery-fresh, and they&#x27;re whiter than they have been in years (and still improving). Who am I to argue with success?be honest, I&#x27;m spending less time brushing and flossing than before.

            <li> I think tastes good, but my kids hate it. I have terribly picky kids though. I would recommend this (just don&#x27;t ask my kids!)</li>
            <li> My kids LOVE this toothpaste. I have purchased at least 3 or 4 tubes of it in the past 2 years. After doing a lot of research I decided this was the best toothpaste for my family. However.... I must say that I would like to see the formula improved somehow as far as consistency or the container/tube and cap needs to be modified. My kids (4 and 7) are not messy wild little hellions but man this toothpaste is a huge mess maker. It does not wash down the sink so if there is even a tiny bit of it that hits the sink and hasn&#x27;t been dissolved, it sticks to the sink like glue. Same with the cap. There is no way to effectively get toothpaste onto your toothbrush without smearing it on the cap and if you don&#x27;t sit there and clean it with a q-tip once a week, you can&#x27;t even get the cap to shut which makes the problem even worse because this stuff literally turns to glue when it dries. Eventually, this leads to the opening for the toothpaste to be so small that the kids need to apply a lot of pressure to get it out of the tube which resulted in our tube of toothpaste developing a crack and exploding. Of course, this wasn&#x27;t a problem after it dried on the crack because it pretty much sealed itself, cause like I said, this stuff turns to glue. I&#x27;m pretty certain you could mortar a brick house with this stuff. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other toothpaste! If it wasn&#x27;t for the consistency issue and mess, I would give this 5 stars because the ingredients are AWESOME and I know this product is great for my kids.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s favorite, and I love the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> My son loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride free + keeps his teeth nice and white.</li>
            <li> I was a really bad dad!  When my dentist of 25 years retired I was much too slow to find a replacement.  Just too many things, too fast and the time just slipped by.  Unfortunately my young daughter was seeing him too and we lapsed 2 years before starting back in.  But the good part of it was she had just started using Coral Kids toothepaste at the time, and knowing how she slips-in the sweets, I made sure she brushed her teeth every morning and night.  Well, she just started back to the dentist in January and although she had no complaints or toothe pains, I was afraid the new dentist would find a mouthful of cavities.  Not so!  She only had one cavity and it was a far-back molar.  I credit this good fortune to Coral toothepaste.  That was a &#x27;good&#x27; change-up.  Whew!</li>
