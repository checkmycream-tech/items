            <li>She was thrilled.</li>

            <li>and you have to rinse it, but it works fine for the price!</li>
            <li>pretty and very nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Just after I was no longer able to return it, it quit working</li>
            <li>Will defiantly buy more</li>
            <li>It works, but is kind of cheaply built.</li>
            <li>My daughter had been looking for an atomizer to put her favorite perfume in (it was a gift and just came in a bottle).</li>
            <li>I know she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely atomizer</li>
            <li>So cute.  </li>
            <li>Cute perfume bottle</li>
            <li>/&gt;Build quality and appearance are OK.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped this would have worked better</li>
            <li>but I guess it works okay for the price.  </li>
            <li>but it sure did the job of looking good and working great for the short time that I needed it to as a gift.</li>
            <li>I gave her the perfume that is her favorite and added this Vintage Style Perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>Cute bottle</li>
            <li>Will buy more</li>
            <li>This worked ok for about 2 months, then stopped spraying.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can fill it with any scent</li>
            <li>I will put in my grandmothers favorite perfume.....</li>
            <li>so it does not clog your spray pump),  Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It saved money by buying my favorite perfume in the refill size and buying this guy to put it in.</li>
            <li>, they look good on my vanity, they are the right size to split a 2.7 ounce bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>I purchased this particular atomizer because of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>and the atomizer works pretty good</li>
            <li>Its so beautiful just what I need to complete my antique collection.</li>
            <li>they had more of a variety i would buy them for myself to display my perfume in.&lt;br /&gt;overall, an unexpected great experience.</li>
            <li>Was nice quality and very pretty.</li>
            <li>So far the atomizer works perfectly, and the size was just right.</li>
            <li>It is a very good overall value.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money &amp; looks nice in my guest bathroom</li>
            <li>This item is actually really cool!</li>
            <li>Easy to fill with the funnel and the spray part never gets clogged.</li>
            <li>Transferring the product to this bottle was easy with the enclosed funnel.</li>
            <li>My teenager was thrilled with this pretty perfume bottle as well as the nostalgia of it.  </li>
            <li>You can use any fragrance oil to scent this perfume recipe, but make sure you use a lite weight carrier oil like sweet almond or fractionated (liquid) coconut oil</li>
            <li>and they still work fine.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty bottle but it doesn&#x27;t most well.</li>
            <li>My daughter filled it up and it leaked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>I filled it with travel sized &amp;#34;dabber&amp;#34; type perfumes</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my sister, she loves it, the spray is even and smooth</li>
            <li>Filled the bottle and used three times then the spray pump stopped working and perfume does not come out.</li>
            <li>Looks great on my vanity and sprays just enough perfume in one puff.</li>
            <li>Super great and make you feel extra girly</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for...  packed beautifully and a gorgeous little atomizer!!  </li>
            <li>It is also easily functional and fun to use.</li>
            <li>This is the best atomizer we have found so far and no longer look for different kinds.</li>
            <li>Dainty little thing, adds character to my vanity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li>Great price for such a pretty bottle</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I was able to find this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s holding up fine, and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very Pretty and works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, works well, and I feel like an old movie star using it!</li>
            <li>i bought this as a gift for my mother,&lt;br /&gt;it came earlier than the estimated date, it was shipped with another cap, although gold, for travel.&lt;br /&gt;it was cute and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly, and it is really nice that they include the tiny funnels to fill the bottle.</li>
            <li>She wanted one of these for a while now, but when ever we see them in store they don&#x27;t seem worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice solid design, and a travel cap you can put on it</li>
            <li>Really nice item with all the necessary supplies.</li>
            <li>rosey (English Rose) scent.  </li>
            <li>A cute, adorable, securely-packaged product that came in 2 days after I ordered it (along with other purchases).</li>
            <li>This atomizer sprays out just the right amount each time.</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>She wanted to fill it right away.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I pictured it to be bigger but the description says how many ounces</li>
            <li>What a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>They are so pretty</li>
            <li>Pretty and girly is what I was looking for</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d recommend going for a bigger size and better quality.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as it looks and is described.</li>
            <li>Exactly as it is shown.</li>
            <li>Real glass and spraying function works perfectly right out of the box.</li>
            <li>It is very classic and pretty, and it works well.</li>
            <li>Very nice glass bottle (clear and stable) and the black bulb works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful design and heavy enough that it doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The bottle itself really doesn&#x27;t seem very vintage</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about the longevity of this product</li>
            <li>Glass is poor quality but a great value in price.  </li>
            <li>made very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as discribed</li>
            <li>IT IS REALLY PRETTY.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li>Nice, heavy glass bottle.</li>
            <li>It is nice, heavy glass.</li>
            <li>I get the original bottle and the next time</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that when it sprays it sounds like it&#x27;s wheezing and isn&#x27;t spraying a full mist like it should be.  </li>
            <li>Decent product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for these everywhere in normal stores.</li>
            <li>It worked very well for the first 3 months, now here I am looking at another refillable replacement bottle for this same perfume.</li>
            <li>lovely, so delicate and pretty</li>
            <li>I was happy that it came with a little bulb so I could remove the perfume out of my broken original bottle and put it into this one.</li>
            <li>(Wash and dry this bottle completely, putting the spray on to make sure its not clogged and working properly.</li>
            <li>Very classy and looks very&lt;</li>
            <li>Was a gift for my eleven year old niece.</li>
            <li>She was was so surprised buy how you can refill it and the removable tops.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old niece wanted this perfume bottle after seeing old shows.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this atomizer.  </li>
            <li>A bit difficult to fill but easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li>Take the spray off and fill the bottle with a little over 3/4 of the way with pure cold pressed sweet almond oil, add 10 drops of English Rose fragrance oil and 4 drops of Tuberose Moss fragrance oil (do not exceed more than 25 drops of fragrance oils or 15 drops of pure essential oils or you could burn your skin), put the permanent lid on the bottle and turn it upside down a few times (do not shake harshly or the oil will become foggy and the glass bottle will look foggy instead of crystal like), let sit for a few hours to combine the fragrances with the almond oil, spray a small amount on your wrist and rub both wrists together - the almond oil soaks into your skin and it has a wonderful soft green (Tuberose Moss)</li>
            <li>I tried unscrewing &amp; retightening the top (incase it was an internal pressure/vacuum issue) but no good.</li>
            <li>It even comes with a little funnel, which is pretty useless but a nice addition.</li>
            <li>It comes with a funnel which makes filling much easier than other atomizers.</li>

            <li> This item is actually really cool!</li>
            <li> Easy to fill with the funnel and the spray part never gets clogged.</li>
            <li> Transferring the product to this bottle was easy with the enclosed funnel.</li>
            <li> My teenager was thrilled with this pretty perfume bottle as well as the nostalgia of it.  </li>
            <li> You can use any fragrance oil to scent this perfume recipe, but make sure you use a lite weight carrier oil like sweet almond or fractionated (liquid) coconut oil</li>
            <li> and they still work fine.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty bottle but it doesn&#x27;t most well.</li>
            <li> My daughter filled it up and it leaked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> I filled it with travel sized &amp;#34;dabber&amp;#34; type perfumes</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister, she loves it, the spray is even and smooth</li>
            <li> Filled the bottle and used three times then the spray pump stopped working and perfume does not come out.</li>
            <li> Looks great on my vanity and sprays just enough perfume in one puff.</li>
            <li> Super great and make you feel extra girly</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for...  packed beautifully and a gorgeous little atomizer!!  </li>
            <li> It is also easily functional and fun to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best atomizer we have found so far and no longer look for different kinds.</li>
            <li> Dainty little thing, adds character to my vanity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li> Great price for such a pretty bottle</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I was able to find this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s holding up fine, and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very Pretty and works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, works well, and I feel like an old movie star using it!</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift for my mother,&lt;br /&gt;it came earlier than the estimated date, it was shipped with another cap, although gold, for travel.&lt;br /&gt;it was cute and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly, and it is really nice that they include the tiny funnels to fill the bottle.</li>
            <li> She wanted one of these for a while now, but when ever we see them in store they don&#x27;t seem worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice solid design, and a travel cap you can put on it</li>
            <li> Really nice item with all the necessary supplies.</li>
            <li> rosey (English Rose) scent.  </li>
            <li> A cute, adorable, securely-packaged product that came in 2 days after I ordered it (along with other purchases).</li>
            <li> This atomizer sprays out just the right amount each time.</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> She wanted to fill it right away.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I pictured it to be bigger but the description says how many ounces</li>
            <li> What a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> They are so pretty</li>
            <li> Pretty and girly is what I was looking for</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d recommend going for a bigger size and better quality.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as it looks and is described.</li>
            <li> Exactly as it is shown.</li>
            <li> Real glass and spraying function works perfectly right out of the box.</li>
            <li> It is very classic and pretty, and it works well.</li>
            <li> Very nice glass bottle (clear and stable) and the black bulb works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful design and heavy enough that it doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The bottle itself really doesn&#x27;t seem very vintage</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about the longevity of this product</li>
            <li> Glass is poor quality but a great value in price.  </li>
            <li> made very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as discribed</li>
            <li> IT IS REALLY PRETTY.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li> Nice, heavy glass bottle.</li>
            <li> It is nice, heavy glass.</li>
            <li> I get the original bottle and the next time</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that when it sprays it sounds like it&#x27;s wheezing and isn&#x27;t spraying a full mist like it should be.  </li>
            <li> Decent product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these everywhere in normal stores.</li>
            <li> It worked very well for the first 3 months, now here I am looking at another refillable replacement bottle for this same perfume.</li>
            <li> lovely, so delicate and pretty</li>
            <li> I was happy that it came with a little bulb so I could remove the perfume out of my broken original bottle and put it into this one.</li>
            <li> (Wash and dry this bottle completely, putting the spray on to make sure its not clogged and working properly.</li>
            <li> Very classy and looks very&lt;</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my eleven year old niece.</li>
            <li> She was was so surprised buy how you can refill it and the removable tops.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old niece wanted this perfume bottle after seeing old shows.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this atomizer.  </li>
            <li> A bit difficult to fill but easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li> Take the spray off and fill the bottle with a little over 3/4 of the way with pure cold pressed sweet almond oil, add 10 drops of English Rose fragrance oil and 4 drops of Tuberose Moss fragrance oil (do not exceed more than 25 drops of fragrance oils or 15 drops of pure essential oils or you could burn your skin), put the permanent lid on the bottle and turn it upside down a few times (do not shake harshly or the oil will become foggy and the glass bottle will look foggy instead of crystal like), let sit for a few hours to combine the fragrances with the almond oil, spray a small amount on your wrist and rub both wrists together - the almond oil soaks into your skin and it has a wonderful soft green (Tuberose Moss)</li>
            <li> I tried unscrewing &amp; retightening the top (incase it was an internal pressure/vacuum issue) but no good.</li>
            <li> It even comes with a little funnel, which is pretty useless but a nice addition.</li>
            <li> It comes with a funnel which makes filling much easier than other atomizers.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, at least from my experience, stay away from anything that comes with a pretty atomizer bulb.</li>
            <li> It was kinda difficult to fill up tho but other than that I love it ,</li>
            <li> The tassel is soft and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> but since it is a brand new item, and moderately priced, it is probably not fair to criticize that.</li>
            <li> Only had less than 1 month.</li>
            <li> Cheaper looking than expected</li>
            <li> I have become addicted to high end perfumes.</li>
            <li> and I go in half on a bottle of what we like.</li>
            <li> Arrived later than they said, which was unfortunate because it was an X-mas present.</li>
            <li> A little hard to fill - only because I am messy probably.</li>
            <li> but it broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> Have not filled it or tried to use yet.</li>
            <li> I gave this item along with some other delicate items as a wedding gift to the bride.  </li>
            <li> This little atomizer is a gem!</li>
            <li> It comes with a small funnel and eyedropper for filling.  </li>
            <li> I comes with a small (about 2 oz?)</li>
            <li> Kinda pricey for it&#x27;s use, but the bottle was very heavy and made well</li>
            <li> The glass is thick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this refillable atomizer to replace the atomizer perfume bottle I got from a store which name rhymes with Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> , not great.</li>
            <li> I bought it because the expensive perfume gift I received would not spray.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed... get what you pay for.</li>

            <li> To get it started you have to put your finger over the nozzle and pump it to get the liquid up the tube. Sometimes the nozzle clogs and you have to rinse it, but it works fine for the price!</li>
            <li> Just after I was no longer able to return it, it quit working and I can figure out how to replace it. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend&#x27;s birthday and she loves it. She has it sitting on her bathroom counter every time I am over and it accents any room beautifully. It is also easily functional and fun to use. It came with everything I needed ( including a funnel to help pour perfume into the smallish bottle) and was packaged well so that nothing broke on it&#x27;s journey to my home.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Dainty little thing, adds character to my vanity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel so Hollywood! Ha!</li>
            <li> bought this for my lady and it is awesome and well built, i want one for my cologne, its a great dresser piece that fits with our decor</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s a beautiful design and heavy enough that it doesn&#x27;t fall over. It came with a funnel to transfer perfumes and an eye dropper if you want to combine liquids. So far the atomizer works perfectly, and the size was just right.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift. Receiver loved it. Real glass and spraying function works perfectly right out of the box. Very beautiful. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Looks very cute and feminine in my bathroom.  :)</li>
            <li> Works beautifully!!! Will defiantly buy more</li>
            <li> This atomizer looks great on the mirror tray I also ordered, work great also!</li>
            <li> Nice, heavy glass bottle. Works great. Very elegant looking. Was a gift for my eleven year old niece. She loves it.</li>
            <li> It works, but is kind of cheaply built.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift for my mother,&lt;br /&gt;it came earlier than the estimated date, it was shipped with another cap, although gold, for travel.&lt;br /&gt;it was cute and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this product for others and&lt;br /&gt;if they had more of a variety i would buy them for myself to display my perfume in.&lt;br /&gt;overall, an unexpected great experience.</li>
            <li> Great! Does the job without leaking. I pictured it to be bigger but the description says how many ounces so I can&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s big enough.</li>
            <li> pretty and very nice quality.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> I was at work when the order came so I picked it up at the post office but it came when it was supposed to and I got everything I ordered. The tray was smaller than I thought so I have to get another one but I got what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been looking for an atomizer to put her favorite perfume in (it was a gift and just came in a bottle). She likes to spray rather than splash or dab. I purchased this atomizer for her birthday which is in June. I know she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> What a reasonable price! I&#x27;ve been looking for these everywhere in normal stores. Thanks to Amazon, I was able to find this. The size is perfect, and I am in love with the tassel pump.A cute, adorable, securely-packaged product that came in 2 days after I ordered it (along with other purchases). I was impressed with the size, packaging, price, and everything in general. Take good care of this, and you&#x27;ll have a great product for years. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have become addicted to high end perfumes. Instead of buying a 2.7 ounce bottle and taking forever to use it my girlfriend and I go in half on a bottle of what we like. This little atomizer is a gem! Each time we go in on a bottle one time I get the original bottle and the next time I get the atomizer. I have 3 of these as does my friend. They are so pretty, they look good on my vanity, they are the right size to split a 2.7 ounce bottle of perfume. This atomizer sprays out just the right amount each time. I have some I&#x27;ve had for years and they still work fine. It comes with a funnel which makes filling much easier than other atomizers. The tassel is a nice touch. It&#x27;s a lovely atomizer and I will continue to buy them and use them as we continue to buy 2.7 ounce bottles of perfume to share. This is the best atomizer we have found so far and no longer look for different kinds. The price is right too. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Pretty and girly is what I was looking for and I found it here. It&#x27;s beautiful and works great. I use it for Rose water body spray. Great price for such a pretty bottle</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for her Birthday. She was was so surprised buy how you can refill it and the removable tops. This is a great gift for a perfume lover.</li>
            <li> Great looking vintage perfume bottle. A bit difficult to fill but easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li> I gave this item along with some other delicate items as a wedding gift to the bride.  She loved it.  It comes with a small funnel and eyedropper for filling.  Was nice quality and very pretty.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful and works great. Easy to fill with the funnel and the spray part never gets clogged.</li>
            <li> So cute.  Looks nice on my vintage vanity.</li>
            <li> Cute perfume bottle but it broke after a few months. The tube inside came out and I could not reattach it.</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked. My daughter filled it up and it leaked. I was very disappointed with the product. It looked great, but it leaked.</li>
            <li> I purchased this refillable atomizer to replace the atomizer perfume bottle I got from a store which name rhymes with Victoria&#x27;s Secret. I purchased this particular atomizer because of all the great reviews. It worked very well for the first 3 months, now here I am looking at another refillable replacement bottle for this same perfume. Bottom line, at least from my experience, stay away from anything that comes with a pretty atomizer bulb.</li>
            <li> I use this several days a day for non-perfume purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s holding up fine, and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality and appearance are OK.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> The glass is thick. The quality is great!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I filled it with travel sized &amp;#34;dabber&amp;#34; type perfumes so I could spray them on instead.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty bottle but it doesn&#x27;t most well.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would have worked better but I guess it works okay for the price.  The only issue I have is that when it sprays it sounds like it&#x27;s wheezing and isn&#x27;t spraying a full mist like it should be.  Decent product but I&#x27;d recommend going for a bigger size and better quality.</li>
            <li> The bottle has a very elegant look and displays nicely on my crystal perfume tray.  It also functions if you are in need of a perfume dispenser.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item. It is a nice bottle for the value. The spritzer works well and is the prettiest part of all. The bottle itself really doesn&#x27;t seem very vintage but since it is a brand new item, and moderately priced, it is probably not fair to criticize that. After all, it is made in that &amp;#34;style.&amp;#34; If you are looking for a nice perfume bottle for your vanity then I recommend this one. It is a very good overall value. It shipped quickly, and it is really nice that they include the tiny funnels to fill the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love it ! The antique look is amazing ! It was kinda difficult to fill up tho but other than that I love it ,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about the longevity of this product but it sure did the job of looking good and working great for the short time that I needed it to as a gift.</li>
            <li> This item is actually really cool! My only issue with it is I still can&#x27;t figure out how to open a perfume bottle to pour some in so I just have body spray in it. It works great. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had always wanted a vintage perfume bottle and this is just the thing! looks great on my shelf &amp; works great too!</li>
            <li> The quality far exceeds the cost of this very attractive perfume bottle.  It is exactly as it looks and is described.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old niece wanted this perfume bottle after seeing old shows.  She loves it and feels so glamourous using it.  It works perfect and came with a funnel for transfer of perfume.</li>
            <li> She wanted one of these for a while now, but when ever we see them in store they don&#x27;t seem worth it for the price. This guy fit the bill perfectly. The funnel that came with it worked well, but I ended up clipping part of the bottom off so the fluid would drain faster into the bottle through it. Works great besides that though! Nice solid design, and a travel cap you can put on it so it doesn&#x27;t spill.</li>
            <li> Awesome&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one for me and my daughter and we bothenjoyed the item for such a very low price...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 at 2 different times but only received a funnel,cap and dropper with 1 of them.1 was a gift so I had to rinse out the extras to give with the gift. Was dissapointed</li>
            <li> lovely, so delicate and pretty</li>
            <li> Exactly as it is shown.</li>
            <li> Glass is poor quality but a great value in price.  Cheaper looking than expected</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this atomizer.  I comes with a small (about 2 oz?), sturdy glass bottle that is suitable for tweens and teens as well as adults.  The tassel is soft and fluffy.  The set includes a pipette and funnel and screw cap to seal the bottle.  I bought one for my daughter&#x27;s best friends birthday--she&#x27;ll be 14.  I then ordered one for my daughter.  Really nice item with all the necessary supplies.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product, thank you</li>
            <li> Nice object. Arrived later than they said, which was unfortunate because it was an X-mas present. Allow for longer shipping. Works great, though.</li>
            <li> Super great and make you feel extra girly</li>
            <li> My teenager was thrilled with this pretty perfume bottle as well as the nostalgia of it.  Have not filled it or tried to use yet.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it. Very classy and looks very&lt;br /&gt;retro as well. comes with a funnel to make it easier to refill.&lt;br /&gt;Definately would buy from this person again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for her birthday and she loved it. It is very classic and pretty, and it works well. It even comes with a little funnel, which is pretty useless but a nice addition.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister, she loves it, the spray is even and smooth</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this atomizer! I was happy that it came with a little bulb so I could remove the perfume out of my broken original bottle and put it into this one. It is nice, heavy glass. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this item.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Very nice glass bottle (clear and stable) and the black bulb works very well. It looks great on my table!</li>
            <li> made very well. everyone looked at it and liked it&lt;br /&gt;my grandaughter loved getting it for Christmas. She wanted to fill it right away.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted one for Christmas. We drew names and I got hers. I gave her the perfume that is her favorite and added this Vintage Style Perfume bottle. She was thrilled. I buy most of my Christmas presents through Amazon because they are good to work with. You should try it. Thank Amazon.</li>
            <li> Filled the bottle and used three times then the spray pump stopped working and perfume does not come out. Very disappointed... get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very Pretty and works well. Kinda pricey for it&#x27;s use, but the bottle was very heavy and made well and the atomizer works pretty good, not great. I would suggest this though.</li>
            <li> Cute bottle but there was no funnel included.</li>
            <li> Bought if for my daughter, she loves it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Beautiful vintage perfume bottle. Looks great on my vanity and sprays just enough perfume in one puff. Will buy more</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as discribed</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for...  packed beautifully and a gorgeous little atomizer!!  Would totally recommend to anyone looking for something like this.</li>
            <li> very nice &amp; functional. A little hard to fill - only because I am messy probably.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an Obsession sprayer that broke when dropped. Transferring the product to this bottle was easy with the enclosed funnel. This worked ok for about 2 months, then stopped spraying. I tried unscrewing &amp; retightening the top (incase it was an internal pressure/vacuum issue) but no good. I ended up tossing the remaining cologne and this atomizer.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money &amp; looks nice in my guest bathroom</li>
            <li> I love this bottle! It is very pretty and works perfectly!  I bought it because the expensive perfume gift I received would not spray.  This was a beautiful solution.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The pump stuck and does not work after cleaning. Only had less than 1 month.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and I love that I can fill it with any scent</li>
            <li> OMG!!! Its so beautiful just what I need to complete my antique collection. I will order another one. Only thing left is to figure out which perfume to put in it. I will put in my grandmothers favorite perfume..... White diamond!</li>
            <li> A good friend was celebrating a 50+ birthday. She loves Victorian elegance (as do I). I was looking for something that would compliment her beautiful vanity table and the more I thought about it the more I liked this bottle. She loves it! I gave her a recipe for her own perfume oil spray to put in this bottle. (Wash and dry this bottle completely, putting the spray on to make sure its not clogged and working properly. Take the spray off and fill the bottle with a little over 3/4 of the way with pure cold pressed sweet almond oil, add 10 drops of English Rose fragrance oil and 4 drops of Tuberose Moss fragrance oil (do not exceed more than 25 drops of fragrance oils or 15 drops of pure essential oils or you could burn your skin), put the permanent lid on the bottle and turn it upside down a few times (do not shake harshly or the oil will become foggy and the glass bottle will look foggy instead of crystal like), let sit for a few hours to combine the fragrances with the almond oil, spray a small amount on your wrist and rub both wrists together - the almond oil soaks into your skin and it has a wonderful soft green (Tuberose Moss) rosey (English Rose) scent.  You can use any fragrance oil to scent this perfume recipe, but make sure you use a lite weight carrier oil like sweet almond or fractionated (liquid) coconut oil so it does not clog your spray pump),  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It saved money by buying my favorite perfume in the refill size and buying this guy to put it in. It&#x27;s cute, works well, and I feel like an old movie star using it!</li>
            <li> I BROKE THE BOTTLE THAT MY PERFUME CAME IN. I ORDERED THIS TO PUT IT IN. IT IS REALLY PRETTY.&lt;br /&gt;NOT ONLY DOES IT SERVE A PURPOSE BUT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DECORATION</li>
