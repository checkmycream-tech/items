            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I came to Amazon and bought some to use at home!</li>

            <li>I only wish I could afford to use it all over my body, it&#x27;s that good!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The image c masque is easy and effortless to use.</li>
            <li>Great mask - totally brightens and hyrdates!</li>
            <li>fantastic</li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated,  soft, and bright.</li>
            <li>I figured if a professional is using this it must be good.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel clean without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn and makes my face feel clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I need to use more consistently to truly rate its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>This product is great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It was not irritating to my skin (dry/sensitive) and did resonate a healthy glow to my skin after use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come completely full.</li>
            <li>Tried it prior and loved the product</li>
            <li>I use it three times a week and with each use, my skin is super hydrated and it glows.</li>
            <li>Product was as described and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Smells like a burst of fresh sweet oranges .</li>
            <li>Love this masque, leaves my face very soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and looks much brighter after I use this product.</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea and sensitive skin, and I love these products.</li>
            <li>I love Vital C hydrating enzyme mask.</li>
            <li>I use this product if my skin is sun burnt or if it is dry or even after a home peel, it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>but i seem to run out of product pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I really likes this hydrating masque, smells wonderful and really makes my winter dry skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if they do the right thing.</li>
            <li>arrived faster than I imagined and product it priced right.  </li>
            <li>It is so much smoother, softer to the touch, the dark spots on my face have lessoned and even my husband commented on how great my face looks.  </li>
            <li>This worked great in the beginning, not sure if I&#x27;m seeing continued improvement.  </li>
            <li>but the chances are high you could be exposing yourself to significant harm and when that does happen (not if, but when) this company will be gone and don&#x27;t expect Amazon to help you, they are protected from liability just like ebay.    </li>
            <li>Although the picture depicts it to be bigger, it&#x27;s still affordable and you don&#x27;t need much for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>use the entire Vital C skin care line and this mask smells great, feels good, but for some reason I just don&#x27;t get the same tingly sensation as when I go to get a facial</li>
            <li>Not messy and easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t too many mask exfoliants that I use, but this is definitely one of my staples.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced by my dermatologist who gave me some samples after a treatment</li>
            <li>I enjoy all the Vital c skincare products from Image, I recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be dissapointed if you are over 40 and need moisture in you skin.</li>
            <li>Not a fake.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was lookin for.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years, first purchase on Amazon for this</li>
            <li>I has this masque at a facial and wanted to buy it because I had such good results.  </li>
            <li>I went through it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It came in a timely manner but was only 1/2 full!</li>
            <li>And my face has stopped peeling so much after using this product two to three times a week for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Fast and just what I wanted</li>
            <li>Thanks, Image - you&#x27;ve got a customer for life.</li>
            <li>This one is very hydrating and helps even out my skin.</li>
            <li>I like the product a lot, can really tell a difference when I use it.</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin; can wear overnight for increased brightness.  </li>
            <li>The tube is very deceitful in size.</li>
            <li>Really hydrates and adds a glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>This works very well at hydrating your skin.</li>
            <li>It really does the job.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin ready to take in the hydration.</li>
            <li>The Esthetician told me to be gentle after using this product for a couple days.</li>
            <li>very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>gentle to use.</li>
            <li>I love this one and use it several times a week on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I am having a super dry skin spell I use this, next day smooth as a babys butt!</li>
            <li>Much better for my very dry sensitive skin than a scrubbing mask.</li>
            <li>My esotericism recommended them, but the price at the salon was high.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I really like Vital C.  </li>
            <li>My (mature) skin doesn&#x27;t handle exfoliators with granules very well, so I was looking for an enzyme exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>My face is looking more hydrated from using this stuff and not so dried out from living in the desert and hiking in the mountains a lot.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to wipe it off with a washcloth as it will take all the dead skin cells off.</li>
            <li>I decided to order a new 2oz tube from amazon.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the label from the salon product was stamped directly on the container (after much handling it will rub off the container) and the one from the Amazon supplier was printed on a clear plastic label and attached to the container.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this was when I went to a spa and had a facial</li>
            <li>However the real potential was shown when I paired it with the Ageless Resurfacing Mask (I use that first for about 30 minutes)</li>
            <li>When I submitted my feedback; the seller contacted me to say that it usually takes more than one tube.  </li>
            <li>I love the Vital C products and had in the past purchased them from a certified salon.</li>
            <li>I first learned about this product about 5 years ago, while having a professional facial at a spa.  </li>
            <li>Expensive products but hands down best out on the market.</li>
            <li>how soft my skin felt after I used this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it every night and wake up to a baby soft face.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I seem to tolerate it well.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy Image Skin Care products, the pros completly outweigh the few cons I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it has never bothered me.</li>
            <li>I have been using Vital C for almost a year.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so refreshed and soft.  </li>
            <li>skin has never been so soft since I switched to this skincare product line.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so soft and refreshed after using this mask.</li>
            <li>This product was completely liquified upon arrival.</li>
            <li>It also makes my face feels so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Sinks right in and helps rebalance problem over processed skin.  </li>
            <li>For all I know these products are fake being made in an uncontrolled environment with unsafe cheap ingredients, it wouldn&#x27;t be the first time it has happened!</li>
            <li>After I rinse with lukewarm water and dry my face, my skin is so hydrated and soft - it&#x27;s like new skin.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it was filled with a clear, watery liquid mixed with small, white globs of some substance.</li>

            <li> Great mask - totally brightens and hyrdates!</li>
            <li> fantastic</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated,  soft, and bright.</li>
            <li> I figured if a professional is using this it must be good.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel clean without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn and makes my face feel clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I need to use more consistently to truly rate its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was not irritating to my skin (dry/sensitive) and did resonate a healthy glow to my skin after use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come completely full.</li>
            <li> Tried it prior and loved the product</li>
            <li> I use it three times a week and with each use, my skin is super hydrated and it glows.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Smells like a burst of fresh sweet oranges .</li>
            <li> Love this masque, leaves my face very soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and looks much brighter after I use this product.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and sensitive skin, and I love these products.</li>
            <li> I love Vital C hydrating enzyme mask.</li>
            <li> I use this product if my skin is sun burnt or if it is dry or even after a home peel, it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> but i seem to run out of product pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I really likes this hydrating masque, smells wonderful and really makes my winter dry skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if they do the right thing.</li>
            <li> arrived faster than I imagined and product it priced right.  </li>
            <li> It is so much smoother, softer to the touch, the dark spots on my face have lessoned and even my husband commented on how great my face looks.  </li>
            <li> This worked great in the beginning, not sure if I&#x27;m seeing continued improvement.  </li>
            <li> but the chances are high you could be exposing yourself to significant harm and when that does happen (not if, but when) this company will be gone and don&#x27;t expect Amazon to help you, they are protected from liability just like ebay.    </li>
            <li> Although the picture depicts it to be bigger, it&#x27;s still affordable and you don&#x27;t need much for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> use the entire Vital C skin care line and this mask smells great, feels good, but for some reason I just don&#x27;t get the same tingly sensation as when I go to get a facial</li>
            <li> Not messy and easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t too many mask exfoliants that I use, but this is definitely one of my staples.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced by my dermatologist who gave me some samples after a treatment</li>
            <li> I enjoy all the Vital c skincare products from Image, I recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be dissapointed if you are over 40 and need moisture in you skin.</li>
            <li> Not a fake.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was lookin for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, first purchase on Amazon for this</li>
            <li> I has this masque at a facial and wanted to buy it because I had such good results.  </li>
            <li> I went through it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It came in a timely manner but was only 1/2 full!</li>
            <li> And my face has stopped peeling so much after using this product two to three times a week for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Fast and just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Thanks, Image - you&#x27;ve got a customer for life.</li>
            <li> This one is very hydrating and helps even out my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot, can really tell a difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin; can wear overnight for increased brightness.  </li>
            <li> The tube is very deceitful in size.</li>
            <li> Really hydrates and adds a glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> This works very well at hydrating your skin.</li>
            <li> It really does the job.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin ready to take in the hydration.</li>
            <li> The Esthetician told me to be gentle after using this product for a couple days.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> gentle to use.</li>
            <li> I love this one and use it several times a week on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I am having a super dry skin spell I use this, next day smooth as a babys butt!</li>
            <li> Much better for my very dry sensitive skin than a scrubbing mask.</li>
            <li> My esotericism recommended them, but the price at the salon was high.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like Vital C.  </li>
            <li> My (mature) skin doesn&#x27;t handle exfoliators with granules very well, so I was looking for an enzyme exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> My face is looking more hydrated from using this stuff and not so dried out from living in the desert and hiking in the mountains a lot.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to wipe it off with a washcloth as it will take all the dead skin cells off.</li>
            <li> I decided to order a new 2oz tube from amazon.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the label from the salon product was stamped directly on the container (after much handling it will rub off the container) and the one from the Amazon supplier was printed on a clear plastic label and attached to the container.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was when I went to a spa and had a facial</li>
            <li> However the real potential was shown when I paired it with the Ageless Resurfacing Mask (I use that first for about 30 minutes)</li>
            <li> When I submitted my feedback; the seller contacted me to say that it usually takes more than one tube.  </li>
            <li> I love the Vital C products and had in the past purchased them from a certified salon.</li>
            <li> I first learned about this product about 5 years ago, while having a professional facial at a spa.  </li>
            <li> Expensive products but hands down best out on the market.</li>
            <li> how soft my skin felt after I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I use it every night and wake up to a baby soft face.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I seem to tolerate it well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Image Skin Care products, the pros completly outweigh the few cons I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it has never bothered me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vital C for almost a year.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so refreshed and soft.  </li>
            <li> skin has never been so soft since I switched to this skincare product line.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so soft and refreshed after using this mask.</li>
            <li> This product was completely liquified upon arrival.</li>
            <li> It also makes my face feels so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Sinks right in and helps rebalance problem over processed skin.  </li>
            <li> For all I know these products are fake being made in an uncontrolled environment with unsafe cheap ingredients, it wouldn&#x27;t be the first time it has happened!</li>
            <li> After I rinse with lukewarm water and dry my face, my skin is so hydrated and soft - it&#x27;s like new skin.  </li>
            <li> Instead, it was filled with a clear, watery liquid mixed with small, white globs of some substance.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use this my skin flakes right after I put my foundation on and will look dull.</li>
            <li> If your skin feels very dry (I had such problem this winter, or after harsh peeling), this product will really hydrate it, it has creamy texture, citron smell.</li>
            <li> No strong serums or creams as the skin is new and fragile.</li>
            <li> The vital c cleanser is a little too stong for me, but thankfully this product from the same line doesn&#x27;t give me any issues.</li>
            <li> The dry skin on my nose and red in my cheeks is gone.</li>
            <li> Not worth the risk for the small savings when this is stuff I will put on my face, especially given the discrepancies noted in the reviews between what a real products from Image looks like and whet this company is selling.    </li>
            <li> Cleans away all the dead skin and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Skin feels hydrated and relieved of dry patches.</li>
            <li> SINCE USING IT, I DON&#x27;T DEVELOP DRY PATCHY SKIN&lt;br /&gt;DURING THE WINTER.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> The other exfoliaters that use nut shells in their creams will just cause breakouts for me and the creams that have exfoliating beads do not do a thing for my skin.</li>
            <li> In summer I have to be careful as it might lead to a little break out.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my Dr. added a little something extra.</li>
            <li> I just tunred 40 last year and this line of skin care products is slowly beoming my go to product.  </li>
            <li> I bought them on Amazon for 35% less.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little when it&#x27;s on which</li>
            <li> I apply it to wet skin in the bath, wait at least five minutes (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this a few times.</li>
            <li> I was not comfortable ordering another tube of this product.  </li>
            <li> You can use this everyday or once a week.</li>
            <li> Watery and not sure how well it worked.</li>
            <li> No more winter dryness &amp; no patchy skin.</li>
            <li> This chemical version is less irritating but still cleans my skin and refreshes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve asked for a refund or at least a replacement.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for a back order of product, and I got desperate and couldn&#x27;t wait any longer!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if this is a fake or not...</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that this was falsely advertised! :(</li>
            <li> Less expensive then the dermatologist office!</li>
            <li> I use the Masque once a week, leave it on for 30 minutes and rinse my face with cold water.  </li>
            <li> If I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Disappointed...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great skin care product for all skin types. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Works good.</li>
            <li> Kuddos to Image.  My face is looking more hydrated from using this stuff and not so dried out from living in the desert and hiking in the mountains a lot.  And my face has stopped peeling so much after using this product two to three times a week for two weeks.  Although the picture depicts it to be bigger, it&#x27;s still affordable and you don&#x27;t need much for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this and love the scent!!!!  The first time I used this was when I went to a spa and had a facial and this was what they used!! I loved it so much that I came to Amazon and bought some to use at home!</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and sensitive skin, and I love these products. My esotericism recommended them, but the price at the salon was high. I bought them on Amazon for 35% less. My skin looks And feels so much better after four weeks.</li>
            <li> Fast and just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Love this masque, leaves my face very soft.</li>
            <li> I only wish I could afford to use it all over my body, it&#x27;s that good!  Thanks, Image - you&#x27;ve got a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like a mask...feels more like a moisturizer or cleanser. Disappointed...won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Watery and not sure how well it worked.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my dry skin. It hydrates, rejuvenates, and softens my skin.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t too many mask exfoliants that I use, but this is definitely one of my staples. For one, I prefer to masks to manual exfoliators. This one is very hydrating and helps even out my skin. The vital c cleanser is a little too stong for me, but thankfully this product from the same line doesn&#x27;t give me any issues. I only wish they sold it in larger sizes..</li>
            <li> Expensive products but hands down best out on the market.</li>
            <li> A great product! Use it every morning! Less expensive then the dermatologist office! Leaves my face glowing! A must try!</li>
            <li> one of the best products I have ever used</li>
            <li> I just tunred 40 last year and this line of skin care products is slowly beoming my go to product.  I was first introduced by my dermatologist who gave me some samples after a treatment (this was one of them).  I love the smell and how soft my skin felt after I used this product.  However the real potential was shown when I paired it with the Ageless Resurfacing Mask (I use that first for about 30 minutes) followed by this one for another thirty minutes two to three times a week.  My skin is transformed.  It is so much smoother, softer to the touch, the dark spots on my face have lessoned and even my husband commented on how great my face looks.  These two product have become part of my permant routine and I would highly recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great for about 24 hours. Definitely better than scrubbing brushes and exfoliaters.</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it every night and wake up to a baby soft face.</li>
            <li> I really likes this hydrating masque, smells wonderful and really makes my winter dry skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Very nice exfoliating mask which I mix with my cleanser and use the clarisonic face cleaning gadget. Smells nice, feels nice, been using it for years!</li>
            <li> Use it 1-2 times a week to exfoliate.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot, can really tell a difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> I use this product if my skin is sun burnt or if it is dry or even after a home peel, it works pretty good. Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because i don&#x27;t use it too often but i seem to run out of product pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use. Good results and great price!</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin; can wear overnight for increased brightness.  I need to use more consistently to truly rate its effectiveness. So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy all the Vital c skincare products from Image, I recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be dissapointed if you are over 40 and need moisture in you skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product about once a week, or on a day where I&#x27;ll be in front of people.  I apply it to wet skin in the bath, wait at least five minutes (once the tingling starts, it&#x27;s done its job), or up to 30 minutes if you have the time and patience.  I&#x27;ve found 5 minutes is enough.  After I rinse with lukewarm water and dry my face, my skin is so hydrated and soft - it&#x27;s like new skin.  One of my favorite enzyme exfoliating masques.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Sinks right in and helps rebalance problem over processed skin.  Skin feels hydrated and relieved of dry patches.</li>
            <li> it makes me break out</li>
            <li> This is authentic product. I hesitated buying products here on Amazon because I read that these products are only supposed to be sold in spas, but after several times of my spa not having product on hand when I needed it I decided to give Amazon sellers a try. I am not disappointed! And I&#x27;m saving money.:)</li>
            <li> Great mask - totally brightens and hyrdates!</li>
            <li> GREAT product. Not a fake.</li>
            <li> This product provides good hydration. The product smells wonderful and leaves my skin soft and smooth. My skin is sensitive and I seem to tolerate it well. In summer I have to be careful as it might lead to a little break out.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but probably wont purchase again. Out of all the image skincare line I have tried this was my favorite product. It was not irritating to my skin (dry/sensitive) and did resonate a healthy glow to my skin after use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Image Skin Care products, the pros completly outweigh the few cons I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;I use the entire Vital C skin care line and this mask smells great, feels good, but for some reason I just don&#x27;t get the same tingly sensation as when I go to get a facial and my Dr. uses the same product line on me.&lt;br /&gt;...Not sure if my Dr. added a little something extra. If I got a bad batch. Or what?&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I don&#x27;t think I will end up buying this again once I run out.</li>
            <li> The tube is very deceitful in size. It doesn&#x27;t come completely full. I went through it pretty fast. It is the best hydrating mask I&#x27;ve used so I will repurchase until I find a better one.</li>
            <li> This product is a treat.  Invigorating citrus smell wakes up the skin and the senses.  I leave it on for the full 30 minutes, and skin feels great.  I also, at times, use this in conjunction with a chemical peel.  Use a good moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I SHOWER IN THE A.M.  THE NIGHT BEFORE I WASH MY HAIR, I  PUT THIS ON BEFORE BED AND DON&#x27;T TAKE IT OFF.  SINCE USING IT, I DON&#x27;T DEVELOP DRY PATCHY SKIN&lt;br /&gt;DURING THE WINTER.</li>
            <li> I love the Vital C products and had in the past purchased them from a certified salon. Not liking the salon prices I turned to Amazon for a better deal. Upon receipt of this product I compared the packaging to the salon certified product I had at home. I noticed that the label from the salon product was stamped directly on the container (after much handling it will rub off the container) and the one from the Amazon supplier was printed on a clear plastic label and attached to the container. Also, the signature orange color on the two product labels was different by several shades. Has anybody else experienced this discrepancy in the packaging? I would love to continue using Amazon for these products but not if I am going to get a fraudulent product.</li>
            <li> If your skin feels very dry (I had such problem this winter, or after harsh peeling), this product will really hydrate it, it has creamy texture, citron smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great masque.  It was recommended by my esthetician for really hydrating and removing dead skin.  It gave my skin a really nice glow!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this mask before I got it from a doctor I love the image products</li>
            <li> Great exfoliant. And moisturizers too. Have been hooked on this product for years.  Takes years off my skin. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> To be honest, Image Vital C masque is the best I&#x27;ve ever used! I was waiting for a back order of product, and I got desperate and couldn&#x27;t wait any longer! I decided to order a new 2oz tube from amazon. It came in a timely manner but was only 1/2 full! I was really surprised that this was falsely advertised! :( Now I won&#x27;t be able to order it from amazon again!</li>
            <li> I really like Vital C.  A friend gave me some and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  It&#x27;s great to use after shaving.  It doesn&#x27;t burn and makes my face feel clean and smooth.  It also helps against the suns rays.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have sensitive skin and it has never bothered me. I use all the image c products and love them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this a few times. Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if this is a fake or not... I still continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Had an OXYGEN facial recently and afterwards was given a trial kit of IMAGE products to use afterwards including this item.  Ended up ordering ALL the products because my &amp;#34;combination - post menopausal still w/t-zone&amp;#34; skin has never looked so good!&lt;br /&gt;Have received MANY compliments on my skin!  So glad I treated myself to the facial which introduced me to these great products!!!</li>
            <li> Really hydrates and adds a glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> A good product. This works very well at hydrating your skin. It also smells wonderful. Tried it prior and loved the product</li>
            <li> I first learned about this product about 5 years ago, while having a professional facial at a spa.  My (mature) skin doesn&#x27;t handle exfoliators with granules very well, so I was looking for an enzyme exfoliator.  I love this one and use it several times a week on my sensitive skin.  It really does the job.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. The only thing that actually works for me. I use it three times a week and with each use, my skin is super hydrated and it glows. Will be using this regularly and will be a part of my regimen permanently.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this mask.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The people I ordered it from were great.</li>
            <li> This worked great in the beginning, not sure if I&#x27;m seeing continued improvement.  Will continue using for now.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing masque. Be sure to wipe it off with a washcloth as it will take all the dead skin cells off. It leaves the skin ready to take in the hydration. The Esthetician told me to be gentle after using this product for a couple days. No strong serums or creams as the skin is new and fragile.</li>
            <li> It smells incredible.  It leave your skin moisturized.  I actually leave it on  overnight and wash it off in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this line of skin care. I always get comments about how healthy my skin looks. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I has this masque at a facial and wanted to buy it because I had such good results.  It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel clean without being too harsh.  I had been using an exfoliant scrub; however, as my skin is aging, i found the scrub too abrasive.  This chemical version is less irritating but still cleans my skin and refreshes.  I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference in my skin by using this product.  When I submitted my feedback; the seller contacted me to say that it usually takes more than one tube.  I was not comfortable ordering another tube of this product.  The product suggests you see results almost immediately.  I love fruit based products; wished it had lived up to its name.</li>
            <li> I have used several different products out of this line. Great quality. Exactly what I was lookin for. Will order again</li>
            <li> I have been using Vital C for almost a year.  I use the Masque once a week, leave it on for 30 minutes and rinse my face with cold water.  My skin feels so refreshed and soft.  I also have rosacea and this helps w/ the redness, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never been so soft since I switched to this skincare product line.  No more winter dryness &amp; no patchy skin.</li>
            <li> I went and had a pricey microdermabrasion facial and when I was finished I found out this was the product they used to cleanse before my treatment. I figured if a professional is using this it must be good. I couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was. Great product gentle on so n and great for any redness problems.</li>
            <li> This is excellent as a moisturizer masque - leave it on from 5 to 30 minutes, as directed and you will even see the difference this makes, in addition to your nightime moisturizer. Not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Living in CO the moisture is needed.  Great mask.  Not messy and easy to wash off.  My face feels so soft and refreshed after using this mask.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite masks.  Great for a weekly treatment or post treatment.  It is creamy and smells divine. Love it</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin. When I don&#x27;t use this my skin flakes right after I put my foundation on and will look dull. You can use this everyday or once a week. The other exfoliaters that use nut shells in their creams will just cause breakouts for me and the creams that have exfoliating beads do not do a thing for my skin. Great smell and even better results!!!</li>
            <li> i regret i didn&#x27;t follow what people said about this product.&lt;br /&gt;very very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;of course it was not same. what i got from spa was great but this one was absolutely different.&lt;br /&gt; i ll never ever buy this product  from on line. no trust any more.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know  how they make this with what material.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, first purchase on Amazon for this and it is the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product at a spa and decided to buy the full-size of it.  It tingles a little when it&#x27;s on which is what I like because I like to feel the product working. My skin feels smooth and looks much brighter after I use this product.</li>
            <li> Much better for my very dry sensitive skin than a scrubbing mask.</li>
            <li> Love it I love this product  fantastic I recommend this product it&#x27;s great wonderful makes my skin feel great try it</li>
            <li> Excellent process and product!</li>
            <li> Image has top of the ingredients that work in repairing your skin not clogging your pores.  People can tell a difference when I use image</li>
            <li> Image skin care does not allow its products to be sold online.    For all I know these products are fake being made in an uncontrolled environment with unsafe cheap ingredients, it wouldn&#x27;t be the first time it has happened! Not worth the risk for the small savings when this is stuff I will put on my face, especially given the discrepancies noted in the reviews between what a real products from Image looks like and whet this company is selling.    Good luck buying from these types, it may work out for you but the chances are high you could be exposing yourself to significant harm and when that does happen (not if, but when) this company will be gone and don&#x27;t expect Amazon to help you, they are protected from liability just like ebay.

            <li> This product was completely liquified upon arrival. I have used this product before and it is supposed to be a white, creamy lotion. Instead, it was filled with a clear, watery liquid mixed with small, white globs of some substance. If you shook its container, it sounded like shaking a water bottle.  Who knows what was in there. Gross. I&#x27;ve asked for a refund or at least a replacement. We&#x27;ll see if they do the right thing.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite of all the image products. Cleans away all the dead skin and leaves my skin feeling soft. I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> Whenever I am having a super dry skin spell I use this, next day smooth as a babys butt!</li>
            <li> Product was as described and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Have been using the Image products for years and love them.</li>
            <li> The image c masque is easy and effortless to use. Only on your face for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Even after just one night of use I see a difference. The dry skin on my nose and red in my cheeks is gone.</li>
            <li> arrived faster than I imagined and product it priced right.  Image Skincare says not to order except to them that product could be tainted if not theirs, but I think they just are getting priced out by others.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time and as listed. A great product for use in the daytime.</li>
            <li> This works great and makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> Very good product! I use this along with the repair creme, so my skin feels great. I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love Vital C hydrating enzyme mask. My skin feels hydrated,  soft, and bright.</li>
            <li> Good Product  work well</li>
            <li> This masques works to refresh the skin and add moisture. The scent is pleasant and it&lt;br /&gt;feels gentle to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most wonderful smelling mask I have ever put on my face. Smells like a burst of fresh sweet oranges . It also makes my face feels so soft and refreshed.</li>
