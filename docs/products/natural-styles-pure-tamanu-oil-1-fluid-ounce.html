            <li>I purchased this product after hearing great things.</li>
            <li>Once again, the Tamanu Oil I bought on Amazon was great but does not seem to be 100% tamanu oil.</li>

            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this oil to me after successfully getting rid of toenail fungus by applying this oil to her toenails.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot of good information on the internet about the benefits of this oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this would be a good product to use on cuts and scrapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I work with a good twenty oils.</li>
            <li>Although it is great for diminishing any kind of scars or blemishes, I had an allergic reaction after putting it all over my face.</li>

            <li>NOT ANY MORE!</li>

            <li>You know all day I slather some kind oil on myself.</li>

            <li>It has a very strong nutty smell but that doesn&#x27;t linger if you wear it during the day.  </li>
            <li>Also great for burns, after the burning process is over, haven&#x27;t tried it on fresh burns yet......</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it really works, if you are faithful about using it!</li>
            <li>product, but not as strong or effective as Life-flow which I also purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I listen watch the Dr. Oz show from time to time and learn many interesting and helpful solutions to every day problems with health, eating, lossing weight, etc.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I learned about this oil.</li>
            <li>You learn more that what is said in an hour show, or</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m surprized as to how good this product really is.</li>
            <li>Smells strong, but you get used to it.  </li>

            <li>i&#x27;m itch free and+pimple free.</li>
            <li>Fantastic results...</li>
            <li>but Tamanu is much more effective and has many other qualities that it brings to the table than just moisturize and help with fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this oil</li>
            <li>So, it was eligible for free super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>It really makes a lovely face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>We staring using this fabulous product 2 years ago, it really, really works, my beautiful wife used to used real expensive creams for her face and hand lotion, but after read all the benefits from this oil, I asked her to give it a try, and she has been loving it, her sking is nice and smooth</li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant, just a nutty smell.&lt;br /&gt;Other recommendations:  </li>
            <li>Research is the key to better health!</li>
            <li>They are fading away to nothing fast!!  </li>
            <li>My skin has been calm ever since using it.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>The newer product I received was much thicker, went on smoother, feels better and keeps my skin much softer.    </li>
            <li>This is by far the most effective facial oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This one,  I saw a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>If you use it straight it washes out easy unlike straight olive oil.  </li>
            <li>This is the same product being sold at the health food stores I checked but at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>I received exactly the product I ordered.    </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I have many scars on my legs from various injuries and surgeries.  </li>
            <li>I read about this oil on internet and was willing to try almost anything at this rate.</li>
            <li>This oil does exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful but so expensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d done alot of research &amp; was interested in trying it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li>It just takes more than a couple of applications and for me it wasn&#x27;t the only thing I was doing to resolve the shingles.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a few months ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>While this is a sensitive area it healed quickly and helped with the inflamation and discomfort.</li>
            <li>I use a large pump bottle of olive oil to run</li>
            <li>I have used this product on two fairly large pieces of tattoo art.</li>
            <li>Pure Tamanu has a sort of milky consistency.  </li>
            <li>The 100% Pure Tamanu Oil really works.</li>
            <li>the 100% pure bottle - a much better price than available locally, which only offers the tree/olive oil mix at three times the cost here through amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I received this very promptly, and started using it immediately.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the real stuff and came with a factory seal and an expiration two years from now</li>
            <li>I find that this brush really cleans &amp; exfoliates &amp; allows products to penetrate the skin to do their job.</li>
            <li>I figured if it didn&#x27;t work out for my face, I could use it for one of the other many uses: cuts, burns, etc.     </li>
            <li>I purchased the Natural Styles 100% Pure Tamanu Oil from Direct Super Center(DAB Nutrition) because it was fulfilled by Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>, she had a surgery due to skin cancer in her nose, the scar mark from the surgery has vanished, now in winter time skin gets so dry, but using Tamanu oil had solve the issue..100% recommended, the product arrives on time and in good condition</li>
            <li>no result ,at all grape seed oil works better and cost 100 times less</li>
            <li>But when I received this oil, I noticed that it is way too clear to be 100% pure Tamanu Oil.</li>
            <li>I apply on my face at night before going to bed and has noticed that my skin is much clearer and is soft as butter.</li>
            <li>Mine weren&#x27;t much but in a 10x mirror I naturally freaked.  </li>
            <li>I might have put too much on, but it did clear up any sort of blemish scars i had</li>
            <li>You will instead receive New Chapter BLENDED Tamanu and Olive OIl.</li>
            <li>Wow, this oil matters!  </li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t experience that), but now she is completely pimple-free &amp; loves her skin!     </li>
            <li>Wow, was I surprised at the difference!</li>
            <li>great product; have tried other Tamanu products but this one is 100%; what a difference and a little goes a real long way.</li>
            <li>was too strong it caused my skin around my nose to become raw and peel.</li>
            <li>Although this oil is advertised to immediately clear up your skin, I didn&#x27;t see any changes at all.  </li>
            <li>I wake up with clear skin.</li>
            <li>I tryed it on an old scar on my face from a pimple and it faded the scar.</li>
            <li>The scar was about six months old.</li>
            <li>I am 20 years old and I still manage to get acne.  </li>
            <li>The oil is yellowish which im told real tamanu is greenish so it probably was mixed with something else.</li>
            <li>I have no new breakouts and my skin is consistently supple (not oily).</li>
            <li>Its  pleasant smell was reassuring initially but generous   applications have served to merely smell up my pillow   cases, not cure my dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Normally the red spot would hang around for over a month.  </li>
            <li>, I contacted  New Chapter Organics, the manufacturer, and I was informed that they only sell 100% Tamanu Oil in 1/2 ounce sizes.</li>
            <li>I use it with my regular facial moisturizer, and it has really helped in clearing blemishes and pimples.  </li>
            <li>I had an allergic reaction to red tattoo ink with my last tattoo; it became very raised, red &amp; itchy and even a couple lymph nodes near the tattoo became enlarged.</li>
            <li>The surgery lines, now, are barely visible.</li>
            <li>I have used Tamanu Oil for a year and most of these scars have decreased in visibility and in some cases, almost disappeared.</li>
            <li>First off i&#x27;d like to thank God for providing such simple yet powerful oil to cure  irritating even life bothersome diseases.</li>
            <li>During the time that I learned about Pure Tamanu Oil, my facial skin had become very rough and scaly for no aparent reason.</li>

            <li> Just a dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is not clear.  </li>

            <li> The product is a thick, green oil with a nutty aroma....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is faintly pine and medicinal at the same time.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I wake up with an almost matte-like finish to my face instead of the usually oiliness that develops overnight.     </li>
            <li> I applied the Tamanu Oil a couple of times a day for a few days and it is Cured!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> product, but not as strong or effective as Life-flow which I also purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Tamanu oil before, but I&#x27;ve read alot about it and decided to try it.  I use it with my regular facial moisturizer, and it has really helped in clearing blemishes and pimples.  Smells strong, but you get used to it.  I also some to my shea butter for an all over body cream.</li>
            <li> I listen watch the Dr. Oz show from time to time and learn many interesting and helpful solutions to every day problems with health, eating, lossing weight, etc. During the time that I learned about Pure Tamanu Oil, my facial skin had become very rough and scaly for no aparent reason. I did the same routine every day and 2 days a week sat in the gym&#x27;s sauna. I purchased the oil, it arrived quicker than I thought and I have been using it on a daily basis. Within a few weeks I noticed a change. I continued to use my toner, and moisturer but I would incorporate Tamanu Oil with it. My face feel wonderful! I don&#x27;t know why it got the way it was but I am glad I learned about this oil. It also has many other benefits and for best results per person, please do research. You learn more that what is said in an hour show, or page long article. Research is the key to better health! Thanks</li>
            <li> I have lived in the southwest all my life and have begun to notice the effects on my face.  I purchased this product after reading of its benefits.  After 2 months of use (about 1/2 bottle) I have noticed a decrease in \\&quot;squint\\&quot; lines around my eyes.  YAY for Tamanu Oil!!!</li>
            <li> The 100% Pure Tamanu Oil really works. I had a rash behind my ear for sometime the ointment the Doctor gave me didn&#x27;t clear it up, the Tamanu Oil did after using it for three weeks. I also had a rash around my nose and the Tamanu Oil was too strong it caused my skin around my nose to become raw and peel. I tryed it on an old scar on my face from a pimple and it faded the scar. The scar was about six months old.</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and I still manage to get acne.  Although this oil is advertised to immediately clear up your skin, I didn&#x27;t see any changes at all.  If you have acne that seems to be resistant to just about every product out there like mine then chances are this one won&#x27;t work for you either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this product a couple of times now.  The only problem I have is that it takes quite a while for my skin to absorb the oil.  So it makes my face look greasy when actually its taking a while to absorb.  Overall its a great product.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz suggested trying this on his show. I&#x27;m surprized as to how good this product really is. I have a ruddy complexion and this item has calmed my skin. I use it only once a day because my skin is oily and it just takes a very small amount!</li>
            <li> Having heard a little about the varied possibilities with Tamanu, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I received this very promptly, and started using it immediately.  I love how soft my skin feels every time I use it.  It has a nice nutty fragrance, which makes me want to be at the beach.</li>
            <li> I have dandruff that other potions haven&#x27;t helped so I  hoped Tamanu might succeed where they had failed.  Its  pleasant smell was reassuring initially but generous   applications have served to merely smell up my pillow   cases, not cure my dandruff.  In fairness, why should I   expect Tamanu to work on dandruff when that&#x27;s not its   defined purpose.      Doomed to Dandruff</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to red tattoo ink with my last tattoo; it became very raised, red &amp; itchy and even a couple lymph nodes near the tattoo became enlarged. My artist suggest this oil to apply to the tattoo 2-3 times daily. Within 2-3 days of using this product my tattoo was flat and back to normal; even my lymph nodes had gone down in size! I am sold on this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the item you will get when you order form them.You will instead receive New Chapter BLENDED Tamanu and Olive OIl. What a scam!!!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who makes and sells lotions told me about Tamanu Oil.  After checking out the prices in health food stores I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy any until I checked Amazon.  This is the same product being sold at the health food stores I checked but at a much better price.  There is a lot of good information on the internet about the benefits of this oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Natural Styles 100% Pure Tamanu Oil from Direct Super Center(DAB Nutrition) because it was fulfilled by Amazon.com. So, it was eligible for free super saver shipping. It arrived in a timely fashion, 6 days after ordering.    The product came sealed. It has a label on cap with a Best by date of 6/2012. It gives me almost 2 years to use the product. The product is a thick, green oil with a nutty aroma....and that is 100% Tamanu oil. I received exactly the product I ordered.    It really makes a lovely face moisturizer. And I put a little on cuticles. Great product.</li>
            <li> purchased from Herbspro and rec&#x27;vd the 100% pure bottle - a much better price than available locally, which only offers the tree/olive oil mix at three times the cost here through amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no seller notification about shipping until i asked, but item arrived well-packaged after ordering (8 days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the real stuff and came with a factory seal and an expiration two years from now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good stuff!</li>
            <li> First off i&#x27;d like to thank God for providing such simple yet powerful oil to cure  irritating even life bothersome diseases.I&#x27;ve had jock itch for 10+yrs,it&#x27;s been 2-3wks i&#x27;m itch free and+pimple free.Thank you Lord Jesus.</li>
            <li> This product was never received, although I did pay for it. Numerous inquiry to  the company and Amazon have gone unanswered.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading it would help fade acne scars. I&#x27;ve been using it every night for 2 weeks without any results. It actually made me break out :(</li>
            <li> This is my second order for Tamanu oil. I love this stuff! I had some surgery and have been putting this Tamanu oil on every day since the stitches came out. The surgery lines, now, are barely visible. I&#x27;ll keep this oil on hand from now on!</li>
            <li> Thought I must have read the description wrong after the 3 bottles I ordered showed up.    This product I received was Not 100% Tamanu oil. Instead it is a 1 OZ bottle that contains a half ounce of 100% Pure Tamanu oil and a half ounce of olive oil.    Item came with a different label and was not as pictured or promised.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Lives up to the claims. I have used it on scratches, dry skin, my psoriasis, and my son&#x27;s athletes foot. Fantastic results... and it decreased my son&#x27;s foot odor...a total bonus!!!  Also great for burns, after the burning process is over, haven&#x27;t tried it on fresh burns yet......</li>
            <li> I purchased Tamanu oil because Dr Manny on Fox News claimed that it helped people with toe fungus, which I have. I have used up one bottle and am working on my second bottle.  I believe it is going to take awhile but I see an inprovement in my nails.</li>
            <li> I had a couple pimples on my face, after using this at night they disappear gradually in about a week.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it really works, if you are faithful about using it! I have many scars on my legs from various injuries and surgeries.  I hated wearing anything that allowed these scars to show.  I have used Tamanu Oil for a year and most of these scars have decreased in visibility and in some cases, almost disappeared. The key is to use the produce faithfully.  If you only use it once a day, it will take a lot longer to show improvement.  I use it two, sometimes three time a day and it definitely works!  I have also recommended it to others and they tell me that it is working for them, too.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this oil to me after successfully getting rid of toenail fungus by applying this oil to her toenails.  She said it took 3 days to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought to use on my Mom&#x27;s toenails.  It didn&#x27;t work for her yet but she&#x27;s had this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying to her toenails I got the oil on my thumb.  I had a thin cut which had been burning and pulling on my thumb.  I never thought about the cut again after applying the oil.  The next day when I did I noticed the cut area had healed over and remember not thinking about the cut at all after the oil application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this would be a good product to use on cuts and scrapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is faintly pine and medicinal at the same time.  I did not find the smell unpleasant.</li>
            <li> after 2 months &#x3D; no result ,at all grape seed oil works better and cost 100 times less</li>
            <li> I have had a rash that was progressly getting worst.I have had for over 3 years no antibiotics or acne creams or washes helped.I read about this oil on internet and was willing to try almost anything at this rate. I hate the smell and color of the oil but have seen a improvement well using.I ran out and noticed the rash coming back.So ,I&#x27;m going to try the soap bar now, I heard it smells better</li>
            <li> great product; have tried other Tamanu products but this one is 100%; what a difference and a little goes a real long way.</li>
            <li> This oil does exactly as described.  It&#x27;s wonderful but so expensive.  Just a dab goes a long way.  I apply on my face at night before going to bed and has noticed that my skin is much clearer and is soft as butter.</li>
            <li> I am a soap maker and I make my living out of knowing oils. I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this oil so I tried it.  I always have to &#x60;see for myself.&#x27;  I will not live without this oil again! I am 58 as I write this and &#x60;starting&#x27; to show the signs of aging.  Wow, this oil matters!  You know all day I slather some kind oil on myself. If I get some on my hand as I am making soap it will go on my face or arms before I will wash it off. I work with a good twenty oils. This one,  I saw a difference right away.  My crow&#x27;s feet are GONE!  My face looks much more youthful all together and if I am to get a break out (yes it never ends) the zit is gone within a day and the redness is gone within a few days after that.  Normally the red spot would hang around for over a month.  I have noticed that any brown spots on my face are fading. Mine weren&#x27;t much but in a 10x mirror I naturally freaked.  They are fading away to nothing fast!!  Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive 100% Tamanu oil.  While it may seem expensive it goes a very long way.  It has a very strong nutty smell but that doesn&#x27;t linger if you wear it during the day.  It is not unpleasant, just a nutty smell.&lt;br /&gt;Other recommendations:  Peach Kernel oil I also saw results with and had no real smell to it but Tamanu is much more effective and has many other qualities that it brings to the table than just moisturize and help with fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;For hair, jojoba hands down.  If you use it straight it washes out easy unlike straight olive oil.  You can&#x27;t beat Olive oil for moisturizing period but for hair, coconut oil or jojoba.  I use a large pump bottle of olive oil to run all move me after my shower.  Tamanu for my face and jojoba or coconut oil (or cream) for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It helps with acne, sun spots and eazor bumps.  I use it after waxing my face to eliminate redness etc.</li>
            <li> Great item if this is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> The tamanu oil never took away my inflamation on my face like it claimed it does. The oil is yellowish which im told real tamanu is greenish so it probably was mixed with something else.</li>
            <li> The product was sold as 100% Tamanu Oil, and it was labeled as such on the box, but on the bottle, the ingredients were listed as 50% Tamanu Oil, 50% Olive Oil, I contacted  New Chapter Organics, the manufacturer, and I was informed that they only sell 100% Tamanu Oil in 1/2 ounce sizes. I contacted Amazon, and they immediately refunded my money.  I&#x27;m a cautious on-line shopper, but I will do more and all with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have to say, Ive never heard of Tamanu oil anywhere until recently while surfing the web looking for a homepathic remedy for skincare.  I am happy I came across this product. My skin has been calm ever since using it. I suffer with temperamental skin battling everything from oily skin, dry skin, cystic acne, blackheads, whiteheads, scarring, and blemishes. No chemical product has ever worked for me it only made it worse. I have no new breakouts and my skin is consistently supple (not oily). I even have a glow. I see the even skin tone appearing and I have a lot of confidence that this product is for keeps.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after hearing great things. Although it is great for diminishing any kind of scars or blemishes, I had an allergic reaction after putting it all over my face. I might have put too much on, but it did clear up any sort of blemish scars i had</li>
            <li> I ordered my tamanu oil on a Thursday &amp; received it Friday. I&#x27;d done alot of research &amp; was interested in trying it. I figured if it didn&#x27;t work out for my face, I could use it for one of the other many uses: cuts, burns, etc.     I basically use the oil at night after brushing my face w/a Clarisonic brush. I find that this brush really cleans &amp; exfoliates &amp; allows products to penetrate the skin to do their job. I was skeptical about using oil on my face b/c my skin is EXTREMELY oily. I use a tiny amount &amp; spread it over my face &amp; neck. I am 37 &amp; I usually have at least 2-3 pimples on my face at all times. No matter what I do or try, I always wake up with a couple of tiny whitheads on my chin or cheek. NOT ANY MORE! On the nights that I use the tamanu oil (I&#x27;ve forgotten on a couple of occasions) I wake up with clear skin. I have probably had about 4 pimples in the month or so since I&#x27;ve started using tamanu oil--due to hormones &amp; forgetting the oil.     This stuff is AMAZING! It is not at all greasy or oil. In fact, I wake up with an almost matte-like finish to my face instead of the usually oiliness that develops overnight.     My friend just ordered some &amp; thanked me profusely for recommending it. She did have some initial breakout when she started using it (I didn&#x27;t experience that), but now she is completely pimple-free &amp; loves her skin!     ***the only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because it is not 100% tamanu oil, it contains olive oil***</li>
            <li> I had a scaly break out on my face.  I applied the Tamanu Oil a couple of times a day for a few days and it is Cured!  It has not come back.  I use it for all type skin conditions!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Really great product! Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago and loved it. However, the Seller was out this go around and I had to order from another auction site.    Wow, was I surprised at the difference! The newer product I received was much thicker, went on smoother, feels better and keeps my skin much softer.    Once again, the Tamanu Oil I bought on Amazon was great but does not seem to be 100% tamanu oil. I advise any purchasers to shop around before buying from this Seller.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on two fairly large pieces of tattoo art. The last was a piece on my chest. While this is a sensitive area it healed quickly and helped with the inflamation and discomfort.</li>
            <li> This oil is a wonder cure for all types of skin issues. It promotes healing and prevents infection. I have used it for a wound that would not heal (diabetes) and it closed up to the amazement of the doctor. Best price anywhere.</li>
            <li> We staring using this fabulous product 2 years ago, it really, really works, my beautiful wife used to used real expensive creams for her face and hand lotion, but after read all the benefits from this oil, I asked her to give it a try, and she has been loving it, her sking is nice and smooth, she had a surgery due to skin cancer in her nose, the scar mark from the surgery has vanished, now in winter time skin gets so dry, but using Tamanu oil had solve the issue..100% recommended, the product arrives on time and in good condition</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend and she liked it</li>
            <li> I purchased  this for shingles and its didn&#x27;t do anything to help.I purchased  this for shingles and its didn&#x27;t do anything to help.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to some investigation for shingles (herpy virus). I found the oil to do as advertised. It just takes more than a couple of applications and for me it wasn&#x27;t the only thing I was doing to resolve the shingles. I will always keep some on hand as ost do once they have tried it out.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most effective facial oil I have ever used. It&#x27;s a staple with me. I like the nutty scent and the results are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> very nice i think its working on my feet on my heels thank you i was looking at it this morning thinking about ordering more almost out</li>
            <li> I have been using Tamanu Oil for quite some time and I Love It!  But when I received this oil, I noticed that it is way too clear to be 100% pure Tamanu Oil. Pure Tamanu has a sort of milky consistency.  It is not clear.  After reading other reviews, I have come to find out that it is only 50% Tamanu Oil and 50% Olive Oil.  I will not buy this brand again.</li>
