            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>It definitely is amazing bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>And it does a nice job of holding the curls and keeping my hair from frizzing.</li>
            <li>This was lighter than I liked, it seemed as if nothing was in my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>Love love love this mousse!</li>
            <li>So happy to find an alcohol free styling product that enhances my curls and makes my hair bouncy &amp; super shiny!</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal has made one girl incredibly happy (my wallet&#x27;s pretty stoked too).</li>
            <li>how many fragrances can we wear in one day?</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t purchase this again, it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I love this mousse.  </li>
            <li>And to makes this product even greater</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to cruelty-free, awesome curly hair that takes only moments to style.</li>
            <li>but it is ok.</li>
            <li>This mousse is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Gets the most curl in my hair.</li>
            <li>favorite thing about the mousse is how lightweight it is.</li>
            <li>I love this mousse.</li>
            <li>Even if you get caught in the rain pushing and shaping your lhair will restore most of your style.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Back to perfect pantene (except the chemicals)</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>The gel adds more definition.  </li>
            <li>I received so many compliments on my curls.  </li>
            <li>As for the scent, my friends are always commenting on how pretty my hair smells -- it&#x27;s kind of fruity, yet kind of flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When its dry, my hair looks great!</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free makes it all the more appealing.</li>
            <li>Can not say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>The smell is very potent, I was quite surprised by how strong it was!</li>
            <li>Anyway, for my 3b, fine, medium dense hair this was way too sticky and flaky.</li>
            <li>I typically dont use any kind mousse because it makes my hair crunchy: SNAP KRACKLE POP!!!</li>
            <li>but luckily they worked ok.</li>
            <li>and if I used more it makes my hair super sticky.</li>
            <li>It literally smells like cheap 1970&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>The others are not alcohol free and for me that seems to make the difference.</li>
            <li>smells great, no white residue</li>
            <li>It leaves my shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>First, I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>This alcohol-free mousse is just light enough but gives my waves perfect definition with a soft hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for my natural Afro-hair for over a year now because it is so much more moisturizing than most other mousse, and my hair looks and smells great.</li>
            <li>is very light and scrunches out easily, leaving perfectly soft waves.</li>
            <li>If you do use too much, your hair will get crunchy, but that&#x27;s true of most products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing at combating natural frizz that comes with curly hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>spraying a dollop in my palm, I rub my hands together well and scrunch up my hair, being sure not to put too much product on the crown of my head.  </li>
            <li>I simply squeeze the excess water out of my hair after washing and apply a good amount of the mousse everywhere except my roots.</li>
            <li>nice soft curl without a sticky crunchy feel.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many mousses and this is currently my fav.</li>
            <li>While it certainly adds volume, it makes my baby fine hair greasy</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>My local Walmart and Target stores no longer carry it, so I&#x27;m glad that I can buy it on Amazon instead!</li>
            <li>Product seems to work fine, but the scent is a bit much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for about 3 months, and I&#x27;m still getting the same amazing results every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sure miss the old Dove Damage Therapy Curl and Sculpt.</li>
            <li>It actually is kinda nice if you ask me.</li>
            <li>That problem went away pretty quickly once I switched to this.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I wasn&#x27;t impressed because I need something that will weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>Not only is it extremely strong and pungent, it is a cheap smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great for my naturally curly hair without the crunch of other mousse.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I didn&#x27;t get any frizz whatsoever with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of hair gel &amp; mousse &amp; all made my hair frizzy &amp; crunchy.</li>
            <li>Gives my curls more definition and a boost which is more than I got from much more expensive curl products.</li>
            <li>Can let it dry by itself or blow dry to get more volume and more curls on top (the length of my hair caused air drying to weigh down and have fewer curls on top).  </li>
            <li>It is so nice to see the natural shine back in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a really hard time getting my hair to curl successfully.</li>
            <li>I like it best because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and wet looking.</li>
            <li>For years, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything under the sun, which has been hell on my wallet and patience (and</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair (Type 3A), and this product works great for everyday use!  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal has a large line of hair products, and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight and fine and this gives it enough body and tackiness to beef it up when using a blow dryer and create the closest things to curls my hair will allow when scrunching with fingers.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately this was more money wasted trying to find the perfect product for my curls.</li>
            <li>(which i didn&#x27;t really want).</li>
            <li>Alcohol-free, this product defines my curls and fights frizz very well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ready to go ahead and get rid of it...</li>
            <li>It also did NOT work very well in humidity.</li>
            <li>This product really did make my hair more curly and helped to define the curls when I let my hair dry naturally, without using a blow-dryer.  </li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t like this particular smell or are sensitive to scent, you may want to find something else because it&#x27;s pretty fragrant and the smell lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>So like many say the fragrance is a little much.</li>
            <li>Smelled nice and did not make my hair uncomfortably crunchy, but curl-holding smooth.</li>
            <li>Start out with less than what you might normally use with an more airy mousse.</li>
            <li>This mousse is a real help in styling my hair, and leaves it soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using a normal amount</li>
            <li>I have very fine wavy (2b) hair, and most other curl setting gels weigh it down too much or dry out the ends.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for a Amazon Prime or Subscribe and Save product, but I&#x27;m done trying new mousse products for the time being.</li>
            <li>I got a new cut that is still below shoulders but is now layered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts all day and leaves me with very soft, shiny curls.  </li>
            <li>My hair tends to draw up and out when it dries and this time was no different other than the fact my curls were more defined.</li>
            <li>Alcoholic free!</li>
            <li>I shook it really well as the can said to, but after the first use or two, it acted like it was empty.</li>
            <li>Activates curls and leaves them soft and shiny, not stiff and crunchy at all.</li>
            <li>My curls weren&#x27;t soft and did not hold well.</li>
            <li>It leaves your curls springey and soft but holds them in.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a natural feel and look.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day even in the southern humidity, and it&#x27;s not crunchy unless you apply too much.  </li>
            <li>Leaves curls soft and managable but not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I got this product because I wanted something to enhance my natural waves/curls without the drying and damaging effects of alcohol.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use a ton, either -- it may feel like you&#x27;re not putting much into your hair, especially when it dissolves, but you are.</li>
            <li>soft smell.</li>
            <li>OMG I naturally have curly hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, so I can tell if a product works with or against my natural curls.  </li>
            <li>I had to run my fingers through the curls to relax them into more of a wave (which is what I prefer for my hair because my thin hair&#x27;s curls tend to look very 90&#x27;s perm-ish).</li>
            <li>and I noticed the L&#x27;Oreal Curl Activating Mousse was super marked down.</li>
            <li>They need to calm down a little with the fragrance and find one that isn&#x27;t so cheap.</li>
            <li>I really thought L&#x27;oreal would be pretty much the same if not better.  </li>
            <li>This product worked ok (not great), but it felt like the can was still half full and nothing would come out anymore</li>
            <li>Can blow dry straight.  </li>
            <li>Each time it got very runny after a short time and even though it felt like there was plenty left</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold my curls very well, and it left my naturally curly (and naturally dry) hair feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>Considering I have put straight oil on my hair before as conditioner, this is pretty hard to do.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if I used this right</li>
            <li>This obviously won&#x27;t work for everyone but it left my long hair soft and manageable without &amp;#34;crunch.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The next day, I scrunched my hair really quickly with it and was shocked a few hours later to find my hair dried in gorgeous, soft, bouncy curls.</li>

            <li> Great for my naturally curly hair without the crunch of other mousse.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I didn&#x27;t get any frizz whatsoever with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of hair gel &amp; mousse &amp; all made my hair frizzy &amp; crunchy.</li>
            <li> Gives my curls more definition and a boost which is more than I got from much more expensive curl products.</li>
            <li> Can let it dry by itself or blow dry to get more volume and more curls on top (the length of my hair caused air drying to weigh down and have fewer curls on top).  </li>
            <li> It is so nice to see the natural shine back in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time getting my hair to curl successfully.</li>
            <li> I like it best because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and wet looking.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything under the sun, which has been hell on my wallet and patience (and</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair (Type 3A), and this product works great for everyday use!  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal has a large line of hair products, and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight and fine and this gives it enough body and tackiness to beef it up when using a blow dryer and create the closest things to curls my hair will allow when scrunching with fingers.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was more money wasted trying to find the perfect product for my curls.</li>
            <li> (which i didn&#x27;t really want).</li>
            <li> Alcohol-free, this product defines my curls and fights frizz very well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ready to go ahead and get rid of it...</li>
            <li> It also did NOT work very well in humidity.</li>
            <li> This product really did make my hair more curly and helped to define the curls when I let my hair dry naturally, without using a blow-dryer.  </li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t like this particular smell or are sensitive to scent, you may want to find something else because it&#x27;s pretty fragrant and the smell lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> So like many say the fragrance is a little much.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice and did not make my hair uncomfortably crunchy, but curl-holding smooth.</li>
            <li> Start out with less than what you might normally use with an more airy mousse.</li>
            <li> This mousse is a real help in styling my hair, and leaves it soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using a normal amount</li>
            <li> I have very fine wavy (2b) hair, and most other curl setting gels weigh it down too much or dry out the ends.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a Amazon Prime or Subscribe and Save product, but I&#x27;m done trying new mousse products for the time being.</li>
            <li> I got a new cut that is still below shoulders but is now layered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts all day and leaves me with very soft, shiny curls.  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to draw up and out when it dries and this time was no different other than the fact my curls were more defined.</li>
            <li> Alcoholic free!</li>
            <li> I shook it really well as the can said to, but after the first use or two, it acted like it was empty.</li>
            <li> Activates curls and leaves them soft and shiny, not stiff and crunchy at all.</li>
            <li> My curls weren&#x27;t soft and did not hold well.</li>
            <li> It leaves your curls springey and soft but holds them in.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a natural feel and look.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day even in the southern humidity, and it&#x27;s not crunchy unless you apply too much.  </li>
            <li> Leaves curls soft and managable but not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I wanted something to enhance my natural waves/curls without the drying and damaging effects of alcohol.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a ton, either -- it may feel like you&#x27;re not putting much into your hair, especially when it dissolves, but you are.</li>
            <li> soft smell.</li>
            <li> OMG I naturally have curly hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so I can tell if a product works with or against my natural curls.  </li>
            <li> I had to run my fingers through the curls to relax them into more of a wave (which is what I prefer for my hair because my thin hair&#x27;s curls tend to look very 90&#x27;s perm-ish).</li>
            <li> and I noticed the L&#x27;Oreal Curl Activating Mousse was super marked down.</li>
            <li> They need to calm down a little with the fragrance and find one that isn&#x27;t so cheap.</li>
            <li> I really thought L&#x27;oreal would be pretty much the same if not better.  </li>
            <li> This product worked ok (not great), but it felt like the can was still half full and nothing would come out anymore</li>
            <li> Can blow dry straight.  </li>
            <li> Each time it got very runny after a short time and even though it felt like there was plenty left</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my curls very well, and it left my naturally curly (and naturally dry) hair feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> Considering I have put straight oil on my hair before as conditioner, this is pretty hard to do.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I used this right</li>
            <li> This obviously won&#x27;t work for everyone but it left my long hair soft and manageable without &amp;#34;crunch.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The next day, I scrunched my hair really quickly with it and was shocked a few hours later to find my hair dried in gorgeous, soft, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> ; curly hair, that is also long, fine, and thin.  </li>
            <li> I applied it to towel dried, damp hair and combed thru and scrunched a little and then used a diffuser to dry my hair and my hair was SUPER curly.</li>
            <li> Just be careful how much you use, because it can get a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Left my hair very dry</li>
            <li> It does not dry your hair out like other products do.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural curl without making it too fluffy .</li>
            <li> Brushed when wet and applied mousse.</li>
            <li> I am going to use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found them all much too heavy for my hair, weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I mean really...</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve used just didn&#x27;t have enough oomph.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t touch again till dry</li>
            <li> I use it on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, and I apply it dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair may be curly, but it isn&#x27;t dry, so I don&#x27;t require something so emollient to style with.</li>
            <li> The gel cast when dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair anymore.  </li>
            <li> Just air dry &amp;</li>
            <li> would recommend this mousse to people with thick, coarse, naturally wavy or curly hair.  </li>
            <li> use it over my wet or dry hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A tiny bit does the job, without making it feel stiff or dry.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few curl activators that actually works.  </li>
            <li> This makes your hair look wet all day.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder and harder to find, so I fear L&#x27;Oreal has stopped producing it.</li>
            <li> Not really for me</li>
            <li> Until I switched to this mousse, my hair was drying out from using the other styling gels &amp; mouses that I tried.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do as well as some other products probably would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other mousse products and nothing compares to the L&#x27;Oreal Paris everstyle curl activating  mousse.</li>
            <li> Not even other L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> my husband does not want me using parabeens and other things</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s less damaging compared to other mousse that do have alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Controls the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> but this product was average in my view.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly, VERY HEAVY 3A hair.</li>
            <li> If I do, it will weigh it down and almost look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to use this with the EverStyle Curl Defining Gel in small doses (a little goes a long way for the gel) for additional defining.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is that of a typically mousse yet creamier.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> Not good for my hair because it I also color iit regularly.</li>
            <li> This product is thick, and the can lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or heavy, and it cuts down on a lot of the frizz.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair a little sticky and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I like this for my permed hair but it stays a little crunchy.  </li>
            <li> These are my 2 go-to hair products...after being on the hunt for my crazy hair for my whole life (42 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up mixing it will a holding cream that I thought was too heavy, and</li>
            <li> Once I discovered this product I stopped using anything else for everyday.  </li>
            <li> The one things this product excels in is volume when blow dried.</li>
            <li> I have mostly straight hair that has gotten an annoying wave in the back.</li>
            <li> but my hair is a little stiff compared to a paste type product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have fluffy, frizzy hair than stiff, stanky hair, thank you.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky and stiff</li>
            <li> this product is not sticky or stiff but gives my curls the lift they need.  </li>
            <li> It did not make my hair too stiff, either, like some others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to wash, or at least wet</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it helps define the waves and helps tame the frizz..</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t find it bad at all when dried though.</li>
            <li> hair is so hard to control that I don&#x27;t mind a little crunch.  </li>
            <li> It enhances/solidifies curls, and doesn&#x27;t cause excessive frizz.</li>
            <li> After my hair dried, I did notice that the product defined my curls and it was not crunchy in the least.</li>
            <li> It air dried in 10 minutes and was CURLY!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and makes hair frizzy when used in small amounts</li>
            <li> ...lets just say, the company went overboard when they added the fragrance.</li>
            <li> If they ever stop making this one I am in serious trouble.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried using hardly any.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Still straight with annoying wave.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed with this mousse.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to find in the stores now...why!?</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair, so when this drys, it makes my hair hold</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a bit less expensive than Target!!</li>
            <li> It makes me feel ill.</li>
            <li> This smells weird and it does not define my curls at all</li>
            <li> Weird smell, and leaves the ubiquitous crunchy-sticky residue that is the bane of all curly-haired folk.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> They all disappointed, and some were even twice the price.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what mouse is supposed to do :(</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t walk around with crazy hair like... hello?!</li>
            <li> THIS cheapo crap is what does it for my hair?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It probably works well with some but horrible with others.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is one of the few curl activators that actually works.  My hair is straight and fine and this gives it enough body and tackiness to beef it up when using a blow dryer and create the closest things to curls my hair will allow when scrunching with fingers.  Other products I&#x27;ve used just didn&#x27;t have enough oomph.</li>
            <li> While it certainly adds volume, it makes my baby fine hair greasy so I have to wash every day when I use this product.  Because of that factor, I will not purchase again when I am finished with the four cans I bought.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this mousse to people with thick, coarse, naturally wavy or curly hair.  Fine-haired ladies, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I used this right but this product was average in my view.  I have thick wavy hair.  My curls weren&#x27;t soft and did not hold well.</li>
            <li> Worked great with my hair. Smelled nice and did not make my hair uncomfortably crunchy, but curl-holding smooth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this mousse! So happy to find an alcohol free styling product that enhances my curls and makes my hair bouncy &amp; super shiny! Price was great too! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This product worked ok (not great), but it felt like the can was still half full and nothing would come out anymore so I had to throw it away.  I shook it really well as the can said to, but after the first use or two, it acted like it was empty.</li>
            <li> Bought this when I was delighted to find this isn&#x27;t tested on animals nor does it have alcohol. can&#x27;t remember if it has silicones. Anyway, for my 3b, fine, medium dense hair this was way too sticky and flaky. the fragrance is nauseating I don&#x27;t understand why these commercial products are loaded with fragrances. how many fragrances can we wear in one day? It makes me feel ill. Unfortunately this was more money wasted trying to find the perfect product for my curls. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Until I switched to this mousse, my hair was drying out from using the other styling gels &amp; mouses that I tried.  That problem went away pretty quickly once I switched to this.  And it does a nice job of holding the curls and keeping my hair from frizzing.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase this again, it&#x27;s just ok. Leaves my hair a little sticky and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Cans were all dented up but luckily they worked ok.</li>
            <li> This smells weird and it does not define my curls at all</li>
            <li> I love this mousse.  It helps keep my curls together without leaving it sticky or crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spraying a dollop in my palm, I rub my hands together well and scrunch up my hair, being sure not to put too much product on the crown of my head.  If I do, it will weigh it down and almost look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts all day and leaves me with very soft, shiny curls.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Gives great curls and bounce. Doesnt leave hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;. For $5 I am thrilled!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well, didn&#x27;t help my curls at all</li>
            <li> This was lighter than I liked, it seemed as if nothing was in my hair. It did not seem to hold my curls well throughout the day. I ended up mixing it will a holding cream that I thought was too heavy, and combining them seemed to work well.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time getting my hair to curl successfully. After trying a couple different mousses, I will only use this one. It enhances/solidifies curls, and doesn&#x27;t cause excessive frizz. If you do use too much, your hair will get crunchy, but that&#x27;s true of most products. It also smells good.</li>
            <li> This product is thick, and the can lasts a long time. I have very thick curly hair, so when this drys, it makes my hair hold it&#x27;s natural curl without making it too fluffy . It does not dry your hair out like other products do.</li>
            <li> I typically dont use any kind mousse because it makes my hair crunchy: SNAP KRACKLE POP!!! But i figured Id give this a try. The consistency is that of a typically mousse yet creamier. The smell is very potent, I was quite surprised by how strong it was! After my hair dried, I did notice that the product defined my curls and it was not crunchy in the least. Overall, I wasn&#x27;t impressed because I need something that will weigh my hair down. My hair tends to draw up and out when it dries and this time was no different other than the fact my curls were more defined. I would suggest this mousse for people who have softer textures of curls who also like some body as well as movement. If you need something that will give some weight to your curls because of the texture, you should go with something else.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this mousse everywhere.  Walgreens used to carry it but has discontinued it in their stores.  It is one of the best mousses out there.  It leaves your curls springey and soft but holds them in.  I usually have to wash, or at least wet, my hair in the morning to push it back into shape; however, this mousse held so well, that when I got up, I just had to brush my hair and I was good to go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know.  I;m finally over my assumption that I can find a L&#x27;oreal mousse that isn&#x27;t sticky and gummy.  Have a collection now of mousses I&#x27;ll never use.  I like the Dove curl activating mousse and the Tresemme extra body mousse, so I really thought L&#x27;oreal would be pretty much the same if not better.  I&#x27;ve tried using a normal amount and I&#x27;ve tried using hardly any.  Was hoping for a Amazon Prime or Subscribe and Save product, but I&#x27;m done trying new mousse products for the time being.</li>
            <li> I prefer something lighter.  This is for someone who has some curl in their hair i think - just try it</li>
            <li> I have mostly straight hair that has gotten an annoying wave in the back. I got a new cut that is still below shoulders but is now layered. Still straight with annoying wave. Can blow dry straight.  Tried this mousse today. Wonderful! I forgot to use conditioner. Brushed when wet and applied mousse. Scrunched hair with fingers. It air dried in 10 minutes and was CURLY!  Holy cow! This stuff is great! Just don&#x27;t touch again till dry and it turns out great!  And to makes this product even greater: it is vegan and not tested on animals.  I am looking forward to cruelty-free, awesome curly hair that takes only moments to style.</li>
            <li> I like this for my permed hair but it stays a little crunchy.  I prefer a natural feel and look.  This makes your hair look wet all day.</li>
            <li> Perfect mousse for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Great for permed curly hair.</li>
            <li> Weird smell, and leaves the ubiquitous crunchy-sticky residue that is the bane of all curly-haired folk. I sure miss the old Dove Damage Therapy Curl and Sculpt. I&#x27;ve resorted to going without mousse entirely. I&#x27;d rather have fluffy, frizzy hair than stiff, stanky hair, thank you.</li>
            <li> I am going to use this for a long time. It smells a bit like cologne in your hand but that smell fades in the hair. It does everything people here said. It holds without making hair crispy nor greasy. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Product seems to work fine, but the scent is a bit much. I like the smell of Aussie brand products, so if you do too then you won&#x27;t like the flowery smell of this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mousse!  Once I discovered this product I stopped using anything else for everyday.  I have naturally curly hair (Type 3A), and this product works great for everyday use!  I use it on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, and I apply it dry.  It lasts all day even in the southern humidity, and it&#x27;s not crunchy unless you apply too much.  It&#x27;s amazing at combating natural frizz that comes with curly hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local retail stores in my area quit carrying this product, so I tried several name brand salon products that were much more expensive to try and replace this one.  They all disappointed, and some were even twice the price.  Now I just buy this one exclusively through Amazon online.  If they ever stop making this one I am in serious trouble.  It definitely is amazing bang for your buck.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend a better mousse to anyone!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and makes hair frizzy when used in small amounts and if I used more it makes my hair super sticky.</li>
            <li> This obviously won&#x27;t work for everyone but it left my long hair soft and manageable without &amp;#34;crunch.&amp;#34;  And it&#x27;s a bit less expensive than Target!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky and stiff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for my natural Afro-hair for over a year now because it is so much more moisturizing than most other mousse, and my hair looks and smells great. It is getting harder and harder to find, so I fear L&#x27;Oreal has stopped producing it. Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> Left my hair very dry</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Loreal EverStyle Curl Activating Mousse...lets just say, the company went overboard when they added the fragrance. Not only is it extremely strong and pungent, it is a cheap smelling fragrance. It literally smells like cheap 1970&#x27;s perfume. I actually had a coworker ask if someone had recently spray air freshener...it was MY HAIR! They need to calm down a little with the fragrance and find one that isn&#x27;t so cheap. I mean really...Air Freshener?</li>
            <li> So like many say the fragrance is a little much. I really don&#x27;t find it bad at all when dried though. It actually is kinda nice if you ask me. It probably works well with some but horrible with others. I thought the hold could have been quite a bit stronger but then again you don&#x27;t want it sticky. I was looking for this to bring out some waves but it didn&#x27;t do as well as some other products probably would. The one things this product excels in is volume when blow dried. (which i didn&#x27;t really want). Not really for me but it is ok.</li>
            <li> This product has been a miracle for me! I have very thick, very curly, VERY HEAVY 3A hair. I&#x27;ve used all the oils, creams, serums directed toward curly hair and I&#x27;ve found them all much too heavy for my hair, weighing it down. My hair may be curly, but it isn&#x27;t dry, so I don&#x27;t require something so emollient to style with. This mousse is fantastic! Alcohol-free, this product defines my curls and fights frizz very well. I simply squeeze the excess water out of my hair after washing and apply a good amount of the mousse everywhere except my roots. When its dry, my hair looks great! I find that I still have great second-day hair too. I can&#x27;t praise L&#x27;Oreal Paris Everstyle Curl Activating Mousse enough! The fact that it&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free makes it all the more appealing. Definitely 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This mousse is a real help in styling my hair, and leaves it soft and silky.  A tiny bit does the job, without making it feel stiff or dry.  L&#x27;Oreal has a large line of hair products, and this is one of my favorites.  It also helps with fly away hair.  It is so nice to see the natural shine back in my hair.</li>
            <li> Since the product is Alcohol-Free it&#x27;s great and doesn&#x27;t damage the hair.</li>
            <li> Love love love this mousse! I have tried many many mousses and this is currently my fav. Leaves curls soft and managable but not frizzy. Will def continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Gets the most curl in my hair.</li>
            <li> Non drying, curl forming. great scent. fast shipping! Can not say enough good things about this product! Love it!! will buy again!</li>
            <li> I got this product because I wanted something to enhance my natural waves/curls without the drying and damaging effects of alcohol. First, I love the smell of this. However, if you don&#x27;t like this particular smell or are sensitive to scent, you may want to find something else because it&#x27;s pretty fragrant and the smell lasts for quite awhile. That being said, it does what it says. Activates curls and leaves them soft and shiny, not stiff and crunchy at all. It almost made my hair TOO curly. I applied it to towel dried, damp hair and combed thru and scrunched a little and then used a diffuser to dry my hair and my hair was SUPER curly. I had to run my fingers through the curls to relax them into more of a wave (which is what I prefer for my hair because my thin hair&#x27;s curls tend to look very 90&#x27;s perm-ish). This is the first product that I didn&#x27;t get any frizz whatsoever with. Just be careful how much you use, because it can get a bit heavy. Start out with less than what you might normally use with an more airy mousse. This one tends to be on the thicker side. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Finding a curl definer/enhancer has been an exercise in futility. For years, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything under the sun, which has been hell on my wallet and patience (and my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in Ulta one day and I noticed the L&#x27;Oreal Curl Activating Mousse was super marked down. I thought, &amp;#34;Oh, why not&amp;#34; and bought it. The next day, I scrunched my hair really quickly with it and was shocked a few hours later to find my hair dried in gorgeous, soft, bouncy curls. They were perfect, AND they smelled great. I figured it was a fluke, but nope! The next time I washed my hair, I got the same results. I was like, &amp;#34;You&#x27;ve gotta be freaking kidding me. THIS cheapo crap is what does it for my hair?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about the mousse is how lightweight it is. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or heavy, and it cuts down on a lot of the frizz. Don&#x27;t use a ton, either -- it may feel like you&#x27;re not putting much into your hair, especially when it dissolves, but you are. Trust me on this. As for the scent, my friends are always commenting on how pretty my hair smells -- it&#x27;s kind of fruity, yet kind of flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2C/3A curls and this mousse has been a godsend. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for about 3 months, and I&#x27;m still getting the same amazing results every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend it enough! L&#x27;Oreal has made one girl incredibly happy (my wallet&#x27;s pretty stoked too).</li>
            <li> this product is not sticky or stiff but gives my curls the lift they need.  i would recommend this product to anyone with wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it helps define the waves and helps tame the frizz.. I like it best because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and wet looking. Alcoholic free!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.  I&#x27;ve tried it twice and both times my hair was frizz-city! I might give it one last try but I&#x27;m ready to go ahead and get rid of it...</li>
            <li> I love this mousse. I&#x27;ve used it it for several years and haven&#x27;t had a perm since I started using it. I used to get two or three a year. Not good for my hair because it I also color iit regularly. I&#x27;ve used other mousse products and nothing compares to the L&#x27;Oreal Paris everstyle curl activating  mousse. Not even other L&#x27;Oreal products. The others are not alcohol free and for me that seems to make the difference. Even if you get caught in the rain pushing and shaping your lhair will restore most of your style.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it does not have alcohol and the product helps style my hair.  It does hold well but my hair is a little stiff compared to a paste type product.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.  Doesn&#x27;t hold my curls very well, and it left my naturally curly (and naturally dry) hair feeling oily.  Considering I have put straight oil on my hair before as conditioner, this is pretty hard to do.  But this one did it.  It also did NOT work very well in humidity.</li>
            <li> Happy with this mousse.&lt;br /&gt;I use it over my wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;No alcohol so it&#x27;s less damaging compared to other mousse that do have alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Controls the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Nice soft smell.</li>
            <li> Great for my naturally curly hair without the crunch of other mousse. Plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have very fine wavy (2b) hair, and most other curl setting gels weigh it down too much or dry out the ends. This alcohol-free mousse is just light enough but gives my waves perfect definition with a soft hold. The gel cast when dry is very light and scrunches out easily, leaving perfectly soft waves. My local Walmart and Target stores no longer carry it, so I&#x27;m glad that I can buy it on Amazon instead!</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol but the scent smells like baby powder..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what mouse is supposed to do :( hold my hair in perfect curls... Back to perfect pantene (except the chemicals) my husband does not want me using parabeens and other things but I can&#x27;t walk around with crazy hair like... hello?!</li>
            <li> OMG I naturally have curly hair and I can&#x27;t believe I am just now finding this product! I love this and it makes my curls look amazing!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this Mousse in stores anymore. It&#x27;s the only mouse that I have found that scrunches my hair the way I like it. It has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;3b&amp;#34; curly hair, that is also long, fine, and thin.  This mousse is one of the best I&#x27;ve found!  Can let it dry by itself or blow dry to get more volume and more curls on top (the length of my hair caused air drying to weigh down and have fewer curls on top).  I like to use this with the EverStyle Curl Defining Gel in small doses (a little goes a long way for the gel) for additional defining.  The mousse helps the curls and adds body (I don&#x27;t use it sparingly).  The gel adds more definition.  These are my 2 go-to hair products...after being on the hunt for my crazy hair for my whole life (42 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so hard to control that I don&#x27;t mind a little crunch.  If you do, don&#x27;t use the gel.  The mousse is not crunchy at all from my experience-especially when blown dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use salon products only.  THIS WAY IS BETTER!!!</li>
            <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
            <li> Easier to find on line than in store. nice soft curl without a sticky crunchy feel. smells great, no white residue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of hair gel &amp; mousse &amp; all made my hair frizzy &amp; crunchy. THIS IS THE BEST MOUSSE!  I received so many compliments on my curls.  This mousse make my hair even curlier.  I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair anymore.  Just air dry &amp; my curls look gorgeous.  All my friends are now using it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this from subscribe and save so I received it several times. Each time it got very runny after a short time and even though it felt like there was plenty left I had to throw it way. Didn&#x27;t seem to matter if I shook it well each time from the start.</li>
            <li> I love it! It is so hard to find in the stores now...why!? It leaves my shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so I can tell if a product works with or against my natural curls.  This product really did make my hair more curly and helped to define the curls when I let my hair dry naturally, without using a blow-dryer.  It did not make my hair too stiff, either, like some others I&#x27;ve tried.  If you have naturally curly hair, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed with this mousse.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Gives my curls more definition and a boost which is more than I got from much more expensive curl products.</li>
            <li> only used it once and the cap stopped working. I can&#x27;t get the mousse to come out.</li>
