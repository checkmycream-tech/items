            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this spray!</li>
            <li>This works great - adds body to my fine hair and helps it hold a style.</li>
            <li>Amazing for people who like their beachy hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t over do it, and you will look amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>Works best in my hair really making my wavy hair pop.</li>
            <li>I might try to make my own, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of recipes online for homemade.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and does add texture to hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t REALLY make my hair particularly more wavy</li>
            <li>I have read in many magazines about how amazing sea salt spray is</li>
            <li>For added or more defined curl or &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34;, I use a 1 &amp; 1/2 inch curling iron, shake the curls out, use some Moroccan Argan oil to smooth out and finish off with OGX Surf Paste (which is their sea salt styling paste - LOVE this stuff!)</li>
            <li>but this spray makes my curls look really cute and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the scent of it too</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>However, after seeing it as winning a beauty award in Self magazine, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I like using a hair dryer for a minute or two on the roots to give my hair more volume.</li>
            <li>It feels more like hair spray then anything else.</li>
            <li>Love the waves it puts in my hair.</li>
            <li>Well have to get more</li>
            <li>However, I do like the smell of this better.</li>
            <li>love the beachy wave look coming home from the beach</li>
            <li>Really perks up curls, isn&#x27;t sticky and smells great.</li>
            <li>This product line makes WONDERFUL products and they&#x27;ve been around long before the rest of the beauty community knew about Argan oil&#x27;s benefits.</li>
            <li>Dry, thicker and just awesome.</li>
            <li>I find it works best if I shower at night, spray some in and let air dry while I sleep.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much and it&#x27;s best to spray about 5&amp;#34;-6&amp;#34; away from fairly wet/out of the towel hair; scrunch and let dry or use a diffuser with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>in a good way, plus it smells clean &amp; fresh like a day at the beach.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this because some people were talking about how it gave you easy waves.</li>
            <li>smells wonderful and makes my curls look messy and sexy.</li>
            <li>I love that this product it jump out of the shower ready which is great since I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to just do my hair anymore.</li>
            <li>sea salt spray is hands down the best sea spray but at $24 a bottle</li>
            <li>He uses it to hold his fine curly hair in place rather than using gel, and swears by it.</li>
            <li>It is great especially this time of year!</li>
            <li>Works best on towel dried hair...</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Weird thing is, it makes my six year olds hair silky smooth and</li>
            <li>My habit has led me to dizzying heights, such as scoring awesome clearance deals on salon-brand product at Ulta, to shattering lows, such as letting Pinterest convince me that I could &amp;#34;make&amp;#34; my own sea salt spray.  </li>
            <li>and a light crop-dusting of</li>
            <li>Does a great job of holding short hair without feeling like you have a head full of glue.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that I could spray and go run errands and still get the same beautiful waves as when I use a hairdryer to calm my curls.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter and she loves it - although she says if she uses it to much it tends to dry out her hair a bit - all in all an excellent product!</li>
            <li>It does make my hair feel dry but this thing works and works kinda great.  </li>
            <li>This spray smells great, but it makes my hair dry, brittle, and gives it a sort of &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feel to it, like I didn&#x27;t wash it and</li>
            <li>It does have a smell that smells both sweet and</li>
            <li>but it was very drying and made my hair more fizzy when I wasn&#x27;t using it.</li>
            <li>Can quickly.</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite sea salt spray.</li>
            <li>I have also tried the Lush sea spray and it had a much more noticeable effect on texture.</li>
            <li>Good product, I used it before, this time it came with the bottle well packed but not as full as the previous time.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say is that it smells nice.</li>
            <li>My husband commandeered this the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li>:) DEFINITELY recommend!</li>
            <li>I love the stuff personally.  </li>
            <li>I love the stuff personally.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product today and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Ok people keep complaining that this thing makes their hair too dry.  </li>
            <li>I have fine short hair and this didn&#x27;t do a whole lot when I put it in.</li>
            <li>my hair feels very dry and thick but looks THE best.  </li>
            <li>Their sea salt spray smells wonderful, a few sprays on damp hair is all you need, and it did indeed give my heavy locks quite a lift.  </li>
            <li>I do not like this product, it is very sticky and gummy.  </li>
            <li>I use a very generous amount of</li>
            <li>you sure can but with long hair, but be prepared for a matted mess that could rival Courtney Love on a bender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I got excited and bought this ten dollar sea salt spray</li>
            <li>My hair has a natural wave to it when i let it air dry &amp; this just gives it more of a \\&quot;wave boost!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have to say that other than one conditioner that was WAY too heavy, I&#x27;ve been VERY pleased with their products!  </li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t make your hair shiny or soft, I don&#x27;t really mind because that isn&#x27;t the look this product promises.</li>
            <li>I actually much prefer the Lush sea salt spray to this one.</li>
            <li>It really brings out the natural curl</li>
            <li>I was livid because I had just got out of the shower &amp; had to go wash my hair a second time because I can&#x27;t stand the feeling dry straw like hair &amp; not being able to run my fingers through OR brush my hair.</li>
            <li>With ANY hair product you use, especially those that are designed to give volume or lift, it&#x27;s important that you get regular haircuts.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair and thought it would enhance the curl</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy anyway</li>
            <li>My nose is sensitive so, if yours is too just keep that in mind.</li>
            <li>This says that it&#x27;s weightless (not), leaves your hair shiny (nope) and soft (not even close).</li>
            <li>It stayed wavy for maybe 5 minutes then went back straight again.</li>
            <li>It really looks like a more tame version of beach hair with messy natural waves.</li>
            <li>I have straight, long, silky hair &amp; I</li>
            <li>Adds body and a casually messy but cool look....</li>
            <li>I let my layers grow out, the less effective any styling product will be, due to the extra weight of your hair, short of sticking a bobby pin into an electrical socket to achieve that &amp;#34;blown out</li>
            <li>I usually will blow-dry on the warm setting until most of the hair is just about dry, hold up random sections of hair and use the cool-shot button on the dryer to blast the roots.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it two stars because the smell is amazing, but otherwise, I HATE it, and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Organix products.</li>
            <li>The Lush one actually create out of the water beach waves!</li>
            <li>Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t work at all to hold or scrunch or style my long thin hair</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s experiences with various hair products can differ, but here is my two cents&#x27; worth on this little gem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>then I spent the whole day sweating outside.</li>
            <li>Even the texture mimics the salty feel from the beach, which seems undesirable at first (this is where it lost a star), but is necessary to weigh my curls down a bit for bigger waves.  </li>
            <li>has if I let it dry naturally.</li>

            <li> Really dried out my hair more than other sea salt sprays have in the past.</li>
            <li> but it really left my hair feeling dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> What also helps to add volume is to blow dry your roots on a cool-air setting, NOT warm or hot.  </li>

            <li> (felt like I had just used hair spray - sticky feeling) and let it air dry over night and in the morning my hair was just flat, no \\&quot;beach waves\\&quot; at all.</li>
            <li> I have hair that dries frizzy and really curly without a hairdryer or any product, so I was afraid this would only work for straight hair.</li>

            <li> My only tip is do not spray it on already dry hair, i tried that one time &amp; it made my hair feel really stiff.</li>
            <li> The only thing it did was leave my hair feeling crunchy and heavy.</li>
            <li> The directions say to use a generous amount which I thought I had, but after air drying, it just looked flat and heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> Eh, I agree with the other reviewers:</li>
            <li> It made my hair SOO DRY!!!</li>
            <li> It made my hair stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> Use a little at a time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Hair will lock in a style or direction of lift once it cools down.  </li>

            <li> My hair is thick &amp; wavy.  This product make it feel stiff, sticky, &amp; dull. Didn&#x27;t like, won&#x27;t buy again, didn&#x27;t even finish using.</li>
            <li> it totally dried my ends out so bad i had to get it cut.&lt;br /&gt;my hair is thick already but that just finished it off.</li>
            <li> My husband commandeered this the first time I bought it. He uses it to hold his fine curly hair in place rather than using gel, and swears by it. We&#x27;ve ordered it numerous times.</li>
            <li> I have read in many magazines about how amazing sea salt spray is so I thought I would give it a try.  Unfortunately all it did is make my hair feel dry and ratty.  I have naturally wavy hair and thought it would enhance the curl but it did nothing!  It smells nice but otherwise a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair curly and looks like I just got back from the beach</li>
            <li> I do not like this product, it is very sticky and gummy.  I want a refund, but the vendor will not give me a return or my money back.  Please refund my money.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my medium length hair....did not get wonderful results. My hair just seemed dry, frizzy and out of control. Maybe that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be. I was expecting my hair to not feel as dry. I&#x27;ll try again.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my thin hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it everyday this summer after i wash my hair. It is great especially this time of year! My hair has a natural wave to it when i let it air dry &amp; this just gives it more of a \\&quot;wave boost!\\&quot; And it smells wonderful too. My only tip is do not spray it on already dry hair, i tried that one time &amp; it made my hair feel really stiff. Works best on towel dried hair... I spray, scrunch then use a diffuser on my roots &amp; viola! :) DEFINITELY recommend!</li>
            <li> Great texture. Use a little at a time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ok people keep complaining that this thing makes their hair too dry.  It does make my hair feel dry but this thing works and works kinda great.  Bumble and bumble sea salt spray is hands down the best sea spray but at $24 a bottle I just can&#x27;t afford it.  I use a very generous amount of spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moroccan sea salt spray makes my hair thicker and gives it awesome beach waves.  My hair is naturally wavy anyway but this spray makes my curls look really cute and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i swim at the beach my hair feels very dry and thick but looks THE best.  My hair stays put if you know what I mean.  Well, the Moroccan sea salt spray feels the same way.  Dry, thicker and just awesome. I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product. It makes my hair wavy when I apply it to my damp hair. I love the scent of it too, it&#x27;s different but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Good product, I used it before, this time it came with the bottle well packed but not as full as the previous time.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite sea salt spray. Works best in my hair really making my wavy hair pop. I find it works best if I shower at night, spray some in and let air dry while I sleep. Then in the morning I use a little bit of treseme curling mouse to enhance. Works great.</li>
            <li> This spray smells great, but it makes my hair dry, brittle, and gives it a sort of &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feel to it, like I didn&#x27;t wash it and then I spent the whole day sweating outside. My hair is already wavy but I was hoping this spray would give it a little oomf. It did not. This spray also tangles my hair really badly and by the end of the day it&#x27;s so mangled, I get dreads. I&#x27;m only giving it two stars because the smell is amazing, but otherwise, I HATE it, and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Organix products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Ordered online because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. Can quickly. Does a great job of holding short hair without feeling like you have a head full of glue.</li>
            <li> I like the product. I have extremely long hair so it is a little expensive. I braided my hair and sprayed it with this Sea Salt spray, left it in over night. When I combed my hair out it was beautiful and stayed wavy for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt; I might try to make my own, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of recipes online for homemade.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it - although she says if she uses it to much it tends to dry out her hair a bit - all in all an excellent product!</li>
            <li> This spray smells great and did put wave in to my hair  but it really left my hair feeling dry and brittle.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever for your hair!  I use it alot during the day and the smell of this is WONDERFUL!  Ladies you will love this product, Ive ordered 4 of them already!!!</li>
            <li> I love that this product it jump out of the shower ready which is great since I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to just do my hair anymore. It does have a smell that smells both sweet and cologne-y? You get used to it, but I definitely won&#x27;t be using this around the headache times. My nose is sensitive so, if yours is too just keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because some people were talking about how it gave you easy waves. So I got excited and bought this ten dollar sea salt spray T_T i basically bought expensive hair spray. This didn&#x27;t give me any wave. It made my hair stiff and dry. I used it on my moms hair however and it worked. It works for different hairtypes. my advice know your hair. Also, buy this in a store instead of on the amazon that way you can try it before you buy it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t work at all to hold or scrunch or style my long thin hair</li>
            <li> It smells nice and does add texture to hair but it was very drying and made my hair more fizzy when I wasn&#x27;t using it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for after workout hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing for people who like their beachy hair. Don&#x27;t over do it, and you will look amazing.</li>
            <li> I have long hair. Down to about my mid back. And this still manages to give warm texture to my dirty blonde hair. I also use it as hairspray sometimes when I curl my hair and it holds well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have hair that dries frizzy and really curly without a hairdryer or any product, so I was afraid this would only work for straight hair. However, after seeing it as winning a beauty award in Self magazine, I decided to give it a try. I was looking for a product that I could spray and go run errands and still get the same beautiful waves as when I use a hairdryer to calm my curls. While it doesn&#x27;t make your hair shiny or soft, I don&#x27;t really mind because that isn&#x27;t the look this product promises. It really looks like a more tame version of beach hair with messy natural waves. Even the texture mimics the salty feel from the beach, which seems undesirable at first (this is where it lost a star), but is necessary to weigh my curls down a bit for bigger waves.  I like using a hair dryer for a minute or two on the roots to give my hair more volume. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a lot like hairspray.  Crunchy hard to brush into the hair.  Smells good but that is about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird thing is, it makes my six year olds hair silky smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figure I will use up the bottle and never buy again.</li>
            <li> This says that it&#x27;s weightless (not), leaves your hair shiny (nope) and soft (not even close). I&#x27;ve decided to try to find a product that will give me the beach wave look I get when we spend our week at the beach and this bottle doesn&#x27;t come close! The only thing it did was leave my hair feeling crunchy and heavy. It feels more like hair spray then anything else. The directions say to use a generous amount which I thought I had, but after air drying, it just looked flat and heavy feeling. I even sprayed water in my hair and scrunched it again (felt like I had just used hair spray - sticky feeling) and let it air dry over night and in the morning my hair was just flat, no \\&quot;beach waves\\&quot; at all. Also if you have small hands the bottle isn&#x27;t the easiest thing to hold and then try and spray onto your hair. The only positive thing I can say is that it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Really dried out my hair more than other sea salt sprays have in the past. I would go with another brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t REALLY make my hair particularly more wavy I don&#x27;t think, but holds in the waves I already have.</li>
            <li> This works great - adds body to my fine hair and helps it hold a style.</li>
            <li> Love the waves it puts in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is your day at the beach in a bottle.  It&#x27;s so great my daughter.  Took it away. It&#x27;s a great product that does wigs tut says. Well have to get more</li>
            <li> makes your hair gross and matted, i&#x27;ve tried different amounts of it in my hair and no matter what it&#x27;s always gross. doesn&#x27;t even substitute for hair spray.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s experiences with various hair products can differ, but here is my two cents&#x27; worth on this little gem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium to thick long layered hair.  With ANY hair product you use, especially those that are designed to give volume or lift, it&#x27;s important that you get regular haircuts.  Speaking from experience, the longer and thicker I let my layers grow out, the less effective any styling product will be, due to the extra weight of your hair, short of sticking a bobby pin into an electrical socket to achieve that &amp;#34;blown out just fried my brain&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I sadly admit that I am a hair product junkie.  My habit has led me to dizzying heights, such as scoring awesome clearance deals on salon-brand product at Ulta, to shattering lows, such as letting Pinterest convince me that I could &amp;#34;make&amp;#34; my own sea salt spray.  Word to the wise: you sure can but with long hair, but be prepared for a matted mess that could rival Courtney Love on a bender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To (ahem) &amp;#34;curtail&amp;#34; my budget and impulse buying of said beauty products, I decided to give OGX a whirl.  I have to say that other than one conditioner that was WAY too heavy, I&#x27;ve been VERY pleased with their products!  Their sea salt spray smells wonderful, a few sprays on damp hair is all you need, and it did indeed give my heavy locks quite a lift.  What also helps to add volume is to blow dry your roots on a cool-air setting, NOT warm or hot.  Hair will lock in a style or direction of lift once it cools down.  I usually will blow-dry on the warm setting until most of the hair is just about dry, hold up random sections of hair and use the cool-shot button on the dryer to blast the roots.  For added or more defined curl or &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34;, I use a 1 &amp; 1/2 inch curling iron, shake the curls out, use some Moroccan Argan oil to smooth out and finish off with OGX Surf Paste (which is their sea salt styling paste - LOVE this stuff!) and a light crop-dusting of Catwalk Work It hairspray.  I haven&#x27;t tried the salt spray while letting my hair air-dry or with a diffuser - this is only because no matter what product I use, my hair type does not dig the air-dry technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps - I love the stuff personally.  Even if you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s less than $10 and you can always take it back for a refund.  Just please don&#x27;t make the Pinterest sea salt DIY spray...op-dusting of Catwalk Work It hairspray.

            <li> Great product...Adds body and a casually messy but cool look....&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on to refresh my style second day, or on damp hair after&lt;br /&gt;washing...works great!!</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and makes my curls look messy and sexy.</li>
            <li> Bought this product today and used it for the first time. It did give my hair some added body to my wavy hair, however, it left my hair very dry, matted and frizzy looking. By the end of the day my hair felt dirty. Couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out!! I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have fine short hair and this didn&#x27;t do a whole lot when I put it in. I have also tried the Lush sea spray and it had a much more noticeable effect on texture. However, I do like the smell of this better.</li>
            <li> Eh, I agree with the other reviewers: this leaves your hair dried out and frizzy with barely a wave insight. I actually much prefer the Lush sea salt spray to this one. The Lush one actually create out of the water beach waves! I am using this one as a texture spray instead, on the roots.</li>
            <li> in a bottle!!!!  in a good way, plus it smells clean &amp; fresh like a day at the beach.  This product line makes WONDERFUL products and they&#x27;ve been around long before the rest of the beauty community knew about Argan oil&#x27;s benefits. I&#x27;ll be a fan for life!</li>
            <li> This product does do....something... to your hair. My hair is straight with slight waves and this product made it lumpy and dirty looking.</li>
            <li> Useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might as well be bottle fragranced water.  It literally does nothing for my hair, and I have pre-beachy hair already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this from my work a few days ago because I get a discount, I only paid $4.79 for this same product &amp; I&#x27;m highly disappointed. I have straight, long, silky hair &amp; I love the beachy wave look coming home from the beach so I&#x27;d figured I&#x27;d try this. I took a shower, put my hair in a towel then sprayed this on my hair while my hair is still damp/wet. It stayed wavy for maybe 5 minutes then went back straight again. It made my hair SOO DRY!!! I was livid because I had just got out of the shower &amp; had to go wash my hair a second time because I can&#x27;t stand the feeling dry straw like hair &amp; not being able to run my fingers through OR brush my hair. Don&#x27;t buy this it will ruin your hair &amp; make it feel like straw!!!! The only thing I like about it was the smell. THATS IT! I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Love this spray! Really perks up curls, isn&#x27;t sticky and smells great. I&#x27;ve ordered multiple times</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much and it&#x27;s best to spray about 5&amp;#34;-6&amp;#34; away from fairly wet/out of the towel hair; scrunch and let dry or use a diffuser with the hair dryer. It really brings out the natural curl/wave my hair has if I let it dry naturally.</li>
