            <li> Great product the real thing!! Woooo hoooooooo what a deal!!!</li>
            <li> My friend raved about this product and I love it.  It makes my skin feel soft and it exfoliates your skin wonderfully.  I was hoping that it would help to fade some of my brown spots on my face but no luck.  But I will continue to buy because my skin does feel fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> Got rid of some discoloration and scaring from acne.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> nice gentle exfoliating cleanser</li>
            <li> This is product is gentle enough for sensitive skin.  It produces a nice lather, then rinses clean.</li>

            <li> The lady who does my facials recommended this product because it exfoliates through chemicals.  She said it helps brighten the skin, when used a few times through the week.  I found the product online at Skin Medica, but it was a tad higher so of course I went to Amazon, found it a cheaper.  Even after paying shipping, I saved around ten dollars.  But every amount helps and the product works very well!</li>

            <li> This face wash is a little bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it. My skin has never been better. I normally have adult acne, and this really seems to help.</li>
            <li> Used for 2 weeks and i felt i got tanned more inspite of using sunscreen and avoiding sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;Im not happy with this product so far.</li>

            <li> I think this is a knock off product. Not the same item I buy at my Doctors office. Buyer Beware</li>
            <li> Bought the product from an actual dermatologist and the smell was different. Knock off.</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin look and feel</li>
            <li> One of my favorite facial cleanses, really helps with my adult acne! For my reviews on my blog visit www.fromflabtofabfitness.com</li>
            <li> Very clean good exfoliation! But I don&#x27;t use every day to make sure I don&#x27;t dry out. I switch it up with sensitive skin cleanser on off days.</li>
