            <li>and I think they do a great job.</li>
            <li>Great product and effective for removing calluses.  </li>
            <li>It works well, color is good, I like it.</li>
            <li>Good for the price as well.</li>
            <li>I love the curved handle which makes it easier to scrub my feet!</li>
            <li>nice price</li>
            <li>It was ok but not what I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Awesome products overall!  </li>
            <li>The sandpaper side warped after exposure to water twice, and the grit on the callus side was just okay.</li>
            <li>and i will get better results.</li>
            <li>The silver part can come off for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it as a good alternative to paying for a pedicure</li>
            <li>This has a nice sturdy handle with an ergonomic curve that gives a natural angle for filing your feet.</li>
            <li>This product works great on my feet and it not too harsh or abrasive.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even worth that price.</li>
            <li>This does exactly as planned.  </li>
            <li>Its ok, not sure abt the performance of the light side!</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The handle wasn&#x27;t really sturdy either.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower when the skin is the softest and it really works.</li>
            <li>Did not work at all and took far to long to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up getting one with sandpaper that works way better.</li>
            <li>Starting to wonder if there was a mix up because the sanders I received were nothing special.</li>
            <li>The rasp side could be a little sharper, but overall this is a good product &amp; value.</li>
            <li>I like that its small and easy to handle but callus removing????</li>
            <li>The rasp side did nothing to remove the dead skin and the opposite side is just fine grain sand paper.</li>

            <li> The rasp side did nothing to remove the dead skin and the opposite side is just fine grain sand paper.</li>
            <li> The metal grate side is too dull, doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> pretty weak.</li>
            <li> If left in the wet shower too long, the black backing comes off.</li>
            <li> I use them when my feet are wet - have not tried on dry feet.</li>
            <li> (like some other products reviewed), not dull, just right.&lt;br /&gt;Still be careful, file away slowly.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me , I used it in the shower because its kinda gross if you get dead skin everywhere</li>
            <li> so sharp it hurts you</li>
            <li> but i dont like it ,cheap and bad quality ,</li>
            <li> No nice factor with this foot callus remover.</li>
            <li> not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> It was very poorly made.</li>
            <li> flimsy plastic handle :(</li>

            <li> This does exactly as planned.  The shaver side gets rid of the dead skin, the soft part makes it soft.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the &#x27;metal&#x27; side, as I had one from a Japanese store before, and this one works great.&lt;br /&gt;Not so sharp it hurts you (like some other products reviewed), not dull, just right.&lt;br /&gt;Still be careful, file away slowly.</li>
            <li> nice price but i dont like it ,cheap and bad quality , (no lo recomiendo no funciona bien de baja calidad)</li>
            <li> Awesome products overall!  Wife loves it!</li>
            <li> flimsy plastic handle :(</li>
            <li> I love the curved handle which makes it easier to scrub my feet! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was not knowing what color I was getting.</li>
            <li> Starting to wonder if there was a mix up because the sanders I received were nothing special. The sandpaper side warped after exposure to water twice, and the grit on the callus side was just okay. The handle wasn&#x27;t really sturdy either. For the money get another one that has the callus remover on both sides.</li>
            <li> This product works great on my feet and it not too harsh or abrasive.  I would definitely recommend it as a good alternative to paying for a pedicure</li>
            <li> It was very poorly made. Did not work at all and took far to long to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up getting one with sandpaper that works way better.</li>
            <li> Its ok, not sure abt the performance of the light side!</li>
            <li> This has a nice sturdy handle with an ergonomic curve that gives a natural angle for filing your feet. The rasp side could be a little sharper, but overall this is a good product &amp; value.</li>
            <li> Great product and effective for removing calluses.  I use this item along with my callus eliminator product.  Can&#x27;t wait for summer sandals and flip flops!!!</li>
            <li> No nice factor with this foot callus remover. It does nothing...i could as well as use a stone and i will get better results. I like that its small and easy to handle but callus removing???? Hell no!</li>
            <li> I suppose I should have known based on the price. The rasp side did nothing to remove the dead skin and the opposite side is just fine grain sand paper. It wasn&#x27;t even worth that price.</li>
            <li> This is a salon quality product. I use it in the shower when the skin is the softest and it really works. The silver part can come off for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is great for the price. If left in the wet shower too long, the black backing comes off. I replace these often (because I think its gross to keep them around) and I think they do a great job. I use them when my feet are wet - have not tried on dry feet.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought I was getting. I thought it was a 3 part unit, with a changeable handle. I will make it work. Ordered on March 12, and received on April 14, 2014.</li>
            <li> It works well, color is good, I like it. Good for the price as well. I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for. pretty weak.</li>
            <li> The sandpaper came off after 3 uses</li>
            <li> The metal grate side is too dull, doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
