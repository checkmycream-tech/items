    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The product was successfully registered on Luna official site.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think I can give a good review for the benefit of skin conditions.</li>
            <li>Good product and customer service.</li>
            <li>Love it - makes my face feel and look great</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to ask for this Luna for Christmas this year, and love it!  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, You don&#x27;t need to bring charges for Luna even if the trip lasts for 1 month!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>really  love  it!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the amazing part!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had Mia when I purchased this in a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
            <li>This review is based on my own experiences, consider your skin type before making decisions.  </li>
            <li>I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>However, my opinion is honest and unbiased.  </li>
            <li>I know Apple probably does and you don&#x27;t need to own an apple device to purchase one,  </li>
            <li>I think is just a better way to massage your face and make your cleanser be more effective.</li>
            <li>It is nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My new beauty instrument makes my skin perfect and clean.</li>
            <li>(I bought mine from a beauty store that begins with a \\&quot;U,\\&quot; and was even able to use a 20% off coupon for it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update my review as I use this more, but, for now, I love this.</li>
            <li>I feel my face cleans better with clarisonic compared to luna.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li>I personally love the cashmere ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The handle of the Clarisonic is better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Which one works better?</li>
            <li>You have to try yourself. :)</li>
            <li>it has many defect spots on the brush head.</li>
            <li>My ex-girlfriend likes it more than me</li>
            <li>Through Snagshout  I was able to get this product in a discounted price.</li>
            <li>Watch more than one presenter because a couple tell you nothing</li>
            <li>Love this face scrubber.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel after I used it every morning.  </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s definitely doing an excellent job of getting out the unwanted dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>Which is a plus for anyone, no matter your skin type.&amp;#34;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me this isn&#x27;t an issue as I already use mostly organic anyways.</li>
            <li>Also it is so soft and great to take with you even for traveling that is just convenient.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel more smooth after cleaning.</li>
            <li>It also encourages me to wash my face twice a day since it&#x27;s effortless and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The shape fits perfectly in my hand, the brush head feels great on my skin and seriously, from the first use I could see results.</li>
            <li>but there is one lady who gets with it, showing a bowl of water to dip the FOREO in to get the tip wet, the part you use, and she is very good at explaining how this should be used.</li>
            <li>it works amazingly and gental on my sentive skin very cute baby pink color</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>When the device turns on, the bristles vibrate, suppose to clean the pore.</li>
            <li>and so far I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This is more gentle compared to Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>, I love it so much.</li>
            <li>More gentle and not foaming well compared to Mia.</li>
            <li>However, The good part of Clarisonic is that you could choose the different type of heads you like.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with the Luna and can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I also bought this from a beauty retailer that included the cleaning spray as a bonus gift, and I&#x27;ve been using that once a week to clean the Luna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using the anti-aging backside of it since I really bought this more for its cleansing abilities, and love how deeply it cleanses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to clean, and leaves my skin as soft as my Mia ever did.</li>
            <li>The battery is amazing in this since I&#x27;ve only charged this twice since I bought it a year or so ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>Worth every dollar</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  very  user  friendly.  </li>
            <li>In the long run the Luna will save you time, money and will also offer more benefits, including the anti aging setting!</li>
            <li>I get a lot of clogged pores on my face and this cleared them right up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about few weeks, then I thought this is much better than the Clarisonic, it is very easy to clean and aslo makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about three weeks now, and it leaves my skin just as soft and smooth as my Clarisonic did.</li>
            <li>I wrote a first review here http://www.soulofafashionista.com/2015/06/luna-by-foreo-your-new-go-to-for.html</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>If you work with your FOREO you will find it&#x27;s pretty nifty,</li>
            <li>My face looked healthy and glowed instantly.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Luna was the silicone exterior.</li>
            <li>but as with any electronic device I had to charge it first.</li>
            <li>the long run the Luna will save you time, money and will also offer more benefits, including the anti aging setting!cess.  </li>
            <li>While it was charging I read the care manual to make sure I was using it properly, when the time came (always read the manuals to new products).</li>
            <li>The cleanser foaming very well by Mia.</li>
            <li>However I can&#x27;t give any review of whether this function really works.</li>
            <li>However, it is much easier finding a place in the traveling package for Luna.</li>
            <li>The real Foreo Luna is made in Stockholm.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much brighter as well because of all the exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I also really like using the anti-aging feature around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I never wear sunglasses so too much squinting in the summer</li>
            <li>My face feels so much cleaner after each use.  </li>
            <li>no need change the brush, and it is small and light which is easy to take to everywhere</li>
            <li>Just think, if it can clean my face enough to help my acne</li>
            <li>decent device for me compared to Mia 2 which has two speeds and a timer.</li>
            <li>After I received it, I compared it to my older one.</li>
            <li>so I use it only once a day on low setting, and it has worked wonders on the pours around my mouth, where I needed it most.</li>
            <li>maybe using it full blast a couple times a day is too much, especially if like me, your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I was not expected or influenced to leave a positive rating or review.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t shoul it&#x27;s the new one or the second-hand one.</li>
            <li>they are very soft ) to the skin.</li>
            <li>It makes it feel so soft!</li>
            <li>I hesitated buying this due to the cost, but it is well worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s because I live near the coast, but the brush heads on the Mia start smelling moldy right away, even when I do weekly disinfecting of them and also properly rinse and dry the brush right after</li>
            <li>Foreo Luna is more gentle for everyday use, but the cleansers you can use with it are limited.</li>
            <li>I would give this product 4.5 stars so far.</li>
            <li>But, anyhow,mine is the real one and that&#x27;s the only thing i care about!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m a Prime member, I can return it free anyway if I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li>The only con to the Luna is the silicone material means you can not use certain facial products with this device as they can cause wear and damage to the silicone.</li>
            <li>(I had asked my husband for it for Christmas) and have always loved how soft and clean it makes my face -- but have hated how it seems to attract mold and a funky smell.  </li>
            <li>Personally, my skin seems to be very sensitive to this</li>
            <li>, I noticed that a few reviewers were worried about whether or not their Lunas were counterfeit, so it may be worth it to order it from a retailer that guarantees the authenticity of the product.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed one night before bed (after using the Luna of course) that my face felt tight, more firm that it had.</li>
            <li>After the first few washes I noticed my acne, that was flared up, was starting to clear up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the natural look and don&#x27;t like to pile too much foundation on my face but after using the Luna for a few days</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the natural look and don&#x27;t like to pile too much foundation on my face but after using the Luna for a few days</li>
            <li> This is a serious beauty investment but its worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use the cleansers have rubbing particles or the acidic cleansers such as BHA (From my guess, I am a biological researcher, the acid will damage the brush if it gets exposed to acid for a long time )  </li>
            <li> After a week of use my breakouts were few and far between and my pores were drastically smaller (something I didn&#x27;t expect).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not much of a girly, girl, but because of my dry skin, I needed to get the sensitive one which only comes in pink!</li>
            <li> I thought to myself &amp;#34;there is no way germs are going to stick to this like they would other facial cleansing devices.</li>
            <li> I do not have to replace the head of the Luna like I would with other facial cleansing devices.</li>
            <li> I wrote a long review to help identify the true and fake ones but amazon says it cannot be posted so I have to write another review.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic Mia for about five years (I had asked my husband for it for Christmas) and have always loved how soft and clean it makes my face -- but have hated how it seems to attract mold and a funky smell.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because I live near the coast, but the brush heads on the Mia start smelling moldy right away, even when I do weekly disinfecting of them and also properly rinse and dry the brush right after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to ask for this Luna for Christmas this year, and love it!  I&#x27;ve been using it about three weeks now, and it leaves my skin just as soft and smooth as my Clarisonic did. I have sensitive, combo skin that also gets easily dried out since I use Retin-A, and using the Mia twice a day (even with sensitive brush heads) was too irritating.  I can use the Luna twice a day with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to clean, and leaves my skin as soft as my Mia ever did. I also bought this from a beauty retailer that included the cleaning spray as a bonus gift, and I&#x27;ve been using that once a week to clean the Luna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using the anti-aging backside of it since I really bought this more for its cleansing abilities, and love how deeply it cleanses.  You just have to be careful to not use any exfoliating or grainy scrubs with this since they can damage the silicone nibs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also only need to charge this once every six months, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I noticed that a few reviewers were worried about whether or not their Lunas were counterfeit, so it may be worth it to order it from a retailer that guarantees the authenticity of the product.  (I bought mine from a beauty store that begins with a \\&quot;U,\\&quot; and was even able to use a 20% off coupon for it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pricey, but it is something that I know should last me for a few years.  It&#x27;s well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review as I use this more, but, for now, I love this.</li>
            <li> I fail to register this product on foreo.com. This is probably a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> This is more gentle compared to Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, says that her face feels smoother and cleaner than ever before using traditional cleaners and soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about few weeks, then I thought this is much better than the Clarisonic, it is very easy to clean and aslo makes my skin very soft. Foreo no need change the brush, and it is small and light which is easy to take to everywhere, I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I have been trying it for a few days now and so far I LOVE IT! I think is just a better way to massage your face and make your cleanser be more effective. Also it is so soft and great to take with you even for traveling that is just convenient. I wrote a first review here http://www.soulofafashionista.com/2015/06/luna-by-foreo-your-new-go-to-for.html and I will add another one in a few weeks. It is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I had Mia when I purchased this in a discounted price for my honest review. I have used this for a few times now, I don&#x27;t think I can give a good review for the benefit of skin conditions. However, I can definitely compared the devices in terms of how you feel when you using the products. Price: Mia 99 dollars if there&#x27;s discount you can get it for 70 dollars, decent device for me compared to Mia 2 which has two speeds and a timer. You need to change the brush head every 3 months which is 25-30 dollars each. You can register your device and get a 25 off 50 coupon for cheaper brush head on their website. FOREO LUNA: 199 dollars for the device. No brush head needed.  Brushhead: Mia: you have multiple choices regarding on your skin condition. The bristles are made of nylons/ cashmere (not sure). When the device turns on, the bristles vibrate, suppose to clean the pore. Compared to Foreo Luna, I think clarisonic is harsher (non cashmere head or radiant head, head they are very soft ) to the skin. The cleanser foaming very well by Mia. You can basically use any cleanser if your skin allows.  Foreo Luna: The brush head made of silicon together with the body. It claimed to be anti-bacteria material even though I don&#x27;t believe it. More gentle and not foaming well compared to Mia. Can&#x27;t use the cleansers have rubbing particles or the acidic cleansers such as BHA (From my guess, I am a biological researcher, the acid will damage the brush if it gets exposed to acid for a long time )  It has speed adjustment.  Your choice based on your skin condition. Both of them are waterproof, rechargeable skin cleansing devices. Foreo Luna is more gentle for everyday use, but the cleansers you can use with it are limited. Clarisonic claimed to be used for everyday but considering your skin type, it should be adjusted. I have acne prone skin, I don&#x27;t use clarisonic everyday. I feel my face cleans better with clarisonic compared to luna. The Luna has anti-aging setup, which is a plus. However I can&#x27;t give any review of whether this function really works. I would give this product 4.5 stars so far. This review is based on my own experiences, consider your skin type before making decisions.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I was not expected or influenced to leave a positive rating or review. My review is only based on my personal experience with this product. If my opinion about it changes as I continue using it, I&#x27;ll add an update.</li>
            <li> My luna box had been opned. I can&#x27;t shoul it&#x27;s the new one or the second-hand one.</li>
            <li> This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;When I got this discount, I was afraid that it might be an unauthentic one. Since I&#x27;m a Prime member, I can return it free anyway if I&#x27;m not satisfied. After I received it, I compared it to my older one. There is no difference between them. And I tried to register the serial number, it works. I think it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li> Great product. Same with I buy from foreo</li>
            <li> Good product and customer service.</li>
            <li> My new beauty instrument makes my skin perfect and clean. Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I am satifsied with my purchase since I got a discount on it and registered on foreo with warrenty. i compared the hints of how to identify with the fake ones, while i think mine is the real one. I wrote a long review to help identify the true and fake ones but amazon says it cannot be posted so I have to write another review. But, anyhow,mine is the real one and that&#x27;s the only thing i care about!</li>
            <li> I have used both the Foreo and the Clarisonic. The price of these two are very similar, but with LUNA you don&#x27;t need to purchase replacement heads, which is $25-30 each. That&#x27;s an extra 100+ spend on Clarisonic for a year! You can&#x27;t save the money with clarisonic, if you don&#x27;t wanna build the bacteria. The silicone heads of Luna don&#x27;t have this problems. However, The good part of Clarisonic is that you could choose the different type of heads you like. I personally love the cashmere ones.&lt;br /&gt;The handle of the Clarisonic is better. With Luna, I slipped it two times already when having the shower. However, it is much easier finding a place in the traveling package for Luna. What&#x27;s more, You don&#x27;t need to bring charges for Luna even if the trip lasts for 1 month! That&#x27;s the amazing part!&lt;br /&gt;Which one works better? You have to try yourself. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered it as a gift with a discount. The product was successfully registered on Luna official site. It is nice and easy to use. It makes the skin feel more smooth after cleaning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it cleans my face. It&#x27;s just a vibrator. Useless. I&#x27;m returning.</li>
            <li> it has many defect spots on the brush head. i think it&#x27;s a counterfeit product</li>
            <li> My ex-girlfriend likes it more than me</li>
            <li> Through Snagshout  I was able to get this product in a discounted price. However, my opinion is honest and unbiased.  Even though many reviews said that this Luna is fake, I still trust Amazon. it works amazingly and gental on my sentive skin very cute baby pink color</li>
            <li> The real Foreo Luna is made in Stockholm. This seems to be from Asia so beware.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the FOREO here, but just wanted to add, go on you tube if you have problems on how to use this device. Watch more than one presenter because a couple tell you nothing but there is one lady who gets with it, showing a bowl of water to dip the FOREO in to get the tip wet, the part you use, and she is very good at explaining how this should be used. Personally, my skin seems to be very sensitive to this so I use it only once a day on low setting, and it has worked wonders on the pours around my mouth, where I needed it most. I almost feel like I can cut down to every other day. Also, some people think they need a computer to plug this into, but you don&#x27;t. Use one of your USB plugs that plug into the wall that comes with another device, or go to a store that sells TVs, computers, celphones, etc and see if they have a USB wall plug there. I know Apple probably does and you don&#x27;t need to own an apple device to purchase one,  you just need to buy the wall plug with the port to plug this in with. If you work with your FOREO you will find it&#x27;s pretty nifty, maybe using it full blast a couple times a day is too much, especially if like me, your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> Tried to register my Foreo Luna and they told me the number was copied or a fake and the order came from China.  I hope it works just as well, if it is a fake, but so far I have seen no difference.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with the Luna and can&#x27;t live without it! Everything about it just works. The shape fits perfectly in my hand, the brush head feels great on my skin and seriously, from the first use I could see results. My face looked healthy and glowed instantly. I&#x27;m a big fan of the natural look and don&#x27;t like to pile too much foundation on my face but after using the Luna for a few days, I feel like I don&#x27;t even need to use it anymore. My skin tone has evened out and my spots have gone. This is a serious beauty investment but its worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Have only been using it for two weeks and have already seen a dramatic improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I  really  love  it!  It&#x27;s  very  user  friendly.  The  manual  is quite  helpful  and  describes  how  to  use  each  feature  the&lt;br /&gt;machine  has,  and  also  includes  recommendations  for  what skin mode  to  use  depending  on  your skin situation.</li>
            <li> Love this face scrubber. Worth every dollar I spent</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel after I used it every morning.  It makes it feel so soft!</li>
            <li> Love it - makes my face feel and look great</li>
            <li> I get a lot of clogged pores on my face and this cleared them right up. My skin looks so much brighter as well because of all the exfoliation. I also really like using the anti-aging feature around my eyes. I never wear sunglasses so too much squinting in the summer makes this a problem area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the color. I&#x27;ve not much of a girly, girl, but because of my dry skin, I needed to get the sensitive one which only comes in pink!</li>
            <li> I hesitated buying this due to the cost, but it is well worth every penny!  After using it for a couple of days I already saw a difference in regards to my complexion.  My face feels so much cleaner after each use.  It also encourages me to wash my face twice a day since it&#x27;s effortless and so easy to use.  The battery is amazing in this since I&#x27;ve only charged this twice since I bought it a year or so ago.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Luna was the silicone exterior. I thought to myself &amp;#34;there is no way germs are going to stick to this like they would other facial cleansing devices. When I received my Luna I was anxious to use it but as with any electronic device I had to charge it first. While it was charging I read the care manual to make sure I was using it properly, when the time came (always read the manuals to new products). After the first few washes I noticed my acne, that was flared up, was starting to clear up. I also noticed one night before bed (after using the Luna of course) that my face felt tight, more firm that it had. After a week of use my breakouts were few and far between and my pores were drastically smaller (something I didn&#x27;t expect). The Luna is not just for acne, this is just my personal experience. Just think, if it can clean my face enough to help my acne then it&#x27;s definitely doing an excellent job of getting out the unwanted dirt and oil. Which is a plus for anyone, no matter your skin type.&amp;#34;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luna is equipped with an anti aging device, made of silicone which requires less maintenance. I do not have to replace the head of the Luna like I would with other facial cleansing devices. The silicone exterior of the Luna makes it nearly impossible for those icky germs to stick to. The only con to the Luna is the silicone material means you can not use certain facial products with this device as they can cause wear and damage to the silicone. To me this isn&#x27;t an issue as I already use mostly organic anyways.The Luna also pulsates in between each 15 seconds to indicate it&#x27;s time to move to another part of your face. Once you have cleansed your face you can press the button on the Luna which will pause the device while you rinse your face and press it a third time to start the anti aging process, which it will pulsate just like with the cleansing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the long run the Luna will save you time, money and will also offer more benefits, including the anti aging setting!cess.
