            <li>This is an awesome toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Though I think both products did a very good job of cleaning the teeth.  </li>

            <li>The LED display is great too.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used an electric Oral-B toothbrush for years and been quite happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Great feeling.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>after a year, it is still running great.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush does an excellent job at cleaning and leaves your mouth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent toothbrush -- my teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
            <li>I do a good job brushing the old-fashioned way, but this device is unbelievably good.</li>
            <li>It has a good readout and, if you brush correctly (2 min</li>
            <li>I think this product works really good.</li>
            <li>The Oral-Be \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot; series electric tooth brushes are so good</li>
            <li>This is a good quality and value product.  </li>
            <li>I used to think that I could brush my teeth just as good as an electric tooth brush....</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cost more than I wanted to spend, but now I am happy I have it.  </li>
            <li>Love the 4000 and Amazon&#x27;s great service.</li>
            <li>I would happily pay full price!</li>
            <li>My mouth feels amazing every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>The default is frustration free packaging which is great for me because I have a disability</li>
            <li>I have received this product as a gift (on my own request) 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>it holds a good charge and makes my teeth feel very clean</li>
            <li>They cancelled my order for no reason after I placed it and they raised the price to the original one!!</li>
            <li>This Oral-B brush is a good size and makes it easy to use, which means cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li>and it works super great.</li>
            <li>However, it is very easy to brush my teeth thoroughly every time with this brush.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to meet the timing recommedations of 30 (or 45 if you adjust the setting)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best so far.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the ratings and comments of users of the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care and selected this toothbrush for use by my wife and me purchasing one for each of us.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is the best most professional type of home product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Out of so many products that I bought during holiday season, this is by far one of the best one I invested my money into.</li>
            <li>I gave Amazon great credit for prompt, friendly telephone service and 100% free exchanges and returns.</li>
            <li>First of all this Oral-B tooth brush is great.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>MORE SPEED.. BATTERY METER...</li>
            <li>Even after so many reviews already for this product, i think this review can add to the greatness of this product.</li>
            <li>This Oral B Smartseries 4000 is FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>I wish it could be more compact or have its prongs perpendicular to the mass of the plug.</li>
            <li>And it fits my hand better.</li>
            <li>I can not tell you how pleased my dental hygenist has been since I started using the Oral-B.  Even the dentist</li>
            <li>I tried that for many months.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t replace the need to floss in between teeth routinely but you will brush better and longer using it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li>Now, do be sure to save your receipt.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a top quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it operates.  </li>
            <li>The top item reads \\&quot;Oral-B FlossActionÂ® Electric Toothbrush Head (Included).\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love the product and eventually hope to get one for each of the kids.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this one a try and really love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush</li>
            <li>I like the 4000 model even better...</li>
            <li>I have always had rapid tartar and plaque buildup and the electric brushes work much better for me than manual brush.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>But, what I like most is that after brushing my teeth feel just like they do after I&#x27;ve had a cleaning at the dental office.  </li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>I love this one-</li>
            <li>If you want more than this you are not getting any review from us at all.</li>
            <li>I will not be buying Oral B products any more.</li>
            <li>- very, very clean feel - very highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly the features I was looking for at a good price.</li>
            <li>Another great feature is that the brush heads indicate when it&#x27;s time to get a new one which takes the guessing out of that process.  </li>
            <li>Also my boyfriend spent a week doing product reviews and found that this model was the best and better then sonicare.</li>
            <li>I strongly urge you to look elsewhere if you are looking to obtain a power toothbrush for your own mouth full of braces.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I am very glad I choose this one.</li>
            <li>When brushing, the handle seems more comfortable.</li>
            <li>When the rechargeable battery in my old Oral-B finally bit the dust I bought a Smartseries 4000 and experienced Oral-B&#x27;s incredible improvement in technology.</li>
            <li>I brush more often because I enjoy doing it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electronic toothbrush and I love it!</li>
            <li>This is the best 80bucks ive ever spent!</li>
            <li>1)I wanted a better clean than a manual toothbrush could provide (hence the selling point) and</li>
            <li>The rebate process is very quick.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I find that this toothbrush makes it easy to improve the quality and consistency of my brushing, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li>both easy to use...</li>
            <li>It was also delivered VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>I love how clean my teeth feel after I use it.</li>
            <li>Battery still going strong.</li>
            <li>My dentist highly praises Oral-B and for good reason.</li>
            <li>After the first brushing it is amazing how my teeth felt.</li>
            <li>they both work just fine and does the job...</li>
            <li>If it can be a little lower in price, then it will be perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is clearly more powerful than the Vitality</li>
            <li>The machine is lightweight, easy to keep clean, and I like the fact that it can rest in its charging cradle without \\&quot;overcharging.\\</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Try the Amazon frustration free packaging version, not the retail box and it worked.  </li>
            <li>The variable speed makes it comfortable for both me and my son.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush\\&quot; priced $92.75 including rebates and free shipping.</li>
            <li>The results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is a great buy with the rebate that is offered now and this toothbrush will last you forever.</li>
            <li>note as I write this that the product is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I have to say it&#x27;s worth every penny that spent, I&#x27;m happy to have got it in Lighting deal!!</li>
            <li>It is such a joy to know I am getting all my teeth clean in a way i could&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li>After using it as instructed, my mouth feels as clean and smooth as when I go to a dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel dentist clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It certainly felt effective before it broke, but it quickly broke; now it hums when it is turned on, but it does not rotate the brushhead at all.</li>
            <li>Got a unit in the 4000 series called the model 4750 which is the one pictured on Amazon plus the 3 free replacement brush heads in the special promotion.</li>
            <li>This being my first use of a power toothbrush, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>Have used electric toothbrushes in the past - this one is the BEST!  </li>
            <li>Besides that minor point, the Oral-B 4000 is great.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the original toothbrush would both beep and pause after each 30-second interval.  </li>
            <li>Since we had kept the original brush head, we consider a portion of the shipping cost to have been \\&quot;covered\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product to replace the aging battery of the Elites (I have 2), however, my kids wouldn&#x27;t switch to this one because it is significantly weaker than the Elite.  </li>
            <li>On the handle it also tells you how long to brush in each quadrant of the mouth, then gives a happy face on the handle if you have used the brush as instructed.  </li>
            <li>I intend(ed) to purchase three more for my children for Christmas, but wanted to test it myself first.</li>
            <li>Then I requested a replacement &amp; put the original in the mail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noisy and the brush is a bit bulky for anyone with a small mouth, however it does an excellent job of brushing teeth squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Just like most of the reviewer stated Dentist are just paid by sonicare to tell you it is better when oral b is just as great if not better!</li>
            <li>The new travel case and charger are nice.</li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my teeth and gums have ever stayed so clean.</li>
            <li>thing is packed with settings... diamond clean - which cleans with a pulse.</li>
            <li>It gives me that just-been-to-the dentist clean</li>
            <li>After that 2 minutes of cleaning - you&#x27;ll feel... so fresh and so clean clean clean...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to surprising my dental hygenist on my next visit.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good toothbrush overall.</li>
            <li>floss action i believe) is nice cause</li>
            <li>It works much faster and does a better cleaning.</li>
            <li>Second of all and most important the service I got from Amazon was even better.</li>
            <li>You have to really watch the pressure and make sure you just let the brush do</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>If you want clean and fresh, get an Oral-B 4000.  </li>
            <li>Also, it signals every 30 seconds, which does help pay attention to brushing all four quadrants adequately.  </li>
            <li>However, when this brush&#x27;s life is over, I would most likely switch to Philips Sonicare, and hope to experience better customer service.</li>
            <li>I really like the options and how easy it is to keep clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tremendous.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li>My wife and I are very pleased with the purchase of our second Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The new model has a number of changes, most of which are improvements.</li>
            <li>I had been a long time user of the Crest Spin Brush since it was cheap and effective.</li>
            <li>Although a little pricey, this toothbrush does a great job at cleaning and whitening teeth.</li>
            <li>Travel case securely holds unit and brush for damage-free transport (with reasonable care).</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I am still convinced that an electric toothbrush does a far better job than a manual one.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re stuck with a $90 boat anchor or the fun of a warranty debate/return cycle/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>+) you will see the time used plus a smile face.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush does remove more food than the old Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my 4th and the most powerful by far, and holds a charge longer.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that the brush heads wouldn&#x27;t fit into the small spaces in the back of my mouth, but it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>It does the job right.  </li>
            <li>It does clean very well.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I love Oral-B toothbrushes and ordered this model to replace an old one</li>
            <li>My first Braun performed flawlessly for approximately 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure i did not brush adequately with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Being my first electric toothbrush, I got used to it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is a solidly built unit and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>And the timer is so nice to make sure we are both brushing long enough.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral B Sonic Professional, however, I recently got braces on my teeth and my orthodontist strongly suggested that I change toothbrushes while I have the braces on.  </li>
            <li>But, after a recent visit to my dentist, I decided to invest in one for better oral care.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is still working as on the first day, no issues at all.</li>
            <li>For me, the different speed-settings are more of a gimmick, as I always have it on maximum speed.  </li>
            <li>I have to say the performance of this brush was impressive from day one although I was skeptical and realized it after 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>First I tried the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>This was the first electric toothbrush I ever bought.</li>
            <li>I can be sure I brush properly.</li>
            <li>I called the repair shop, and they told me that after testing both the handle and the charger, they would most likely replace which ever part was defective.  </li>
            <li>And I love that the toothbrush rotates, vibrates, and technically polishes my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Seeing the results in a short period of time, I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>tried the Philips electric first, and it slowed plaque build-up, but it would eventually accumulate.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was pretty hokey.</li>
            <li>What it does is display the face when you have brushed  for the appropriate length of time.</li>
            <li>I share with my boyfriend (we have different heads) and were in love with it.</li>
            <li>Battery life is as expected on it and the interchangeable heads are nice.</li>
            <li>I like it much more than larger brush heads.</li>
            <li>And, I tried a battery-powered Oral-B that worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Without any doubt, the latest retail package only contains one brush head.  </li>
            <li>First I floss</li>
            <li>The timer comes in handy when brushing, but other than that it&#x27;s exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li>Although booth toothbrushes worked pretty much the same - it is more of a percieved value to have the digital lcd display (looks more fancy)...</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon the first time about this problem, they noted that the item was temporarily unavailable from them due to some kind of problem.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean all day long no matter what I eat and notice a huge improvement in my gums as well.</li>
            <li>The timer is great, just a subtle series of pauses at 30 seconds, and then a longer series of pauses at 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>A good visit to the dentist means a short visit to me, and this brush has helped keep visits short.</li>
            <li>This model has more action than my old one Oral B.</li>
            <li>Again, love the cleaning ability, it has really made a big difference.</li>
            <li>Like the 4 brushing settings (normal, sensitive, etc.), like being able to see battery life left, enjoy getting a smiley face at the end of brushing, timer, pretty much all the advertised benefits.</li>
            <li>I also love the timer on this model, as I am one of those people who needs a bit of guidance on how long I should brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to reach the back of my teeth</li>
            <li>This is my first (real) electric toothbrush (the $9 crest ones don&#x27;t count haha)...</li>
            <li>and it makes it really easy to open up the box and get to your product.</li>
            <li>&quot; The electric cord plug is a bit large.</li>
            <li>The charger has a large plug, so I do not leave it in the stand.  </li>
            <li>The brush tells me, with a change in pulsation frequency, when it is time to move to a different quadrant and, finally, when I&#x27;ve brushed the full two minutes (I get a smiley face on the display when I&#x27;ve done a good job).  </li>
            <li>Amazon quickly took it back with a free return label and sent another thinking the problem was fixed.</li>
            <li>Actually a handy little display.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this to me and it works very well.</li>
            <li>but it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>This product beats Sonicare in every way - both from a hygiene point of view (no mold build-up under the brush collar) and the effect it has on your teeth and gums - feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I really like this series.   </li>
            <li>It cleans very well..</li>
            <li>Now, I really look forward to cleaning my teeth and gums</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It also has a gentle setting (which I need).  </li>
            <li>I am really pissed</li>
            <li>Amazon reps said they are working on properly describing the retail and frustration free items to avoid confusion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The rep said that I could get an exchange if I waited for the item to come back to being available on Amazon.com, which is what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every trip to the dentist was an embarrassment, really.</li>
            <li>As I travel, I also really appreciate the travel case and the ability of the charger to be plugged into any voltage (110/220) power source.</li>
            <li>I really do brush longer, and after just a week of use there was a visible difference in the health of my gums and the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I like the timed interval for brushing each surface and stopping when too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>Love the cleaning ability, our teeth feel far cleaner than using a standard brush and would recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a Sonni-care, which i liked, until the battery died after a  few years.  </li>
            <li>luckily for me my significant other wasn&#x27;t so picky and didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of the return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- which might be more effective than the motion that each model offers (the standard motion is usually what i use because its a hassle to change the settings when i just want to press one button).</li>
            <li>Although you still need to floss, this particular toothbrush really minimizes the build-up of crud between your teeth.</li>
            <li>extended clean - which cleans for an extra 30 seconds or so.</li>
            <li>Great product, the only downside is, I get so lazy to use normal toothbrushes when I am traveling.  </li>
            <li>The true source of themisunderstanding is Oral-B by calling multiple models the 4000 series and creating these issues.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold, easy to operate, multiple brush settings (4), \\&quot;complete cleaning\\&quot; timer and single charge lasts weeks.  </li>
            <li>Hands down better than Sonicare in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>PURCHASED AS A REPLACEMENT OF AN OLDER ORAL B.</li>
            <li>I love the features of this brush - the brushing time indicator, the display screen, the waterproof handle and simple charging station that does not have to be plugged in on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This feature -- the timer, not the smiley face --  was the reason I purchased this particular model</li>
            <li>Oral-B explained that this item was an older 4000 designed for a promotion through dental offices.</li>
            <li>/&gt;there were some bad/useless things on this particular model/delivery etc.</li>
            <li>I had an older model before this for several years that was much more basic.  </li>
            <li>but the unit we received was an older unit Triumph Series Model which is no longer made.</li>
            <li>Well, then the older discontinued unit we received should have been sold at a closeout price.</li>
            <li>Got the same older model again and Amazon took it back again with very friendly service from the phone reps.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on Consumer Reports high rating.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Price of replacement heads is also a bit high ($27.00 for two and Rite Aid) but that&#x27;s the case with all of the mechanical toothbrushes I reviewed.  </li>
            <li>With the exception of the faulty battery, I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;deep&#x27; clean simply makes you brush longer, and while that seems like a bit of a cop-out, it&#x27;s really all you do need for a deep clean.  </li>
            <li>My first use of this brush left my mouth sore and tender,figuring this to just be due to being a new product I used it a few more times hoping for better results.</li>
            <li>The new unit we received is identical to the older Triumph Model in our household we wished to replace.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a professional electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Have really noticed the difference over my old toothbrush the Oral B vitality.</li>
            <li>I just wish it came with normal heads instead of the whiting ones.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>There was no brush head holder included with the replacement, but the new handle \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; fits in the one we kept.  </li>
            <li>P&amp;G does not acknowledge any operational issues but sent us a $10.00 coupon for purchase of a new unit.</li>
            <li>Even my old unit has brush head storage and a decent plug.</li>
            <li>but it did make me wonder if i spent too much on something that was an old model (both were the same price) or spent to much on a a 4000 series versus a 3000 series (which may have been just as effective without the bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The expiration date on the coupon in the first box was later than the one inside the replacement box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also bought one of these for my significant other...</li>
            <li>Big Deal leave it on the charger over night and it will be ready to go!</li>
            <li>U like, such as standards or deep clean</li>
            <li>This came with 2 Pro White (whitening) brush heads, not the standard, cleaning heads (either FlossAction or Precision Clean).</li>
            <li>The original toothbrush would light up in red when brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>(\\&quot;if you would like to purchase a new toothbrush that comes with a dual charger you should look for the Professional Care 4000 or 5000\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>The new unit we received does not have acceptable performance after a complete charge of 24 hours and two uses of two minutes each.  </li>
            <li>IT JUST GIVES AN OVERALL CLEAN FEELING SIMILAR TO A PROFESSIONAL CLEANING WITHOUT THE PAIN.</li>
            <li>but like i said - its somewhat of a perceived value... to have the old model versus the new model... from what i&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>I really like the pulsating feature that lets me know  when to move between different areas of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are naturally whiter</li>
            <li>I had been a manual tooth brusher my whole life, and my dentist said I should try an electric toothbrush (saying it was likely something in my brushing style that was helping my gums recede).    </li>
            <li>Using the Oral B Professional 4000</li>
            <li>I want to say that one of us was sent the old model...</li>
            <li>its almost near immpossible while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth</li>
            <li>Mouthwash really cleans deep between the gums and along the gum line.</li>
            <li>&quot; and plug are heavy and bulky but the charger is light weight and discrete.</li>
            <li>I use the whiting and the floss action and he has the sensitive.</li>
            <li>The box was marked Series 4000, but the product is marked Series 4750.  </li>
            <li>Then I will return to my Sonic Professional.  </li>
            <li>I use the floss head at night, the soft sensitive in the morning and floss at night.  </li>
            <li>Even earlier I had a Phillips Sonicare and for me the Oral B gets my teach much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I bought this one after my old Oral-B stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I have received the Oral-B Professional Care</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 18 months and so far it&#x27;s working like a champ.  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy a spare one just for my frequent travel.</li>
            <li>It is not too bulky and does a good job reaching even those difficult areas.  </li>
            <li>The electrical cord is very long (there is a funny pictograph on the adaptor/plug indicating not to cut the cord with scissors).  </li>
            <li>Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space which is a major plus in a tiny bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product vs. the more expensive Smartseries 5000 which has additional features that sound useful but add little extra value.</li>
            <li>and standard setting - which calculates and lets you know when 30 seconds are up for cleaning that particular quarter of your mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having just received the second toothbrush, I&#x27;ve discovered exactly the same problem--NO full-size charger/holder for heads.</li>
            <li>The small size of the toothbrush head is ideal for getting in, around, and behind teeth.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long, long time, and gives nearly full power cleaning even when on lower battery.</li>
            <li>The brush moves and pulses at such a high speed</li>
            <li>All in all, a very well thought-out product that also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I find that it really helps, giving you an idea of how long you should brush for.    </li>
            <li>It starts on the normal cycle, but you can change to several brushing modes with the touch of a button.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that takes a little getting used to is the sound it makes.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush has different settings, regular clean, whitening, sensitive and extra long brushing.</li>
            <li>When the new one arrived I tried it for several weeks but the size of the handle part is way too bulky for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Approximately a week later, I received a box, not from Poughkeepsie, but from an Oral-B shipping facility located in New Jersey.  </li>
            <li>There was a coupon inside the new box offering a rebate on my next dental visit.  </li>
            <li>Had an Oral-B Triumph 9000 for over 5 years as our third Oral-B and decided to get a new unit since the 9000 had a lot of use on it.</li>
            <li>I attempted to replace the battery with a new one, following the instructions for battery removal in the product manual.  </li>
            <li>especially the newly designed brush that \\&quot;cups\\&quot; each tooth as I brush.    </li>
            <li>I am returning the defective toothbrush and getting a new one (same model).  </li>
            <li>I have been using this model Oral B for years, and I am happy to say that after a few months of using it I noticed I needed to use Sensodyne less and less.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely would NEVER go back to a regular toothbrush if i had my choice (and couldafford an electric toothbrush lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>went from an old oral b that died after 5 years use (didn&#x27;t die actually, battery stopped holding a charge) to this one.  </li>
            <li>My old Oral B died and I needed a replacement (can&#x27;t go back to manual brushing.</li>
            <li>Secondly, The unit we ordered was the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 4000</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care is my second tooth brush manufactured by Braun.  </li>
            <li>If you want quiet, get an old fashioned toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The only beef I have is that it is a bit loud and it has to be running to change the settings (regular, sensitive, or deep</li>
            <li>Although my teeth are still sensitive to some cold, they are nowhere near as sensitive as they were before, and the gums have not been receding any more.  </li>
            <li>After only 1 week of using the toothbrush with the flossing brush head I was seeing a dramatic difference in the coloring of my teeth, and how much cleaner they felt as opposed to my original manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li>So, I gave this to my husband and went back to my old one since the brush part didn&#x27;t seem any different.</li>
            <li>My teeth are starting to look whiter and my mouth feels fresher for longer than it did when I brushed with my old tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It is loud, and is rough, especially with the head that the doctor recommended (and came with the brush - the floss action).  </li>
            <li>first few times I used this brush my gums felt sore/sensitive.</li>
            <li>Regular setting is WAY too rough but, with a second click, of the smaller button, I can switch to the gentle setting.  </li>
            <li>Only bad part is the price, which has increased a good deal since I last bought.</li>

            <li> It has a good readout and, if you brush correctly (2 min</li>
            <li> I think this product works really good.</li>
            <li> The Oral-Be \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot; series electric tooth brushes are so good</li>
            <li> This is a good quality and value product.  </li>
            <li> I used to think that I could brush my teeth just as good as an electric tooth brush....</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cost more than I wanted to spend, but now I am happy I have it.  </li>
            <li> Love the 4000 and Amazon&#x27;s great service.</li>
            <li> I would happily pay full price!</li>
            <li> My mouth feels amazing every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> The default is frustration free packaging which is great for me because I have a disability</li>
            <li> I have received this product as a gift (on my own request) 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> it holds a good charge and makes my teeth feel very clean</li>
            <li> They cancelled my order for no reason after I placed it and they raised the price to the original one!!</li>
            <li> This Oral-B brush is a good size and makes it easy to use, which means cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li> and it works super great.</li>
            <li> However, it is very easy to brush my teeth thoroughly every time with this brush.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to meet the timing recommedations of 30 (or 45 if you adjust the setting)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the best so far.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the ratings and comments of users of the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care and selected this toothbrush for use by my wife and me purchasing one for each of us.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best most professional type of home product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Out of so many products that I bought during holiday season, this is by far one of the best one I invested my money into.</li>
            <li> I gave Amazon great credit for prompt, friendly telephone service and 100% free exchanges and returns.</li>
            <li> First of all this Oral-B tooth brush is great.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> MORE SPEED.. BATTERY METER...</li>
            <li> Even after so many reviews already for this product, i think this review can add to the greatness of this product.</li>
            <li> This Oral B Smartseries 4000 is FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> I wish it could be more compact or have its prongs perpendicular to the mass of the plug.</li>
            <li> And it fits my hand better.</li>
            <li> I can not tell you how pleased my dental hygenist has been since I started using the Oral-B.  Even the dentist</li>
            <li> I tried that for many months.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t replace the need to floss in between teeth routinely but you will brush better and longer using it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li> Now, do be sure to save your receipt.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a top quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it operates.  </li>
            <li> The top item reads \\&quot;Oral-B FlossActionÂ® Electric Toothbrush Head (Included).\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love the product and eventually hope to get one for each of the kids.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this one a try and really love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush</li>
            <li> I like the 4000 model even better...</li>
            <li> I have always had rapid tartar and plaque buildup and the electric brushes work much better for me than manual brush.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> But, what I like most is that after brushing my teeth feel just like they do after I&#x27;ve had a cleaning at the dental office.  </li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> I love this one-</li>
            <li> If you want more than this you are not getting any review from us at all.</li>
            <li> I will not be buying Oral B products any more.</li>
            <li> - very, very clean feel - very highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly the features I was looking for at a good price.</li>
            <li> Another great feature is that the brush heads indicate when it&#x27;s time to get a new one which takes the guessing out of that process.  </li>
            <li> Also my boyfriend spent a week doing product reviews and found that this model was the best and better then sonicare.</li>
            <li> I strongly urge you to look elsewhere if you are looking to obtain a power toothbrush for your own mouth full of braces.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I am very glad I choose this one.</li>
            <li> When brushing, the handle seems more comfortable.</li>
            <li> When the rechargeable battery in my old Oral-B finally bit the dust I bought a Smartseries 4000 and experienced Oral-B&#x27;s incredible improvement in technology.</li>
            <li> I brush more often because I enjoy doing it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best 80bucks ive ever spent!</li>
            <li> 1)I wanted a better clean than a manual toothbrush could provide (hence the selling point) and</li>
            <li> The rebate process is very quick.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I find that this toothbrush makes it easy to improve the quality and consistency of my brushing, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> both easy to use...</li>
            <li> It was also delivered VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel after I use it.</li>
            <li> Battery still going strong.</li>
            <li> My dentist highly praises Oral-B and for good reason.</li>
            <li> After the first brushing it is amazing how my teeth felt.</li>
            <li> they both work just fine and does the job...</li>
            <li> If it can be a little lower in price, then it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is clearly more powerful than the Vitality</li>
            <li> The machine is lightweight, easy to keep clean, and I like the fact that it can rest in its charging cradle without \\&quot;overcharging.\\</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Try the Amazon frustration free packaging version, not the retail box and it worked.  </li>
            <li> The variable speed makes it comfortable for both me and my son.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush\\&quot; priced $92.75 including rebates and free shipping.</li>
            <li> The results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is a great buy with the rebate that is offered now and this toothbrush will last you forever.</li>
            <li> note as I write this that the product is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> I have to say it&#x27;s worth every penny that spent, I&#x27;m happy to have got it in Lighting deal!!</li>
            <li> It is such a joy to know I am getting all my teeth clean in a way i could&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> After using it as instructed, my mouth feels as clean and smooth as when I go to a dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel dentist clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It certainly felt effective before it broke, but it quickly broke; now it hums when it is turned on, but it does not rotate the brushhead at all.</li>
            <li> Got a unit in the 4000 series called the model 4750 which is the one pictured on Amazon plus the 3 free replacement brush heads in the special promotion.</li>
            <li> This being my first use of a power toothbrush, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> Have used electric toothbrushes in the past - this one is the BEST!  </li>
            <li> Besides that minor point, the Oral-B 4000 is great.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the original toothbrush would both beep and pause after each 30-second interval.  </li>
            <li> Since we had kept the original brush head, we consider a portion of the shipping cost to have been \\&quot;covered\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace the aging battery of the Elites (I have 2), however, my kids wouldn&#x27;t switch to this one because it is significantly weaker than the Elite.  </li>
            <li> On the handle it also tells you how long to brush in each quadrant of the mouth, then gives a happy face on the handle if you have used the brush as instructed.  </li>
            <li> I intend(ed) to purchase three more for my children for Christmas, but wanted to test it myself first.</li>
            <li> Then I requested a replacement &amp; put the original in the mail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noisy and the brush is a bit bulky for anyone with a small mouth, however it does an excellent job of brushing teeth squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> Just like most of the reviewer stated Dentist are just paid by sonicare to tell you it is better when oral b is just as great if not better!</li>
            <li> The new travel case and charger are nice.</li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my teeth and gums have ever stayed so clean.</li>
            <li> thing is packed with settings... diamond clean - which cleans with a pulse.</li>
            <li> It gives me that just-been-to-the dentist clean</li>
            <li> After that 2 minutes of cleaning - you&#x27;ll feel... so fresh and so clean clean clean...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to surprising my dental hygenist on my next visit.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush overall.</li>
            <li> floss action i believe) is nice cause</li>
            <li> It works much faster and does a better cleaning.</li>
            <li> Second of all and most important the service I got from Amazon was even better.</li>
            <li> You have to really watch the pressure and make sure you just let the brush do</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> If you want clean and fresh, get an Oral-B 4000.  </li>
            <li> Also, it signals every 30 seconds, which does help pay attention to brushing all four quadrants adequately.  </li>
            <li> However, when this brush&#x27;s life is over, I would most likely switch to Philips Sonicare, and hope to experience better customer service.</li>
            <li> I really like the options and how easy it is to keep clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tremendous.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are very pleased with the purchase of our second Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The new model has a number of changes, most of which are improvements.</li>
            <li> I had been a long time user of the Crest Spin Brush since it was cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> Although a little pricey, this toothbrush does a great job at cleaning and whitening teeth.</li>
            <li> Travel case securely holds unit and brush for damage-free transport (with reasonable care).</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I am still convinced that an electric toothbrush does a far better job than a manual one.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re stuck with a $90 boat anchor or the fun of a warranty debate/return cycle/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> +) you will see the time used plus a smile face.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush does remove more food than the old Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my 4th and the most powerful by far, and holds a charge longer.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that the brush heads wouldn&#x27;t fit into the small spaces in the back of my mouth, but it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> It does the job right.  </li>
            <li> It does clean very well.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I love Oral-B toothbrushes and ordered this model to replace an old one</li>
            <li> My first Braun performed flawlessly for approximately 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure i did not brush adequately with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Being my first electric toothbrush, I got used to it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is a solidly built unit and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> And the timer is so nice to make sure we are both brushing long enough.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B Sonic Professional, however, I recently got braces on my teeth and my orthodontist strongly suggested that I change toothbrushes while I have the braces on.  </li>
            <li> But, after a recent visit to my dentist, I decided to invest in one for better oral care.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is still working as on the first day, no issues at all.</li>
            <li> For me, the different speed-settings are more of a gimmick, as I always have it on maximum speed.  </li>
            <li> I have to say the performance of this brush was impressive from day one although I was skeptical and realized it after 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> First I tried the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> This was the first electric toothbrush I ever bought.</li>
            <li> I can be sure I brush properly.</li>
            <li> I called the repair shop, and they told me that after testing both the handle and the charger, they would most likely replace which ever part was defective.  </li>
            <li> And I love that the toothbrush rotates, vibrates, and technically polishes my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Seeing the results in a short period of time, I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> tried the Philips electric first, and it slowed plaque build-up, but it would eventually accumulate.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was pretty hokey.</li>
            <li> What it does is display the face when you have brushed  for the appropriate length of time.</li>
            <li> I share with my boyfriend (we have different heads) and were in love with it.</li>
            <li> Battery life is as expected on it and the interchangeable heads are nice.</li>
            <li> I like it much more than larger brush heads.</li>
            <li> And, I tried a battery-powered Oral-B that worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Without any doubt, the latest retail package only contains one brush head.  </li>
            <li> First I floss</li>
            <li> The timer comes in handy when brushing, but other than that it&#x27;s exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li> Although booth toothbrushes worked pretty much the same - it is more of a percieved value to have the digital lcd display (looks more fancy)...</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon the first time about this problem, they noted that the item was temporarily unavailable from them due to some kind of problem.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean all day long no matter what I eat and notice a huge improvement in my gums as well.</li>
            <li> The timer is great, just a subtle series of pauses at 30 seconds, and then a longer series of pauses at 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> A good visit to the dentist means a short visit to me, and this brush has helped keep visits short.</li>
            <li> This model has more action than my old one Oral B.</li>
            <li> Again, love the cleaning ability, it has really made a big difference.</li>
            <li> Like the 4 brushing settings (normal, sensitive, etc.), like being able to see battery life left, enjoy getting a smiley face at the end of brushing, timer, pretty much all the advertised benefits.</li>
            <li> I also love the timer on this model, as I am one of those people who needs a bit of guidance on how long I should brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to reach the back of my teeth</li>
            <li> This is my first (real) electric toothbrush (the $9 crest ones don&#x27;t count haha)...</li>
            <li> and it makes it really easy to open up the box and get to your product.</li>
            <li> &quot; The electric cord plug is a bit large.</li>
            <li> The charger has a large plug, so I do not leave it in the stand.  </li>
            <li> The brush tells me, with a change in pulsation frequency, when it is time to move to a different quadrant and, finally, when I&#x27;ve brushed the full two minutes (I get a smiley face on the display when I&#x27;ve done a good job).  </li>
            <li> Amazon quickly took it back with a free return label and sent another thinking the problem was fixed.</li>
            <li> Actually a handy little display.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to me and it works very well.</li>
            <li> but it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> This product beats Sonicare in every way - both from a hygiene point of view (no mold build-up under the brush collar) and the effect it has on your teeth and gums - feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I really like this series.   </li>
            <li> It cleans very well..</li>
            <li> Now, I really look forward to cleaning my teeth and gums</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It also has a gentle setting (which I need).  </li>
            <li> I am really pissed</li>
            <li> Amazon reps said they are working on properly describing the retail and frustration free items to avoid confusion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The rep said that I could get an exchange if I waited for the item to come back to being available on Amazon.com, which is what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every trip to the dentist was an embarrassment, really.</li>
            <li> As I travel, I also really appreciate the travel case and the ability of the charger to be plugged into any voltage (110/220) power source.</li>
            <li> I really do brush longer, and after just a week of use there was a visible difference in the health of my gums and the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I like the timed interval for brushing each surface and stopping when too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> Love the cleaning ability, our teeth feel far cleaner than using a standard brush and would recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a Sonni-care, which i liked, until the battery died after a  few years.  </li>
            <li> luckily for me my significant other wasn&#x27;t so picky and didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of the return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - which might be more effective than the motion that each model offers (the standard motion is usually what i use because its a hassle to change the settings when i just want to press one button).</li>
            <li> Although you still need to floss, this particular toothbrush really minimizes the build-up of crud between your teeth.</li>
            <li> extended clean - which cleans for an extra 30 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> Great product, the only downside is, I get so lazy to use normal toothbrushes when I am traveling.  </li>
            <li> The true source of themisunderstanding is Oral-B by calling multiple models the 4000 series and creating these issues.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold, easy to operate, multiple brush settings (4), \\&quot;complete cleaning\\&quot; timer and single charge lasts weeks.  </li>
            <li> Hands down better than Sonicare in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> PURCHASED AS A REPLACEMENT OF AN OLDER ORAL B.</li>
            <li> I love the features of this brush - the brushing time indicator, the display screen, the waterproof handle and simple charging station that does not have to be plugged in on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This feature -- the timer, not the smiley face --  was the reason I purchased this particular model</li>
            <li> Oral-B explained that this item was an older 4000 designed for a promotion through dental offices.</li>
            <li> /&gt;there were some bad/useless things on this particular model/delivery etc.</li>
            <li> I had an older model before this for several years that was much more basic.  </li>
            <li> but the unit we received was an older unit Triumph Series Model which is no longer made.</li>
            <li> Well, then the older discontinued unit we received should have been sold at a closeout price.</li>
            <li> Got the same older model again and Amazon took it back again with very friendly service from the phone reps.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on Consumer Reports high rating.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Price of replacement heads is also a bit high ($27.00 for two and Rite Aid) but that&#x27;s the case with all of the mechanical toothbrushes I reviewed.  </li>
            <li> With the exception of the faulty battery, I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;deep&#x27; clean simply makes you brush longer, and while that seems like a bit of a cop-out, it&#x27;s really all you do need for a deep clean.  </li>
            <li> My first use of this brush left my mouth sore and tender,figuring this to just be due to being a new product I used it a few more times hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> The new unit we received is identical to the older Triumph Model in our household we wished to replace.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a professional electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have really noticed the difference over my old toothbrush the Oral B vitality.</li>
            <li> I just wish it came with normal heads instead of the whiting ones.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> There was no brush head holder included with the replacement, but the new handle \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; fits in the one we kept.  </li>
            <li> P&amp;G does not acknowledge any operational issues but sent us a $10.00 coupon for purchase of a new unit.</li>
            <li> Even my old unit has brush head storage and a decent plug.</li>
            <li> but it did make me wonder if i spent too much on something that was an old model (both were the same price) or spent to much on a a 4000 series versus a 3000 series (which may have been just as effective without the bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The expiration date on the coupon in the first box was later than the one inside the replacement box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also bought one of these for my significant other...</li>
            <li> Big Deal leave it on the charger over night and it will be ready to go!</li>
            <li> U like, such as standards or deep clean</li>
            <li> This came with 2 Pro White (whitening) brush heads, not the standard, cleaning heads (either FlossAction or Precision Clean).</li>
            <li> The original toothbrush would light up in red when brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> (\\&quot;if you would like to purchase a new toothbrush that comes with a dual charger you should look for the Professional Care 4000 or 5000\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> The new unit we received does not have acceptable performance after a complete charge of 24 hours and two uses of two minutes each.  </li>
            <li> IT JUST GIVES AN OVERALL CLEAN FEELING SIMILAR TO A PROFESSIONAL CLEANING WITHOUT THE PAIN.</li>
            <li> but like i said - its somewhat of a perceived value... to have the old model versus the new model... from what i&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> I really like the pulsating feature that lets me know  when to move between different areas of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are naturally whiter</li>
            <li> I had been a manual tooth brusher my whole life, and my dentist said I should try an electric toothbrush (saying it was likely something in my brushing style that was helping my gums recede).    </li>
            <li> Using the Oral B Professional 4000</li>
            <li> I want to say that one of us was sent the old model...</li>
            <li> its almost near immpossible while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth</li>
            <li> Mouthwash really cleans deep between the gums and along the gum line.</li>
            <li> &quot; and plug are heavy and bulky but the charger is light weight and discrete.</li>
            <li> I use the whiting and the floss action and he has the sensitive.</li>
            <li> The box was marked Series 4000, but the product is marked Series 4750.  </li>
            <li> Then I will return to my Sonic Professional.  </li>
            <li> I use the floss head at night, the soft sensitive in the morning and floss at night.  </li>
            <li> Even earlier I had a Phillips Sonicare and for me the Oral B gets my teach much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I bought this one after my old Oral-B stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I have received the Oral-B Professional Care</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 18 months and so far it&#x27;s working like a champ.  </li>
            <li> I am going to buy a spare one just for my frequent travel.</li>
            <li> It is not too bulky and does a good job reaching even those difficult areas.  </li>
            <li> The electrical cord is very long (there is a funny pictograph on the adaptor/plug indicating not to cut the cord with scissors).  </li>
            <li> Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space which is a major plus in a tiny bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this product vs. the more expensive Smartseries 5000 which has additional features that sound useful but add little extra value.</li>
            <li> and standard setting - which calculates and lets you know when 30 seconds are up for cleaning that particular quarter of your mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having just received the second toothbrush, I&#x27;ve discovered exactly the same problem--NO full-size charger/holder for heads.</li>
            <li> The small size of the toothbrush head is ideal for getting in, around, and behind teeth.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long, long time, and gives nearly full power cleaning even when on lower battery.</li>
            <li> The brush moves and pulses at such a high speed</li>
            <li> All in all, a very well thought-out product that also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I find that it really helps, giving you an idea of how long you should brush for.    </li>
            <li> It starts on the normal cycle, but you can change to several brushing modes with the touch of a button.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that takes a little getting used to is the sound it makes.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush has different settings, regular clean, whitening, sensitive and extra long brushing.</li>
            <li> When the new one arrived I tried it for several weeks but the size of the handle part is way too bulky for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Approximately a week later, I received a box, not from Poughkeepsie, but from an Oral-B shipping facility located in New Jersey.  </li>
            <li> There was a coupon inside the new box offering a rebate on my next dental visit.  </li>
            <li> Had an Oral-B Triumph 9000 for over 5 years as our third Oral-B and decided to get a new unit since the 9000 had a lot of use on it.</li>
            <li> I attempted to replace the battery with a new one, following the instructions for battery removal in the product manual.  </li>
            <li> especially the newly designed brush that \\&quot;cups\\&quot; each tooth as I brush.    </li>
            <li> I am returning the defective toothbrush and getting a new one (same model).  </li>
            <li> I have been using this model Oral B for years, and I am happy to say that after a few months of using it I noticed I needed to use Sensodyne less and less.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely would NEVER go back to a regular toothbrush if i had my choice (and couldafford an electric toothbrush lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> went from an old oral b that died after 5 years use (didn&#x27;t die actually, battery stopped holding a charge) to this one.  </li>
            <li> My old Oral B died and I needed a replacement (can&#x27;t go back to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> Secondly, The unit we ordered was the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 4000</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care is my second tooth brush manufactured by Braun.  </li>
            <li> If you want quiet, get an old fashioned toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The only beef I have is that it is a bit loud and it has to be running to change the settings (regular, sensitive, or deep</li>
            <li> Although my teeth are still sensitive to some cold, they are nowhere near as sensitive as they were before, and the gums have not been receding any more.  </li>
            <li> After only 1 week of using the toothbrush with the flossing brush head I was seeing a dramatic difference in the coloring of my teeth, and how much cleaner they felt as opposed to my original manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> So, I gave this to my husband and went back to my old one since the brush part didn&#x27;t seem any different.</li>
            <li> My teeth are starting to look whiter and my mouth feels fresher for longer than it did when I brushed with my old tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It is loud, and is rough, especially with the head that the doctor recommended (and came with the brush - the floss action).  </li>
            <li> first few times I used this brush my gums felt sore/sensitive.</li>
            <li> Regular setting is WAY too rough but, with a second click, of the smaller button, I can switch to the gentle setting.  </li>
            <li> Only bad part is the price, which has increased a good deal since I last bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now addicted to excessively clean teeth and will never go back to a battery-operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I am brushing my upper teeth, the sound and vibration (even on gentle mode) is unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> The stand/charger is very compact and takes up very little space on my counter.    </li>
            <li> This last issue is the only \\&quot;con\\&quot; that really bothers me and, for all I know, it is common to all electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The only con is I like to brush my tongue and the electric toothbrush is not very efficient with brushing tongues, so I have to alternate between a regular toothbrush and the electronic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and  was set up in minutes to operate the way we like with only one long vibration after 2 minutes of brushing instead  of 4 interval reminders (which you can also select for the 4750).  </li>
            <li> We comply with the manufacture&#x27;s instructions to run the battery down completely before recharging but this does not help.  </li>
            <li> I really like the features, especially the brush letting you know if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> This may give you much less than 2 years if your unit was  in stock for a considerable time, so put the receipt away with your Oral-B instructions.  </li>
            <li> The adaptor/plug is large -- 2 inches wide x 2-3/4 inches long -- and sticks out from the wall quite a bit (~ 3 inches, when I include the stiff part of the cord).  </li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s a small display panel that includes the amount of charge left and, at the right time, a little smiley face.</li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare model power toothbrush that had a large head, and was difficult to manuver and use.</li>
            <li> This on also rattles the hard edges of the brush against my teeth unless I&#x27;m very careful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After receiving the replacement, I called Oral-B Customer Service, but they were either unwilling or unable to provide a credible explanationwith regard to the differences between the two products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it uses a lithium ion battery because it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I knew that I should have switched to an electric toothbrush a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> But I always brushed carefully.  </li>
            <li> Obviously the \\&quot;gotcha\\&quot; is the cost of the brush heads, but generic ones can be found at your local pharmacy if you fancy saving a few (or a lot of)</li>
            <li> the bristles are not too hard, not too soft, and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It allows the brush to dry and also keeps it protected.  </li>
            <li> We feel the 4750 we got in the 4000 series will give the same great service as our previous Triumph 9000 without the messy cleaning problems of the brush holders in the base.  </li>
            <li> As reviewed by others, the charger is very small and ideal to take with you on travel (it seperates from the the rest of the base).</li>
            <li> To prevent drooling all over yourself, just tilt your head back slightly while brushing.  </li>
            <li> Not that big of a deal, just a little cumbersome.</li>
            <li> It does have a smaller bristle thus making brush time a little longer.</li>
            <li> even told her there was not much she could do about it.</li>
            <li> and I can do the same in less than 4 minutes!</li>
            <li> The digital lcd feature is somewhat useless on this particular model because you can&#x27;t see the seconds while you brush your teeth (but i guess that&#x27;s all depending on how you hold your toothbrush).</li>
            <li> Both toothbrushes had a little pause to let you know to move on to the next quarter section of your mouth - but there was a slight variation in how the pause was.</li>
            <li> only complaint is there is a little open slot with a moving metal piece on the head.</li>
            <li> I have had other oral B electric tooth brushes, but this surpasses all others.  </li>
            <li> to brush other zones of teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is my first-ever electric toothbrush, so I cannot make a comparison with other models.  </li>
            <li> The prices were within a penny of each other, but Amazon offered both a $10.00 discount and a $20.00 mail-in rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a tendency to accumulate mold, due to the way the head attaches to the body.</li>
            <li> However, there are usually coupons floating around the web for various rebates.    </li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I thought that Amazon shipped the wrong part.  </li>
            <li> I recieved my 50% rebate the other day.  </li>
            <li> I always let the battery die completely before recharging and only leave it on the base to charge until it is fully ready.  </li>
            <li> [...] click on &#x27;Features&#x27; and scroll down to \\&quot;Includes ... 1 Oral-B FlossAction brush head.\\&quot; A bit further down is the caveat \\&quot;Contents may not available in all models.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> And after a few uses, I definitely noticed I have a lot less plaque and less build-up on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Go crazy after 1 week, jus in the middle of a travel, first stop function, then the power buttom dont&#x27;t work and turn on alone and don&#x27;t stop until the battery die, I charge and after a few minutes turn on again and don&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it took me so long to buy one of these, can&#x27;t imagine brushing without it.  </li>
            <li> For almost $100, this brand is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> After owning several different Oral-b toothbrushes over the years, I was again in the market for a new toothbrush after mine had a tragic accident caused by the dog.</li>
            <li> I used to have to go to dentist 4 times a year -- now down to twice</li>
            <li> I mean, I brushed, but the plaque would accumulate anyway.</li>
            <li> I may have to buy one for the little guy so we can brush together instead of one after the other.</li>
            <li> This one has a circular motion where the previous one went up and down.  </li>
            <li> And, double-checking on the item on Amazon&#x27;s site again, I see that it&#x27;s AGAIN not available due to some sort of problem (which they don&#x27;t describe.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush broke after less than one minute of brushing.</li>
            <li> 2) there was a rebate that would cover half of the cost.</li>
            <li> It sticks out from the outlet like a diving board and can come unplugged if even slightly bumped.</li>
            <li> It has a small pause in brushing every 30 seconds and then 4 small pauses after 2 minutes when in regular cleaning mode.</li>
            <li> it feels like it could get into those tight spaces where your molars are.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is the high price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy and feels bulkier</li>
            <li> You can buy them separate, but then you feel like you wasted the two that came with the thing.</li>
            <li> The Amazon Frustration-Free version of this product is missing items: the full-size charger with holder for toothbrush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I assumed--and the Amazon rep seemed to agree--that this could be because of the missing full-size charger.</li>
            <li> After a few years, this will not stay charged.</li>
            <li> Sadly the price has gone up probably due to Christmas approaching.</li>
            <li> It travels very well, with a small charging base and a solid travel case included.  </li>
            <li> I tend to bear down to hard on my gums.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly strong gag reflex and generally hated brushing.</li>
            <li> That said, I was disappointed that this model has no way to store separate brush heads and has a VERY unusual plug.  </li>
            <li> SMALL FOOTPRINT</li>
            <li> The heads are small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s worse--THIS time, the package was ALSO missing both brush heads!</li>
            <li> It just takes a small amount of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I usually take 15-20 minutes brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> I can put in small charger holder detached from the holder for brush heads (saves cramped counter space).</li>
            <li> I use the least expensive heads for it; same ones I used for the Vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I purchase an electric toothbrush that would let me know when I was brushing to hard.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush lets me know when I am brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 4-star because the power button is a bit hard to feel by the thumb during brushing.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that I do brush too hard so this tooth brush has helped to get me out of that habit.</li>
            <li> This means I need to put it in the recharger at least once per week.</li>
            <li> It holds the charge for at least 10 days, so I just put it on the charger unit once a week.  </li>
            <li> This appears common with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used 2 years without failure - except to recharge.</li>
            <li> So, we ordered the 4000 in retail packaging and were shocked when we got a completely different unit.</li>
            <li> Since it charges through induction (without an actual contact-surface), there is no wear on the charger or the base of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Years ago my gum-lines began receding and were getting worse over the years, causing pain from hot/cold drinks and it got to the point that I often needed Sensodyne to brush my teeth without pain.  </li>
            <li> Especially since we brush in the bathroom-I hate germs-this makes me feel safer.</li>
            <li> her&#x27;s also came with a different charging base.</li>
            <li> mine was shaped like a ring where the base of the toothbrush rested inside while hers came with male type charger.</li>
            <li> Oral-B refused to honor the 2-year warranty, stating that even though the unit was already broken before I opened it, because I opened it, the warranty was invalidated.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B said they did not deny that the unit was broken before I opened it, but because I opened it, they would not replace the unit.</li>
            <li> Instead of hardening them, things have gotten worse and the bleeding happens every time I use the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Dump the brush holders in the base and end the mess.</li>
            <li> The battery life isnt as bad as some people complained about as it lasts about a week before it needs a charge...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time figuring out which model I needed for this feature (websites were no help)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within a month, the Oral-B failed to take a charge.  </li>
            <li> Makes cleaning molars difficult.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within 6 months it&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I got my toothbrush it did not include the UPC label.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Cleaning with bleach cleaner was required frequently, and the base looked awful.  </li>
            <li> It feels awkward to hold.  </li>
            <li> However, I have to do this awkwardly while the toothbrush is on, and in my mouth; otherwise, the toothpaste sprays all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I did not give it five stars because the handle is bulkier and can be a bit awkward.  </li>
            <li> This one is just unpleasant.</li>
            <li> He suggested this toothbrush, and I must say I am sadly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It sticks out of the outlet close to 3 inches and looks stupid.  </li>
            <li> There was also a very annoying brush holder on the 9000 that would gunk up with stuff from the brush heads and then would start to get brown mold at the bottom.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to me and it works very well. I love it holds a good charge and makes my teeth feel very clean</li>
            <li> I purchased this tooth brush after a recommendation from my dentist to get an electric tooth brush because I had the beginnings of gingevitis and quite a bit of decay from over 6 years of not visiting a dentist. After only 1 week of using the toothbrush with the flossing brush head I was seeing a dramatic difference in the coloring of my teeth, and how much cleaner they felt as opposed to my original manual tooth brush. The timer is great, just a subtle series of pauses at 30 seconds, and then a longer series of pauses at 2 minutes. I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the very best electric tooth brush I have used.  I have had other oral B electric tooth brushes, but this surpasses all others.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> Go crazy after 1 week, jus in the middle of a travel, first stop function, then the power buttom dont&#x27;t work and turn on alone and don&#x27;t stop until the battery die, I charge and after a few minutes turn on again and don&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li> Although this model does not have any fancy features it truly does an excellent job. Provided travel case is also an additional bonus as toothbrush head and unit fits perfectly. Would recommend this product vs. the more expensive Smartseries 5000 which has additional features that sound useful but add little extra value.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush has different settings, regular clean, whitening, sensitive and extra long brushing.Toothbrush works with different heads;regular,sensitive,flossing function and whitening.    It&#x27;s a little noisy and feels bulkier but it cleans very well. Only bad thing is the high price. This is the third electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had and it&#x27;s the best so far.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush broke after less than one minute of brushing. It certainly felt effective before it broke, but it quickly broke; now it hums when it is turned on, but it does not rotate the brushhead at all.</li>
            <li> This product beats Sonicare in every way - both from a hygiene point of view (no mold build-up under the brush collar) and the effect it has on your teeth and gums - feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> PURCHASED AS A REPLACEMENT OF AN OLDER ORAL B. AMAZED BY THE IMPROVEMENTS, ANGLED HEAD..MORE SPEED.. BATTERY METER...BRUSH TIMER...SMALL FOOTPRINT WHEN IN HOLDER/CHARGER..IT JUST GIVES AN OVERALL CLEAN FEELING SIMILAR TO A PROFESSIONAL CLEANING WITHOUT THE PAIN.</li>
            <li> I really like this series.   It has not only the battery reminder but also can set up the mode U like, such as standards or deep clean,  the best of all, it will remind u every 30 secs. to brush other zones of teeth.  I am considering to get another one for my parents.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I am very glad I choose this one. It cleans very well..the bristles are not too hard, not too soft, and will last for a long time. Using and cleaning this product is extremely simple. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a professional electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> went from an old oral b that died after 5 years use (didn&#x27;t die actually, battery stopped holding a charge) to this one.  Been very happy with it.  The timer comes in handy when brushing, but other than that it&#x27;s exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li> This being my first use of a power toothbrush, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  But, after a recent visit to my dentist, I decided to invest in one for better oral care.  After researching various options, I chose this model.  Now, I really look forward to cleaning my teeth and gums and I know I&#x27;m using the perfect product to do so.  My mouth feels amazing every time I use it.  I really like the pulsating feature that lets me know  when to move between different areas of my mouth.  The LED display is great too.  Another great feature is that the brush heads indicate when it&#x27;s time to get a new one which takes the guessing out of that process.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for two reasons 1)I wanted a better clean than a manual toothbrush could provide (hence the selling point) and 2) there was a rebate that would cover half of the cost. With that said...the 3000 was only only a dollar or two cheaper than the 4000 so I bought the 4000.  PROS: Like the 4 brushing settings (normal, sensitive, etc.), like being able to see battery life left, enjoy getting a smiley face at the end of brushing, timer, pretty much all the advertised benefits. Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space which is a major plus in a tiny bathroom.  CONS: Battery life isn&#x27;t so great.   If money is a concern, the 3000 does the same stuff and probably has a longer battery life because it doesn&#x27;t have an LCD screen.  If money is no problem, I would have upgraded to the 5000 so I could have gotten the detached Smartguide instead of trying to maneuver to see my toothbrush LCD screen in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Even after so many reviews already for this product, i think this review can add to the greatness of this product. I have received this product as a gift (on my own request) 3 years ago. It has gone through some updates, but the toothbrush looks still the same. The product itself is still working as on the first day, no issues at all. The battery-life is still doable after all this time, I think it lasts about 6-7 4-minute sessions (i do tend to brush my teeth longer than the recommended 2 minutes because it&#x27;s such a pleasure to do it with an electric brush). This means I need to put it in the recharger at least once per week. As reviewed by others, the charger is very small and ideal to take with you on travel (it seperates from the the rest of the base). Since it charges through induction (without an actual contact-surface), there is no wear on the charger or the base of the brush.  For me, the different speed-settings are more of a gimmick, as I always have it on maximum speed.  All in all, a very well thought-out product that also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this item from Amazon because of the rebate and when I sent the paperwork in it was refused for a reason I could not comprehend.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun Oral-B Vitality (their inexpensive model) for years, and didn&#x27;t want to buy this model, but I was traveling in Europe and needed one I could charge on a 220-240 volt system.  I had a difficult time figuring out which model I needed for this feature (websites were no help) so I finally emailed P&amp;G and they sent me the information (\\&quot;if you would like to purchase a new toothbrush that comes with a dual charger you should look for the Professional Care 4000 or 5000\\&quot;).  I bought the model reviewed here (also called \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot;, which is confusing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cost more than I wanted to spend, but now I am happy I have it.  It travels very well, with a small charging base and a solid travel case included.  It works well on 110 and 220 volts, but the charger does heat up, so I find I leave it unplugged some of the time.  I use the least expensive heads for it; same ones I used for the Vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clearly more powerful than the Vitality and I find I like that.  Also, it signals every 30 seconds, which does help pay attention to brushing all four quadrants adequately.  It is a solidly built unit and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This Oral B Smartseries 4000 is FANTASTIC!  Have used electric toothbrushes in the past - this one is the BEST!  Easy to reach the back of my teeth - very, very clean feel - very highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Almost feels like you just left the dentist.  Not sure why it took me so long to buy one of these, can&#x27;t imagine brushing without it.  Give it a try you wont be dissapointed.  The rebate process is very quick. Got my rebate within 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> After brushing my teeth I feel like I just left my dental hygienist.  My teeth and mouth feel so clean.  I love the features of this brush - the brushing time indicator, the display screen, the waterproof handle and simple charging station that does not have to be plugged in on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Has reduced my tooth sensitivity and actually whitened my teeth even through I am only using the \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; brush.  Mine held it&#x27;s charge for about 10 days using it 2x&#x27;s a day.  My teeth feel so much cleaner.  I am so impressed with this brush.</li>
            <li> I do a good job brushing the old-fashioned way, but this device is unbelievably good. Although you still need to floss, this particular toothbrush really minimizes the build-up of crud between your teeth. I&#x27;m looking forward to surprising my dental hygenist on my next visit.   I also purchased replacement packs of the flossing and polishing attachment heads, and alternate using each.  The machine is lightweight, easy to keep clean, and I like the fact that it can rest in its charging cradle without \\&quot;overcharging.\\&quot; The electric cord plug is a bit large. I wish it could be more compact or have its prongs perpendicular to the mass of the plug. It sticks out from the outlet like a diving board and can come unplugged if even slightly bumped. I have Braun devices with a similar plug. The engineers for both should revisit their designs.  Besides that minor point, the Oral-B 4000 is great. I don&#x27;t think my teeth and gums have ever stayed so clean.</li>
            <li> After about a month of using this toothbrush my teeth feel like I have been to the dentist to get them cleaned.</li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade my current electric tooth brush.  When the new one arrived I tried it for several weeks but the size of the handle part is way too bulky for me.  It feels awkward to hold.  So, I gave this to my husband and went back to my old one since the brush part didn&#x27;t seem any different. And it fits my hand better.</li>
            <li> I have to say the performance of this brush was impressive from day one although I was skeptical and realized it after 3-4 days. My teeth are naturally whiter but I was getting brown stains for no reasons[I don&#x27;t smoke] and will get it removed only when I go to Dentist and they will show again in couple of months. I realized this brush was getting rid of them every time I brushed. I have to say it&#x27;s worth every penny that spent, I&#x27;m happy to have got it in Lighting deal!!</li>
            <li> This purchase was to replace another oral-B that I had dropped several times.  I can not tell you how pleased my dental hygenist has been since I started using the Oral-B.  Even the dentist said\\&quot; why didn&#x27;t you do this 30 years ago?\\&quot;  I guess that seaks for itself...</li>
            <li> Hands down better than Sonicare in my opinion.  Years ago my gum-lines began receding and were getting worse over the years, causing pain from hot/cold drinks and it got to the point that I often needed Sensodyne to brush my teeth without pain.  I had been a manual tooth brusher my whole life, and my dentist said I should try an electric toothbrush (saying it was likely something in my brushing style that was helping my gums recede).    First I tried the Sonicare.  I tried that for many months.  When I went back to my dentist, he said that I should buy an Oral B because its technique is much different from the Sonicare.  Am I ever grateful that I received this advice.  I have been using this model Oral B for years, and I am happy to say that after a few months of using it I noticed I needed to use Sensodyne less and less.  And after 12 to 18 months of using it, I found that I no longer needed to use Sensodyne at all.  Although my teeth are still sensitive to some cold, they are nowhere near as sensitive as they were before, and the gums have not been receding any more.  I cannot give this toothbrush enough praise!  Thank you Oral B!</li>
            <li> This was the first electric toothbrush I ever bought. Got one for my husband too. I have a fairly strong gag reflex and generally hated brushing. I&#x27;m sure i did not brush adequately with a regular toothbrush.  Using the Oral B Professional 4000 I can be sure I brush properly. The heads are small. It gets every tooth completely-even way in back.  Seems to have a lot of power.  The timer is wonderful. I find myself brushing over 3 minutes now. It is such a joy to know I am getting all my teeth clean in a way i could&#x27;t before. The charge lasts about a week.  My husband loves his too.  I like the case to store it in.  Especially since we brush in the bathroom-I hate germs-this makes me feel safer. It allows the brush to dry and also keeps it protected.  The refills can be found everywhere. You can find coupons for them in the sunday paper. I did buy a bunch with the toothbrush to get started. It doesn&#x27;t replace the need to floss in between teeth routinely but you will brush better and longer using it. It may be much more expensive than a traditional non-electric toothbrush but your dental bills will be smaller. I highly reccomend this toothbrush.  after 6 months of using this product My dentist even noticed a difference!! they are amazed at what a great job it does.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does an excellent job at cleaning and leaves your mouth feeling very clean.  Comfortable to hold, easy to operate, multiple brush settings (4), \\&quot;complete cleaning\\&quot; timer and single charge lasts weeks.  Easy to clean and waterproof.  Travel case securely holds unit and brush for damage-free transport (with reasonable care).</li>
            <li> This is my first-ever electric toothbrush, so I cannot make a comparison with other models.  However, it is very easy to brush my teeth thoroughly every time with this brush.  Pros:  The brush tells me, with a change in pulsation frequency, when it is time to move to a different quadrant and, finally, when I&#x27;ve brushed the full two minutes (I get a smiley face on the display when I&#x27;ve done a good job).  This feature -- the timer, not the smiley face --  was the reason I purchased this particular model and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It also has a gentle setting (which I need).  The stand/charger is very compact and takes up very little space on my counter.    Cons:  Regular setting is WAY too rough but, with a second click, of the smaller button, I can switch to the gentle setting.  However, I have to do this awkwardly while the toothbrush is on, and in my mouth; otherwise, the toothpaste sprays all over the place.  There was a short learning curve.  The electrical cord is very long (there is a funny pictograph on the adaptor/plug indicating not to cut the cord with scissors).  The adaptor/plug is large -- 2 inches wide x 2-3/4 inches long -- and sticks out from the wall quite a bit (~ 3 inches, when I include the stiff part of the cord).  When I am brushing my upper teeth, the sound and vibration (even on gentle mode) is unpleasant.  This last issue is the only \\&quot;con\\&quot; that really bothers me and, for all I know, it is common to all electric toothbrushes.  Therefore, I find that this toothbrush makes it easy to improve the quality and consistency of my brushing, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush from Amazon in December 2011.  The Consumer Reports review rated it about equal with the equivalent Philips Sonicare.  The prices were within a penny of each other, but Amazon offered both a $10.00 discount and a $20.00 mail-in rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a month, the Oral-B failed to take a charge.  I called their Customer Service Department (There is a 2-year warranty), and they told me to send it to the nearest repair facility (located about 75 miles away in Poughkeepsie, NY).  I called the repair shop, and they told me that after testing both the handle and the charger, they would most likely replace which ever part was defective.  They informed me that I had to pay for the shipping (either UPS or FedEx), and it had to be insured, as well.  Oral-B would pay for the return shipping.  Even after applying a AAA discount at the local UPS Store, it cost me just under $13.00 to ship it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximately a week later, I received a box, not from Poughkeepsie, but from an Oral-B shipping facility located in New Jersey.  Inside was an unopened box with a SmartSeries 4000 toothbrush inside.  It was not, however, the same product that I had purchased from Amazon.  The toothbrush I bought had come with a brush head holder and one brush head.  There was no brush head holder included with the replacement, but the new handle \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; fits in the one we kept.  The original toothbrush would light up in red when brushing too hard.  The replacement does not have this feature.  Furthermore, the original toothbrush would both beep and pause after each 30-second interval.  The replacement pauses, but does not beep.  The only advantage of the replacement was the fact that it came with two brush heads.  Since we had kept the original brush head, we consider a portion of the shipping cost to have been \\&quot;covered\\&quot;.  After receiving the replacement, I called Oral-B Customer Service, but they were either unwilling or unable to provide a credible explanationwith regard to the differences between the two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that Oral-B makes different models of the SmartSeries 4000.  I am convinced that when they sent the replacement, it was last year&#x27;s model.  How do I know that?  There was a coupon inside the new box offering a rebate on my next dental visit.  It had already expired.  Each box also contained coupons for discounts on replacement brush heads.  The expiration date on the coupon in the first box was later than the one inside the replacement box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am still convinced that an electric toothbrush does a far better job than a manual one.  The problems experienced are not Amazon&#x27;s fault.  However, when this brush&#x27;s life is over, I would most likely switch to Philips Sonicare, and hope to experience better customer service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush overall. I just wish it came with normal heads instead of the whiting ones. Makes cleaning molars difficult. You can buy them separate, but then you feel like you wasted the two that came with the thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My dentist picked this out from a list I showed him. I really like the options and how easy it is to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Purchased this during one of the Today&#x27;s Deals to try this brand out! Now that I have tried it I would happily pay full price! After the first brushing it is amazing how my teeth felt. Definitely if you care about your teeth you must get this!</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush and I love it! It definitely helps me get to the hard-to-reach places, such as my molars. And I love that the toothbrush rotates, vibrates, and technically polishes my teeth.  And after a few uses, I definitely noticed I have a lot less plaque and less build-up on my teeth. The only con is I like to brush my tongue and the electric toothbrush is not very efficient with brushing tongues, so I have to alternate between a regular toothbrush and the electronic toothbrush.  Overall, I would still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They cancelled my order for no reason after I placed it and they raised the price to the original one!! I am really pissed</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush for 6 months I would definitely not go back to regular toothbrushes. It does clean very well.</li>
            <li> Had an Oral-B Triumph 9000 for over 5 years as our third Oral-B and decided to get a new unit since the 9000 had a lot of use on it. There was also a very annoying brush holder on the 9000 that would gunk up with stuff from the brush heads and then would start to get brown mold at the bottom.  Cleaning with bleach cleaner was required frequently, and the base looked awful.  Well, Oral-B figured it out. Dump the brush holders in the base and end the mess. We decided to use a plastic Tupperware soap holder to store brush heads in  a sanitary manner.  So, we ordered the 4000 in retail packaging and were shocked when we got a completely different unit. Oral-B explained that this item was an older 4000 designed for a promotion through dental offices. Amazon quickly took it back with a free return label and sent another thinking the problem was fixed. No such luck. Got the same older model again and Amazon took it back again with very friendly service from the phone reps.  Boo Hoo! I wanted my 4000, not the over gadgeted 5000 that could also be ordered from Amazon, so I began to read the Amazon reviews noting that some buyers got the unit pictured and others did not. Ooo! Ooo! as the cop said on \\&quot;Car 54 Where Are You\\&quot;. Try the Amazon frustration free packaging version, not the retail box and it worked.  Got a unit in the 4000 series called the model 4750 which is the one pictured on Amazon plus the 3 free replacement brush heads in the special promotion. It charged fully overnight and  was set up in minutes to operate the way we like with only one long vibration after 2 minutes of brushing instead  of 4 interval reminders (which you can also select for the 4750).  I gave Amazon great credit for prompt, friendly telephone service and 100% free exchanges and returns. This is the way to run a mail order shop and I recommend Amazon to all.  Amazon reps said they are working on properly describing the retail and frustration free items to avoid confusion. The true source of themisunderstanding is Oral-B by calling multiple models the 4000 series and creating these issues.  We feel the 4750 we got in the 4000 series will give the same great service as our previous Triumph 9000 without the messy cleaning problems of the brush holders in the base.  Now, do be sure to save your receipt. Amazon gives you 30 days to return it and Oral-B has a 60 day satisfaction refund procedure. Your 2 year warranty runs from the date on your receipt. If you don&#x27;t have one, it runs 2 years from the date of manufacture. This may give you much less than 2 years if your unit was  in stock for a considerable time, so put the receipt away with your Oral-B instructions.  My dentist highly praises Oral-B and for good reason. It does the job right.  The 4000 is not made in China and comes from a line of brushes that has passed the test of time.  Love the 4000 and Amazon&#x27;s great service.</li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare model power toothbrush that had a large head, and was difficult to manuver and use. This Oral-B brush is a good size and makes it easy to use, which means cleaner teeth. I think it uses a lithium ion battery because it holds a charge for a long time. A good visit to the dentist means a short visit to me, and this brush has helped keep visits short.</li>
            <li> This is my first (real) electric toothbrush (the $9 crest ones don&#x27;t count haha)... and it works super great. I absolutely would NEVER go back to a regular toothbrush if i had my choice (and couldafford an electric toothbrush lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is packed with settings... diamond clean - which cleans with a pulse. extended clean - which cleans for an extra 30 seconds or so. feather setting - for those with sensitivity issues. and standard setting - which calculates and lets you know when 30 seconds are up for cleaning that particular quarter of your mouth. After that 2 minutes of cleaning - you&#x27;ll feel... so fresh and so clean clean clean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there were some bad/useless things on this particular model/delivery etc. I also bought one of these for my significant other...I want to say that one of us was sent the old model...one of them came with a simple display without the lcd (just display lights regarding the settings).. i noticed that they sent me the model with a digital lcd display which showed the actual seconds elapsing while i brushed my teeth. The digital lcd feature is somewhat useless on this particular model because you can&#x27;t see the seconds while you brush your teeth (but i guess that&#x27;s all depending on how you hold your toothbrush). its almost near immpossible while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth - you&#x27;d have to pause the brushing to look at the number. Both toothbrushes had a little pause to let you know to move on to the next quarter section of your mouth - but there was a slight variation in how the pause was. Although booth toothbrushes worked pretty much the same - it is more of a percieved value to have the digital lcd display (looks more fancy)... luckily for me my significant other wasn&#x27;t so picky and didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of the return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed another difference... her package came with a toothbrush head holder - while mind did not. her&#x27;s also came with a different charging base. mine was shaped like a ring where the base of the toothbrush rested inside while hers came with male type charger. both easy to use... but like i said - its somewhat of a perceived value... to have the old model versus the new model... from what i&#x27;ve seen so far. they both work just fine and does the job... but it did make me wonder if i spent too much on something that was an old model (both were the same price) or spent to much on a a 4000 series versus a 3000 series (which may have been just as effective without the bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i believe that every model uses the same toothbrush heads (interchangeable to about 3-5 types?) - which might be more effective than the motion that each model offers (the standard motion is usually what i use because its a hassle to change the settings when i just want to press one button). that&#x27;s another plus - the toothbrush head that it came with (floss action i believe) is nice cause it feels like it could get into those tight spaces where your molars are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall - i&#x27;m satifisfied with its ergonomics and utility.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush -- my teeth have never felt so clean! My daughter always has had \\&quot;yellowed\\&quot; teeth and the dentist even told her there was not much she could do about it. Her teeth look whiter and brighter after using this brush. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> In my opinion - the batteries they put in their product are garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 6 months it&#x27;s useless.  Amazon won&#x27;t help because return period is up and you&#x27;re stuck with a $90 boat anchor or the fun of a warranty debate/return cycle/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and look for another product</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on Consumer Reports high rating. Seeing the results in a short period of time, I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> The Amazon Frustration-Free version of this product is missing items: the full-size charger with holder for toothbrush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted Amazon the first time about this problem, they noted that the item was temporarily unavailable from them due to some kind of problem. I assumed--and the Amazon rep seemed to agree--that this could be because of the missing full-size charger. The rep said that I could get an exchange if I waited for the item to come back to being available on Amazon.com, which is what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having just received the second toothbrush, I&#x27;ve discovered exactly the same problem--NO full-size charger/holder for heads. And, double-checking on the item on Amazon&#x27;s site again, I see that it&#x27;s AGAIN not available due to some sort of problem (which they don&#x27;t describe.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s worse--THIS time, the package was ALSO missing both brush heads! (It&#x27;s supposed to come with TWO.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I purchase an electric toothbrush that would let me know when I was brushing to hard.  This Oral-B Smartseries 4000 was perfect.  I tend to bear down to hard on my gums.  This toothbrush lets me know when I am brushing too hard.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of problems with dental plaque. Every trip to the dentist was an embarrassment, really. I mean, I brushed, but the plaque would accumulate anyway. Yuck!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Philips electric first, and it slowed plaque build-up, but it would eventually accumulate. I didn&#x27;t like the Philips because it always needed cleaning. It has a tendency to accumulate mold, due to the way the head attaches to the body. One day I dropped it and it went kaput. So I got the Oral-B, by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a big difference in teeth-cleaning power. The Oral-B got rid of ALL of my plaque after a while, and it&#x27;s stayed away ever since I started using it (over a year now). Battery still going strong. And--I like to use it. It gives me that just-been-to-the dentist clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hint I took from my dentist is to use it occasionally with mouthwash. Mouthwash really cleans deep between the gums and along the gum line. No gingivitis (a bacterial infection that irritates the gums gums)--ever. It just takes a small amount of mouthwash. To prevent drooling all over yourself, just tilt your head back slightly while brushing.  Everything will stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the way to go for great oral hygiene. Whoever kisses you will thank you. I feel great every time I use it--which keeps me using it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noisy and the brush is a bit bulky for anyone with a small mouth, however it does an excellent job of brushing teeth squeaky clean.  Bottom line:  I like it!</li>
            <li> After owning several different Oral-b toothbrushes over the years, I was again in the market for a new toothbrush after mine had a tragic accident caused by the dog. I decided to try the Smartseries 4000 as my newest toothbrush. After one use, I am very impressed. The variable speed makes it comfortable for both me and my son. And the timer is so nice to make sure we are both brushing long enough. I may have to buy one for the little guy so we can brush together instead of one after the other. For the price, this is a top quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My old Oral B died and I needed a replacement (can&#x27;t go back to manual brushing. The new model has a number of changes, most of which are improvements. When brushing, the handle seems more comfortable. Also, there&#x27;s a small display panel that includes the amount of charge left and, at the right time, a little smiley face. At first, I thought it was pretty hokey. What it does is display the face when you have brushed  for the appropriate length of time. Actually a handy little display. Linked up to this is a timer for brushing. Every 30 seconds or so, the brush motor stutters, indicating that you can move on to the next section of teeth. I find that it really helps, giving you an idea of how long you should brush for.    Only bad part is the price, which has increased a good deal since I last bought. However, there are usually coupons floating around the web for various rebates.    All in all, a great toothbrush - also uses the same standard replacement brushes</li>
            <li> Received the product in working condition and on time, Amazon rocks!    I purchased this product to replace the aging battery of the Elites (I have 2), however, my kids wouldn&#x27;t switch to this one because it is significantly weaker than the Elite.  Though I think both products did a very good job of cleaning the teeth.  I gave it a 4-star because the power button is a bit hard to feel by the thumb during brushing.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I ordered the \\&quot;Oral-B ProfessionalCare SmartSeries 4000 Electric Toothbrush\\&quot; priced $92.75 including rebates and free shipping. The \\&quot;Oral-B ProfessionalCare SmartSeries 4000 Electric Toothbrush\\&quot; and plug are heavy and bulky but the charger is light weight and discrete. The blue coffin included is the only area to store the additional \\&quot;Oral-B Pro White Replacement Electric Toothbrush Head.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is the best 80bucks ive ever spent! My teeth feel clean all day long no matter what I eat and notice a huge improvement in my gums as well. I share with my boyfriend (we have different heads) and were in love with it. I use the whiting and the floss action and he has the sensitive. We are both very happy with the tooth brush and reccomend it to all our family, friends and co-workers! Also my boyfriend spent a week doing product reviews and found that this model was the best and better then sonicare. Just like most of the reviewer stated Dentist are just paid by sonicare to tell you it is better when oral b is just as great if not better!</li>
            <li> This model has more action than my old one Oral B. It works much faster and does a better cleaning.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best most professional type of home product I have ever used.  After using the toothbrush, I fees as if I had just been to the hygienist.  My mouth feels clean and fresh.  The gums also have gotten praise from my periodontist since using this toothbrush.  On the handle it also tells you how long to brush in each quadrant of the mouth, then gives a happy face on the handle if you have used the brush as instructed.  Believe me it knows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccommended!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I love Oral-B toothbrushes and ordered this model to replace an old one and I love the way it operates.  That said, I was disappointed that this model has no way to store separate brush heads and has a VERY unusual plug.  It sticks out of the outlet close to 3 inches and looks stupid.  I called Oral-B and they told me where to buy a storage unit to keep brush heads in for a price. Did they make this for Amazon to sell as a cheaper model? Even my old unit has brush head storage and a decent plug.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are very pleased with the purchase of our second Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush. We recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I thought that Amazon shipped the wrong part.  The box was marked Series 4000, but the product is marked Series 4750.  As it turns out this one is as advertised.  The charger has a large plug, so I do not leave it in the stand.  It holds the charge for at least 10 days, so I just put it on the charger unit once a week.  It has a good readout and, if you brush correctly (2 min +) you will see the time used plus a smile face.  It starts on the normal cycle, but you can change to several brushing modes with the touch of a button.  I had an older model before this for several years that was much more basic.  It was still running perfect, but I just could not resist the Oral-B rebate offer and all the \\&quot;Bells &amp; Whistles\\&quot; that this one has.  Amazon should tell you that the model number is not Smartseries 4000.  That would avoid any confusion when you receive the product.    This is a wonderful rechargeable toothbrush and I encourages you to brush your teeth the proper way and the correct amount of time.  A thumbs up product!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush. I upgraded from the cheapest Oral-B brush to this. It tells you when you are done brushing and cleans the heck out of your teeth.It was also delivered VERY quickly. I ordered at 1pm and it was on my doorstep by 7am the next day, in Atlanta. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a power toothbrush user from way back.  I love my Oral B Sonic Professional, however, I recently got braces on my teeth and my orthodontist strongly suggested that I change toothbrushes while I have the braces on.  He suggested this toothbrush, and I must say I am sadly disappointed.  It is loud, and is rough, especially with the head that the doctor recommended (and came with the brush - the floss action).  My first use of this brush left my mouth sore and tender,figuring this to just be due to being a new product I used it a few more times hoping for better results. To no avail. Afterwards, I obtained a manual brush made for braces until such time as I get them off.  Then I will return to my Sonic Professional.  I strongly urge you to look elsewhere if you are looking to obtain a power toothbrush for your own mouth full of braces. This one is just unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Although a little pricey, this toothbrush does a great job at cleaning and whitening teeth. The teeth whitening/polishing settings leaves your mouth feeling like you just left the dentist. Battery life is as expected on it and the interchangeable heads are nice.</li>
            <li> This came with 2 Pro White (whitening) brush heads, not the standard, cleaning heads (either FlossAction or Precision Clean). [...] click on &#x27;Features&#x27; and scroll down to \\&quot;Includes ... 1 Oral-B FlossAction brush head.\\&quot; A bit further down is the caveat \\&quot;Contents may not available in all models.\\&quot; [...] click on &#x27;Brushheads.\\&quot; The top item reads \\&quot;Oral-B FlossActionÂ® Electric Toothbrush Head (Included).\\&quot; So, to me, this was misleading, and I have to order standard brush heads to use this product, since I do not want to use the supplementary whitening heads that it came with.</li>
            <li> Did not come with all parts.  This appears common with this product.  For the price, this should not be an issue.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I&#x27;m now addicted to excessively clean teeth and will never go back to a battery-operated toothbrush. The small size of the toothbrush head is ideal for getting in, around, and behind teeth. I like it much more than larger brush heads. I also love the timer on this model, as I am one of those people who needs a bit of guidance on how long I should brush my teeth. It has a small pause in brushing every 30 seconds and then 4 small pauses after 2 minutes when in regular cleaning mode. The &#x27;deep&#x27; clean simply makes you brush longer, and while that seems like a bit of a cop-out, it&#x27;s really all you do need for a deep clean.  It holds a charge for a long, long time, and gives nearly full power cleaning even when on lower battery. As I travel, I also really appreciate the travel case and the ability of the charger to be plugged into any voltage (110/220) power source.</li>
            <li> I think this product works really good.If it can be a little lower in price, then it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral B 4000 and am sorry I did not purchase it earlier. I intend(ed) to purchase three more for my children for Christmas, but wanted to test it myself first. Love the product and eventually hope to get one for each of the kids. Sadly the price has gone up probably due to Christmas approaching.</li>
            <li> Out of so many products that I bought during holiday season, this is by far one of the best one I invested my money into. I usually take 15-20 minutes brushing my teeth and I can do the same in less than 4 minutes!</li>
            <li> Love the cleaning ability, our teeth feel far cleaner than using a standard brush and would recommend this product to anyone.  The only beef I have is that it is a bit loud and it has to be running to change the settings (regular, sensitive, or deep clean)which inevitable gets toothpaste sprayed all over, so you have to change the settings while you are brushing.  Not that big of a deal, just a little cumbersome. Price of replacement heads is also a bit high ($27.00 for two and Rite Aid) but that&#x27;s the case with all of the mechanical toothbrushes I reviewed.  Again, love the cleaning ability, it has really made a big difference.</li>
            <li> The Oral-Be \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot; series electric tooth brushes are so good I think every person should be given one.  After cleaning your teeth will feel like you have just gone to the dentist. There are four brush heads for different people&#x27;s preferences.  I use the floss head at night, the soft sensitive in the morning and floss at night.  Did you know the same bacteria found in between teeth show up in arterial plaques that cause strokes?  And remember, bacteria don&#x27;t sleep.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!  SAVED ME FROM  EXPLENSIVE GUM DISEASE!</li>
            <li> I used to have a Sonni-care, which i liked, until the battery died after a  few years.  I decided to give this one a try and really love it.  Smaller charger and unit size makes it easier to take with me when I travel too.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality and value product.  Exactly the features I was looking for at a good price.</li>
            <li> The battery in my Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush stopped recharging 1 year after I bought it.  I attempted to replace the battery with a new one, following the instructions for battery removal in the product manual.  Oral-B refused to honor the 2-year warranty, stating that even though the unit was already broken before I opened it, because I opened it, the warranty was invalidated.  Oral-B said they did not deny that the unit was broken before I opened it, but because I opened it, they would not replace the unit.</li>
            <li> came in expeditiously and has been a wonderful toothbrush. the charger and brush together also have a sleek look on the counter.  i would encourage the use of this product based on my results</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush ~ I&#x27;ve had the same Oral B electric toothbrush for the last 15 years. I had to replace it because I dropped it and broke the peg that holds the brush.  I like the 4000 model even better...especially the newly designed brush that \\&quot;cups\\&quot; each tooth as I brush.    The only problem I have is that the battery life is not what the literature states.  Instead of 10 days of daily 2-minute brushes, the battery stays charged for only 3 days.  I am returning the defective toothbrush and getting a new one (same model).  With the exception of the faulty battery, I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> This was to replace an equivalent Oral B from 1996 whose battery died. I like that I can put in small charger holder detached from the holder for brush heads (saves cramped counter space). Except for having replaceable battery (see if that works -- in several years), seems almost identical to the one it replaced. Even earlier I had a Phillips Sonicare and for me the Oral B gets my teach much cleaner. I have always had rapid tartar and plaque buildup and the electric brushes work much better for me than manual brush. I used to have to go to dentist 4 times a year -- now down to twice and the dentist is very happy with condition of teeth and gums (at age 75!).</li>
            <li> The new unit we received does not have acceptable performance after a complete charge of 24 hours and two uses of two minutes each.  We comply with the manufacture&#x27;s instructions to run the battery down completely before recharging but this does not help.  P&amp;G customer service did not offer any help or constructive advise. Secondly, The unit we ordered was the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 4000 but the unit we received was an older unit Triumph Series Model which is no longer made. The new unit we received is identical to the older Triumph Model in our household we wished to replace. P&amp;G customer service advised that it is the same unit with a different name.  Well, then the older discontinued unit we received should have been sold at a closeout price. My experience indicates that the Triumph Model was NOT a name change only but may have battery issues.  P&amp;G does not acknowledge any operational issues but sent us a $10.00 coupon for purchase of a new unit. We are currently evaluating the Phillips Sonicare Essence Model Electric Toothbrush  for purchase.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care is my second tooth brush manufactured by Braun.  My first Braun performed flawlessly for approximately 10 years.  When it was time for a replacement, I compared user comments for Oral-B and a competitive brand prior to making a purchase.  I was impressed with the ratings and comments of users of the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care and selected this toothbrush for use by my wife and me purchasing one for each of us.  Price, 30 second signals to move brush to a different section of the mouth, cleaning effectiveness, comfort of use, and quality of product were considerations in selecting the Oral-B.  I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> After a friend told me that her dentist recommended this tooth brush, I decided to do some research. I really like the features, especially the brush letting you know if you are brushing too hard. My dentist told me that I do brush too hard so this tooth brush has helped to get me out of that habit. I love how clean my teeth feel after I use it. I didn&#x27;t get that feeling with a manual tooth brush. I was concerned that the brush heads wouldn&#x27;t fit into the small spaces in the back of my mouth, but it fits perfectly. My teeth are starting to look whiter and my mouth feels fresher for longer than it did when I brushed with my old tooth brush. I cannot wait for my next dentist visit to see what my dentist says.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an Oral-B electric brush, and when I was tempted by a lower-cost version of the series she told me to get this one. It&#x27;s tremendous. I really do brush longer, and after just a week of use there was a visible difference in the health of my gums and the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> First of all this Oral-B tooth brush is great. Second of all and most important the service I got from Amazon was even better. Oral-B was running a 50% off program if you mailed in the UPC label and proof of purchase. Unfortunately when I got my toothbrush it did not include the UPC label. So guess who gave me a 50% credit on my credit card. Amazon did! That is service above and beyond the call of duty. Thanks Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;To avoid the problems I had with UPC code just choose retail packaging under product packaging. The default is frustration free packaging which is great for me because I have a disability and it makes it really easy to open up the box and get to your product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric Oral-B toothbrush for years and been quite happy with the results.  When the rechargeable battery in my old Oral-B finally bit the dust I bought a Smartseries 4000 and experienced Oral-B&#x27;s incredible improvement in technology. After using it as instructed, my mouth feels as clean and smooth as when I go to a dental hygienist.  I have never been a fan of brushing my teeth, but now, I actually look forward to brushing. The brush moves and pulses at such a high speed that all you do is guide it over your teeth.  The results are fantastic.  The only thing that takes a little getting used to is the sound it makes.  It is high-pitched.  The whirring sounds like something you would hear from a tool your hygienist uses. If you want quiet, get an old fashioned toothbrush.  If you want clean and fresh, get an Oral-B 4000.  I cannot recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li> I gave this toothbrush four stars.  I bought this one after my old Oral-B stopped working.  This toothbrush does remove more food than the old Oral-B.  I did not give it five stars because the handle is bulkier and can be a bit awkward.  The new travel case and charger are nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 4000 series, the 1st arrive &amp; did not work. I put it on the charger &amp; the screen was completely blank. Then I requested a replacement &amp; put the original in the mail. I got the replacement today &amp; the same thing. I thought I would take it home &amp; try on my home outlet even though I know the outlets at my office work. Same blanket screen. It is unconscionable that Amazon would send me a defective REPLACEMENT item. I am requesting I be sent a WORKING item I paid $90.00 for IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            <li> I knew that I should have switched to an electric toothbrush a long time ago.  But I always brushed carefully.  And, I tried a battery-powered Oral-B that worked pretty well.  Finally, I gave in and bought the Oral B SmartSeries 4000 Electric.  It is terrific.  I brush more often because I enjoy doing it.  It is very easy to meet the timing recommedations of 30 (or 45 if you adjust the setting) seconds per quadrant of your teeth.  But, what I like most is that after brushing my teeth feel just like they do after I&#x27;ve had a cleaning at the dental office.  Great feeling. Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> after a year, it is still running great.</li>
            <li> Amazon product&#x27;s description:    Product Features  Product Packaging: Retail  Indicator Bristles  FlossAction &amp; ProWhite Brush Heads    I have received the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 4000 Rechargeable Toothbrush retail package from Amazon today, Agust 21, 2011.    Without any doubt, the latest retail package only contains one brush head.  You can also see the description on the package itselft.  You won&#x27;t get the \\&quot;FlossAction &amp; ProWhite Brush Heads\\&quot; as stated by Amazon.    I hope it will help you guys from making your purchasing decision.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well. It does have a smaller bristle thus making brush time a little longer. I have an Oral B S320 and I think they&#x27;re comparable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my brush for about a month now.  Being my first electric toothbrush, I got used to it pretty quickly.  It is not too bulky and does a good job reaching even those difficult areas.  A charge lasts around 10 to 12 days, and the motor is not too noisy.  I recieved my 50% rebate the other day.  I would recomend this product espically with the rebate.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothbrush. My teeth feel dentist clean and smooth. Have really noticed the difference over my old toothbrush the Oral B vitality. This is a great buy with the rebate that is offered now and this toothbrush will last you forever. The battery life isnt as bad as some people complained about as it lasts about a week before it needs a charge...Big Deal leave it on the charger over night and it will be ready to go!</li>
            <li> toothbrush works okay, no complaints, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my teeth.  I have used this product for about 1 month.</li>
            <li> I had been a long time user of the Crest Spin Brush since it was cheap and effective. I bought this when it was on sale and had a rebate (which I forgot to send in X|).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used this brush my gums felt sore/sensitive. You have to really watch the pressure and make sure you just let the brush do it&#x27;s work. It keeps a charge for about a week, so constant charging isn&#x27;t needed. The head size/brush size are just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is there is a little open slot with a moving metal piece on the head. Some how this caught my lip one day and pinched/cut it open.</li>
            <li> I used to think that I could brush my teeth just as good as an electric tooth brush.... I was wrong. This makes my teeth feel cleaner than brushing with a regular tooth brush. Wish I had bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this electric toothbrush the health of my teeth and gums have improved.  First I floss then I brush.  Betsy</li>
            <li> I have used 2 years without failure - except to recharge. I have noticed a decrease in battery life over the months. Is there a way to replace/rejuvenate the battery? I like the timed interval for brushing each surface and stopping when too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> I love this one- it&#x27;s my 4th and the most powerful by far, and holds a charge longer.  Worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 18 months and so far it&#x27;s working like a champ.  Obviously the \\&quot;gotcha\\&quot; is the cost of the brush heads, but generic ones can be found at your local pharmacy if you fancy saving a few (or a lot of) dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with function or battery life, and all I&#x27;m doing to keep it charged is drop it on the inductive charging stand once every week or two and leave it till the next time I brush.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Good price.  If you want more than this you are not getting any review from us at all.</li>
            <li> After a few years, this will not stay charged. I always let the battery die completely before recharging and only leave it on the base to charge until it is fully ready.  Now it will only last about two uses then I have to recharge.  I called customer service and the only thing they offered to do was to send me a coupon for another toothbrush. I will not be buying Oral B products any more. For almost $100, this brand is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product, the only downside is, I get so lazy to use normal toothbrushes when I am traveling.  I am going to buy a spare one just for my frequent travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an electric toothbrush that would no longer charge up.  This one has a circular motion where the previous one went up and down.  This on also rattles the hard edges of the brush against my teeth unless I&#x27;m very careful.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d get used to it but instead it has made my gums sore and start to bleed.  Instead of hardening them, things have gotten worse and the bleeding happens every time I use the toothbrush.  Not when I use a regular brush however.&lt;br /&gt;I note as I write this that the product is no longer available.  That&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
