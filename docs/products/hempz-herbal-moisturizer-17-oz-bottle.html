            <li>Silky creamy smooth lotion.</li>
            <li>this lotion works very well, nice smell, luxury feel...</li>
            <li>comfortable skin</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t knock off&#x27;s or just filled with another lotion.</li>
            <li>keep my skin smooth on my body and face</li>
            <li>This is the perfect moisturizer for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Its a great moisturizer for all the time, but especially after tanning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have been using this lotion for years and am glad that i can finally get a great deal on a product that is so worth it&lt;</li>
            <li>Anyone not using this lotion is missing one of the best products on the market.</li>
            <li>so far everyone has loved it.</li>
            <li>I love how clean and fresh this lotion smells, my Fiance can also use it without smelling like flowers.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well spreading easily and leaving the skin looking very smooth.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer leaves a clean, non greasy, smooth feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li>overall very pleased :)</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>There are alot of imitations on the market, but this is the original and there is no comparison.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter since she tans a lot and as long as she is happy</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t nothing that I couldn&#x27;t clean up.</li>
            <li>I wound up buying another 2 pack as it goes on lightly and seems to absorb into skin rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too overpowering, yet it makes me feel refreshed, clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Great to fight dry skin</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite, better than any drug store brand you will ever buy and</li>
            <li>There are better over the counter items on the market that in my opinion are better than this product and far cheaper.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, a little sweet but a good lingering scent for a girl to be sure, guys just might want some cologne after, but then again I have associated the smell with my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, light, fresh fragrance, does not leave an oily residue on my skin and moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>These are true to their name.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good lotion to use daily.</li>
            <li>They will send you off some sweet smelling knock off.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is good but only if it says SUPRE on the bottle(as it does on the product page).</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers don&#x27;t really do anything but make my hands greasy, or it absorbs into the skin and</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and love the price and smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li>Not bad lotion.</li>
            <li>Hydrating for dry skin and a nice light scent!</li>
            <li>Was wary of it not being authentic, but it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was just as advertised</li>
            <li>Bold statement?</li>
            <li>I have been a huge fan of Hempz Herbal Moisturizer since the first time I used it a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li>It smells good, it moisturizes all day long</li>
            <li>Makes me very smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>but it is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>It is the original and not a fake</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>So nice not having to constantly re-apply this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>SO worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Amazon and the sellers who sell through them are by far the most inexpensive way to go.</li>
            <li>Hempz lotion is my absolute favorite, and I am very picky about which types of lotion I will use on my skin.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>I think for one is 16 here this is a great price and arrived in less than a week!</li>
            <li>Super fast service!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is excellent; non greasy, easily absorbed and leaves a thin barrier that he doesn&#x27;t feel, but seems to protect his skin very well.</li>
            <li>We live in the Caribbean and it is comfortable even in our sweaty summer.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing I have used it for a very long time, since I was in highschool.</li>
            <li>It does the job without feeling heavy and has a nice light unisex  fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years it absolutely swear by it for great looking skin.</li>
            <li>the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very VERY dissatisified with this seller, and the fact that they never even responded to my inquiry.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion for my super dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Just can&#x27;t get enough of this lotion, it has a mild but pleasant smell to it and makes those winter dry skin blues go away.</li>
            <li>i love the lotion, but i ordered the 2 bottle lotion pack and the seller only sent me one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the first product I ever used with&lt;br /&gt;Hemp</li>
            <li>My favorite and only after shower lotion!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or wet, nice smell that doesn&#x27;t bother my scent-related allergies.</li>
            <li>And amazon has the twin pack that costs $2 more than my local beauty store charges for one bottle.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, it smells great and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I first found this lotion at a salon while living in Nebraska.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>When I wash my hands later I don&#x27;t feel like the lotion is still sitting on the top of my skin waiting to be washed off.</li>
            <li>The smell of this lotion is different from the first bottle we purchased and it is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Now I use it as my daily moisturizer and it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I bought a trial size of this a while back and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>My teenage son and I both love the scent.</li>
            <li>I received it first as a sample at my salon and couldnt wait to getmore.</li>
            <li>I love that there are no added dyes or perfumes, especially with my skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Would really like to bathe in it!  </li>
            <li>I thought the wild strawberry smell too strong for me (about me: I don&#x27;t wear perfume and help people who regularly have headaches which strong smells can stimulate)</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and is extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li>this is definitely the real deal and a great deal it lasts a long time</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion that i use, not greasy, smells great and got it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>I got these very quickly, the only difference from the pic is the pump on top of the bottles was red.</li>
            <li>I love how fast acting this cream is.</li>
            <li>#34;it puts on the lotion&amp;#34;) and the fact that I can purchase this via Amazon Marketplace at a cost that is 50% less than in the stores is really nice.</li>
            <li>thought it was cool because it as hemp in it, but this is not for us guys just to be clear.</li>
            <li>The smell continues to be overwhelming for a long time after it is applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have bought some in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had issues with dry skin while using this lotion in the winter and in the most freezing of winters.</li>
            <li>It is soothing and it makes the dry itchy skin feel so much better .Highly</li>
            <li>I have had to return some products because the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is so strong that it actually makes me&lt;br</li>
            <li>asked me to make certain we never run out.</li>
            <li>The smell is pure bliss and unlike anything I have ever found.</li>
            <li>Great price, so much less than what my esthetician charges for the same product.</li>
            <li>Seriously smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I am a man and have really dry skin especially on the winter months, but not any more thanks to Hempz!!!</li>
            <li>Extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have very itchy skin</li>
            <li>and this has helped me so much.</li>
            <li>fast shipping also.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This lotion works very well for people with eczema, I have it; and if you put it on after you shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like doing these reviews, takes up too much time to type</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>, i cant really describe the scent</li>
            <li>The hemp seed oil is nurturing and promising.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will order again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this lotion feels and smells amazing, thick but feels light after it absorbs and has taken away many of my scars and helps heal any other scrapes or bug bites.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and arrived very quick</li>
            <li>I only like the original scent.</li>
            <li>Seemed like I would be getting 1 more ounce than the other sellers were offering.  </li>
            <li>I bought this due to being allergic to most smells.</li>
            <li>But no biggie, its still the same hempz original lotion I always get,</li>
            <li>So far I have only tried the original scent because I like it so much</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s main purpose for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Had read reviews elsewhere about too strong a smell and other reviewers (who purchased from a walk in store) were concerned about authenticity.</li>
            <li>I have read other reviews about how this lotion is soo strong selling and ect.</li>
            <li>scent is akin to crushed fern - light, &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; and soothing&lt;br /&gt;No sticky residue.</li>
            <li>use on every part of my body - not so heavy it cannot be applied to the more tender region of face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>so my skin feels even tighter after a shower, so those of you with normal water may not have to use as often.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, it&#x27;s not greasy and does not leave you with needing to wipe the&lt;br /&gt;palm of your hands off after applying it.</li>
            <li>The original might seem less appealing than other varities, but don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;original\\&quot; thing make you underestimate this stuff.</li>
            <li>I used to live in Colorado, now I llve in Arizona.  </li>
            <li>for summer skin - protecting a new tan without being loaded with chemicals.</li>
            <li>This company only has good ratings because they won&#x27;t allow negative ones.</li>
            <li>Lovely non-invasive fragrance, instantly soothing even to my old very dry skin ...</li>
            <li>Great for winter skin when harsh cold air tends to make hands more like alligator skin than baby-soft flesh.</li>
            <li>Historically I have purchased this lotion in my local tanning salon (for double the price), and love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased more recently just because I remembered liking it and now won&#x27;t buy any other lotion.</li>
            <li>wow, does this ever work!</li>
            <li>Even my husband likes the smell...which is a small feat in itself :)</li>
            <li>what can i say----i love this smell on my woman…these bottles cost one and half times the price at my local gym</li>
            <li>just so I don&#x27;t have to clean up the mess on a brand new</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t improve it very fast but as long as you use it</li>
            <li>The picture CLEARLY showed an 18oz bottle... that is why I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hands really soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>the deep moisterizing is well needed and appreciated.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the larger sizes and how firm and soft</li>
            <li>If you need something just for the winter to keep skin soft, I&#x27;d give it a try...</li>
            <li>This lotion has a soft, fruity smell.</li>
            <li>Never heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>but it was definitely the real deal so trust this seller.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, not too light.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and anything that has perfume</li>
            <li>I originally bought this lotion YEARS ago when I was all about tanning year round.</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a moisturizer that I could use that wasn&#x27;t just waiting for me to wash it off...</li>
            <li>Much less expensive on Amazon than in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Product contains many other oils, is not greasy on skin and smells divine, exceptionally healing on cracked skin and feet.</li>
            <li>Absorbs very nicely and absolutely no greasy residue or unpleasant excess feelings are left after it quickly absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>Smells terrific, leaving skin feeling soft and nourished, but not greasy!</li>
            <li>delivery was on time or actually a day or two early.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion, but both of the bottles had broken pumps upon arrival.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use my other body lotions as much.</li>
            <li>I live in a desert area and have dry skin to start...</li>
            <li>It is one of my few treats but worth the extra $$ .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little expensive compared to some lotions I have bought in the past, but I am very happy with this product.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my daughter since she tans a lot and as long as she is happy</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t nothing that I couldn&#x27;t clean up.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s not too overpowering, yet it makes me feel refreshed, clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great to fight dry skin</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite, better than any drug store brand you will ever buy and</li>
            <li> There are better over the counter items on the market that in my opinion are better than this product and far cheaper.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, a little sweet but a good lingering scent for a girl to be sure, guys just might want some cologne after, but then again I have associated the smell with my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, light, fresh fragrance, does not leave an oily residue on my skin and moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> These are true to their name.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good lotion to use daily.</li>
            <li> They will send you off some sweet smelling knock off.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is good but only if it says SUPRE on the bottle(as it does on the product page).</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers don&#x27;t really do anything but make my hands greasy, or it absorbs into the skin and</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love the price and smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Not bad lotion.</li>
            <li> Hydrating for dry skin and a nice light scent!</li>
            <li> Was wary of it not being authentic, but it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was just as advertised</li>
            <li> Bold statement?</li>
            <li> I have been a huge fan of Hempz Herbal Moisturizer since the first time I used it a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> It smells good, it moisturizes all day long</li>
            <li> Makes me very smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> but it is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> It is the original and not a fake</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> So nice not having to constantly re-apply this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> SO worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Amazon and the sellers who sell through them are by far the most inexpensive way to go.</li>
            <li> Hempz lotion is my absolute favorite, and I am very picky about which types of lotion I will use on my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh.  </li>
            <li> I think for one is 16 here this is a great price and arrived in less than a week!</li>
            <li> Super fast service!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is excellent; non greasy, easily absorbed and leaves a thin barrier that he doesn&#x27;t feel, but seems to protect his skin very well.</li>
            <li> We live in the Caribbean and it is comfortable even in our sweaty summer.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing I have used it for a very long time, since I was in highschool.</li>
            <li> It does the job without feeling heavy and has a nice light unisex  fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years it absolutely swear by it for great looking skin.</li>
            <li> the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very VERY dissatisified with this seller, and the fact that they never even responded to my inquiry.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion for my super dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t get enough of this lotion, it has a mild but pleasant smell to it and makes those winter dry skin blues go away.</li>
            <li> i love the lotion, but i ordered the 2 bottle lotion pack and the seller only sent me one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the first product I ever used with&lt;br /&gt;Hemp</li>
            <li> My favorite and only after shower lotion!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or wet, nice smell that doesn&#x27;t bother my scent-related allergies.</li>
            <li> And amazon has the twin pack that costs $2 more than my local beauty store charges for one bottle.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, it smells great and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I first found this lotion at a salon while living in Nebraska.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> When I wash my hands later I don&#x27;t feel like the lotion is still sitting on the top of my skin waiting to be washed off.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is different from the first bottle we purchased and it is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Now I use it as my daily moisturizer and it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I bought a trial size of this a while back and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> My teenage son and I both love the scent.</li>
            <li> I received it first as a sample at my salon and couldnt wait to getmore.</li>
            <li> I love that there are no added dyes or perfumes, especially with my skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Would really like to bathe in it!  </li>
            <li> I thought the wild strawberry smell too strong for me (about me: I don&#x27;t wear perfume and help people who regularly have headaches which strong smells can stimulate)</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and is extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li> this is definitely the real deal and a great deal it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that i use, not greasy, smells great and got it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I got these very quickly, the only difference from the pic is the pump on top of the bottles was red.</li>
            <li> I love how fast acting this cream is.</li>
            <li> #34;it puts on the lotion&amp;#34;) and the fact that I can purchase this via Amazon Marketplace at a cost that is 50% less than in the stores is really nice.</li>
            <li> thought it was cool because it as hemp in it, but this is not for us guys just to be clear.</li>
            <li> The smell continues to be overwhelming for a long time after it is applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have bought some in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had issues with dry skin while using this lotion in the winter and in the most freezing of winters.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and it makes the dry itchy skin feel so much better .Highly</li>
            <li> I have had to return some products because the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is so strong that it actually makes me&lt;br</li>
            <li> asked me to make certain we never run out.</li>
            <li> The smell is pure bliss and unlike anything I have ever found.</li>
            <li> Great price, so much less than what my esthetician charges for the same product.</li>
            <li> Seriously smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I am a man and have really dry skin especially on the winter months, but not any more thanks to Hempz!!!</li>
            <li> Extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have very itchy skin</li>
            <li> and this has helped me so much.</li>
            <li> fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This lotion works very well for people with eczema, I have it; and if you put it on after you shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like doing these reviews, takes up too much time to type</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> , i cant really describe the scent</li>
            <li> The hemp seed oil is nurturing and promising.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will order again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this lotion feels and smells amazing, thick but feels light after it absorbs and has taken away many of my scars and helps heal any other scrapes or bug bites.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and arrived very quick</li>
            <li> I only like the original scent.</li>
            <li> Seemed like I would be getting 1 more ounce than the other sellers were offering.  </li>
            <li> I bought this due to being allergic to most smells.</li>
            <li> But no biggie, its still the same hempz original lotion I always get,</li>
            <li> So far I have only tried the original scent because I like it so much</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s main purpose for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Had read reviews elsewhere about too strong a smell and other reviewers (who purchased from a walk in store) were concerned about authenticity.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about how this lotion is soo strong selling and ect.</li>
            <li> scent is akin to crushed fern - light, &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; and soothing&lt;br /&gt;No sticky residue.</li>
            <li> use on every part of my body - not so heavy it cannot be applied to the more tender region of face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> so my skin feels even tighter after a shower, so those of you with normal water may not have to use as often.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, it&#x27;s not greasy and does not leave you with needing to wipe the&lt;br /&gt;palm of your hands off after applying it.</li>
            <li> The original might seem less appealing than other varities, but don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;original\\&quot; thing make you underestimate this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used to live in Colorado, now I llve in Arizona.  </li>
            <li> for summer skin - protecting a new tan without being loaded with chemicals.</li>
            <li> This company only has good ratings because they won&#x27;t allow negative ones.</li>
            <li> Lovely non-invasive fragrance, instantly soothing even to my old very dry skin ...</li>
            <li> Great for winter skin when harsh cold air tends to make hands more like alligator skin than baby-soft flesh.</li>
            <li> Historically I have purchased this lotion in my local tanning salon (for double the price), and love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased more recently just because I remembered liking it and now won&#x27;t buy any other lotion.</li>
            <li> wow, does this ever work!</li>
            <li> Even my husband likes the smell...which is a small feat in itself :)</li>
            <li> what can i say----i love this smell on my woman…these bottles cost one and half times the price at my local gym</li>
            <li> just so I don&#x27;t have to clean up the mess on a brand new</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t improve it very fast but as long as you use it</li>
            <li> The picture CLEARLY showed an 18oz bottle... that is why I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hands really soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> the deep moisterizing is well needed and appreciated.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the larger sizes and how firm and soft</li>
            <li> If you need something just for the winter to keep skin soft, I&#x27;d give it a try...</li>
            <li> This lotion has a soft, fruity smell.</li>
            <li> Never heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> but it was definitely the real deal so trust this seller.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, not too light.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and anything that has perfume</li>
            <li> I originally bought this lotion YEARS ago when I was all about tanning year round.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a moisturizer that I could use that wasn&#x27;t just waiting for me to wash it off...</li>
            <li> Much less expensive on Amazon than in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Product contains many other oils, is not greasy on skin and smells divine, exceptionally healing on cracked skin and feet.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very nicely and absolutely no greasy residue or unpleasant excess feelings are left after it quickly absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells terrific, leaving skin feeling soft and nourished, but not greasy!</li>
            <li> delivery was on time or actually a day or two early.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion, but both of the bottles had broken pumps upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use my other body lotions as much.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert area and have dry skin to start...</li>
            <li> It is one of my few treats but worth the extra $$ .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive compared to some lotions I have bought in the past, but I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Two big bottles will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I may spend the extra couple bucks per bottle and order in single units in the future</li>
            <li> it keeps my skin so silky soft, and doesn&#x27;t dry out in a while like other products.</li>
            <li> Never had a lotion that actually solved my dry skin issues</li>
            <li> A little too much scent for me and my nose, but other than that</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that all natural Marijuana has healing properties, and being that this lotion has part of the plant in it, I hope to lessen the stretch marks that I have.</li>
            <li> and I tend to have dry skin all year long</li>
            <li> occasionally I will try other lotions, when given gifts or samples, but I have yet to find anything that works on my skin as well.  </li>
            <li> The original had a faint oatmeal scent and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on a just a little greasy but within seconds it loses the greasiness as it is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like greasy things on my skin, and I have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> During really dry season, I put coconut oil on my skin and then cover it with the Hempz.  </li>
            <li> Works well even on winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am dry immediately after.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, which my daughter &amp; I both do, this is a God send.</li>
            <li> I started using it in Arizona when my skin got so dry it cracked.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered single pieces at a time</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the same lotion as I did the first time which did not have this particular smell.</li>
            <li> Being diabetic I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Dink a star only because I wish the scent was a little stronger and lingered longer.</li>
            <li> You pay a little extra but you get what you  pay for.</li>
            <li> When I find a lotion I like, I use it at least twice daily on my body, and several times throughout the day on my hands, arms, and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minimal fragrance.</li>
            <li> So for me to turn around smelling my sweet honey behind me and turning around to a bear of a truck driver......could be slightly confusing.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the smell of strawberries.  </li>
            <li> Helped with scarring and didn&#x27;t have to reapply like I had to with cocoa butter and other products.  </li>
            <li> that tries it loves it!  </li>
            <li> I even stack it upside down when the pump can no longer work</li>
            <li> Smelled a knock-off lotion at a Beauty Supply the other day, yuk!</li>
            <li> Not super moisturizing but</li>
            <li> Hempz on Amazon is less than half the cost than what you would pay at retail outlets.  </li>
            <li> just half the price.</li>
            <li> I have slight Eczema and this lotion makes it DISAPPEAR.</li>
            <li> and they charge $22 for one bottle of this lotion, I bought two for less than the price of one.</li>
            <li> live in a state with dry dry dry climate, and very cold winters, and this stuff helps me get through.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about ordering because it was so cheep compared to in store prices</li>
            <li> Smells a little freaky.</li>
            <li> Hempz is one of the few that works for me.  </li>
            <li> We order this lotion every few months.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a bottle for less than $20 in the stores.</li>
            <li> After using aquafor for severe cracked knuckles and lips in the past, my son who works at a hospital found Hempz.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in the past from another source.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when they arrived because they had broken open and made a little bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> It has an extremely strong , feminine fragrance added to it and has caused me terrible breakouts.</li>
            <li> My husband is in his late sixties and his skin is drier than it used to be.</li>
            <li> My complaint is the pumps stopped working in BOTH bottles...</li>
            <li> It moisturizes really well and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling all sticky, which I hate.</li>
            <li> , we have very hard water</li>
            <li> and its less expensive than if i were to buy it at a tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I just wish it contained fewer questionable chemicals.</li>
            <li> but it is very faint and doesn&#x27;t over whelm you all day.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with two bottles of bad lotion that make me smell like Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> And I have not had bad break outs since.</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this lotion for my super dry skin.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion more than anything else. It smells great and moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> This company only has good ratings because they won&#x27;t allow negative ones.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion....not greasy. I only like the original scent.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend has used before and now I found for her on here. She loves this stuff and likes the scent too. Not too strong, a little sweet but a good lingering scent for a girl to be sure, guys just might want some cologne after, but then again I have associated the smell with my girlfriend. So for me to turn around smelling my sweet honey behind me and turning around to a bear of a truck driver......could be slightly confusing. Lol.</li>
            <li> Love it, has a great scent. Leaves hands really soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion,.  I don&#x27;t like greasy things on my skin, and I have really dry skin.  I have been using this for over a decade, longer than I can remembers, and it is the only lotions I use.  occasionally I will try other lotions, when given gifts or samples, but I have yet to find anything that works on my skin as well.  During really dry season, I put coconut oil on my skin and then cover it with the Hempz.  It is wonderful lotion!</li>
            <li> My husband is in his late sixties and his skin is drier than it used to be. This moisturizer is excellent; non greasy, easily absorbed and leaves a thin barrier that he doesn&#x27;t feel, but seems to protect his skin very well. We live in the Caribbean and it is comfortable even in our sweaty summer.&lt;br /&gt;He asked me to make certain we never run out.</li>
            <li> The picture CLEARLY showed an 18oz bottle... that is why I purchased.  Seemed like I would be getting 1 more ounce than the other sellers were offering.  It arrived 17oz. When I contacted the seller, they blamed the maker of the lotion and would offer no refund or return.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON.  GO ELSEWHERE&gt;</li>
            <li> good - not the best- Maybe it will work better when the drying weather has passed</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion and keep ordering it.  Leaves my skin soft and absorbs well.  Have even given it for Christmas gifts and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product,  great price, and great seller.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Love the price</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about ordering because it was so cheep compared to in store prices but it is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> Best body and hand lotion that I&#x27;ve found!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an addictive smell, however, not overpowering. You can still wear perfume. Great moisturizer. There are alot of imitations on the market, but this is the original and there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this deal. I&#x27;ve been looking at this lotion at Ulta. 1(17 oz) bottle is over $20. I got 2 for $20 on here.&lt;br /&gt;Love the lotion!</li>
            <li> Got my package! Everything is perfect!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this lotion and would use it everytime there is a sample bottle. I think for one is 16 here this is a great price and arrived in less than a week! &amp;#34;&amp;#34; I use it everynight and has a very sweet smell to it. Im going to put some on right now!!</li>
            <li> Perfect lotion for a person who is in the sun often. keeps my skin moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the smell of strawberries.  More strawberry-like.  It may not appeal to everyone.</li>
            <li> Historically I have purchased this lotion in my local tanning salon (for double the price), and love it. Was wary of it not being authentic, but it was perfect. Great lotion!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  Extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is great!  Works well even on winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works great and I love the scent!</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t get enough of this lotion, it has a mild but pleasant smell to it and makes those winter dry skin blues go away.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was just as advertised</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin, smells good and do the job! Cheaper to buy here than in stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never stop buying this lotion. It smells awesome and works great.</li>
            <li> i love the lotion, but i ordered the 2 bottle lotion pack and the seller only sent me one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I requested they send the second bottle or refund me the difference, of which they have not....&lt;br /&gt;I still request that they send the second bottle of lotion or refund me the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very VERY dissatisified with this seller, and the fact that they never even responded to my inquiry.</li>
            <li> Had read reviews elsewhere about too strong a smell and other reviewers (who purchased from a walk in store) were concerned about authenticity. I don&#x27;t have any experience with having purchased this product &amp;#34;in person&amp;#34;. I thought the wild strawberry smell too strong for me (about me: I don&#x27;t wear perfume and help people who regularly have headaches which strong smells can stimulate) so I use this product infrequently. However, I gave a bottle to a friend who loves the way it smells. When I do use it, it does moisturize well and my hands feel supple for several hours after that (not including through washing though). So, these are my two cents. If you want to give me a refund, let Amazon know.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is delightful, refreshing and softening, soaks into the skin. I recommend this lotion to friends.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li> Great lotion...not greasy....especially good for dry winter skin and summer &amp;#34;after sun.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing. I have very itchy skin and this has helped me so much. I have tried more lotions than I can name and this one is still the best.</li>
            <li> Great transaction!  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I will use! I have sensitive skin and this lotion feels and smells amazing, thick but feels light after it absorbs and has taken away many of my scars and helps heal any other scrapes or bug bites. Way more than just a lotion! It came in the mail on time, no delay.</li>
            <li> I love the smell on my husband and on myself, good product! I don&#x27;t use my other body lotions as much.</li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion, the smell is not overpowering and during the winter months the deep moisterizing is well needed and appreciated. I buy these in Qty of two so I can keep one at home and one on my desk.</li>
            <li> Great lotion!  The entire family uses it</li>
            <li> Great product!  Smells and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for skin. Nice and moist and obsorbs in your skin. Been using it for years....&lt;br /&gt;I am, Imogene</li>
            <li> Very good lotion overall. I would give it 5 stars, but I have mixed feelings about the fragrance and it is a bit pricey....</li>
            <li> Great price and delivered on time</li>
            <li> I have already made multiple purchases of this product. Everyone that enters my house uses it. Family, friends, neighbors, they can&#x27;t get enough. I may have to start bag checks when people leave my house...it is that good</li>
            <li> Smells great and it&#x27;s a great deal for two bottles.</li>
            <li> hempz is my favorite lotion!!! love this stuff! and its less expensive than if i were to buy it at a tanning salon! fast shipping also. overall very pleased :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Absorbs quickly, light, fresh fragrance, does not leave an oily residue on my skin and moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  None that I have found.</li>
            <li> Smells a little freaky. Not bad lotion. I love the leaf.</li>
            <li> I have said forever, this lotion is like a fountain of youth.  I never use anything else on my face, and it is my number one go to for body lotion.  My parents, both 83, look 70 and this is their pick.  Thank you, Hempz!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Not too greasy. Absorbs fast. Dink a star only because I wish the scent was a little stronger and lingered longer. Personal preference.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!, Don&#x27;t be fooled by others, they are not the same. Smelled a knock-off lotion at a Beauty Supply the other day, yuk! This is the real deal. Hempz makes a great product. Smells so good!</li>
            <li> Best lotion that exists in the entire world. Bold statement? Maybe. But so very accurate.</li>
            <li> Hands down, best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  Helped with scarring and didn&#x27;t have to reapply like I had to with cocoa butter and other products.  Smells wonderful!  Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this lotion YEARS ago when I was all about tanning year round. I purchased more recently just because I remembered liking it and now won&#x27;t buy any other lotion. This sells locally for anywhere from $16 to $25 per bottle so this bundled set is an EXCELLENT deal! I&#x27;ve now having to buy even more often because my husband has started using this!</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, and excellent no-see-um (gnat) repellant!  Winner</li>
            <li> amazing fragrance...absorbs into skin beautifully...and really moisturizes and softens without clogging build-up. Wonderful ingredients!!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion and I don&#x27;t have to mortgage my home to purchase it like at the tanning salon! Amazing!</li>
            <li> love this lotion works so well will order it again my sisters and son love it also I like all the smells of each one</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there - not sticky - absorbs quickly - smells incredible - always get compliments on the smell -anyone that tries it loves it!  Keeps the skin nice and moist.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST deep moisturizing lotion EVER!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this a year ago - had to use up all of the different types I had on hand, then find this again.  So happy - my dry winter skin is looking and feeling much better.</li>
            <li> I have been a huge fan of Hempz Herbal Moisturizer since the first time I used it a couple of years ago. It smells amazing and is extremely hydrating. One of these 17 oz bottles lasted me an entire year. I will forever be an advocate for this lotion, and I am so glad that Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and it is what my salon recommended since I had broke out when I used tanning lotions</li>
            <li> This lotion works very well for people with eczema, I have it; and if you put it on after you shower. Well my eczema go&#x27;s away.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and is awesome for the dry Colorado climate.  Would recommend it for anyone as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soo happy that Amazon is carrying this lotion!! I have read other reviews about how this lotion is soo strong selling and ect. What I can tell you is this lotion smells awesome and is not too strong!! I am a man and have really dry skin especially on the winter months, but not any more thanks to Hempz!!! Also this lotion has a great smell for men, unlike most lotions that have a female perfume smell. This lotion is hands down the best lotion I have ever put on my skin!!! I also just purchased the Hempz triple moisturizing lotion and I couldn&#x27;t believe just how good it really is!! Both of these lotions are not greasy either like most lotions I have tried!!! After putting on Hempz lotion I can still text on my phone without making the screen greasy and I can still open up my doors in my house!!! I love this lotion!! Thank you Hempz for finally making a lotion that is not just for women(even though women can still use it), and that works exactly like it says it does!!!</li>
            <li> Non greasy and fruity!!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. This product also has a very pleasant scent. I would get this again and again.</li>
            <li> smells great if your a women. if your a guy you&#x27;ll just smell like a strawberry lemonade. thought it was cool because it as hemp in it, but this is not for us guys just to be clear.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s Price! I love the smell, the larger sizes and how firm and soft my skin feels after using this amazing lotion!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite lotion. Great moisturizer! I ordered on Amazon and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful, and I only order off Amazon for the steals.  It smells wonderful and hydrates great!  Buying 2 at a time is helpful</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter since she tans a lot and as long as she is happy then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this moisturizer.  My complaint is the pumps stopped working in BOTH bottles...So aggravating.</li>
            <li> Silky creamy smooth lotion.</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion... The the smell!!</li>
            <li> Great deal. Have made multiple purchases.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert area and have dry skin to start...this lotion works very well, nice smell, luxury feel...comfortable skin</li>
            <li> These are true to their name. They aren&#x27;t knock off&#x27;s or just filled with another lotion. I was a little disappointed when they arrived because they had broken open and made a little bit of a mess. But it wasn&#x27;t nothing that I couldn&#x27;t clean up. Worth the money</li>
            <li> This moisturizer leaves a clean, non greasy, smooth feeling on the skin.  The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and pleasant.  Great to use after being in the sun</li>
            <li> Great lotion to help manage Keratosis Pilaris.  It doesn&#x27;t improve it very fast but as long as you use it you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> Such a great lotion at such a great price!!!  I was recently at a cosmetic store where these sold for $24 EACH!  We shouldn&#x27;t have to go broke for a good body lotion, LOL!</li>
            <li> Not at all greasy, great scent, leaves your skin silky smooth and it absorbs quickly..</li>
            <li> Hempz is great for my sensitive skin, it smells amazing &amp; doesnt leave me all sticky. I paid a fraction of the price by ordering it from amazon! It arrived within a week &amp; id happily order it again.</li>
            <li> i ABSOLUTELY love THIS Lotion!  So glad I can get the 2 pack.  One in the bath and one in my room</li>
            <li> After using aquafor for severe cracked knuckles and lips in the past, my son who works at a hospital found Hempz.  I wound up buying another 2 pack as it goes on lightly and seems to absorb into skin rather quickly.  Great light scent as well.  If you need something just for the winter to keep skin soft, I&#x27;d give it a try...good luck...</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever! I absolutly love this product. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good lotion to use daily.</li>
            <li> Arrived in 2 days and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> we buy this product on here all the time and it is just a great all around product.  Great for after a day outside or at the beach, we use it every day and a great smell as well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.  HOWEVER, I have tried buying it and sellers here do not sell SUPRE lotion that is on the picture.  They will send you off some sweet smelling knock off.  The lotion is good but only if it says SUPRE on the bottle(as it does on the product page).</li>
            <li> Really great lotion. Always like to have a bottle or two around the house.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST moisturizer there is on planet earth (Just my opinion, of course). This is the first product I ever used with&lt;br /&gt;Hemp oil and I never knew what an amazing moisturizer it is. This lotion has a soft, fruity smell. It is NOT overbearing and&lt;br /&gt;eventually goes away. I have had to return some products because the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is so strong that it actually makes me&lt;br /&gt;sick....not this. It&#x27;s very pleasant.</li>
            <li> It smells like a woman scent i gave it to my mom......wasnt happy with the smell</li>
            <li> A wonderful scent that goes on light.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a subtly sweet smell, goes on sooooo smooth! My favorite and only after shower lotion!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite lotion for some years now.  Lovely non-invasive fragrance, instantly soothing even to my old very dry skin ... I used to live in Colorado, now I llve in Arizona.  Doesn&#x27;t get any dryer than that!</li>
            <li> I love how fast acting this cream is. Once applied I can tell almost immediately the softness of my hands.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hemp lotion for 10years now and its smooth and smells great. Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the name. Its the best i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be without it the best lotion ever...Great for aging skin!! Age spot fading....can&#x27;t get a better deal than this</li>
            <li> what can i say----i love this smell on my woman…these bottles cost one and half times the price at my local gym so this is one heck of a bargain….</li>
            <li> This is great lotion. Love the smell. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it is amazing! Hydrating for dry skin and a nice light scent! Seriously smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells terrific, leaving skin feeling soft and nourished, but not greasy! So nice not having to constantly re-apply this moisturizer. A definite desert must have for me.</li>
            <li> I love the lotion, my brother loves the lotion and my mom and dad!!! We will definitely keep this in our household!</li>
            <li> The most amazing lotion ever. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or wet, nice smell that doesn&#x27;t bother my scent-related allergies. It&#x27;s the only lotion I buy now</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Softens skin without leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s (and mine) favorite lotion at a grrrrreat price!</li>
            <li> Wonderful lotion, love it would order it again. I don&#x27;t like doing these reviews, takes up too much time to type</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Most moisturizers don&#x27;t really do anything but make my hands greasy, or it absorbs into the skin and I am dry immediately after.  Hempz is one of the few that works for me.  And amazon has the twin pack that costs $2 more than my local beauty store charges for one bottle.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for over a decade now. Not super moisturizing but the lotion has a refreshing scent and is vegan. It&#x27;s nice to have something healthy to use on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; hempz lotion and it smelled wonderful.  Now I smell like a bubble gum factory.  Truly disappointed</li>
            <li> This product is NOT the original Hempz! It has an extremely strong , feminine fragrance added to it and has caused me terrible breakouts. The original had a faint oatmeal scent and did not irritate my skin. Now I&#x27;m stuck with two bottles of bad lotion that make me smell like Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> when I am paying up to 30 to 45 dollars per 17 ounce him lotion this is definitely the real deal and a great deal it lasts a long time and I am very happy with this product keep my skin smooth on my body and face we will continue buying!!! thank you so much even my husband loves this product so much they make great gifts as well</li>
            <li> Great cream.  Nice scent.  Easy to apply, feels great on skin and hydrates nicely.  Two big bottles will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> OUR SON HAS USED THIS FOR YEARS, ITS THE BEST LOTION I HAVE TRIED IN YEARS!!!  I STILL LIKEMY CERVA BUT THIS IS ALSO WONDERFUL FOR MY VERY DRY SKIN!</li>
            <li> Works so much better than drug store lotions, lasts for months.  Much less expensive on Amazon than in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Product contains many other oils, is not greasy on skin and smells divine, exceptionally healing on cracked skin and feet.</li>
            <li> love this lotion and this is a great price for the twin pack</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.  Hempz on Amazon is less than half the cost than what you would pay at retail outlets.  It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion at the salon I visit and couldn&#x27;t believe the wonderful scent. It&#x27;s not only the scent that sold me - it is a wonderful moisturizer as well. I highly recommend this product. You&#x27;ll won&#x27;t want to purchase another type of lotion after using Hempz.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion. It arrived on time and was exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a moisturizer that I could use that wasn&#x27;t just waiting for me to wash it off...wow, does this ever work! I love it...it keeps my skin so silky soft, and doesn&#x27;t dry out in a while like other products. SO worth the price.  This is one happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:D</li>
            <li> A favorite moisturizer that is not greasy and has a great scent. Perfect size to just leave on a counter or the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizer for the winter months.  Smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever, I have been using this for years. It is not greasy, it smells great and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, we love hemps lotion , have been using it for 10 years. I will let all my friends know about it.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion.  Being diabetic I have very dry skin and this works for me.  Also, on Amazon I can get two bottles for the price of one in the shop.</li>
            <li> The product itself is unbelievable. I actually started using this lotion for my face after I shave to help stop breakouts and it worked like a charm. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the intended use Is for the face but that&#x27;s it&#x27;s main purpose for me. And I have not had bad break outs since. I gave this product a 4 star because I wish the packaging could be better. It arrived and both caps had busted and the lotion was all over...straight out of the box. I have ordered single pieces at a time and I did not have the same issue with packaging. I may spend the extra couple bucks per bottle and order in single units in the future just so I don&#x27;t have to clean up the mess on a brand new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to leave on a good note... I also love the smell of this lotion and my wife agrees. 5/5 for the smell and product itself.</li>
            <li> perfect! Love it! They smell awesome and its the best moisturizer Ive used in my life (and Ive tried a lot!) delivery was on time or actually a day or two early. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion (&amp;#34;it puts on the lotion&amp;#34;) and the fact that I can purchase this via Amazon Marketplace at a cost that is 50% less than in the stores is really nice.</li>
            <li> I discovered Hempz lotion when a friend gave me a goodie bag she received at the Grammy&#x27;s two years ago and the lotion was included. I have used this lotion exclusively ever since.  It&#x27;s the very best dry skin lotion I have ever used and it&#x27;s great for your whole body.  I even stack it upside down when the pump can no longer work so I can get every last drop out.  Never had a lotion that actually solved my dry skin issues...highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and it really hydrates the body well.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin then this is an incredible product.  I have been using this for over three years and love it.  Its the only lotion I use now!</li>
            <li> Gift for my sister-in-law.... we both love Hempz. Great price!</li>
            <li> Bought the two pack so I could give one as a gift.  The person was very pleased with this excellent all purpose lotion.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in the past from another source. Amazon and the sellers who sell through them are by far the most inexpensive way to go. The lotion itself is one of those wonderful aromas that can be worn by either men or women.  So far I have only tried the original scent because I like it so much I have found no need to try one of the others.  I give them as gifts to both my male and female friends so far everyone has loved it.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this moisturizer for several years. My grand daughter was over for a visit and had her Mom try it while she was here. She in turn asked if I would order some the next time I was on Amazon, which is quite often. I did so and she had me use it, so now we are all using it. If you have dry skin, which my daughter &amp; I both do, this is a God send. I heartily recommend this to anyone that needs a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> great product,much cheaper then stores around here.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product, she refuses to use anything else</li>
            <li> These came not taped together this time and in perfect order.... Thank you!!💛💛💛💛 this product!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend and she loves it</li>
            <li> I first found this lotion at a salon while living in Nebraska.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is akin to crushed fern - light, &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; and soothing&lt;br /&gt;No sticky residue. Never heavy feeling. Never greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I use on every part of my body - not so heavy it cannot be applied to the more tender region of face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Great for summer skin - protecting a new tan without being loaded with chemicals. Great for winter skin when harsh cold air tends to make hands more like alligator skin than baby-soft flesh.</li>
            <li> I have bought some in the past and loved it. Helps my hand a lot. This time the smell has changed and it has a fragrance. I bought this due to being allergic to most smells. Now i have it with one.</li>
            <li> This is my standard moisturizer; I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have a hard time finding a bottle for less than $20 in the stores. I&#x27;m in the sun a lot and this moisturizer is perfect.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing I have used it for a very long time, since I was in highschool. It moisturizes really well and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling all sticky, which I hate. This lotion is even better in the summer after you&#x27;ve been in the sun for a while I don&#x27;t even bother with aloe Vera, this lotion feels way better. The smell may not be for everyone but i like it because it is not perfumy at all, i cant really describe the scent but it is very faint and doesn&#x27;t over whelm you all day. If this helps at all, I am very fair complected with freckles and I tend to have dry skin all year long so I moisturize twice a day, after every shower, we have very hard water so my skin feels even tighter after a shower, so those of you with normal water may not have to use as often.  And of course it&#x27;s nice to find it for such a good deal on amazon! I was nervous I would receive some knock off but it was definitely the real deal so trust this seller. Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion! Exactly what I expected and arrived very quick</li>
            <li> I love how clean and fresh this lotion smells, my Fiance can also use it without smelling like flowers.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, light smell, isn&#x27;t greasy, and absorbs nicely.  When I wash my hands later I don&#x27;t feel like the lotion is still sitting on the top of my skin waiting to be washed off.</li>
            <li> Great price, return buyer -</li>
            <li> I love it. You should get one!</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Great lotion, moisturizes well with a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Hempz lotion is my absolute favorite, and I am very picky about which types of lotion I will use on my skin. When I find a lotion I like, I use it at least twice daily on my body, and several times throughout the day on my hands, arms, and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer has been my favorite for years. The original has been my go to favorite, the scent is amazingly fresh and clean! it&#x27;s not too overpowering, yet it makes me feel refreshed, clean and moisturized. Absorbs very nicely and absolutely no greasy residue or unpleasant excess feelings are left after it quickly absorbs into my skin. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a state with dry dry dry climate, and very cold winters, and this stuff helps me get through. I&#x27;ve never had issues with dry skin while using this lotion in the winter and in the most freezing of winters. I feel my skin is incredibly healthy and I&#x27;m really grateful for this wonderful product. I can&#x27;t imagine myself using a lotion that would even compare.The hemp seed oil is nurturing and promising. Try it! The original might seem less appealing than other varities, but don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;original\\&quot; thing make you underestimate this stuff. it has a great smell and it&#x27;s my most trusted type of Hempz lotion, and lotion in general.</li>
            <li> It smells good, it moisturizes all day long and it&#x27;s affordable! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great smelling moisturizer</li>
            <li> We all love this cream, it smells great too!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect moisturizer for everyday use. It does the job without feeling heavy and has a nice light unisex  fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great to fight dry skin</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy, absorbs very quickly, smells great. I just wish it contained fewer questionable chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great product and the delivery was fast. I love the Hempz brand and would buy for this seller again.</li>
            <li> The best lotion ever. Smells great, moisturizers and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling</li>
            <li> this is the best lotion we have ever used</li>
            <li> I love love love love hempz lotion! great moisturizer, non-greasy and great smelling (think strawberry banana: fresh and natural, not in a cheap candy sort of way!) This is by far my favorite, better than any drug store brand you will ever buy and the deal on amazon is a total steal! this lotion goes for $23 a bottle at Ulta!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love the price and smell of the lotion. Hempz is the best! It is the original and not a fake</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is different from the first bottle we purchased and it is overwhelming.  The smell continues to be overwhelming for a long time after it is applied to the skin.  I was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the same lotion as I did the first time which did not have this particular smell.</li>
            <li> Love it,Love it,Love it.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is a big fan of it also. I have purchased this product and as well as the best  self-tanning lotion ever used.In S.C. Wholesale as salon owner....Amazon had the better price. We like the his &amp; hers. LOL</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever. Makes your skin feel so soft and moisturized. Best place for the money you pay. Better than a salon.</li>
            <li> I love all the hemp products.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> feels amazing &amp; smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion, but both of the bottles had broken pumps upon arrival.</li>
            <li> great lotion, very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Amazing body lotion! Absorbs fully with no greasy residue. This lotion smells so good....I would call it banana floral.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.  It smells great and works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I started using it in Arizona when my skin got so dry it cracked.  It works amazingly!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase. I am sure I will order again in the near future. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I think this was a really good value and I love this lotion - the way it works and the scent!</li>
            <li> There are better over the counter items on the market that in my opinion are better than this product and far cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. It&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It was good and shipped fast at the best price. I already know that Hempz is the best moisturizer, and help me with wintertime dry skin better than anything I have found.</li>
            <li> Go into any salon that carries this product line and you will be paying $17-$20 each for the hand cream. It is a natural product, not greasy, absorbs quickly, smells great and WORKS!!! Even my husband likes the smell...which is a small feat in itself :)</li>
            <li> Its a great moisturizer for all the time, but especially after tanning. Its much cheaper to buy it through amazon then a tanning place.. smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is a great all-over moisturizer. Not greasy and soaks into skin easily.  Nice mild fragrance -doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the senses.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my order! Will purchase it again in the future, great deal for the price! Love it! Great!</li>
            <li> Favorite Lotion! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and it smells delicious! I used this on a sunburn and it helped greatly. Now I use it as my daily moisturizer and it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I got these very quickly, the only difference from the pic is the pump on top of the bottles was red. But no biggie, its still the same hempz original lotion I always get, just half the price. So glad I grabbed these while on sale, might order some more.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever and it does not sting.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have been using this for many years and I&#x27;m in the beauty business for forty years 🌹</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years.  It has a great, mild unisex fragrance.  I have plenty of friends (both male and female) who have tried this lotion and are hooked.</li>
            <li> smell so so great. Feel good too.It is one of my few treats but worth the extra $$ .</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, i have been using it since 2003ish and its still just a good as the first day i used it. the smell is a perfect balance and is never to strong. Makes me very smooth and soft!</li>

            <li> I love this lotion and this deal was awesome. I go to planet beach and they charge $22 for one bottle of this lotion, I bought two for less than the price of one.</li>
            <li> i love the way this smells and i love the fact that i got two for the price of one.</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion as a skin firmer recommended by a friend. I love the smell, and the fact that it does not leave greasy residue. I am a firm believer that all natural Marijuana has healing properties, and being that this lotion has part of the plant in it, I hope to lessen the stretch marks that I have. It&#x27;s a little expensive compared to some lotions I have bought in the past, but I am very happy with this product. Would recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> I hope they never discontinue it.  Smells fresh.  Not too heavy, not too light.  Perfect lotion for all types of skin.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer out there, packaged well.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer not only smells great, but works great also!  Purchase one for yourself and give one to a friend!</li>

            <li> Love Hempz ! !  Always happy when I can find it at a reasonable price.  Thanks.</li>

            <li> Great value. I liked the product.</li>
            <li> I bought a trial size of this a while back and fell in love with it.  I cannot find it at local stores.  This was an excellent value.</li>
            <li> This is the finest quality Moisturizer I have used  in my life. You pay a little extra but you get what you  pay for.It is soothing and it makes the dry itchy skin feel so much better .Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great stuff... Save money with the two pack..</li>
            <li> Bought this product for myself and my daughter. We have both enjoyed it. Smells great but doesnt make skin as smooth as I thought. I do recommend it tho.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is light but very hydrating without being oily, has a wonderful light fragrance.  Recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this product and never disappointed. The shipping and delivery were quick and perfect.</li>
            <li> Great price and was delivered on time. Love the lotion and the smell is great also</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells and hydrates skin. Love it! Purchased based on word of mouth, and glad I listened. If the marijuana leaf is holding you back, forget it! Best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> works great with very light scent!</li>
            <li> Love the smell - we use this all the time.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this moisturizer has Vitamin C,D % E in it. Those are good things for the skin. It moisturizes very well spreading easily and leaving the skin looking very smooth. It goes on a just a little greasy but within seconds it loses the greasiness as it is absorbed into the skin. My teenage son and I both love the scent.</li>
            <li> My #1 go to lotion.  For over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Super fast service!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion! I received it first as a sample at my salon and couldnt wait to getmore. I absolutely love it and will order again!</li>
            <li> The smell is very sweet.  Fine if you like that kind of smell on yourself, I suppose.</li>
            <li> The smell is pure bliss and unlike anything I have ever found. More importantly, it&#x27;s not greasy and does not leave you with needing to wipe the&lt;br /&gt;palm of your hands off after applying it.</li>
            <li> The best hand/body lotion out there.  Minimal fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when it came both bottles were not packed appropriately.  The pumps were damaged.  I&lt;br /&gt;was left with two bottles of lotion and no pumps/lids</li>
            <li> A little too much scent for me and my nose, but other than that, it&#x27;s pretty amazing. I have sensitive skin and anything that has perfume makes my eyes red and my skin itch. So this was actually great for me.</li>
            <li> what an awesome deal&lt;br /&gt;i have been using this lotion for years and am glad that i can finally get a great deal on a product that is so worth it&lt;br /&gt;VERY MOISTURIZING</li>
            <li> Good price for great lotion.  Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! One of three I can use without allergic reaction, and always soothing without feeling greasy. I love that there are no added dyes or perfumes, especially with my skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have written about this product before. Anyone not using this lotion is missing one of the best products on the market. This stuff is great for the skin.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, feel and texture of this lotion.  I was given a&lt;br /&gt;sample of this by my nail tech and was sold from then on!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that i use, not greasy, smells great and got it sooner than expected. very satisfied</li>
            <li> Always does a good job for me and my family.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance; nice hydration.  Would really like to bathe in it!  Probably a good idea to buy two at a time although  delivery is really quick.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, and the price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
