            <li> Had I been sent the correct item, everything would have been golden. Alas, I was sent the \\&quot;hard hold\\&quot; gel instead. $15 down the drain.</li>
            <li> Holds on almost all day.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised and has a good manly smell.  The price seems to be high for the quantity that one gets</li>
            <li> Incredible for really thick men&#x27;s hair.  Have been using it for over ten years and will never switch.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair product for years and still appreciate its level of hold for my hair. Redken is a leader in hair care products. Try it!</li>
            <li> Great holding hair gel. My husband loves this and has used it for years!  We have to reorder constantly. Not sticky and washes out well.  The smell is also pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I would not rebuy this product. It does hold your hair in place and does not take much to accomplish this. However, this product is very greasy and also does not re-comb well.</li>
            <li> I use this gel daily and have for a few years.  I&#x27;m over fifty and still only have dark hair with a little grey and yet this gel seems to even darken my hair eliminating what little grey I have.  It holds wonderfully.  My kids call it hurricane gel!</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do ya....works great!!</li>
            <li> Great gel that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down too much.  It will last throughout the day and won&#x27;t leave your hair with that greasy look.  The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it is pricey in comparison to competitors.</li>
            <li> I have very fine curly hair. This works like a charm to give it body. If you use to much, however you will lose your shine</li>
            <li> Great product ! Thank you !!!</li>
            <li> Works great with my thin, flat hair!</li>
            <li> Holds very well but it leaves my hair dry</li>
            <li> My barber uses this product and I really like the way it performs. It is almost impossible to buy retail and the barber shop price is high. This seller offers a fair price and fast delivery.  No complaints just praise !</li>
            <li> Good Stuff. Total CONTROL</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this product when my hair cutter used it on my hair after my last haircut. Works great throughout the day, darkening my hair slightly and leaving it soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Some of the Redken Products are very similar looking and even reformulated.  This product shown in the picture is what you get.  That is honest and the choice to buy it is up to you.  You will get what you pay for and if you know and like this product from before as I do, then you will get what is being advertized.  This was not the case for me recently with \\&quot;Go Clean\\&quot; Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not a great hold on this, but i have really unruly and thick hair.  Works well though to not have much shine and look natural.  Smells amazing too!</li>
