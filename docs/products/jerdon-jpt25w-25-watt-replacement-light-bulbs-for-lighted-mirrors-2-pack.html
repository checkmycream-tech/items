            <li>thanks works great</li>
            <li>Well I was glad to get these bulbs.</li>
            <li>They work, but a taller bulb would have lit up the lamp more fully.</li>
            <li>Well pleased with purchase and speed of shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received</li>
            <li>Have not used them,but is better to have them on hand.</li>
            <li>Much better than the 15W that came with lamp.</li>
            <li>Told I must use six more words.</li>
            <li>and I like it better.</li>
            <li>You turn on the juice and they light up!</li>
            <li>and I love the mirror/light fixture</li>
            <li>I was really glad to find them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed...Will buy again  !!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used these yet as my unit is still using the original ones, which are holding their own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright and perfect for my little vanity  I can see clearly on both sides to do my make up love it !!</li>
            <li>long as this is the bulb your device requires, I think you will be perfectly happy!</li>
            <li>I am sure they are fine, but I have not been able to use them yet.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the bright over heads when I am getting ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are a perfect fit for the Conair double sided mirror.  </li>
            <li>I use in my Conair makeup mirror with different light settings and they work perfectly!</li>
            <li>I just wanted to stick with the clear, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>4 Watt 350 Lumens LED Light Bulb better.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good quality.  </li>
            <li>Two screws and mirror comes apart for easy access to bulbs.</li>
            <li>I bought these because finding 25W bulbs isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li>Great price, no other place sells these for my makeup mirror, thank god this place sells them</li>
            <li>The Jerdons are 25 watt and work fine, the Home Depot ones are 15 Watt.</li>
            <li>All seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>these work just fine.</li>
            <li>The quality of the bulbs are fine except that one of the bulbs should not have been in the package.  </li>
            <li>Worked just fine in my make up mirror</li>
            <li>Did the job just fine.</li>
            <li>They work just fine and were packaged well...arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li>Great value, easy to order and get rather than running to numerous places to find this bulb in the specified wattage.</li>
            <li>The bulb was fine and fit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light bulb and it works.</li>
            <li>The ConAir model I&#x27;m using calls for 10w light bulbs.</li>
            <li>They fit, it works and I now have a spare blub.</li>
            <li>I had a light in the mirror I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Worked just like a light bulb should.</li>
            <li>the light is on.</li>
            <li>but when the light when out in it</li>
            <li>I bought the bulbs thinking that if they were advertised side-by-side with the mirror they must fit.</li>
            <li>How else was I supposed to determine if the bulbs fit the mirror???).</li>
            <li>Have fun with your light!</li>
            <li>I bought my lighted makeup mirror from Wynn casino in Las Vegas because I liked the mirror in my room so much.</li>
            <li>Light on my makeup mirror burned out.  </li>
            <li>Jerdon JPT25W 25-Watt Replacement Light Bulbs for Lighted Mirrors, 2-Pack .I ordered the bulbs for the wall mounted light and mirror.</li>
            <li>they are light bulbs</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the light bulbs.  </li>
            <li>When your make up mirror lightbulb goes out, it is not recommended to use just any bulb that will fit.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>They are nice and bright and last a good long time.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t happen with the original bulb.</li>
            <li>This vendor shipped as promised and the bulb worked as well as the original.</li>
            <li>This  bulb is not as bright as the original bulb that came with my makeup mirror even though it is the same wattage.</li>
            <li>But, when my make-up mirror did not have a working one, believe me I was excited to order and quickly receive this item.</li>
            <li>Replacement bulbs are hard to find and I thought a couple extras would be perfect.</li>
            <li>bright enough.</li>
            <li>I was real concerned that I may not be able to find a replacement bulb for it.</li>
            <li>Other than that these are great.</li>
            <li>Get them here with quick delivery and save yourself time and gas.</li>
            <li>Even though it was supposed to fit my mirror, they were too large.  </li>
            <li>Buy these things, they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I still look 69 yrs old, just more groomed.  </li>
            <li>I bought these along with my Jerden mirror fixture and just wanted to have extra bulbs handy.  </li>
            <li>these hard to find bulbs are great when the original burns out.  </li>
            <li>Having the right replacement bulbs made sense. . .</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>These bulbs are just the right size and wattage.</li>
            <li>These are not the right bulb for the mirror I ordered for my grandaughters birthday.</li>
            <li>I got these for a salt lamp and so far the first one has cast a very nice glow for several months without problem.  </li>
            <li>Note that the Eiko bulbs are slightly larger, but fit fine my application.</li>
            <li>Amazon was a great deal especially when I leveraged with other orders for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>Looked like big bulbs for a Conair mirror light, but fits perfect and now I have an extra when my other daughter&#x27;s mirror burns out</li>
            <li>Good gets a little hot</li>
            <li>The frame of my makeup mirror becomes hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally found this item.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I should have come here first.</li>
            <li>The bulb was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>You ask for too many words on a product bought for future use!!</li>
            <li>This is a higher wattage than was recommended for the lamp</li>
            <li>was exactly what I ordered and both bulbs were in working condition.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with these bulbs--I am only on my first bulb in the pack (using in salt lamp).</li>
            <li>I am well pleased and won&#x27;t hesitate to shop with you next time a product is needed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>In purchasing this bulb, I wanted a more narrow glass to fit into a Christmas village store.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find, but totally delighted with purchase.</li>
            <li>I had the toughest time finding a replacement bulb, as it comes with a 25 watt bulb that is about the same size as a night light bulb.  </li>
            <li>Finally found some on a light bulb website and the shipping cost was twice the cost of the bulbs.</li>
            <li>Very prompt service</li>
            <li>and it was appreciated.</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
            <li>Better that I expected, just like OEM.</li>
            <li>As requested, with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>When the light bulb went out I looked at several stores without any luck for a replacement bulb.</li>
            <li>Used these to replace the lights in my girlfriends makeup mirror, much cheaper than from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>The wire is not broken and works but the bulb should not have passed quality control.</li>
            <li>I was glad to have found them after looking at Lowes, Home Depot, Sears and other places.</li>
            <li>It would have been easy to install if it were not for the tiny little screws to remove and reinsert on the mirror which was challenging.</li>
            <li>We bought extra light bulbs with our new makeup mirror</li>
            <li>So, if you happen to have a Home Depot near you, check there first.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to throw the whole mirror away--but could not find the bulb at any of the normal places I looked like lowe&#x27;s and home depot.  </li>
            <li>Ok but not bright as original</li>
            <li>Not sure if a fluke, but ordered two more of a different brand (EiKO) and both are working fine.  </li>
            <li>She was pleased to know that she has instant solutions to future burned out bulbs.</li>
            <li>It is hard to get excited about a light bulb.  </li>
            <li>Be careful, when you search for ConAir light bulbs, these bulbs will show up in the search engine.</li>
            <li>she was ready to junk it, but we found these bulbs and saved ourselves a considerable amount of money.</li>
            <li>It is probably worth noting that I use my mirror daily for make up</li>
            <li>For the low price it is worth just getting this with the mirror.  </li>
            <li>The original bulb lasted roughly 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to have back-up for new mirror.</li>
            <li>Saved me from buying a new lighted mirror.</li>
            <li>Looked around locally and could not find an exact match.</li>
            <li>I did verify the correct wattage and voltage before I bought these, so check your current bulb or the label inside your bulb compartment for any specifications that YOU might need to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>Wide and 7-Inch Tall Round Basket Lamp filled with Himalayan Natural Crystal Salt Chuncks]] and needed to replace the light bulb in one of them.  </li>
            <li>The length of the power cord for the light in the mirror was just long enough for us.  </li>
            <li>The bottom part of the light was not attached and black.  </li>
            <li>I went to next recommendation and they were too large.  </li>
            <li>glad to get replacement sometimes hard to find when you need them.  </li>
            <li>I can see clearly now</li>
            <li>So far, have not had to replace bulb.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Wal-Mart has them too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to get off incandescents completely, and even beyond CFLs with LEDs, now that I can get</li>
            <li>My mirror is so old</li>
            <li>Fixed our problem with bulbs that we could not find anywhere else.</li>
            <li>They were not the right wattage (a little to high)</li>
            <li>I looked high and low for these bulbs for my make-up mirror.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had an issue with that and don&#x27;t think it would happen unless you had the light on your mirror on for excessive lengths of time.</li>
            <li>The light itself works but it shines a yellowish light which was disappointing.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work for yours, please make sure and double check.</li>
            <li>Both bulbs were installed and one started clouding up right away and burned out in less than two minutes.  </li>
            <li>I really have no excuse for letting this go as long as i did..</li>
            <li>wanted these because the Conair recommended replacement bulbs were a mix set of a clear and a blue bulb.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find these bulbs, but worth the effort!  </li>
            <li>The LED is big, but it just barely fits into the vanity mirror.</li>
            <li>These light bulbs are very hard to find.  </li>
            <li>for the bulbs (with no luck) and finally found the bulbs online; however, they are certainly not as bright as the original one that came with my lighted mirror.</li>

            <li> thanks works great</li>
            <li> Well I was glad to get these bulbs.</li>
            <li> They work, but a taller bulb would have lit up the lamp more fully.</li>

            <li> Have not used them,but is better to have them on hand.</li>

            <li> Told I must use six more words.</li>
            <li> and I like it better.</li>
            <li> You turn on the juice and they light up!</li>
            <li> and I love the mirror/light fixture</li>
            <li> I was really glad to find them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed...Will buy again  !!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet as my unit is still using the original ones, which are holding their own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright and perfect for my little vanity  I can see clearly on both sides to do my make up love it !!</li>
            <li> long as this is the bulb your device requires, I think you will be perfectly happy!</li>
            <li> I am sure they are fine, but I have not been able to use them yet.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the bright over heads when I am getting ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are a perfect fit for the Conair double sided mirror.  </li>
            <li> I use in my Conair makeup mirror with different light settings and they work perfectly!</li>
            <li> I just wanted to stick with the clear, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> 4 Watt 350 Lumens LED Light Bulb better.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good quality.  </li>
            <li> Two screws and mirror comes apart for easy access to bulbs.</li>
            <li> I bought these because finding 25W bulbs isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li> Great price, no other place sells these for my makeup mirror, thank god this place sells them</li>
            <li> The Jerdons are 25 watt and work fine, the Home Depot ones are 15 Watt.</li>
            <li> All seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> these work just fine.</li>
            <li> The quality of the bulbs are fine except that one of the bulbs should not have been in the package.  </li>
            <li> Worked just fine in my make up mirror</li>
            <li> Did the job just fine.</li>
            <li> They work just fine and were packaged well...arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li> Great value, easy to order and get rather than running to numerous places to find this bulb in the specified wattage.</li>
            <li> The bulb was fine and fit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light bulb and it works.</li>
            <li> The ConAir model I&#x27;m using calls for 10w light bulbs.</li>
            <li> They fit, it works and I now have a spare blub.</li>
            <li> I had a light in the mirror I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Worked just like a light bulb should.</li>
            <li> the light is on.</li>
            <li> but when the light when out in it</li>
            <li> I bought the bulbs thinking that if they were advertised side-by-side with the mirror they must fit.</li>
            <li> How else was I supposed to determine if the bulbs fit the mirror???).</li>
            <li> Have fun with your light!</li>
            <li> I bought my lighted makeup mirror from Wynn casino in Las Vegas because I liked the mirror in my room so much.</li>
            <li> Light on my makeup mirror burned out.  </li>
            <li> Jerdon JPT25W 25-Watt Replacement Light Bulbs for Lighted Mirrors, 2-Pack .I ordered the bulbs for the wall mounted light and mirror.</li>
            <li> they are light bulbs</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the light bulbs.  </li>
            <li> When your make up mirror lightbulb goes out, it is not recommended to use just any bulb that will fit.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> They are nice and bright and last a good long time.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t happen with the original bulb.</li>
            <li> This vendor shipped as promised and the bulb worked as well as the original.</li>
            <li> This  bulb is not as bright as the original bulb that came with my makeup mirror even though it is the same wattage.</li>
            <li> But, when my make-up mirror did not have a working one, believe me I was excited to order and quickly receive this item.</li>
            <li> Replacement bulbs are hard to find and I thought a couple extras would be perfect.</li>
            <li> bright enough.</li>
            <li> I was real concerned that I may not be able to find a replacement bulb for it.</li>
            <li> Other than that these are great.</li>
            <li> Get them here with quick delivery and save yourself time and gas.</li>
            <li> Even though it was supposed to fit my mirror, they were too large.  </li>
            <li> Buy these things, they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I still look 69 yrs old, just more groomed.  </li>
            <li> I bought these along with my Jerden mirror fixture and just wanted to have extra bulbs handy.  </li>
            <li> these hard to find bulbs are great when the original burns out.  </li>
            <li> Having the right replacement bulbs made sense. . .</li>
            <li> Just the right size.</li>
            <li> These bulbs are just the right size and wattage.</li>
            <li> These are not the right bulb for the mirror I ordered for my grandaughters birthday.</li>
            <li> I got these for a salt lamp and so far the first one has cast a very nice glow for several months without problem.  </li>
            <li> Note that the Eiko bulbs are slightly larger, but fit fine my application.</li>
            <li> Amazon was a great deal especially when I leveraged with other orders for free shipping.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Looked like big bulbs for a Conair mirror light, but fits perfect and now I have an extra when my other daughter&#x27;s mirror burns out</li>
            <li> Good gets a little hot</li>
            <li> The frame of my makeup mirror becomes hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally found this item.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I should have come here first.</li>
            <li> The bulb was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> You ask for too many words on a product bought for future use!!</li>
            <li> This is a higher wattage than was recommended for the lamp</li>
            <li> was exactly what I ordered and both bulbs were in working condition.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with these bulbs--I am only on my first bulb in the pack (using in salt lamp).</li>
            <li> I am well pleased and won&#x27;t hesitate to shop with you next time a product is needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> In purchasing this bulb, I wanted a more narrow glass to fit into a Christmas village store.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find, but totally delighted with purchase.</li>
            <li> I had the toughest time finding a replacement bulb, as it comes with a 25 watt bulb that is about the same size as a night light bulb.  </li>
            <li> Finally found some on a light bulb website and the shipping cost was twice the cost of the bulbs.</li>
            <li> Very prompt service</li>
            <li> and it was appreciated.</li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> Better that I expected, just like OEM.</li>
            <li> As requested, with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> When the light bulb went out I looked at several stores without any luck for a replacement bulb.</li>
            <li> Used these to replace the lights in my girlfriends makeup mirror, much cheaper than from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The wire is not broken and works but the bulb should not have passed quality control.</li>
            <li> I was glad to have found them after looking at Lowes, Home Depot, Sears and other places.</li>
            <li> It would have been easy to install if it were not for the tiny little screws to remove and reinsert on the mirror which was challenging.</li>
            <li> We bought extra light bulbs with our new makeup mirror</li>
            <li> So, if you happen to have a Home Depot near you, check there first.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to throw the whole mirror away--but could not find the bulb at any of the normal places I looked like lowe&#x27;s and home depot.  </li>
            <li> Ok but not bright as original</li>
            <li> Not sure if a fluke, but ordered two more of a different brand (EiKO) and both are working fine.  </li>
            <li> She was pleased to know that she has instant solutions to future burned out bulbs.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get excited about a light bulb.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, when you search for ConAir light bulbs, these bulbs will show up in the search engine.</li>
            <li> she was ready to junk it, but we found these bulbs and saved ourselves a considerable amount of money.</li>
            <li> It is probably worth noting that I use my mirror daily for make up</li>
            <li> For the low price it is worth just getting this with the mirror.  </li>
            <li> The original bulb lasted roughly 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to have back-up for new mirror.</li>
            <li> Saved me from buying a new lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> Looked around locally and could not find an exact match.</li>
            <li> I did verify the correct wattage and voltage before I bought these, so check your current bulb or the label inside your bulb compartment for any specifications that YOU might need to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> Wide and 7-Inch Tall Round Basket Lamp filled with Himalayan Natural Crystal Salt Chuncks]] and needed to replace the light bulb in one of them.  </li>
            <li> The length of the power cord for the light in the mirror was just long enough for us.  </li>
            <li> The bottom part of the light was not attached and black.  </li>
            <li> I went to next recommendation and they were too large.  </li>
            <li> glad to get replacement sometimes hard to find when you need them.  </li>
            <li> I can see clearly now</li>
            <li> So far, have not had to replace bulb.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Wal-Mart has them too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get off incandescents completely, and even beyond CFLs with LEDs, now that I can get</li>
            <li> My mirror is so old</li>
            <li> Fixed our problem with bulbs that we could not find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> They were not the right wattage (a little to high)</li>
            <li> I looked high and low for these bulbs for my make-up mirror.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an issue with that and don&#x27;t think it would happen unless you had the light on your mirror on for excessive lengths of time.</li>
            <li> The light itself works but it shines a yellowish light which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work for yours, please make sure and double check.</li>
            <li> Both bulbs were installed and one started clouding up right away and burned out in less than two minutes.  </li>
            <li> I really have no excuse for letting this go as long as i did..</li>
            <li> wanted these because the Conair recommended replacement bulbs were a mix set of a clear and a blue bulb.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find these bulbs, but worth the effort!  </li>
            <li> The LED is big, but it just barely fits into the vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> These light bulbs are very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> for the bulbs (with no luck) and finally found the bulbs online; however, they are certainly not as bright as the original one that came with my lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> I am 69 yrs old and Male, I have hair growing out of my ears, noise, other places that I could not see to remeove them.</li>
            <li> The light went out in my mirror that I use every day to help me see those hard to see tiny little hairs.</li>
            <li> All you need is the candelabra base and make sure the bulb is narrow enough to fit.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s see how long they last.</li>
            <li> These bulbs work well and seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use them in my Himalayan Salt lamps for the heat they put out, (which creates the negative ion count in the air) , but these bulbs I find don&#x27;t put out much heat, hence they are for lighted mirrors, which I didn&#x27;t take into account.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t keep it on too long</li>
            <li> I was without a bulb for a long time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how we got along this long wirhout it.</li>
            <li> Does the job and lasts a very long time before burning out.</li>
            <li> Then I happened to go in Home Depot and found basically the same thing (Phillips brand) for half the price of these (around $3 for a pack of two at Home Depot).</li>
            <li> I thought 25W would be the same as previous ones I purchased.  </li>
            <li> These are dangerous, as they are too strong for some ConAir makeup lights.</li>
            <li> These bulbs, which I didn&#x27;t see before, probably would have been a better match for salt lamps (and also 4 1/2 times less expensive!)</li>
            <li> Be careful if you are using these with a ConAir lighted makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> so it was a no brainer to just spent the couple of dollars to you</li>
            <li> My salt lamp is approximately 7\\&quot; high.</li>
            <li> As expected!</li>
            <li> used for round make up mirror that lights up from Costco, have used for a long time now.</li>
            <li> not sure if anyone actually buy these items alone in AMZ.  </li>
            <li> but I could not find any other option.</li>
            <li> These bulbs are dimmer than other 25 watt bulbs I have purchased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They will work for other things I have</li>
            <li> It is brighter and has a higher color temperature (closer to 4000k) along with little heat that causes the bulbs the fail in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the postage to return them.</li>
            <li> They were half the price of the con-air bulbs, so I thought &amp;#34;Great!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The threading is half the size of T7.</li>
            <li> Not bright enough or at all like the one that came with my makeup mirror when I received it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Bought these little bulbs to use in my daughter&#x27;s lighted makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> Put one of these in my Conair makeup mirror, and yes it was a little brighter than the bulb the mirror came with.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed since I had looked in numerous stores (Home Depot, Lowes, Light Stores, etc.)</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered a few</li>
            <li> they will melt the plastic behind the mirror and could start a fire if left unattended.</li>
            <li> take it from me, its just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Delivery was one day late than initially expected.</li>
            <li> They do not fit.</li>
            <li> The light comes on and you can&#x27;t turn it off by tapping on the mirror base.</li>
            <li> Purchase them from Amazon and save yourself the trouble of hunting.</li>
            <li> I was not completely confident ordering even afar the reviews as my Conair mirror specifies DO NOT exceed 20 watts and one person said their Conair mirror fried out.</li>
            <li> I had what&#x27;s called a Type T (tubular) lamp, candelabra (pretty narrow) base bulb.</li>
            <li> Not too tall for a small lamp.</li>
            <li> We bought these for the small vanity mirror in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The bulb in my mirror burnt out and I had a hard time finding the replacement in retail stores.</li>
            <li> The other one is tucked away for whenever it fails.  </li>
            <li> This bulb hard to find, , save your time and order here!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fits, works, one was broken.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find did the job</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are 20w.</li>
            <li> They saved my wife&#x27;s expensive makeup mirror...</li>
            <li> The base is too small.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> After searching around on line comparing the base to pictures online, I figured out</li>
            <li> The height on this bulb is about 1 1/2\\&quot;, 2 1/8\\&quot; with the base.</li>
            <li> They are IMPOSSIBLE to find in stores!</li>

            <li> OEM quality. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I keep a stash of these for my conair makeup mirror</li>
            <li> I was looking for &#x27;daylight&#x27; type like and this bulb does not provide it. For that reason I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exceeds expectations!</li>
            <li> Difficult to find did the job</li>
            <li> Bulbs worked great for a project I was making as Christmas gift. They arrived unbroken &amp; on the date promised! I love to order from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Bought these little bulbs to use in my daughter&#x27;s lighted makeup mirror.  She was pleased to know that she has instant solutions to future burned out bulbs.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t needed them yet...but when I do.....</li>
            <li> The frame of my makeup mirror becomes hot to the touch. This didn&#x27;t happen with the original bulb. These Jerdon bulbs are the correct wattage for the mirror.</li>
            <li> As expected! So far, have not had to replace bulb. Ordered as spare. Shipment arrived on time and in great shape. Have on hand, if and when I need to replace!</li>
            <li> I have several of the salt rock baskets [[ASIN:B0025VO3DW WBM 8-Inch Wide and 7-Inch Tall Round Basket Lamp filled with Himalayan Natural Crystal Salt Chuncks]] and needed to replace the light bulb in one of them.  I had the toughest time finding a replacement bulb, as it comes with a 25 watt bulb that is about the same size as a night light bulb.  Neither the local grocery stores nor drugstores had them.  I didn&#x27;t try a hardware store, but I did find them here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bulbs work well and are just what I needed.  They were packaged well, arrived quickly, and works perfectly with my salt rock baskets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be pleased if you purchase this.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I looked all over locally for these bulbs. Couldn&#x27;t find the correct wattage. Finally found some on a light bulb website and the shipping cost was twice the cost of the bulbs. Amazon was a great deal especially when I leveraged with other orders for free shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light bulb and it works.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a replacement bulb for my illuminated mirror and no stores carry the product. I purchased this mirror years ago and of course do not have any insert for product information. I took a chance and ordered a few and it works perfect. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to find a replacement bulb for there illuminated mirror.</li>
            <li> Not bright enough or at all like the one that came with my makeup mirror when I received it as a gift.</li>
            <li> there light bulbs what can I say , if they light there good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally found this item. I looked all over locally with no luck. This worked as I hoped at a good price!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed...Will buy again  !!!</li>
            <li> Looked like big bulbs for a Conair mirror light, but fits perfect and now I have an extra when my other daughter&#x27;s mirror burns out</li>
            <li> used for round make up mirror that lights up from Costco, have used for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you are using these with a ConAir lighted makeup mirror. The ConAir model I&#x27;m using calls for 10w light bulbs. The only bulbs I can find close to 10w are these. Unfortunately, they are 20w. Be careful, when you search for ConAir light bulbs, these bulbs will show up in the search engine. These are dangerous, as they are too strong for some ConAir makeup lights. they will melt the plastic behind the mirror and could start a fire if left unattended. I&#x27;m giving these 3 stars for being listed under ConAir mirrors.</li>
            <li> would recommend to family and friends .</li>
            <li> I used these on my conair makeup mirror. They all burnt out/exploded and melted the plastic on the mirror and left burn marks.</li>
            <li> These are the same type bulbs as sold from the manufacture. I looked all over town for these type bulbs with no luck. Get them here with quick delivery and save yourself time and gas.</li>
            <li> This  bulb is not as bright as the original bulb that came with my makeup mirror even though it is the same wattage.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to replace the lightbulb in my lighted vanity mirror.  Fits perfectly in the one I have: http://www.amazon.com/VDOMUS%C2%AE-Double-Sided-Mount-Makeup-Mirror/dp/B00482WST2/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_194_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;13FVMRFZBW2KPD2VP7WC</li>
            <li> Looked around locally and could not find an exact match. Decided to purchase online. They fit, it works and I now have a spare blub.</li>
            <li> time will tell.  The site indicated these would be correct replacements, but the model number doesn&#x27;t coincide with the Conair product number.  Might wind up throwing them out - we&#x27;ll see what happens when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  Just what I needed for my make-up mirror.  Couldn&#x27;t find locally-  this was great.</li>
            <li> Fits, works, one was broken.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Great quality and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I am sure they are fine, but I have not been able to use them yet. I had a light in the mirror I ordered.  Very prompt service and it was appreciated.</li>
            <li> Ok but not bright as original</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my con-air double sided makeup mirror. They were half the price of the con-air bulbs, so I thought &amp;#34;Great!&amp;#34;. Then I happened to go in Home Depot and found basically the same thing (Phillips brand) for half the price of these (around $3 for a pack of two at Home Depot). Actually, the Home Depot ones are a bit brighter. So, if you happen to have a Home Depot near you, check there first. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Wal-Mart has them too. All you need is the candelabra base and make sure the bulb is narrow enough to fit. My mirror says 10 watt bulbs only, but I can&#x27;t find those (not even on the con-air website). The Jerdons are 25 watt and work fine, the Home Depot ones are 15 Watt. All seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> I was so thankful to find these darn things!! They are IMPOSSIBLE to find in stores! If you love your mirror like I do mine, don&#x27;t cut corners....take it from me, its just a waste of time. Buy these things, they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This item was a gift for Family member. It has worked out well, always order from Amazon, without any reservation as to quality</li>
            <li> The light went out in my mirror that I use every day to help me see those hard to see tiny little hairs. I didn&#x27;t want to throw the whole mirror away--but could not find the bulb at any of the normal places I looked like lowe&#x27;s and home depot.  Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good quality.  The length of the power cord for the light in the mirror was just long enough for us.  We are very happy with the mirror.</li>
            <li> Good gets a little hot but I don&#x27;t keep it on too long</li>
            <li> Wanted to have back-up for new mirror.</li>
            <li> I was not completely confident ordering even afar the reviews as my Conair mirror specifies DO NOT exceed 20 watts and one person said their Conair mirror fried out. I haven&#x27;t had an issue with that and don&#x27;t think it would happen unless you had the light on your mirror on for excessive lengths of time. Great value, easy to order and get rather than running to numerous places to find this bulb in the specified wattage. A ploy to get you to order replacement bulbs from Conair? Don&#x27;t know, but these work just fine. And, order was delivered timely.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect part for allowing me to fix my own, old lighted mirror. Very reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Having the right replacement bulbs made sense. . .</li>
            <li> Also compatible with Conair  make up vanity mirrors.</li>
            <li> good price and delivered on time</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them. Just got them for when my bulb expires in the mirror i bought for my self</li>
            <li> They are just what I needed, and that extra five watts makes a difference for my magnifying mirror. I&#x27;m happy with the bulbs and the quality of light. I hope that one day soon, however, these can be LED instead of incandescent. I&#x27;m trying to get off incandescents completely, and even beyond CFLs with LEDs, now that I can get 40- and 60-watt LEDs that look like incandescents but are only $10 and $12 respectively, with a warranty for 10 years. That&#x27;s what all bulbs need to be.</li>
            <li> Worked just like a light bulb should.</li>
            <li> Must have when ordering the mirror</li>
            <li> Great product, easy replacement in Mirror. Two screws and mirror comes apart for easy access to bulbs.</li>
            <li> Purchased for someone else, no input.</li>
            <li> Probably did not need to buy these now as I see now that the Jerden vanity mirror comes with a spare.  but this should last for years</li>
            <li> Just the thing for a lighted mirror.  Mine is one of those touch control models, with the 3 levels of brightness.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Even though it was supposed to fit my mirror, they were too large.  I went to next recommendation and they were too large.  Returned these and could not return second set.  Not the best experience.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get excited about a light bulb.  But, when my make-up mirror did not have a working one, believe me I was excited to order and quickly receive this item.</li>
            <li> These bulbs fit perfectly and I didn&#x27;t have to discard my lighted mirror.  I can see clearly now the light is on.</li>
            <li> Delivery was one day late than initially expected. Other than that these are great. I bought it for my Conair makeup mirror. The mirror came with 30w bulbs and these are only 25w but still very bright. I was without a bulb for a long time so I am very happy to finally have even lighting for doing my makeup.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to find these bulbs for my daughter&#x27;s make up mirror.  they work like a charm, after months of searching locally...I should have come here first.</li>
            <li> I have had a lighted make-up mirror for 20+ years but when the light when out in it I was real concerned that I may not be able to find a replacement bulb for it. Turns out these were perfect! Did what I needed...:)</li>
            <li> When I purchased the Jerdon J1010 lighted makeup mirror, these bulbs were promoted as an \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; item. I bought the bulbs thinking that if they were advertised side-by-side with the mirror they must fit. WRONG! They do not fit. The base is too small. I cannot return the bulbs for a refund because the package has been opened. (Of course it has been opened!! How else was I supposed to determine if the bulbs fit the mirror???). Now I am stuck with them. Boo Hiss Amazon for the misleading \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li> I really have no excuse for letting this go as long as i did.. just finally got around to it.. thanks works great</li>
            <li> Well I was glad to get these bulbs. I had shopped for some time and then just went on line and found them instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can use my mirror again!</li>
            <li> My mirror is so old I was ecstatic to find out I could get a replacement!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Better that I expected, just like OEM. perfect fit , no problems! Would recomend this product to any one. Have fun with your light!</li>
            <li> As requested, with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Lightbulbs are just as described, I ordered them as a replacement for a burned out light bulb in our lighted mirror and it fits perfectly</li>
            <li> My Himalayan Salt Lamp said 120v, 25w. After searching around on line comparing the base to pictures online, I figured out I had what&#x27;s called a Type T (tubular) lamp, candelabra (pretty narrow) base bulb. My salt lamp is approximately 7\\&quot; high. The height on this bulb is about 1 1/2\\&quot;, 2 1/8\\&quot; with the base. They work, but a taller bulb would have lit up the lamp more fully. These bulbs, which I didn&#x27;t see before, probably would have been a better match for salt lamps (and also 4 1/2 times less expensive!):  [...]</li>
            <li> I bought my lighted makeup mirror from Wynn casino in Las Vegas because I liked the mirror in my room so much. When the light bulb went out I looked at several stores without any luck for a replacement bulb. This vendor shipped as promised and the bulb worked as well as the original. Since it came in a two pack I am now set for another three years.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere! Perfect light for my makeup mirror and my plug in scentsy.</li>
            <li> Used these to replace the lights in my girlfriends makeup mirror, much cheaper than from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for these kind of bulbs from Lowes to walmart to beauty supply stores and could not find them anywhere. Was very happy to find them on amazon because I had run out of places to look for them.</li>
            <li> Light on my makeup mirror burned out.  The bulb was exactly what I needed. Well pleased with purchase and speed of shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received 2 bulbs which will last awhile.  Will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> Replacements for my mirror bulbs, and they are perfect.  My wife thinks I&#x27;m her ace handyman.</li>
            <li> Jerdon JPT25W 25-Watt Replacement Light Bulbs for Lighted Mirrors, 2-Pack .I ordered the bulbs for the wall mounted light and mirror.Have not used them,but is better to have them on hand.</li>
            <li> I bought these because finding 25W bulbs isn&#x27;t easy.  I use them in my Himalayan Salt lamps for the heat they put out, (which creates the negative ion count in the air) , but these bulbs I find don&#x27;t put out much heat, hence they are for lighted mirrors, which I didn&#x27;t take into account.  I thought 25W would be the same as previous ones I purchased.  I will have to go back to the 25W bulbs I purchased before to get the heat.</li>
            <li> they are light bulbs what&#x27;s to say</li>
            <li> you never have enough spares</li>
            <li> These light bulbs are very hard to find.  I looked everywhere and could not find them.  Wife&#x27;s mirror has been saved.</li>
            <li> Perfect bulb, perfect price, free shipping with my Prime!!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these kind of bulbs ANYWHERE! These worked like a charm. I still have one in reserve! Very happy.</li>
            <li> Bought them to replace burnt out bulbs on my wife&#x27;s make-up mirror. They are working and she&#x27;s happy with them</li>
            <li> This is a luxury item. I don&#x27;t know how we got along this long wirhout it. I am 69 yrs old and Male, I have hair growing out of my ears, noise, other places that I could not see to remeove them. Well this has allowed me to see and remove all that hair. Its hereditary but I no longer have to look like a \\&quot;tumble weed\\&quot;! Every one should have one.  I still look 69 yrs old, just more groomed.  I had to have the replacement bulbs.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed.  And I got them before the manufacturer (Conair) responded my inquiry re: their availability.</li>
            <li> The quality of the bulbs are fine except that one of the bulbs should not have been in the package.  The bottom part of the light was not attached and black.  The wire is not broken and works but the bulb should not have passed quality control.</li>
            <li> perfect great price fast shipping</li>
            <li> This did not work properly in my Conair 2-sided makeup mirror with touch control. It doesn&#x27;t respond to the touch control to go through the 3 levels of power, and I have to unplug it to turn it off.</li>
            <li> The packaage arrived in good shape.  Both bulbs were installed and one started clouding up right away and burned out in less than two minutes.  Not sure if a fluke, but ordered two more of a different brand (EiKO) and both are working fine.  Note that the Eiko bulbs are slightly larger, but fit fine my application.</li>
            <li> Bought these as spare part when bought the mirror...not sure if anyone actually buy these items alone in AMZ.  Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them but don&#x27;t expect any surprises.  Shipping was prompt and good packaging, hence 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this replacement bulb in my &amp;#34;Conair Oval Double-Sided Lighted Mirror - Oiled-Bronze Finish&amp;#34; (BE47BR) for over a month without issue.  The original bulb lasted roughly 6 months.  It is probably worth noting that I use my mirror daily for make up and I use it as a &amp;#34;night light&amp;#34; when I am in the bathroom at night (it doesn&#x27;t stay on, just when I&#x27;m in the room).  I like it better than the bright over heads when I am getting ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted these because the Conair recommended replacement bulbs were a mix set of a clear and a blue bulb.  I just wanted to stick with the clear, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  I did verify the correct wattage and voltage before I bought these, so check your current bulb or the label inside your bulb compartment for any specifications that YOU might need to be aware of.  5 Watts might not sound like much, but it could compromise your mirror (like melting the plastic).  When I opened mine it said specifically to use a Type T - 25W bulb, and I bet yours has a sticker too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as this is the bulb your device requires, I think you will be perfectly happy!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed since I had looked in numerous stores (Home Depot, Lowes, Light Stores, etc.) for the bulbs (with no luck) and finally found the bulbs online; however, they are certainly not as bright as the original one that came with my lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> Fixed our problem with bulbs that we could not find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go hunting in the store for replacement bulbs for my mirror, so was happy to find these online.</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere for one.  Finally found it on here.  It works perfectly and is a great price!</li>
            <li> I purchased these bulbs for a Conair make-up mirror. They were not the right wattage (a little to high) but I could not find any other option. The bulbs are great - it&#x27;s Conair that&#x27;s the problem. Can&#x27;t find bulbs for the products they sell.</li>
            <li> 48 hour response at a great price</li>
            <li> Although it works, I like the Toplimit E12 4 Watt 350 Lumens LED Light Bulb better.  It is brighter and has a higher color temperature (closer to 4000k) along with little heat that causes the bulbs the fail in the beginning.  The LED is big, but it just barely fits into the vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> Does the job and lasts a very long time before burning out.</li>
            <li> My bulbs arrived quickly and they work great~</li>
            <li> Very nice bulbs for my dimmable salt lamp. Not too tall for a small lamp. Much better than the 15W that came with lamp.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product as of yet.  You ask for too many words on a product bought for future use!!</li>
            <li> I needed replacement bulbs for a specific glass wax warmer purchased on Amazon. These are doing the job just fine!</li>
            <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t had to use them yet but glad to have &#x27;em handy. Told I must use six more words.</li>
            <li> These works great for my conair vanity light up mirror. They are a lot cheaper than buying it off the conair website.</li>
            <li> The bulbs came on when the switch was thrown. What else can you ask for? I was glad to have found them after looking at Lowes, Home Depot, Sears and other places.</li>
            <li> I got these for a salt lamp and so far the first one has cast a very nice glow for several months without problem.  The other one is tucked away for whenever it fails.  This is a higher wattage than was recommended for the lamp and I like it better.</li>
            <li> Came up as T7 25 Watt bulb when I did a search, but it is not a T7 bulb.  The threading is half the size of T7.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a vanity mirror</li>
            <li> perfect and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Hard to find, but totally delighted with purchase. Thought I would have to discard my make-up mirror, but no!</li>
            <li> Have a Clairol mirror and couldn&#x27;t find the replacement bulb any where. Save time and gas this is the correct one.</li>
            <li> bright enough. let&#x27;s see how long they last.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the light bulbs.  They were ordered with the mirror as extra bulbs in case one burned out.</li>
            <li> The bulb burnt out in my 70 dollar Lighted Mirror,  worked perfect!  This bulb hard to find, , save your time and order here!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for my desk lamp. was exactly what I ordered and both bulbs were in working condition. no issues</li>
            <li> I could not find this product anywhere until I discovered at Amazon! I thought I had to replace my make up mirror but Amazon saved me some cash by having this product It&#x27;s not sold in any stores. It&#x27;s perfect for make up mirror.</li>
            <li> I use these bulbs in my Himalayan Salt Lamp. They are nice and bright and last a good long time.</li>
            <li> These are a perfect fit for the Conair double sided mirror.  What else is there to say?  You turn on the juice and they light up!</li>
            <li> These are awesome! I looked high and low for these bulbs for my make-up mirror. No one had them. Thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> These bulbs work well and seem to last a long time. Well made and fit good too. Saves money and time.</li>
            <li> Put one of these in my Conair makeup mirror, and yes it was a little brighter than the bulb the mirror came with.  Glad I got a spare now!</li>
            <li> These bulbs are dimmer than other 25 watt bulbs I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with this product at all !</li>
            <li> Work fine, seem like a good bulb.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I am pleased with these bulbs--I am only on my first bulb in the pack (using in salt lamp). and I got these a month ago tomorrow</li>
            <li> I wish they would have been brighter.  They don&#x27;t seem to be as bright as the bulbs that were originally in the lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> The bulbs fit perfectly and were delivered immediately. I got two bulbs for what I would have paid for one bulb in a retail store. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> Great bulbs! I use in my Conair makeup mirror with different light settings and they work perfectly!</li>
            <li> The bulb in my mirror burnt out and I had a hard time finding the replacement in retail stores. I purchased this item from your website, received it in a timely manner, and it was in excellent condition. I am well pleased and won&#x27;t hesitate to shop with you next time a product is needed.</li>
            <li> There was already an extra bulb which came with the mirror, and these two extra were suggested.</li>
            <li> Worked just fine in my make up mirror</li>
            <li> We bought extra light bulbs with our new makeup mirror so we wouldn&#x27;t have to wait on them if one went out sometime. Yes I would recommend this product, if this is the bulb you may need for something.</li>
            <li> Saved me from buying a new lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> Best price I could find. Used for conair mirror.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these bulbs, but worth the effort!  They saved my wife&#x27;s expensive makeup mirror...she was ready to junk it, but we found these bulbs and saved ourselves a considerable amount of money.</li>
            <li> Great price for these bulbs!</li>
            <li> I bought these along with my Jerden mirror fixture and just wanted to have extra bulbs handy.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting bulbs and I love the mirror/light fixture</li>
            <li> In purchasing this bulb, I wanted a more narrow glass to fit into a Christmas village store.  The bulb was fine and fit well however I did not find the 1 watt bulb I needed.  The light was very bright, using the 25 watt.  Delivery and customer service were excellent.</li>
            <li> This bulb is working great for me in our lighted mirror.  I was really glad to find them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright and perfect for my little vanity  I can see clearly on both sides to do my make up love it !!</li>
            <li> Did the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I found these! I looked in stores locally for ages for replacement bulbs for my vanity mirror... these bulbs were what I needed!</li>
            <li> Got the bulbs and they were 20W, not the 25W as advertised.  I will find a use for them somewhere.  Not worth the postage to return them.</li>
            <li> They worked wonderfully  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work properly with my Conair mirror. The light comes on and you can&#x27;t turn it off by tapping on the mirror base.</li>
            <li> As described perfect for conair make up mirror</li>
            <li> Excellent Shopping experience.  Would recommend this to everyone. Great price and exactly as described.  I would go to this site again.</li>
            <li> Works for vanity mirror</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I was told they would work for my lighted mirror, but they were too big.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work for yours, please make sure and double check.</li>
            <li> Only option for makeup mirror. Can&#x27;t find in stores .  Cant beat the price.  The only choice if you want to use the mirror.</li>
            <li> I used this to replace the lamp in my wife&#x27;s make-up mirror. This lamp did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Best price on the internet that I could find.</li>
            <li> I got these to replace the bulb in my Conair makeup mirror. Works perfectly. Just the right size. And now I have an extra bulb!</li>
            <li> It came on time, well packed and intact. It would have been easy to install if it were not for the tiny little screws to remove and reinsert on the mirror which was challenging. The light itself works but it shines a yellowish light which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Works great</li>
            <li> When your make up mirror lightbulb goes out, it is not recommended to use just any bulb that will fit. These bulbs are just the right size and wattage. Don&#x27;t do what I did and search all over town for this size and wattage, no place had them, not even the lighting store. Purchase them from Amazon and save yourself the trouble of hunting.</li>
            <li> Great product, couldn&#x27;t find these bulbs anywhere than here. Great fast shipping and safe and secure, packed great. Great price, no other place sells these for my makeup mirror, thank god this place sells them</li>
            <li> Fit my conair dual mirror perfectly</li>
            <li> We bought these for the small vanity mirror in the bathroom.  They work just fine and were packaged well...arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement bulb.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet as my unit is still using the original ones, which are holding their own. These were purchased as a back up.</li>
            <li> These are not the right bulb for the mirror I ordered for my grandaughters birthday. They will work for other things I have but I was disapointed. Replacement bulbs are hard to find and I thought a couple extras would be perfect.</li>
            <li> these hard to find bulbs are great when the original burns out.  they light is bright and they are good to have on hand</li>
            <li> ordered with the mirror.</li>
            <li> For the low price it is worth just getting this with the mirror.  This all came with the mirror so it was a no brainer to just spent the couple of dollars to you have the bulbs in stock</li>
            <li> glad to get replacement sometimes hard to find when you need them.  just what we needed to replace the lamp</li>
