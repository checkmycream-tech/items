            <li>Nice perfume, fragance smell so good, very known brand, french-like design, what more can i say?</li>
            <li>A very clean, refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>I collect perfume bottles and this bottle is very unique.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like sweet with a nice afterscent.</li>
            <li>It was a great price for that size and we always use Live  by Jennifer  Lopez</li>
            <li>If you have a generally strong or identifying smell, musks, some vanillas, &amp; woodsy types fragrances work better for you.</li>
            <li>The bottle is prettier and the fragrance has a strong exotic fruity smell.</li>
            <li>lady (Tovah) described it as&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It&#x27;s a beautifully balanced blend that simply creates a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and came really fast.</li>
            <li>has that right kind of smell for a women</li>
            <li>Love the fresh smell!</li>
            <li>Just go easy on the spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer easy to find in stores, so I buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li>the smell of it is not to strong.</li>
            <li>I love sweet,fruity fragrances,but this one is too sweet.</li>
            <li>Thought this helms a lot f floral notes, they came across more &amp;#34;sweety like&amp;#34; at first which works for me because I love fruity smells on.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong, it lasts all day, and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite perfume!  </li>
            <li>It has some hints of soft musk, serene vanilla, sandalwood and of a light pleasant floral vibe to it...</li>
            <li>Great price, large quantity and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no fragrance expert by any means, but this variant of the J-Lo offerings is particularly light and airy with hints of citrus.</li>
            <li>Also, u can just ask someone you really trust to be honest with you.</li>
            <li>So re-apply and enjoy.</li>
            <li>Genuine perfume and the wife loves it.</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S how you&#x27;ll be able to tell if that&#x27;s the right smell for you.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that smelled sweet, but most sweet scents smell too sweet.  </li>
            <li>I can see why Live got so many stars, I give it 5 stars myself!</li>
            <li>This scent is very nice, not too sweet and definitely not too flowery.  </li>
            <li>Mi perfume llegó a Ecuador en buen estado, tal cual es el original, el olor rico tiene un parecido al Luxe mismo de JLo</li>
            <li>The size was great - I won&#x27;t run out for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li>Me and my daughter love LIVE!!</li>
            <li>and I love to wear it because it lasts whole day.</li>
            <li>Nice soft sensual scent</li>
            <li>it smells so fresh and clean &amp; where did you get it</li>
            <li>I wlll be you loyal customer for life.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy it locally and haven&#x27;t been able to find it, so I went online and found it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>it got here quickly &amp; in one piece.  </li>
            <li>Will surely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>i myself enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>I really like this scent, but it&#x27;s too strong, and too sweet for me.  </li>
            <li>but I think this is suitable if your 16 years old.</li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume after falling in love with Live Luxe by Jennifer Lopez.  </li>
            <li>I love JLO Live Parfum.  </li>
            <li>I can find similarities in many fragrances, but nothing I know of smells like Live.</li>
            <li>I am in love with Live by J. LO.</li>
            <li>I like live luxe better.</li>
            <li>Live isn&#x27;t as fruity as Live Luxe, but is good for a day when you want to smell nice without overpowering an entire room with your scent.</li>
            <li>Smelled exactly as I remembered it!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and ease of transaction details!!</li>
            <li>; They are more surprised when I tell them it is a JLO perfume!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s cheap for the big bottle!</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t have that crisp sweet smell that I remember.</li>
            <li>Never a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>Jlo has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something lovely and unusual, give Live a try.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is slightly sweet and very feminine.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the free gifts and new fragrance sample.</li>
            <li>it came super fast like</li>
            <li>A pleasant smell, not strong at all I&#x27;ve had allot of compliments</li>
            <li>The most stunning thing about Live for me is its uniqueness among other fragrances.</li>
            <li>The perfume came in a timely fashion and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Last a long time and smells great.</li>
            <li>The smell lasts a good amount of time I can say but wears off after a few hours, 3 to four to be exact</li>
            <li>i believe its been about 5 or 6 years since I first tried it.</li>
            <li>Bottle and colors are pretty too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years when it first launched.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how lovely this fragrance is</li>
            <li>I first received it as a gift</li>
            <li>First had it when first released and it&#x27;s smell was embedded in my mind for years.</li>
            <li>It is most definitely the scent for me, however.</li>
            <li>She really likes it!</li>
            <li>Recomend it, yet not expensive to buy it.</li>
            <li>I purchased it because it was said to have a soft gentle smell, but it was to strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>It also seems to attract a lot of positive attention from people, which not a lot of perfumes do because of their overbearing scent.</li>
            <li>My main concern was the smell wasnt the same this used to be my favorite perfume I always bought it</li>
            <li>My 4th bottle can&#x27;t get enough of it my favorite by far!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong at first but calms down quickly.</li>
            <li>I have never found the large size bottle in the stores.</li>
            <li>The main reason why I still have this parfum is because the bottle is so pretty sitting up on my armoir.</li>
            <li>so i cant really say.</li>
            <li>My sister really loves this perfume</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a reasonable purchase price for this perfume.</li>
            <li>I like the fragrance, but did not want to spend too much for something that I wear in the summer.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping with the legit product.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really do like it.  </li>
            <li>My wife absolutely lives this perfume.</li>
            <li>thanks for everything</li>
            <li>If you knew how much of a pessimist I am, then you would understand how much that means coming from me.</li>
            <li>Everyone loves it and wants to know the name of it.</li>
            <li>AND I RECEIVED VERY SPEEDY SHIPPING/ SERVICE WITH THE TRANSACTION.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from Trinidad and its so hurtful when I pay so much for something that is not.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>It is not too overpowering, and not weak.</li>
            <li>It is fruity but also clean smelling; on me the caramel is not apparent.</li>
            <li>This scent is different from the original live perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still sweet but a little less sweet &amp; more &amp;#34;florally&amp;#34; than fruity.</li>
            <li>I think they have discontinued production of this particular parfum, because of the difficulty I had finding it.</li>
            <li>Quick to deliver and exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I used to use this in high school</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the typical stores and finally found it here on Amazon at a great price for the larger bottle.</li>
            <li>If it were just a little on the lighter side, it&#x27;d be much better.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time even with regular use and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>First off, this perfume is 3.4 ounces, whereas most perfumes come in teeny little 1 ounce bottles, so that was a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>BTW, any ny new samples for men&#x27;s fragrances?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos</li>
            <li>The product was new and inside the box.</li>
            <li>I get compliments when I wear this and LIVE  </li>
            <li>i have Live on</li>
            <li>Put up Calvin Klein Euphoria for Live.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I do recommend this J Lo Live perfume/ cologne.</li>
            <li>Jennifer Lopez &#x27;s Live was a gift for my mother on mother day.</li>
            <li>Compliments from men and women when I wear Live.  </li>
            <li>Received new in package.</li>
            <li>its Live by Jennifer Lopez</li>
            <li>Completely!</li>
            <li>Such a pretty smell.</li>
            <li>Completely recommend this!</li>
            <li>, i ordered it kind of late but came just in time for christmas!</li>
            <li>i love this perfume, its hard to find in stores for some reason</li>
            <li>I will recomend this perfume for a young lady.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than local.</li>
            <li>You can have florals &amp; fruits but not as the main fragrance as it will mix like carbon dioxide &amp; stove gas escaping together &amp; silently kill someone.</li>
            <li>and I usually can find it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li>Purchased I think third one so far.</li>
            <li>A larger bottle will last far longer than a smaller one.</li>
            <li>Bottle leaked only was less than half full</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice perfume, fragance smell so good, very known brand, french-like design, what more can i say?</li>
            <li> A very clean, refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> I collect perfume bottles and this bottle is very unique.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like sweet with a nice afterscent.</li>
            <li> It was a great price for that size and we always use Live  by Jennifer  Lopez</li>
            <li> If you have a generally strong or identifying smell, musks, some vanillas, &amp; woodsy types fragrances work better for you.</li>
            <li> The bottle is prettier and the fragrance has a strong exotic fruity smell.</li>
            <li> lady (Tovah) described it as&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It&#x27;s a beautifully balanced blend that simply creates a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and came really fast.</li>
            <li> has that right kind of smell for a women</li>
            <li> Love the fresh smell!</li>
            <li> Just go easy on the spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer easy to find in stores, so I buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> the smell of it is not to strong.</li>
            <li> I love sweet,fruity fragrances,but this one is too sweet.</li>
            <li> Thought this helms a lot f floral notes, they came across more &amp;#34;sweety like&amp;#34; at first which works for me because I love fruity smells on.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong, it lasts all day, and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume!  </li>
            <li> It has some hints of soft musk, serene vanilla, sandalwood and of a light pleasant floral vibe to it...</li>
            <li> Great price, large quantity and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no fragrance expert by any means, but this variant of the J-Lo offerings is particularly light and airy with hints of citrus.</li>
            <li> Also, u can just ask someone you really trust to be honest with you.</li>
            <li> So re-apply and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Genuine perfume and the wife loves it.</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S how you&#x27;ll be able to tell if that&#x27;s the right smell for you.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that smelled sweet, but most sweet scents smell too sweet.  </li>
            <li> I can see why Live got so many stars, I give it 5 stars myself!</li>
            <li> This scent is very nice, not too sweet and definitely not too flowery.  </li>
            <li> Mi perfume llegó a Ecuador en buen estado, tal cual es el original, el olor rico tiene un parecido al Luxe mismo de JLo</li>
            <li> The size was great - I won&#x27;t run out for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter love LIVE!!</li>
            <li> and I love to wear it because it lasts whole day.</li>
            <li> Nice soft sensual scent</li>
            <li> it smells so fresh and clean &amp; where did you get it</li>
            <li> I wlll be you loyal customer for life.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy it locally and haven&#x27;t been able to find it, so I went online and found it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> it got here quickly &amp; in one piece.  </li>
            <li> Will surely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> i myself enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent, but it&#x27;s too strong, and too sweet for me.  </li>
            <li> but I think this is suitable if your 16 years old.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume after falling in love with Live Luxe by Jennifer Lopez.  </li>
            <li> I love JLO Live Parfum.  </li>
            <li> I can find similarities in many fragrances, but nothing I know of smells like Live.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Live by J. LO.</li>
            <li> I like live luxe better.</li>
            <li> Live isn&#x27;t as fruity as Live Luxe, but is good for a day when you want to smell nice without overpowering an entire room with your scent.</li>
            <li> Smelled exactly as I remembered it!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and ease of transaction details!!</li>
            <li> ; They are more surprised when I tell them it is a JLO perfume!</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s cheap for the big bottle!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t have that crisp sweet smell that I remember.</li>
            <li> Never a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Jlo has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something lovely and unusual, give Live a try.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is slightly sweet and very feminine.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the free gifts and new fragrance sample.</li>
            <li> it came super fast like</li>
            <li> A pleasant smell, not strong at all I&#x27;ve had allot of compliments</li>
            <li> The most stunning thing about Live for me is its uniqueness among other fragrances.</li>
            <li> The perfume came in a timely fashion and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Last a long time and smells great.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts a good amount of time I can say but wears off after a few hours, 3 to four to be exact</li>
            <li> i believe its been about 5 or 6 years since I first tried it.</li>
            <li> Bottle and colors are pretty too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years when it first launched.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how lovely this fragrance is</li>
            <li> I first received it as a gift</li>
            <li> First had it when first released and it&#x27;s smell was embedded in my mind for years.</li>
            <li> It is most definitely the scent for me, however.</li>
            <li> She really likes it!</li>
            <li> Recomend it, yet not expensive to buy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because it was said to have a soft gentle smell, but it was to strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> It also seems to attract a lot of positive attention from people, which not a lot of perfumes do because of their overbearing scent.</li>
            <li> My main concern was the smell wasnt the same this used to be my favorite perfume I always bought it</li>
            <li> My 4th bottle can&#x27;t get enough of it my favorite by far!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong at first but calms down quickly.</li>
            <li> I have never found the large size bottle in the stores.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I still have this parfum is because the bottle is so pretty sitting up on my armoir.</li>
            <li> so i cant really say.</li>
            <li> My sister really loves this perfume</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a reasonable purchase price for this perfume.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance, but did not want to spend too much for something that I wear in the summer.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping with the legit product.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really do like it.  </li>
            <li> My wife absolutely lives this perfume.</li>
            <li> thanks for everything</li>
            <li> If you knew how much of a pessimist I am, then you would understand how much that means coming from me.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves it and wants to know the name of it.</li>
            <li> AND I RECEIVED VERY SPEEDY SHIPPING/ SERVICE WITH THE TRANSACTION.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Trinidad and its so hurtful when I pay so much for something that is not.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> It is not too overpowering, and not weak.</li>
            <li> It is fruity but also clean smelling; on me the caramel is not apparent.</li>
            <li> This scent is different from the original live perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still sweet but a little less sweet &amp; more &amp;#34;florally&amp;#34; than fruity.</li>
            <li> I think they have discontinued production of this particular parfum, because of the difficulty I had finding it.</li>
            <li> Quick to deliver and exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I used to use this in high school</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the typical stores and finally found it here on Amazon at a great price for the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> If it were just a little on the lighter side, it&#x27;d be much better.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time even with regular use and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> First off, this perfume is 3.4 ounces, whereas most perfumes come in teeny little 1 ounce bottles, so that was a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> BTW, any ny new samples for men&#x27;s fragrances?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos</li>
            <li> The product was new and inside the box.</li>
            <li> I get compliments when I wear this and LIVE  </li>
            <li> i have Live on</li>
            <li> Put up Calvin Klein Euphoria for Live.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I do recommend this J Lo Live perfume/ cologne.</li>
            <li> Jennifer Lopez &#x27;s Live was a gift for my mother on mother day.</li>
            <li> Compliments from men and women when I wear Live.  </li>
            <li> Received new in package.</li>
            <li> its Live by Jennifer Lopez</li>
            <li> Completely!</li>
            <li> Such a pretty smell.</li>
            <li> Completely recommend this!</li>
            <li> , i ordered it kind of late but came just in time for christmas!</li>
            <li> i love this perfume, its hard to find in stores for some reason</li>
            <li> I will recomend this perfume for a young lady.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than local.</li>
            <li> You can have florals &amp; fruits but not as the main fragrance as it will mix like carbon dioxide &amp; stove gas escaping together &amp; silently kill someone.</li>
            <li> and I usually can find it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li> Purchased I think third one so far.</li>
            <li> A larger bottle will last far longer than a smaller one.</li>
            <li> Bottle leaked only was less than half full</li>
            <li> so I know when its different and the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed, because I like more fruity &amp; sweet smelling perfumes.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle, ((empty)) buying more...today!!!!  </li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Lingers long.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> I have bought this perfume for a long time.</li>
            <li> find myself getting bored with perfumes, but this one is still my favorite for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> but as you can see there are some notes which help to tone it down a bit after the initial blast!</li>
            <li> Thank you for having this available when it&#x27;s so hard to find elsewhere!!!</li>
            <li> BUT this one was just as I expected!</li>
            <li> For some reason, it smells slightly different than the past.</li>
            <li> I wear it almost everyday, I&#x27;ve gotten quiet a few comments about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not right.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a sultry slightly fruity scent.  </li>
            <li> I was a little uneasy about purchasing online bc you hear and read about all these knock offs</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my neck (in addition to my wrists) and it caused a headache after a few minutes; if I don&#x27;t spray it on my neck</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with Miami Glow a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I usually spend twice this amount for a bottle about half the size.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Flower Bomb, or Thierry Muglers Angel, but with the economy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, so I&#x27;m grateful that I can still purchase online.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to describe.</li>
            <li> This bottle of parfum is so old that it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I have never liked musky type perfumes.</li>
            <li> In the past year I have found it difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Can never find it in store and when I do, it&#x27;s waaay too expensive.</li>
            <li> no woman can go wrong using it..</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy for me based on the notes but it has become my go-to every day perfume.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I wear my expensive perfumes and never get compliments</li>
            <li> If you buy it ,you won&#x27;t be unhappy with your purchase.</li>
            <li> what is it&lt;br /&gt;Usually afraid to say what it is</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bland, boring, and has no kick to it.</li>
            <li> And it has not affected any residents with bad allergies.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to use this in high school and I love the way it smells.  It&#x27;s the perfect mix of fruity and floral.  Love it!</li>
            <li> So nice smell love ......&lt;br /&gt;I love J-Lo , I like her Perfume also the bottle look Amazing&lt;br /&gt;She smell like a Diva..?</li>
            <li> Fast, excellent service! Thank you for the free gifts and new fragrance sample. I wlll be you loyal customer for life.  Keep it up.  BTW, any ny new samples for men&#x27;s fragrances?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos Feliciano</li>
            <li> bought it for a friend of mine and she loves it. depends on what kind of scent you like, i havent smelled it so i cant really say.</li>
            <li> The product was new and inside the box. I don´t have anything to complain about.</li>
            <li> Bottle leaked only was less than half full oh well</li>
            <li> This is the best service I have gotten from online shopping.   Im definitily shopping on Amazon.com more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. I bought it as a christmas present for my mom, i ordered it kind of late but came just in time for christmas! I compared the prices to department stores and i got a bargain for it! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love. It&#x27;s my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> SINCE I WAS PURCHASING ONE SCENT FROM THE VENDOR, I FIGURED THAT I WOULD LOOK TO SEE IF THEY CARRIED THIS SCENT AS WELL.  IT SAVED ME A TRIP TO THE MALL.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because it was said to have a soft gentle smell, but it was to strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume after falling in love with Live Luxe by Jennifer Lopez.  Live isn&#x27;t as fruity as Live Luxe, but is good for a day when you want to smell nice without overpowering an entire room with your scent. My only suggestion is to use it sparingly if you&#x27;re prone to perfume-induced headaches. I sprayed it on my neck (in addition to my wrists) and it caused a headache after a few minutes; if I don&#x27;t spray it on my neck I don&#x27;t have a problem with headaches.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  My mom asks me to get it for her every Christmas.  Thank you !!  Great seller!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I get compliments all the time. A must have for me! It is a great fragrance and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just absolutely love this smell</li>
            <li> My 4th bottle can&#x27;t get enough of it my favorite by far!!</li>
            <li> I love JLO Live Parfum.  It is my favorite and I have always received complements on the smell.  I used to be able to buy it locally and haven&#x27;t been able to find it, so I went online and found it at Amazon.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Arrived great, timely, love the smell</li>
            <li> The perfume came in a timely fashion and is exactly what I wanted. I had to wait some time for it because I had to send it to NY. From NY they sent it to me. I hope they ship to PR in the future.</li>
            <li> My sister really loves this perfume</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and very good expecially for the price</li>
            <li> Top Notes&lt;br /&gt;Lemon, Orange, Pineapple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle Notes&lt;br /&gt;Peony, Violet, Redcurrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Base Notes&lt;br /&gt;Caramel, Tonka Beans, Vanilla, Sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a veryyy fruity scent but as you can see there are some notes which help to tone it down a bit after the initial blast! I&#x27;ve had this since about Christmas and I love to wear it because it lasts whole day. I&#x27;m in my twenties and people are always asking what I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lady (Tovah) described it as&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It&#x27;s a beautifully balanced blend that simply creates a lovely fragrance. To me, it&#x27;s rather elegant. I couldn&#x27;t resist it and I had to have it. I can smell some pineapple, and the way it blends with vanilla and sandalwood is amazing. The most stunning thing about Live for me is its uniqueness among other fragrances. I can find similarities in many fragrances, but nothing I know of smells like Live. It stands out, and attracts. If you&#x27;re looking for something lovely and unusual, give Live a try.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and I totally agree!&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this perfume online because it was one of my favorites, but it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore. It smells AMAZING and I never have to work about someone wearing the same perfume as me. I get compliments when I wear this and LIVE  LUXE all the time.</li>
            <li> It was a great price for that size and we always use Live  by Jennifer  Lopez</li>
            <li> My ultimately favorite sexy smelling perfume.  Can never find it in store and when I do, it&#x27;s waaay too expensive. Love that it&#x27;s cheap for the big bottle! Perfect! !</li>
            <li> I once bought this from Macy&#x27;s at regualr retail price so I knew what it suppose to smell like. I was a little uneasy about purchasing online bc you hear and read about all these knock offs BUT this one was just as I expected! Smelled exactly as I remembered it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. After one spray, it last all afternoon. I would recommend this product to others. It has a beautiful fruity/ flower smell.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a reasonable purchase price for this perfume. I like the fragrance, but did not want to spend too much for something that I wear in the summer. I am satisfied with the price and quality of this purchase.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in time in Brazil, in according with the estimated. I love the smell and i´m very happy.</li>
            <li> I do like this.  I purchased it based on many great reviews.  I like Glow better but this does smell great.  It&#x27;s strong at first but calms down quickly.</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments when I wear this!</li>
            <li> Mi perfume llegó a Ecuador en buen estado, tal cual es el original, el olor rico tiene un parecido al Luxe mismo de JLo aunque un poco más suave.. no tengo ninguna queja todo bien.</li>
            <li> Great product at the best price!!! Fast delivery and ease of transaction details!! My most favorite person has decided to keep me a while longer!! Great job, as usual,Amazon!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> bought as a gift to change things up a bit. very good decision. I&#x27;m no fragrance expert by any means, but this variant of the J-Lo offerings is particularly light and airy with hints of citrus. not to flowery or overpowering.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I still have this parfum is because the bottle is so pretty sitting up on my armoir. I&#x27;m not really a big fan of the parfum&#x27;s scent. It&#x27;s very bland, boring, and has no kick to it. It reminds me of the musk that my mother used to wear back in the 1980s. If you are a J-Lo fan, however, I would go with her Miami Glow.</li>
            <li> I used to love this perfume and now its just okay...it didn&#x27;t have that crisp sweet smell that I remember.</li>
            <li> Wife liked it a lot for an Xmas gift.  Last a long time and smells great.</li>
            <li> Jlo has done it right with his Fragrences I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light and it&#x27;s last it makes you wanna have sex with yourself it smells so good.</li>
            <li> People ask me everytime i have Live on, what is that you&#x27;ve on it smells so fresh and clean &amp; where did you get it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Its that perfume you want to throw on during the summertime. The smell lasts a good amount of time I can say but wears off after a few hours, 3 to four to be exact but I recomend it because it turns heads.</li>
            <li> The best perfume ever iove all her flaver</li>
            <li> This has got to be my favorite perfume!!! I work in nursing and I get complimented on it every day but co-workers and residents. And it has not affected any residents with bad allergies.The bottle is even beautiful to me.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh smell!</li>
            <li> I really like this scent, but it&#x27;s too strong, and too sweet for me.  If it were just a little on the lighter side, it&#x27;d be much better.</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter love LIVE!! Everytime we wear it we got a lot of compliments. It stays on for a long time. We have been wearing this Parfum spray for about 4 years.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume for many many years. It lasts a long time even with regular use and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Another AMAZING scent from Jennifer Lopez; she makes many great fragrances and you won&#x27;t be dissapointed by the seller. Really fast shipping with the legit product. No fakes here and no damaged product. I ordered this along with Miami Glow a few weeks ago. Great fragrances. This scent is perfect for Spring, Autumn, and Winter but I occasionally wear it in the Summer. Just go easy on the spray.</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful, I wear it all the time!! It is definitely  my favorite perfume of all time!! I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find another perfume (at ANY proce point) that works with my body chemistry the way this one does.  Love.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best fragrances by Jlo no woman can go wrong using it..</li>
            <li> It smells so good and came really fast.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume...i believe its been about 5 or 6 years since I first tried it. I still use it to this day!</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells feminine and sensual. Lingers long. Priced right. Bottle and colors are pretty too. Put up Calvin Klein Euphoria for Live.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume!  It&#x27;s no longer easy to find in stores, so I buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive. My main concern was the smell wasnt the same this used to be my favorite perfume I always bought it so I know when its different and the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> I received this product within two days of ordering it and I&#x27;m so happy to be reunited with my favorite perfume! Great price, large quantity and fast delivery what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> The size was great - I won&#x27;t run out for a LONG time. Love this scent (and get complimented on it) and I haven&#x27;t seen it in a store in years. So glad Amazon had it!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the purchase of this parfume. My wife loves it and the price was great. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Great price. I will be ordering again. I use to wear this perfume all the time and I&#x27;m so happy I found it on here.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.  Cheaper price than the stores.</li>
            <li> I have kept this in my collection for years because it always has people asking &amp;#34;What are you wearing, I love it!&amp;#34; They are more surprised when I tell them it is a JLO perfume!</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance. I used to love it. For some reason, it smells slightly different than the past. It&#x27;s a flirty youthful kinda smell. It seems a bit stronger than earlier years ago. I&#x27;ve been using it for years when it first launched. I&#x27;d still recommend it. I know they&#x27;d say they didn&#x27;t change the formulation but I can sooooooooo smell the difference. It&#x27;s still sweet but a little less sweet &amp; more &amp;#34;florally&amp;#34; than fruity. Even a bit woody or savory smelling. Thought this helms a lot f floral notes, they came across more &amp;#34;sweety like&amp;#34; at first which works for me because I love fruity smells on. They tend to blend well with my body&#x27;s chemistry. You have to know what bottom notes smell best on you. If you have a generally strong or identifying smell, musks, some vanillas, &amp; woodsy types fragrances work better for you. You can have florals &amp; fruits but not as the main fragrance as it will mix like carbon dioxide &amp; stove gas escaping together &amp; silently kill someone. It&#x27;s just not right. Once your body adopts the fragrance you&#x27;re wearing, the heat from you turns it all the way on. THAT&#x27;S how you&#x27;ll be able to tell if that&#x27;s the right smell for you. Also, u can just ask someone you really trust to be honest with you. Completely! Bottom line, I do recommend this J Lo Live perfume/ cologne. ;-)</li>
            <li> I always, always get compliments when I wear this! Such a pretty smell. I bought this as a Christmas gift and they loved it too!</li>
            <li> What a bright, fresh, happy frag! This was a blind buy for me based on the notes but it has become my go-to every day perfume. It is fruity but also clean smelling; on me the caramel is not apparent. Weirdly enough I feel like this smells a bit like the berry Teen Spirit deodorant I wore in middle school but I love it regardless.</li>
            <li> My sister &amp; I fell in love been using for awhile,love the smell.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Live by J. LO. This is the 3rd time I brought this perfume. I can&#x27;t stress enough how lovely this fragrance is and I will continue to buy it. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Everything was great!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using this. It is a gift.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! The fragrance is very sexy and I get compliments all the time when I wear it. Shipping was on time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent! I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, sadly, so in glad I found it on here!</li>
            <li> My mother in law loved it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daycare provider.  I had to stop using myself once I knew she used it.  I paid a great price for this product $20-something and my daycare provider loves it.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, so I&#x27;m grateful that I can still purchase online.</li>
            <li> Smelled good all day, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It smells great and lingers most of the day.  I first received it as a gift and I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like, but I was wrong.  I really do like it.  Try it you may to.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a sultry slightly fruity scent.  It&#x27;s addictive.  I never tried this perfume before and I will be using this as my Spring scent.</li>
            <li> I had this one when I was 18 and I wouldnt wear it today.Im not a fan of fruity purfumes but I think this is suitable if your 16 years old.The bottle is prettier and the fragrance has a strong exotic fruity smell.</li>
            <li> A pleasant smell, not strong at all I&#x27;ve had allot of compliments, I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle, ((empty)) buying more...today!!!!  It has some hints of soft musk, serene vanilla, sandalwood and of a light pleasant floral vibe to it...and it last for hours after applying.Love it.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my step g.daughter for Christmas....she loves it...age 17</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents.  I was looking for something that smelled sweet, but most sweet scents smell too sweet.  This scent is very nice, not too sweet and definitely not too flowery.  Another plus is the price.  Amazon&#x27;s price is the lowest I&#x27;ve found for this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. I get compliments on it wherever I go. It is not too strong, it lasts all day, and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Jennifer Lopez &#x27;s Live was a gift for my mother on mother day. She loved it.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely lives this perfume. Thank you for having this available when it&#x27;s so hard to find elsewhere!!! You guys are amazing!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful perfume, I always receive a lot of complements when I wear it:)</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume!! had no problems very happy</li>
            <li> Nice soft sensual scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I found my favorite perfume here on Amazon. I&#x27;ve used this perfume for many years and I usually can find it pretty much anywhere. In the past year I have found it difficult to find in stores. For some reason they have discontinued carrying it in stores. So, I was very happy that I found it at Amazon, and for a better price than I had ever paid too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product .. arrived on the exact date ... is 100% original and excellent quality ... the product is as described by the image ... and I loved it .. thanks for everything, I recommend it to all amazon buyer community ...</li>
            <li> Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s Birthday !</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance, and unmatched price.This is my 2nd time when I buy this perfume and I love it.It&#x27;s really great!!!!</li>
            <li> This scent has been my favorite perfume since the day I tried it. The smell is slightly sweet and very feminine. I have never liked musky type perfumes. This scent reminds me of good times, summer love, and butterflies. If you knew how much of a pessimist I am, then you would understand how much that means coming from me. I always keep a bottle on my counter. It also seems to attract a lot of positive attention from people, which not a lot of perfumes do because of their overbearing scent. If you get a whiff of this you&#x27;ll never go without it again.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this ,someone always asks what I&#x27;m wearing.The scent is pleasant and I like how it smells on me.All of Jennifer&#x27;s  colognes smell nice.We buy them all but this is my favorite.If you buy it ,you won&#x27;t be unhappy with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Great quality perfum from France by Lopez. Everyone loves it and wants to know the name of it. First had it when first released and it&#x27;s smell was embedded in my mind for years. Had to have it again.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto... Llego en tiempo récord y en perfectas condiciones, no tengo queja alguna del vendedor....  Espero siga así lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> Compliments from men and women when I wear Live.  Never a disappointment.  A very clean, refreshing smell. Evening or day</li>
            <li> Someone purchased this for me 3yrs ago. I could never get this scent out of my mind....... so this year I decided to find it for myself!!!!!!!....The best ever</li>
            <li> Bought this a a Christmas gift and reciever of the gift was pleased with it.  This is a very pleasant scent.  The price is an excellant value for a very nice fragrance.</li>

            <li> Love it! Received new in package.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and distribición by supplier</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my lady. She loves the stuff and I like the way it smells on her. I think they have discontinued production of this particular parfum, because of the difficulty I had finding it. I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the typical stores and finally found it here on Amazon at a great price for the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off reviews. To me personally it has a hint of grapefruit  that I&#x27;m not a fan of.</li>
            <li> Genuine perfume and the wife loves it. Much cheaper than local.</li>
            <li> My mother loved it, I&#x27;m glad I bought from here it saved me a lot of money</li>
            <li> Love this product! Always get compliments on this perfume.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells so good. I wear my expensive perfumes and never get compliments but I always do when I wear this one</li>
            <li> Received quickly, the packing was perfect and the price was Great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent. I wear it almost everyday, I&#x27;ve gotten quiet a few comments about it. I would definately buy this again and again</li>
            <li> ordered by mistake but it smell good so i&#x27;ll keep it. Very nice smell I like Jlo products anyway. would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more girl&#x27;s perfume. I love sweet,fruity fragrances,but this one is too sweet. Like candy,lolly pop. I had one smelling like this and gave it to my friend&#x27;s daughter who is 13.</li>
            <li> This scent is different from the original live perfume. I&#x27;m from Trinidad and its so hurtful when I pay so much for something that is not. I&#x27;m totally unsatisfied</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling and happy I found it on Amozon</li>
            <li> I seem to remember already reviewing this, but I think it was a while back from a different seller. STILL love this fragrance after all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself getting bored with perfumes, but this one is still my favorite for everyday wear. Completely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Shipping was on point. And I love love love  this perfume.</li>
            <li> I have bought this perfume for a long time. It smells great. It is not too overpowering, and not weak. It lasts all day. This is the only perfume that I have gotten tons of compliments with. It is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price is wonderful too. I usually spend twice this amount for a bottle about half the size. I am glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the bottle. I collect perfume bottles and this bottle is very unique. To my surprise the perfume is simply wonderful. Will be re-ordering this when I run out.</li>
            <li> First off, this perfume is 3.4 ounces, whereas most perfumes come in teeny little 1 ounce bottles, so that was a big plus for me. A larger bottle will last far longer than a smaller one. Also, speaking of lasting, this scent definitely has lasting power. I sprayed some on myself before I left work, and nine hours later when I arrived at home I could still smell the fragrance in my room. It smells really good, although I can see it not being a scent for everyone. It is most definitely the scent for me, however.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife then she ran out. I bought her a second bottle and she loves it. It has a fruity smell.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I got it for a GREAT price thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> this is awesome and great price</li>
            <li> Its good. I like live luxe better. But its good I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, 100% satisfied. Price is excellent for the amount of the product. Great price, better price than in a department store.</li>
            <li> This bottle of parfum is so old that it smells bad.  Do not buy it, Amazon doesnt let you return this product either.  Do not waist your money.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Packaged well. Love the scent. WAY cheaper than at the store. Lasts for freakin&#x27; ever. Good buy.</li>
            <li> The best purchase out of all scents</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Amazon seller was awesome it got here quickly &amp; in one piece.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed, because I like more fruity &amp; sweet smelling perfumes.  It smells a tad \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; on ME.  Definately does not get the \\&quot;what are you wearing you smell so good?\\&quot; that the Britney Spears \\&quot;Fantasy\\&quot; gets me.  It&#x27;s a beautiful bottle though.  I&#x27;ll keep it for when I&#x27;m not going out.  I usually wear Flower Bomb, or Thierry Muglers Angel, but with the economy it the sh*tter I had to \\&quot;downsize\\&quot; my perfume &amp; I&#x27;m actually impressed with some of the celebrity perfumes that I&#x27;d turn my nose up at Once upon a time.......</li>
            <li> Nice perfume, fragance smell so good, very known brand, french-like design, what more can i say? its Live by Jennifer Lopez</li>
            <li> She really likes it! Took a chance after reading reviews. I did good!! Will surely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> wife like it and so do I . Purchased I think third one so far. Smell good. Recomend it, yet not expensive to buy it.</li>
