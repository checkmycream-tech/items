            <li>They are also easy to tip over and fairly flimsy.  </li>

            <li>This stand is very light, and can be folded up, which is nice for travel.</li>
            <li>They are very light and portable.  </li>
            <li>I needed a better way to keep my wigs nice and this is an easy way to do it.</li>
            <li>this wig stand is just okay.  </li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t too many choices out there if you dont want a funky foam head.  </li>
            <li>Wish it had been more sturdy, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li>Well it does have the snap on top and the curved sides are also not as shown.  </li>
            <li>I use my Styrofoam stands at home as they do work better.</li>
            <li>The top part never stays on because it is not aligned with the notches.  </li>
            <li>I guess when you purchase something cheap you get what you pay for!  </li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>This would be perfect for a shorter wig, which is what I will use it for in the future.</li>
            <li>Too tall for my shelves and the top piece keeps coming off.</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this stand before I lost my hair and got a wig..because of chemo.</li>
            <li>The directions to put the wig stand together are so simple and the best part is that my wigs are retaining their shape.</li>
            <li>which is what I like the most.</li>

            <li>These wig stands are easy to use and they are easy to pack in a suitcase.  </li>

            <li>The price is excellent compared to higher prices in local hair stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another great thing is that because it&#x27;s all open on the inside</li>
            <li>its great because its portable however you cant style your wig on it because there isnt enough structure to it</li>

            <li>It serves it&#x27;s purpose as a cheap wig stand.</li>
            <li>These are really very nice sturdy wig stands, &amp; you simply cannot beat this deal.</li>
            <li>Perfect for packing, takes very little room in luggage.</li>
            <li>I liked my old one which easily slipped together and apart.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a small stand and this fits the biill perfectly, I also like that you can fold it up when you are not using it.</li>
            <li>My original reason for the purchase was as a knitted hat blocker.</li>
            <li>If you just want something to hang your wig on to dry after washing it; then this would be great for that.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one because for my not too frequent traveling I thought it would be better without bothering with the snap on top.</li>
            <li>Got it quick.</li>
            <li>Very nice able to use as a regular wig stand or could be used to dry wigs after washing.  </li>
            <li>I AM OK WITH IT SO FAR .</li>
            <li>but so far i am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>right and snaps/ locks in place.</li>
            <li>It flops right off and pulls at the lace.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old foam head that I used 45 years ago for my first wig.</li>
            <li>I have two wigs and two hat wigs and they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It looks like it will do exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>I had bought a second wig stand that has the circle that snaps on the top which I planned for home.  </li>
            <li>It came a lot faster than it was suppost too, and it does exactly what you would expect it to do.</li>
            <li>Pretty much what you&#x27;d expect if you look at what it is and how it&#x27;s made.  </li>
            <li>I chosed all five stars because the product is exactly what I have been using and it works very well with all my wigs.</li>
            <li>When I shampoo my wig, I wrap it in a towel to take most water out..then put the wig on this stand to air dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t use it to fix my wigs or anything.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the help.</li>
            <li>This stand is inexpensive and very portable.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Need to carefully balance wig on it or it easily falls over.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this wig stand; I thought that it would be a little more durable.</li>
            <li>This is a little hard to put together (you have to line it up just right), but once it is together it is very sturdy and is a good size for demonstrating hats and beanies</li>
            <li>It is cheap but not worth</li>
            <li>I have three so far.  </li>
            <li>This wig stand is exactly what I needed to travel and to use to dry my wigs after washing.  </li>

            <li> Not bad, but not great.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s simple to use and does the job as well as can be expected.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it would hold a long wig well though</li>
            <li> It made trying to style the wig very difficult because it wasn&#x27;t firmly on the stand, the stand also isn&#x27;t very sturdy, it&#x27;s made of plastic, not metal like I originally thought it was.</li>
            <li> , it seems stable with a short wig, but it might tip over or something with a heavy or long wig.</li>
            <li> It is also occupies minimal storage space when not in use.</li>
            <li> but it is made of plastic and as far as I can tell, some of the pieces have to be forced into place.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, the stand does not fall over, it&#x27;s just the weight of the wig that&#x27;s the downfall.</li>
            <li> It took less than thirty seconds to assemble and is extremely lightweight.</li>
            <li> These were made out of&lt;br /&gt;heavy duty &amp; thick plastic, navy blue in color and are very&lt;</li>
            <li> I have a few wigs due to a health issue and purchased these&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> I use it everyday when I take my wig off.</li>
            <li> and it takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> It was not suitable for that use.</li>
            <li> so that sucks,</li>
            <li> Thick sturdy plastic.</li>
            <li> This is not a good wig stand.  </li>
            <li> I will keep it but was disappointing it wasn&#x27;t as pictured.  </li>
            <li> but it is awkward to assemble.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, but it&#x27;s not the stand&#x27;s fault.</li>

            <li> These work well for me! I have two wigs and two hat wigs and they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> this wig stand is just okay.  seems to easily come apart when you take your wigs off or put them on the stand.  does the job well enough i guess</li>
            <li> Is what it is. Thick sturdy plastic. Got it quick. Holds the wig  right and snaps/ locks in place. Good.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Great price! Just what I wanted for when I wash my wig.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this wig stand; I thought that it would be a little more durable. I really can&#x27;t use it to fix my wigs or anything. If you just want something to hang your wig on to dry after washing it; then this would be great for that.</li>
            <li> It did the job... A piece broke before I could really use it good so that sucks, but I travel a lot and it fits in my suitcase. So, it&#x27;s still doing its job.</li>
            <li> Got this stand in fairly quickly, works great, and will do for the wig I just bought. Thanks for the help. It looks like it will do exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I have a few wigs due to a health issue and purchased these&lt;br /&gt;for them. The ones I had were flimsy. These were made out of&lt;br /&gt;heavy duty &amp; thick plastic, navy blue in color and are very&lt;br /&gt;sturdy. And as is usual with most Amazon items, great pricing!</li>
            <li> Kinda flimsy, but serves its purpose.  Need to carefully balance wig on it or it easily falls over.  There aren&#x27;t too many choices out there if you dont want a funky foam head.  Wish it had been more sturdy, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li> it does the job. good for traveling</li>
            <li> These are really very nice sturdy wig stands, &amp; you simply cannot beat this deal. I have three so far.  Best of all, you can take them apart for travel.  No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Wig stand came today.  I had bought a second wig stand that has the circle that snaps on the top which I planned for home.  I purchased this one because for my not too frequent traveling I thought it would be better without bothering with the snap on top. Well it does have the snap on top and the curved sides are also not as shown.  This is why I only rated it two stars.  I like the things I order to be as advertised. I will keep it but was disappointing it wasn&#x27;t as pictured.  I will probably contact the seller about it though.</li>
            <li> This is a little hard to put together (you have to line it up just right), but once it is together it is very sturdy and is a good size for demonstrating hats and beanies (what I use it for). Great solution for the price.</li>
            <li> The fold-able wig stand disassembles which makes it great for travel. I use my Styrofoam stands at home as they do work better.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to hold my wig for a convention that I was going to, but the wig won&#x27;t stay on it properly! It made trying to style the wig very difficult because it wasn&#x27;t firmly on the stand, the stand also isn&#x27;t very sturdy, it&#x27;s made of plastic, not metal like I originally thought it was. You have to assemble it yourself when you get it so, as I said, it isn&#x27;t sturdy. If you are looking for something to hold a wig, I&#x27;d choose something else.</li>
            <li> This is not a good wig stand.  The top part never stays on because it is not aligned with the notches.  I guess when you purchase something cheap you get what you pay for!  I would recommend that anyone looking to purchase a wig stand to spend the money to get a good one.</li>
            <li> good price - good quality - I will be buying more !!</li>
            <li> IT IS LOOK SAME ON THE PICTURE HERE AND I USE IT FOR MY WIG . I AM OK WITH IT SO FAR .</li>
            <li> This wig stand works great as a wig stand. Some people complained you can&#x27;t style the wig on this stand, its true, its a stand people not a styling head.</li>
            <li> I wanted a small stand and this fits the biill perfectly, I also like that you can fold it up when you are not using it.</li>
            <li> This wig stand is lightweight, fold-able and practical. It is great for travel should you need a wig stand when away from home.  It is also occupies minimal storage space when not in use. It is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have a collection of wigs for conventions and costumes and this is great for that. Because it&#x27;s three pieces that snap together it saves space in your bag, but it&#x27;s stable and durable. Another great thing is that because it&#x27;s all open on the inside it lets your wigs air out.</li>
            <li> So nice to have stands for my wigs!</li>
            <li> I just received this stand 3 days after it was ordered and i love it. It took less than thirty seconds to assemble and is extremely lightweight. I have yet to see how it holds with my wig but so far i am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product to hold your wig or hat in shape, it&#x27;s simple to use and does the job as well as can be expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold a 21 inch pony tail wig. It flops right off and pulls at the lace. On the other hand, the stand does not fall over, it&#x27;s just the weight of the wig that&#x27;s the downfall. I&#x27;m disappointed, but it&#x27;s not the stand&#x27;s fault. This would be perfect for a shorter wig, which is what I will use it for in the future.</li>
            <li> This wig stand is exactly what I needed to travel and to use to dry my wigs after washing.  It can&#x27;t be used to styly, but that wasn&#x27;t it&#x27;s purpose for me, so I like it.</li>
            <li> Very nice able to use as a regular wig stand or could be used to dry wigs after washing.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This stand is very light, and can be folded up, which is nice for travel. The only thing is it is a bit unstable.</li>
            <li> This stand is inexpensive and very portable. My original reason for the purchase was as a knitted hat blocker. It was not suitable for that use. I gave it to a friend that travels with her wig and she seemed very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Just what one needs when traveling to third world countries with wigs.  Perfect for packing, takes very little room in luggage.</li>
            <li> Kinda flimsy but it does the job. I&#x27;d certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use these to hold hats and accessories for costume fabrication.  They are very light and portable.  They are also easy to tip over and fairly flimsy.  Pretty much what you&#x27;d expect if you look at what it is and how it&#x27;s made.  Not bad, but not great.  Just meh.</li>
            <li> its great because its portable however you cant style your wig on it because there isnt enough structure to it</li>
            <li> Too tall for my shelves and the top piece keeps coming off.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this stand before I lost my hair and got a wig..because of chemo. I use it everyday when I take my wig off. It comes apart very easily and is great for packing/traveling. When I shampoo my wig, I wrap it in a towel to take most water out..then put the wig on this stand to air dry. Much better than my old foam head that I used 45 years ago for my first wig.</li>
            <li> I needed a better way to keep my wigs nice and this is an easy way to do it. One of the nice options is when you are traveling. You can easily take it apart an reassemble for compact traveling.</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to assemble and use. Inexpensive and is all that is needed for my type of light hairpiece</li>
            <li> This is a very nice wig stand. It came a lot faster than it was suppost too, and it does exactly what you would expect it to do.</li>
            <li> I was traveling for work and needed a foldable wig stand for my wigs to keep their shape and this works perfectly.  The directions to put the wig stand together are so simple and the best part is that my wigs are retaining their shape.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without it. Highly recommend the product. Can&#x27;t believe stores don&#x27;t carry them.  It&#x27;s a must have for sure!</li>
            <li> Just what I need it was not expensive and it kept my wigs in good shape after I wash them. And was very easy to put to&lt;br /&gt;getter.</li>
            <li> I like this  stand it&#x27;s portable which is what I like the most. I would definitely recommend this stand for wig wearers</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose as a cheap wig stand. It travels, it holds my short wig &amp; it basically does it job. What more does it need to do?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it would hold a long wig well though, it seems stable with a short wig, but it might tip over or something with a heavy or long wig.</li>
            <li> This does the job but it is awkward to assemble.  I liked my old one which easily slipped together and apart.  However, it is good to have something like this for travel if one wheres a wig.</li>
            <li> I know it is supposed to look like this when it is put together but it is made of plastic and as far as I can tell, some of the pieces have to be forced into place.  I did manage to kind of set up off balance and rest my wig on it while it is drying.  I plan on replacing it when I think of it when I place another order.  I would not recommend anyone buy this.  It is cheap but not worth even the low price asked.</li>
            <li> These wig stands are easy to use and they are easy to pack in a suitcase.  I never have to travel without stands for my wigs.</li>
            <li> I chosed all five stars because the product is exactly what I have been using and it works very well with all my wigs. Its safe for our environment and it disassembles if I need to take it while traveling and it takes up very little space. The price is excellent compared to higher prices in local hair stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect fit for you hats as well!!!!</li>
            <li> Travel with these wig stands, and just love them!</li>
            <li> This did what it was suppose to do.  Held my wig and was able to travel with them with ease.  Fast shipping.</li>
