            <li>KMS Curl Up works the best.</li>
            <li>LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li>I love it and have been using it now for 8 yrs!!!!</li>
            <li>The best!</li>
            <li>And it smells great too!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get very good instructions of how to use this, just says emulsify.</li>
            <li>Great product and excellent service by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;KMS curl is best for curls, I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great</li>
            <li>Ehhh... not so great.</li>
            <li>This product wasn&#x27;t great on the frizz part.</li>
            <li>The seller is also great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better!</li>
            <li>I love this creme!  </li>
            <li>A girlfriend recommended this to me and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Texture wise applying it to your hair doesn&#x27;t feel all that appealing either.</li>
            <li>and this is the absolute best product I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>This is wonderful and leaves my hair soft, but still holds well.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and have tried many products to keep it in control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep this as a backup if I run out of my favorite item, OGX Argan Curl Cream.</li>
            <li>so I bought it, but the OGX is so much better.</li>
            <li>What I use now works better.</li>
            <li>living in Louisiana, I have to fight humidity every day, but with this cream my hair looks shiny, healthy and is so soft and get real nice curls</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product for women with curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I still haven&#x27;t found anything better than this.</li>
            <li>So it is probably better for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>i just bought 2 more of these products they work</li>
            <li>Very healthy looking and full.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for that magical product that will make my hair curl more and clump together.  </li>
            <li>This product does work well though, and I&#x27;ll continue to buy it until I find something better.  </li>
            <li>It does help to make it a bit more curly.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my curls defines and frizz free without any kind of residue or crunchiness.</li>
            <li>I have used many products for my curly hair but there is nothing like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used this product for awhile and love it.</li>
            <li>and I get pretty good clumping (called &amp;#34;bunching&amp;#34; by KMS); however, it doesn&#x27;t control my frizz.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tell how much water to how much creme to mix for best results.</li>
            <li>Plus even though it smells (sort of) like strawberries, it&#x27;s so strong</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Not for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my daughter in law,I have curly hair and is long know,after I applied the gel,I applied the cream and the hair looks so beautiful and easy to manage for days.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and is now the only thing I use on my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I still use it to help smooth out frizz, but won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li>frizz free curls.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic product that helps keep my hair under control.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product for curly hair, separates hair enough to manage a bit of control and keep the frizz to a minimun.</li>
            <li>This gives my hair a slightly more defined curls, but my hair puffs out and is very frizzy.</li>
            <li>I guessed and it works, but better instructions would have been appreciated.</li>
            <li>dull and sticky great product will continue to buy more products</li>
            <li>Trying this was an impulse decision, but I am now a loyal convert.</li>
            <li>This is the best product to achieve soft curls with minimal frizz EVER.</li>
            <li>I love this product i have very straight hair and have been looking for something that would scrunch my hair and not be sticky it leaves it very soft and my scrunch stays all day</li>
            <li>I have found I have to put gel on my outer layers and along my part first, in order to keep the frizz away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely a repeat customer:)</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I really love how KMS bottles push up the bottom as they are used, ensuring you are pumping out every last bit of creme.  </li>
            <li>however I personally believe works better on wet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I pretty much always keep an eye out for something to control frizz and improve the look of my curls.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner made my hair dry and brittle, this didn&#x27;t make it any better.</li>
            <li>Works even better if I blow dry after applying.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and in the summer it gets frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I do not like this; it makes your hair really crinkly and crunchy.</li>
            <li>it gets to be a bit much.</li>
            <li>This defines my waves very well</li>
            <li>This product works really well to add curl to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than I have ever found.</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair, but the texture varies, fine on top and coarse on the bottom.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and gives great curl definition without being stiff or crunchy.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have ever tried that works for my curly frizzy hair (I&#x27;m a guy with super curly hair).  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>I live in south florida the humidity capital.</li>
            <li>I was super disappointed after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I LOVE KMS products, but this one is not a favorite.</li>
            <li>Everyone loves my natural curls!</li>
            <li>use this product daily and also order two as soon as one gets low.&lt;br /&gt;Cant live without it!!</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft, but defined.</li>
            <li>Curl Up holds my waves, eliminates the frizz and leaves my hair soft and natural feeling.</li>
            <li>Keeps curls, but looks and feels natural.  </li>
            <li>I just let my hair dry naturally most of the time, then when I comb it the curls are not as tight and my hair never frizzes.  </li>
            <li>I am constantly trying new products for curly hair</li>
            <li>Natural wavu, some curly long hair....</li>

            <li> Natural wavu, some curly long hair....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spread as easily as I would like and is a little too thick for me.</li>
            <li> It takes a tiny amount on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> It is quite thick, so I wet my hands first before emulsifying, and that helps a lot with application.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, very wavy hair</li>
            <li> curl up makes it so soft without being greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft, it isn&#x27;t stiff like when I used a gel.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use a small amount each time though or your hair will look greasy and it will be a little hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other products, but coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> This curly up creme would probably work in a less humid environment, or on a different type of curly hair.</li>
            <li> I put it in when it is wet, work it through and squeeze dry with paper towels.  </li>
            <li> be used on wet or dry</li>
            <li> I have tried this alone and with the bounce back spray and have air dried my hair and have also used a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever tried left my hair stiff or strawlike.  </li>
            <li> I keep this as a back up - a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for my hair because i LOVE the curl up shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tried various other products that claim to tame the frizz, but nothing works like this.  </li>
            <li> A little doesn&#x27;t go a long way, as with other products.</li>
            <li> i have tried lots of other products and they all seem to leave my hair</li>
            <li> This product does not weigh down my wavy hair..</li>
            <li> and so I purchase it on Amazon by the case for less than my salon used to charge.</li>
            <li> The KMS Curl Up Control Creme holds your curls without making your hair stiff or brittle.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it keeps it neat, without being stiff and helps to control fizziness.</li>
            <li> Tame the beast...</li>
            <li> My sister has a lot of thick hair and just loves it.  </li>
            <li> product is a thick cream which I scrunch into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously curly and often frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It weighed my hair down terribly!  </li>
            <li> As a result, I am nearly impossible to please.</li>

            <li> KMS Curl Up works the best. This product does not weigh down my wavy hair..</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent service by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;KMS curl is best for curls, I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have frizzy curly hair and Kms curl up makes it so soft without being greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and in the summer it gets frizzy.  I have tried various other products that claim to tame the frizz, but nothing works like this.  My hair stays soft, it isn&#x27;t stiff like when I used a gel.  It takes a tiny amount on wet hair.  I just let my hair dry naturally most of the time, then when I comb it the curls are not as tight and my hair never frizzes.  I have also used it when blow drying my hair.  It works well either way.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great - i&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have tried many products to keep it in control. This is wonderful and leaves my hair soft, but still holds well. Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried this alone and with the bounce back spray and have air dried my hair and have also used a diffuser. I do not like this; it makes your hair really crinkly and crunchy. Do not waste your money on this. Get the KMS bounce back spray. It&#x27;s so much better!</li>
            <li> Ehhh... not so great. A little doesn&#x27;t go a long way, as with other products. My hair felt a bit greasy with this stuff, and if I touched my hair throughout the day by accident, I could also feel grease residue on my hand. I&#x27;ll keep this as a backup if I run out of my favorite item, OGX Argan Curl Cream. I thought this might compare to that so I bought it, but the OGX is so much better.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair, but the texture varies, fine on top and coarse on the bottom. Different parts curl in different ways. As a result, I am nearly impossible to please. Trying this was an impulse decision, but I am now a loyal convert. My hair is curling all in the same direction, its not crunchy and I don&#x27;t need an anti frizz serum every 2 hours. LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously curly and often frizzy hair. I have tried hundreds of creams, mouses, alixurs, etc, etc over the years and I can&#x27;t live without this product. No one in my area carries the KMS line and so I purchase it on Amazon by the case for less than my salon used to charge.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair. I pretty much always keep an eye out for something to control frizz and improve the look of my curls. This product wasn&#x27;t great on the frizz part. What I use now works better. Plus even though it smells (sort of) like strawberries, it&#x27;s so strong it gets to be a bit much. Texture wise applying it to your hair doesn&#x27;t feel all that appealing either. So it&#x27;s a pass for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the middle with this one. I have lots of fine wavy hair.  This defines my waves very well and I get pretty good clumping (called &amp;#34;bunching&amp;#34; by KMS); however, it doesn&#x27;t control my frizz. It is quite thick, so I wet my hands first before emulsifying, and that helps a lot with application. I have found I have to put gel on my outer layers and along my part first, in order to keep the frizz away. I don&#x27;t think I would buy again, but I will finish it now that I know what products to cocktail with.</li>
            <li> I love this creme!  If you have curly hair, you need this product!  I love it and have been using it now for 8 yrs!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product to achieve soft curls with minimal frizz EVER.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product for curly hair, separates hair enough to manage a bit of control and keep the frizz to a minimun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for YEARS. I keep trying other products, but coming back to this one. It keeps my hair soft, but defined.</li>
            <li> living in Louisiana, I have to fight humidity every day, but with this cream my hair looks shiny, healthy and is so soft and get real nice curls</li>
            <li> The best! Natural wavu, some curly long hair....Love this stuff</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for women with curly hair. I have been using this for several years. I am constantly trying new products for curly hair and I still haven&#x27;t found anything better than this. The KMS Curl Up Control Creme holds your curls without making your hair stiff or brittle.</li>
            <li> Luv luv this product! I&#x27;m definitely a repeat customer:)</li>
            <li> This product really works! Curls were enhanced but not crunchy!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, very wavy hair and this is the absolute best product I have ever found.  I swear by it and refuse to use anything else.  Every gel or mousse I&#x27;ve ever tried left my hair stiff or strawlike.  Curl Up holds my waves, eliminates the frizz and leaves my hair soft and natural feeling.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner made my hair dry and brittle, this didn&#x27;t make it any better.</li>
            <li> This curly up creme would probably work in a less humid environment, or on a different type of curly hair. This gives my hair a slightly more defined curls, but my hair puffs out and is very frizzy. I keep this as a back up - a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for my hair because i LOVE the curl up shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is now the only thing I use on my curly hair. It lasts a long time and gives great curl definition without being stiff or crunchy.</li>
            <li> Makes my curly 3b hair greasy instead of holding or styling it.</li>
            <li> Not for fine hair.  It weighed my hair down terribly!  My sister has a lot of thick hair and just loves it.  So it is probably better for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my daughter in law,I have curly hair and is long know,after I applied the gel,I applied the cream and the hair looks so beautiful and easy to manage for days.</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed after reading all the great reviews. I LOVE KMS products, but this one is not a favorite. It doesn&#x27;t spread as easily as I would like and is a little too thick for me. It ends up looking greasy. It may be because I have thinner hair. I still use it to help smooth out frizz, but won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this product i have very straight hair and have been looking for something that would scrunch my hair and not be sticky it leaves it very soft and my scrunch stays all day i just bought 2 more of these products they work i have tried lots of other products and they all seem to leave my hair dull and sticky great product will continue to buy more products</li>
            <li> I really love how KMS bottles push up the bottom as they are used, ensuring you are pumping out every last bit of creme.  The seller is also great and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase from them.</li>
            <li> This product works really well to add curl to my hair.  And it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Keeps curls, but looks and feels natural.  Very healthy looking and full.  Been using for several years now.  Haven&#x27;t found another product that works as well for my hair.  I put it in when it is wet, work it through and squeeze dry with paper towels.  Everyone loves my natural curls!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for that magical product that will make my hair curl more and clump together.  This product does work well though, and I&#x27;ll continue to buy it until I find something better.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy or greasy like some products do.  It does help to make it a bit more curly.  Works even better if I blow dry after applying.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that tames my crazy and frizzy hair to help it maintain nice curls</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have ever tried that works for my curly frizzy hair (I&#x27;m a guy with super curly hair).  Tame the beast... try this out.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend recommended this to me and I absolutely love it! Keeps my curls defines and frizz free without any kind of residue or crunchiness.</li>
            <li> I have used many products for my curly hair but there is nothing like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not like the wet crunchy look and like a natural yet frizz free curls.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a thick cream which I scrunch into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used on wet or dry however I personally believe works better on wet.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product daily and also order two as soon as one gets low.&lt;br /&gt;Cant live without it!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get very good instructions of how to use this, just says emulsify. Doesn&#x27;t tell how much water to how much creme to mix for best results. I guessed and it works, but better instructions would have been appreciated.</li>
            <li> I live in south florida the humidity capital. I have used this product for fifteen years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile and love it. I have curly hair and it keeps it neat, without being stiff and helps to control fizziness.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that helps keep my hair under control. Be sure to use a small amount each time though or your hair will look greasy and it will be a little hard to manage. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than I have ever found.</li>
