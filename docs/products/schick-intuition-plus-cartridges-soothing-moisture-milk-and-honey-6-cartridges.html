    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought whatever razor blades or razor is the best deal - EXCEPT disposables - these have never worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>Now, I just buy whatever intuition refill is the best price</li>
            <li>Excellent as always and great price!</li>
            <li>It works GREAT, and I don&#x27;t have to apply shave gel.  </li>
            <li>great sellers.</li>
            <li>These things were great.</li>
            <li>Subscribing to the refill razors is perfect and a much better value than any stores I&#x27;ve been too.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly moisturzing and smoothing, smells great (though Cucumber Melon is my favorite scent), and they glide effortlessly over my skin.  </li>
            <li>Since the Schick Intuition came out (2004 or so), I&#x27;ve been in love with it!  </li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>is a nice scent.</li>
            <li>They were sealed and arrived very quickly!  </li>
            <li>They kept me smooth, no hair bumps, they smell good and it&#x27;s easy to use in or out of water.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price on these in bulk - and the shave is plenty close, even on coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I love these razors.</li>
            <li>The razors have cute designs, and I love the scents the refills come in.    </li>
            <li>These razors never nick me and I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to buy shaving cream &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Well, the intuition is so much better</li>
            <li>Having the refills on-hand is just that much more convenient.</li>
            <li>My husband is thankful that I&#x27;ve found a way to keep my legs smooth again. :)</li>
            <li>They provide a close shave and leave my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Shaving my legs is sooooo easy, quick, and painless (I&#x27;ve NEVER nicked or cut myself while shaving with the Intuition).  </li>
            <li>As was explained to me in an email today they are out of the 4-blade heads (as pictured) and will be issuing me a return label and full refund.</li>
            <li>4 stars because they run out quickly,</li>
            <li>All I have to do is quickly swipe and rinse</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of the Intuition and Intuition Plus cartridges, but these are--by far--my favorite ones.  </li>
            <li>I think it shaves pretty close</li>
            <li>but my legs seem more dry and irritated.</li>
            <li>It saves so much time.</li>
            <li>The ONLY downside of these (which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but just FYI) is that they are kind of big and clunky, so it can sometimes be tricky to maneuver--especially around the knees.</li>
            <li>First of all the picture shows that they have 4 blades but the ones I received only have 3 blades.</li>
            <li>more room in my small shower.    </li>
            <li>Also these don&#x27;t work as well as the sensitive skin ones.</li>
            <li>A FYI these heads are NOT as pictured - they are the old 3-blade heads.</li>
            <li>You get a soft, close shave with the Intuition Plus Cartridges and the Milk &amp; Honey</li>
            <li>Make higher-quantity (bulk) packages available, reduce waste in form and packaging.</li>
            <li>I like the ease of Schick Intuition - just hop in the shower, no mess with creams or gels.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these razors/refills for a few years since I first saw them on the shelf.    </li>
            <li>No matter how quickly the blades get dull (every 4 shaves or so, depending)</li>

            <li> Have used these for a long time and can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> but i find that due to how close it shaves the hair grows back faster like by two days.  </li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s just never worth it to go back to the shaving cream and razor.  </li>
            <li> I shave every day or every other day and go through a refill every week.</li>
            <li> I spent $5 less buying them online.</li>
            <li> so that the soap wears down evenly.</li>
            <li> I shave my legs and underarms every day and these refills last me at least 3 weeks before showing the green part, at which point you&#x27;re supposed to replace them.  </li>
            <li> With the intuition, I can shave both legs in less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re shaped all wrong, so half the soap is unusable), and they&#x27;re wildly overpriced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrating to have to throw the thing out when it&#x27;s less than half gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love my intuition but the replacement razors are very expensive! !</li>
            <li> I always buy them on Amazon in order to save a few dollars!</li>
            <li> However, the price is at least $4 less than buying in stores; Amazon does it again!</li>
            <li> I have a very active toddler and not much time for silly things like showers and sleeping.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, and I don&#x27;t have any spare time to do it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used these razors for over 6 years now and they are the only ones I will use. They provide a close shave and leave my skin feeling smooth. The razor gives so that it works with angles on the body, avoiding cuts. I actually don&#x27;t think I have cut myself since using these razors. I shave every day or every other day and go through a refill every week.</li>
            <li> Previously I have used the sensitive skin intuition cartridges but I ordered these instead because they were cheaper. I&#x27;m not a fan. First of all the picture shows that they have 4 blades but the ones I received only have 3 blades. Also these don&#x27;t work as well as the sensitive skin ones. I don&#x27;t know if its just because of the blades or if its the moisturizer part but my legs seem more dry and irritated. I definitely won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried \\&quot;everything\\&quot; - Venus, gillettes, etc - and nothing ever compares to the ease of using intuition.  No matter how quickly the blades get dull (every 4 shaves or so, depending) - It&#x27;s just never worth it to go back to the shaving cream and razor.  Amazon has the best price on these in bulk - and the shave is plenty close, even on coarse hair.  4 stars because they run out quickly, but for everything else - 5++ stars!</li>
            <li> A FYI these heads are NOT as pictured - they are the old 3-blade heads. As was explained to me in an email today they are out of the 4-blade heads (as pictured) and will be issuing me a return label and full refund. If you are looking for the 4-blade heads then these are NOT for you!</li>
            <li> i have hAve used this product for about five years still like using it seems to work well and i dont seem to cut myself</li>
            <li> I love these razors. No shave gel or soap needed. It saves so much time. I have been a faithfull user of this product for seven years and will continue to use it. And the prices on amazon cannot be beat. At the store I could spend $18 on a 6 pack. I spent $5 less buying them online.</li>
            <li> I have been using these razors/refills for a few years since I first saw them on the shelf.    The razors have cute designs, and I love the scents the refills come in.    These razors never nick me and I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to buy shaving cream &#x3D; more room in my small shower.    The ONLY downside of these (which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but just FYI) is that they are kind of big and clunky, so it can sometimes be tricky to maneuver--especially around the knees.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of Schick Intuition - just hop in the shower, no mess with creams or gels.  You get a soft, close shave with the Intuition Plus Cartridges and the Milk &amp; Honey is a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Who knew shaving your legs could be such a spa-like experience?  Since the Schick Intuition came out (2004 or so), I&#x27;ve been in love with it!  Shaving my legs is sooooo easy, quick, and painless (I&#x27;ve NEVER nicked or cut myself while shaving with the Intuition).  I&#x27;ve used several of the Intuition and Intuition Plus cartridges, but these are--by far--my favorite ones.  They are incredibly moisturzing and smoothing, smells great (though Cucumber Melon is my favorite scent), and they glide effortlessly over my skin.  No missed hairs, whatsoever!  I shave my legs and underarms every day and these refills last me at least 3 weeks before showing the green part, at which point you&#x27;re supposed to replace them.  The frugal girl in me continues to use them for another week without replacing the cartridge, so I get a month out of each one.  However, the price is at least $4 less than buying in stores; Amazon does it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought whatever razor blades or razor is the best deal - EXCEPT disposables - these have never worked well for me.  Well, the intuition is so much better I&#x27;ll never consider a different razor again.  It saves so much time and mess!  I hate shaving, and I don&#x27;t have any spare time to do it.  With the intuition, I can shave both legs in less than a minute.  It works GREAT, and I don&#x27;t have to apply shave gel.  The blades last a LONG time.  Now, I just buy whatever intuition refill is the best price, I don&#x27;t care which scent or variety as long as it is the intuition.</li>
            <li> The razor has 4 blades to my surprise. I think it shaves pretty close and i have only used it twice but i find that due to how close it shaves the hair grows back faster like by two days.  So if you want a close shave i do recommend it but the hair may grow back.  The shave bar does lather and keep your skin.</li>
            <li> These were two for the price of one!!  Can&#x27;t beat that! They were sealed and arrived very quickly!  Love my intuition but the replacement razors are very expensive! !</li>
            <li> Have used these for a long time and can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore. Are they being discontinued in California? Love them!</li>
            <li> These are $$$$ at the store and I tend to not change the cartridge often and end up shaving with &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; there...at least with this price-cut I can be a bit more casual about putting a new blade in</li>
            <li> I loveeee this product! I have such dry skin and I always cut myself -- but not anymore. I would totally recommend this product and it was shipped promptly! great sellers.</li>
            <li> Considering what you pay for them in stores this was a steal!  I always buy them on Amazon in order to save a few dollars!</li>
            <li> Excellent as always and great price!</li>
            <li> I have been using intuition for 4+ years and will probably never go back to the regular blades + shaving cream. I am spoiled. Having the refills on-hand is just that much more convenient. Subscribing to the refill razors is perfect and a much better value than any stores I&#x27;ve been too. I prefer this scent over the others (I&#x27;m talking to you, watermelon!).</li>
            <li> This takes put the extra step of shaving cream so it shaves-ha-time of the morning rush. This I&#x27;d why I subscribe and save; another no brainer!</li>
            <li> Boy! These things were great. They kept me smooth, no hair bumps, they smell good and it&#x27;s easy to use in or out of water.</li>
            <li> I have a very active toddler and not much time for silly things like showers and sleeping. These are a lifesaver. All I have to do is quickly swipe and rinse and I&#x27;m done.  My husband is thankful that I&#x27;ve found a way to keep my legs smooth again. :)</li>
            <li> These things work well, but they&#x27;re wasteful (they&#x27;re shaped all wrong, so half the soap is unusable), and they&#x27;re wildly overpriced. As soon as I find a substitute, I&#x27;ll dump these things and never look back.&lt;br /&gt;If they want to cultivate some loyalty, they can:&lt;br /&gt;  -Change the angle so that the soap wears down evenly. It&#x27;s frustrating to have to throw the thing out when it&#x27;s less than half gone.&lt;br /&gt;  -Reduce the packaging. It&#x27;s wasteful, and it&#x27;s driving up the already-too-high price.&lt;br /&gt;  -Reconsider price point. Make higher-quantity (bulk) packages available, reduce waste in form and packaging.</li>
            <li> the only stuff i shave with.</li>
