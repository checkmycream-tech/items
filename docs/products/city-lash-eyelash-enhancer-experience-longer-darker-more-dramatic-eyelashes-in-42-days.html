            <li>/&gt;Finally, a company that understands that women of all ages want to live their BEST life and that means looking our best in every way!</li>
            <li>good stuff</li>
            <li>It is a good product and just needs the instructions followed.</li>
            <li>and I was kind of hesitant in making the purchase, but I believe it was really a great investment.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>maybe something good will happen.</li>

            <li>This works good for eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll see good result again.</li>
            <li>I wash off my makeup with good quality soap before bed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price, too.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>But I have found that it has brought about a surprising regrowth of my eyebrows, with  which</li>
            <li>But I have found that it has brought about a surprising regrowth of my eyebrows, with  which</li>
            <li>Not 42 days into use, but seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promptly and in good shape.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t feel good.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li>helped alittle but not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I LOVED them for about a month.</li>
            <li>the product cam prove its claims, more beautiful eyelashes,</li>
            <li>I want to put my best foot forward which includes making sure I am confident in my looks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with City Lash and City Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>There are no chemicals and no additives, thus it is very safe to use.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is not for everyone, but I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li>so happy with this product:)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>of the issues I had with the product (worth putting up with for the awesome result of eyelash growth)</li>
            <li>and I am sure you will love it as I do!!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Women love to look nice!</li>
            <li>I love City Lash!  </li>
            <li>So glad I did!</li>
            <li>I have to say the results have been pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>Love this for my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I started with RaidLash a couple of years ago and got amazing results.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing , been using it for about one month and can already tell a difference on my lashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I used to have amazing eyelashes that everyone commented on</li>
            <li>I switched to Latisse and got amazing results.</li>
            <li>It has been 2 weeks, and I already see an amazing result.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I purchased this because Amazon no longer carries Li lash which worked amazing.</li>
            <li>I also greatly appreciate that this is a cruelty free brand.</li>
            <li>It seems to be as good or better than Rapid Lash.  </li>
            <li>City Lash might aptly be called Lash</li>
            <li>The best part is, this is REAL mascara</li>
            <li>I use Refresh eye ointment or drops, and the eyes and lashes remain nice and moisturized all night.  </li>
            <li>guess I will never know how effective it could be.</li>
            <li>The best part is, that while the product is pricey, it worked even better than a prescription I once used, so it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to super pricy eyelash extensions that can cost anywhere up to $400.</li>
            <li>so it was very easy for me to see the difference.</li>
            <li>and I feel so much more confident leaving the house without any makeup on!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and even more pleased with the price.</li>
            <li>Mine are some thicker and longer, but are still very fine.  </li>
            <li>This line of products is amazing, great thought has gone in to what people really need and what truly works.</li>
            <li>I have had great success, though not all will, and does in fact have the most, and correct required compound to cause lash growth.</li>
            <li>This product received great reviews and I was willing to try it in order to see if it lived up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>Keeping in mind that I do not use mascara, it was surprising to see how full they got</li>
            <li>it seemed to good to be true</li>
            <li>but my lashes are very light.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, easy application…</li>
            <li>/&gt;received quickly and in good condition....</li>
            <li>It gave a very logical analysis of why this is a superior product.</li>
            <li>I have been using City Lash for almost a year, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad he knew what was best!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find Li Lash to be better.</li>
            <li>most of the time-</li>
            <li>I went on the hunt and came across the consumer guide&#x27;s  top pick for lash growth CITY Lash</li>
            <li>but more to my satisfaction</li>
            <li>They are not noticeably longer yet but there are more of them.  </li>
            <li>When this runs out I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li>+ and noticing with age the beginning signs of thinning hair and eyelashes, among many things</li>
            <li>If you hunt around the internet, the forums, the beauty boards, you&#x27;ll find more stories like mine.</li>
            <li>Like others, I was able to procure a package deal thru consumer reports @ $49.99 per tube.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still notable.    </li>
            <li>I have uses Larissa many times and never had the discomfort I had with this..</li>
            <li>Below is most of my letter to the site&#x27;s email contact.</li>
            <li>postage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li>The extension of this product on my lashes was phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I believe they think you won&#x27;t be able to see the eyeliner they added to make it look like model&#x27;s eyelashes are fuller.  </li>
            <li>The difference, however, is that many of them admit their deception,...</li>
            <li>Most days I don&#x27;t get any in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I think it helps the lengths a bit too, but mostly it keeps your lashes from falling out and staying in longer, giving you a fuller look.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did end up buying this item.</li>
            <li>Also, I love how my lashes look while wearing City Lash.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I started with City Lash.</li>
            <li>After searching Google for a better mascara, I came across City Lash.</li>
            <li>so you can just use it as your every day mascara, while it does it&#x27;s magic and helps your eye lashes grow.</li>
            <li>They are also darker and have more volume.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the longer I use it the better the results.</li>
            <li>This product make her eye more sexier.</li>
            <li>It makes it darker and longer for the eyelash which make her eye more appealing.</li>
            <li>40 days or more.</li>
            <li>Rivitalash works much better  </li>
            <li>I found a beutedeparis product that was much better</li>
            <li>City Lash was on the top</li>
            <li>my lashes feel so much more substantive.</li>
            <li>I still have 2 more weeks to go for the growing cycle, however.</li>
            <li>but I still had hope that with more time I would see an improvement</li>
            <li>WHY I LOVE CITY LASH</li>
            <li>LOVE CITY LASH</li>
            <li>Better results than with LiLash.</li>
            <li>and it was okay.  </li>
            <li>Where do I begin, I love my products.</li>
            <li>I can wear my contacts and it just is more flexible than Latisse in use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using city lash for more than 40 days now.</li>
            <li>So my eyelashes are even sparser than most people’s, and I have tried many, many products to aid in their growth.  </li>
            <li>So my eyelashes are even sparser than most people’s, and I have tried many, many products to aid in their growth.  </li>
            <li>and it is one of the most potent ingredients ever to support eyelash growth.</li>
            <li>I have tried Revitalash and had success with that, but thought it was a good idea to check out the competition.  </li>
            <li>tips...be sure to NOT get any into your eye..</li>
            <li>I did not think it burned or irritated any more than Latisse (which did not work for me, but it does work for some women I know.)</li>
            <li>Just buy Revitalash, as that stuff works like magic.  </li>
            <li>I think it should have shown more results by now.  </li>
            <li>I will give it more time</li>
            <li>I started doing more research on reviews from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Now my friends as envious as my look so healthy.  </li>
            <li>It did what it said it was going to do, and it was much more affordable than the comparably-effective competitors.</li>
            <li>I will give this more time to see what happens.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because most of my eyebrows are gone.  </li>
            <li>and I there seems to be more of them too.</li>
            <li>I am going to give this more time</li>
            <li>My lashes looked phenomenal.</li>
            <li>But over the long-haul your lashes will look better and better and better.</li>
            <li>Neither top or bottom lashes appears darker.  </li>
            <li>Really think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>but I will continue to buy it as I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>then tried it on my eye brows and magic</li>
            <li>/&gt;so far so good!  </li>
            <li>If I use City Lash faithfully I have plenty of long, wonderful lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of prescription products on the market, and it still delivers pretty good results.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good lash enhancer</li>
            <li>Consumer reports studied eyelash enhancers (look on their site) and did ultimately rate this as the best, but they do list the top three and give detailed information about each.</li>
            <li>The length of my lashes were significantly longer!</li>
            <li>I also love how easy it is to use, and if you have sparse eyebrow hairs, City Lash also works well on them too.</li>
            <li>, I did notice that my lashes had filled out more and were noticeably thicker.  </li>
            <li>If you want fuller lashes, this product is ok, if are primarily looking for length, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>You also have to be vigilant to make sure it does not get in the eye as it will permanently discolor the whites and the iris of light colored eyes.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it has been wonderful!</li>
            <li>easy to apply</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t have to wait until bedtime to put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take but a minute to do both eyes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>...keep using the product your lashes look great!&amp;#34;  Easy to use and no itching or redness</li>
            <li>I \\&quot;prep\\&quot; my lids with a nice hot washcloth compress for a minute before applying City Lash.  </li>
            <li>I also missed the fine print about getting a refund before 60 days, so it&#x27;s my fault</li>
            <li>Considering I have very sensitive eyes, I was delighted in suffering no irritation or allergy to the product.</li>
            <li>Eyelash enhancers, which are becoming very popular, they state, have been proven in numerous studies to increase your lash line by up to 70%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>free to send extras.....</li>
            <li>City Lash is a fabulous lash enhancer.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy cheap eye lash products again.</li>
            <li>WHICH IS A FABULOUS ENHANCER TO MY FACE.  </li>
            <li>City Lash is a fantastic method to volumize eye lashes and give them glamour that reminds us all of the stars of yesteryear.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a matter of what&#x27;s important to you.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t work for me--actually I wasn&#x27;t able to give it a good try because it caused such a severe burning sensation that I had to try to rinse it off immediately.</li>
            <li>I should have realized that it as a scam when the pop up insisting that I buy more of the product right away before the  offer ended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results I&#x27;ve gotten even with admittedly sporadic use, and hope the appearance of my lashes will improve even more if I manage to remember to apply twice daily as recommended.</li>
            <li>I LOVE city lash and will continue to enjoy it into my mature years to light up the Light in my eyes!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>When City Lash came in, she was excited and started using it immediately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited until I saw the price.</li>
            <li>I then used it every morning after 6 weeks I compared with the original pictures and found no difference</li>
            <li>and there is a SIGNIFICANT difference in the length and fullness of my brows and eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it really works!</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased and</li>
            <li>Packaging was adequate &amp; fine for product.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with black lashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li>I have been using this product, consistently (every night) for 3 months and have noticed that my eye lashes appear more full.  </li>
            <li>I may be sensitive to it, but I did not experience the burning sensation with Li lash and got amazing results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the time limit is for a refund; it just says, . . .\\&quot;full</li>
            <li>I can still return for a full refund, where do I send it and to whose attention?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: When I wrote customer service, I was promptly given a polite letter with a RMA# (return merchandise authorization number) and the full amount of $129.99 was credited to my PayPal account, where I am awaiting transfer to my checking account; so then, my out-of pocket expense was just $3.99 return</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that will be true for everyone.  </li>
            <li>My lashes do not fall as often any more, so the life cycle is a lot longer now, and because of that the lash line became much fuller.</li>
            <li>I particularly liked using City Lash because it of its all natural approach and its organic means of stimulating eye lash growth.</li>
            <li>the last part of week #3 and the liquid actually succeeds in making</li>
            <li>The company was good about taking back the product and refunding the money.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to wait 6 wks or more to see the real results.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product, but I don&#x27;t think I see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and that&#x27;s that.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried City Lash and bought two tubs because of the great price and fake good reviews online.</li>
            <li>In A Flash because in a flash is how quickly I saw improvement, on both my lashes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are noticeably fuller, longer, and only look even better with mascara on top.</li>
            <li>Congrats to the lucky ones who got results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eyelash enhancer for anyone looking to get thicker lashes - it worked even better for me than Latisse did.</li>
            <li>I must admit, that I did not notice a difference until I started using the product daily and am now very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>previously used Lilash with great results.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in trying this, note that the photos are REALLY tiny, and for good reason.  </li>
            <li>I should have stuck with my tried and true RapidLash which give me beautiful long and lush lashes.</li>
            <li>This works very well!!</li>
            <li>and I am happy with my results and have purchased a second City Lash to maintain my new lashes...</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it, I signed up for their e-mail notification on the website, and as a first time customer they give you a huge discount,  </li>
            <li>I really like the City Lash because it made my lashes longer and filled in the gaps which made it look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but my lashes did not grow $70 worth of length.</li>
            <li>Some of my friends recently commented on how nice my eye lashes look.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I decided to give up the fake lashes and use City Lash to nurture my grow my own.</li>
            <li>I am waiting to give this review an honest review after finishing the entire tube.  </li>
            <li>I figured let me try a different kind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read the reviews that said this product doesn&#x27;t work, but also read the ones that were complimentary.  </li>
            <li>Worth a</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to be patient, in the end it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>And their service is quick and consistent.  </li>
            <li>I use the City Lash Enhancer when I want more of a dramatic look and I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>If you have been to sparse lashes it will probably increase it some but nothing to a full set of full lashes let&#x27;s be realistic here people.     </li>
            <li>you might not see results right away</li>
            <li>I also purchased City Lips for my daughter and would have to say that this company is doing something right.</li>
            <li>and it has kept my right eyelashes</li>
            <li>have tried many of the products you can buy from the major cosmetic retailers to lengthen lashes - from serums to mascaras.  </li>
            <li>Before you apply make sure you take the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; off the tip of the wand, it will run into your eyes if not careful.</li>
            <li>The only thing is it has made my eye lid red at times and if you stops using it your eyelashes do go back to their original state.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are really OK but who couldn&#x27;t use a little more length and thickness?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I used it mostly first thing in the morning and also at night right before bedtime.  </li>
            <li>At the ripe old age of 68, I still want to look as good as I possibly can.</li>
            <li>The applicator is so easy to use no wasted product.</li>
            <li>I already had nice long lashes from using Latisse but thought a  friendlier product that could do the same would be better.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many friends and a few have purchased it so far and they are definitely pleased!</li>
            <li>and he preferred I try this product first.  </li>
            <li>had to be patient as I saw no change in the first 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone willing to listen ;-)  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I did not see a date on this package as with my first package.  </li>
            <li>, i love it , it gave me my lashes back, and it makes me feel</li>
            <li>I started using City Lash Eyelash Enhancer about a month ago, and started seeing noticeable improvement within the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are definitely thicker, longer, and more supple.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this rated higher than the Marini product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>the product cost me $49.99  the first time.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely pleased with the results and encourage to try and see how it works.</li>
            <li>This product is reasonably priced and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I think they are about the same respectable length as when I was using Latisse.</li>
            <li>I noticed more lashes after the second week of use.  </li>
            <li>After the first time of rubbing my eyes</li>
            <li>It is pretty pricey</li>
            <li>I have never reviewed a product before, but am compelled to do so here because of the stellar results using City Lash.</li>
            <li>They are VERY visible (yeah!)</li>
            <li>It works for me...and the results were fast!</li>
            <li>I had lost a lot of lashes and had some bald spots and brittle lashes but after using City Lash for only a week they&#x27;re SOOOO much better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so much happier now!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after my first week of use.</li>
            <li>The first week I used it</li>
            <li>Most of them I used for several months and saw no noticeable change in my lashes, but City Lash works, and noticeably works.</li>
            <li>The first day i tried it, My eye and surrounding lids burned.</li>
            <li>I saw that many people had similar problems with City Lash.</li>
            <li>I first tried another lash product called RapidLash which did not seem to work.  </li>
            <li>I started using the City Lash serum exactly four weeks ago</li>
            <li>The only one I have been able to find that compares to the results i got from Latisse is City Lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise not to waste your money on this product, but buy a good quality, lengthening mascara instead.</li>
            <li>manufacturers further claim that, unlike other lash-enhancing products, CityLash is safe, even for the most sensitive skin and eyes, is natural and fragrance free, can be safely used on eyebrows as well, and, like all CITY Cosmetics, is not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>, I am still using the original applicator, so the price, spread over 5 months so far, is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Most products are geared for younger women but the reviews I read for City Lash Eyelash Enhancer were positive and testimonies raved at the benefits for all.</li>
            <li>Its makers claim that its unique proprietary formula will stimulate eyelash growth and extend the natural life cycle of the lash.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this did more damage over the years than good.</li>
            <li>Because using it the amount of time they say to be successful, you use a lot of the product and when it doesn&#x27;t work, they only refund you $20.00 with the excuse that it can&#x27;t be re sold!  </li>
            <li>I think some people are just not going to have any positive response to these products.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear mascara too often, but when I do my lashes look long and lovely.</li>
            <li>Though the product is suppose to give thicker eye lashes in 45 days, it doesn&#x27;t because you will not be able to wear it that long.  </li>
            <li>Not Bollywood long, but definitely more than nature gave me.</li>
            <li>I did not notice much length until just now which is about 5 weeks of consistently using.</li>
            <li>, well, the old adage is true.....</li>
            <li>Not sure why this has gotten any good reviews.</li>
            <li>City Lash is an excellent product for anyone who LOVES thick, long lashes and hates the hassle of eyelash extensions or glue-on faux lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both Rapid Lash and Smart Lash before City Lash and saw results in about 7 days with those products.</li>
            <li>seems fine but only used for 3 days so</li>
            <li>it DOES help older thinning lashes!</li>
            <li>(I have little baby eyeslashes, and pray for gorgeous long full beauties).  </li>
            <li>Lashes are much longer now than they used to be</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it worked</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much growth.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes were growing in much thicker and longer with both products.</li>
            <li>within 2 weeks my eyelashes were longer than I have ever seen them (I lost a lot of my lashes when I was smoking and since then, they would fall out and were very short).&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>It made my eyes water so much, I could not even keep my eye make-up on.  </li>
            <li>Oh yeah, it really irritates my eyes also.</li>
            <li>It was very east to use</li>
            <li>but my patience has really paid off.</li>
            <li>I used City Lash twice and it resulted in days of redness, burning, and intense itching.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much change in color</li>
            <li>One must realize that if ones lashes are already on the sparse side this lash enhancer will only work with what is available.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a shot, it works really fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks to City Lash</li>
            <li>It took a while, but at the 3 month mark I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a fuller, longer lash!</li>
            <li>Because it really works.  </li>
            <li>The competitors product works very well land</li>
            <li>Really gave me longer thicker lashes after about a month.</li>
            <li>They warn you and it&#x27;s for real.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>It does burn a bit if you poke your eye, but no worse than shampoo - and blinks away immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get a whole brushful of liquid at one time.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t happened as fast as some people said</li>
            <li>The product is gentle.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the lash enhancers available without prescription, and I used Latisse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, I highly recommend City Lash!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s because I put too much on my eyelid and it ran into my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement.  </li>
            <li>Nothing has ever worked this fast for me.  </li>
            <li>I read some reviews and City lash was rated very well, and compared to Latisse.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a change in my lashes</li>
            <li>nothing really can drastically alter the type of eyelashes that you are born with.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really lengthen lashes as much as I had thought.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The thing is, it was way way way way too much money.  </li>
            <li>I already have light facial hair on my face</li>
            <li>This really grew my lashes</li>
            <li>This really works I&#x27;ve seen a difference</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work on my very sparse lashes.</li>
            <li>Give City Lash a fair try of at least a month</li>
            <li>My lashes are now back, but even better they are full and long.</li>
            <li>try.irm a few months ago, when I discovered their eye cream and liked its results.  </li>
            <li>It didnt give me the wow factor of Latisse, but it was enough for me to be satisfied.</li>
            <li>When new ones grow in they are 1/3 + longer and thicker, but you MUST complete a full cycle.</li>
            <li>Since I was satisfied with other products from City Cosmetics, I decided to try this product because they are claiming that it works on eyebrows too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other lash lengtheners before and had okay results</li>
            <li>Within 3 months my lashes and eyebrows were back to the original short/thin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t work for the company and have used a couple of their other products that I am also pleased with.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used City Lash for the past 2 years and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>I suspect the same is true for this product--I am going to give it a try and see what I come with.....</li>
            <li>The makers state that this ingredient has been proven through many clinical trials to get results - with the average being 54% and the highest at 72% increase in lash line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I became acquainted with this firm a few months ago, when I discovered their eye cream and liked its results.  </li>
            <li>It does sting and makes my eyes red, thus the 4 stars, but not bad or for long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very nervous about using this product as I had tried so many others and had little results for my eyelashes that now had basically bald spots from stress</li>
            <li>I have noticed new hairs coming in on my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>I have seen more bad reviews than good on this site.</li>
            <li>I continued to use this product for 1 more month twice daily, 7 days a week with no further results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only using for 30 days s of now but most likely buy again.</li>
            <li>At my last checkup, my optometrist told me he didn&#x27;t think it was safe to use Latisse unless I had my eye pressure checked regularly.</li>
            <li>I wanted this product because it has a higher concentration of the important ingredients, without the danger of making dark flecks on my irises.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are so much fuller, longer, and lush!</li>
            <li>Those bare spots and thin parts are looking better and better.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>This product had high ratings, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try City Lash if you want to grow your lash and brows in a hurry, with no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend product for females.</li>
            <li>CityLash reviews were high, which is why I purchased this brand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend City Lash if you want \\&quot;Latisse like\\&quot; results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have some eyebrow problems due to an autoimmune disease and while I don&#x27;t have my full eyebrows back, they are presentable and easy to fill in with dark eye shadow (looks more natural than pencil.)</li>
            <li>My lashes aren&#x27;t quite the way they were before, but they certainly don&#x27;t need mascara, which pleases this busy mama.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CityLash is more expensive than many other available eyelash enhancers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;CityLash is more expensive than many other available eyelash enhancers.  </li>
            <li>Getting older and having a chronic disease, this product gave me a new lease on life.</li>
            <li>I started using City Lash in February, and though the results were slow in coming, by the second month there was a huge difference, and even more so now, in July.</li>
            <li>My lashes are longer and fuller than they were when I was young, but not in a &#x27;too much&#x27; way.</li>
            <li>City Lash improved the thickness and length of my lashes so much that it completely eliminated the need for mascara.</li>
            <li>I grew a few more lashes</li>
            <li>Mine has NEVER burned, although my eyelids seems a wee bit irritated for maybe 2 days and all is normal now.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the inconvenience because having my brows and lashes fuller is making me look younger.</li>
            <li>and I emailed customer service asking if this is a normal reaction.</li>
            <li>Length and darker color with this clear last product that does take about 2 or 3 months for full affect.</li>
            <li>After using it morning and night for 5 weeks I have long full lashes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply to the upper lash line twice daily, and I was able to see faster lash growth in a spot where I&#x27;d just pulled out a few lashes with a curler.  </li>
            <li>I wasn’t actually concerned, and, if it can do that, it must be helping my lashes, right?  </li>
            <li>I wasn’t actually concerned, and, if it can do that, it must be helping my lashes, right?  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product</li>
            <li>The main reason City Lash is so effective is because they have this listed as the 3rd ingredient on it&#x27;s list - Meaning they are one of the few that use the required amount studies show works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, many so-called eyelash enhancers can’t actually do the job: they are formulated mainly with inexpensive mineral oil, whereas CityLash uses Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 as its main active ingredient.</li>
            <li>This product brings a new meaning to the zombie movie title, &amp;#34;48-day later.&amp;#34; Unless you&#x27;re into torture, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>with any new product you should do a patch test to see if you have a reaction to any of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>have a job now that requires me to meet new people each and every day.</li>
            <li>Matisse gives you a new applicator for each eye and for each night that it is used.</li>
            <li>New growth in areas that hadn&#x27;t had brows in years.</li>
            <li>but I was told this was NEW</li>
            <li>It did work for me as I saw a decrease in lash breakage and new lashes looked a bit healthier/</li>
            <li>I used it for 4 weeks and almost no added growth to my missing eye lashes, at all; even left on their own</li>
            <li>They key is to use City Lash daily and consistently!!  </li>
            <li>I have only been using City Lashes for a few weeks, so will see after a couple more months what I really think.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve tried other lash enhancers, and although this product is expensive, it seems to me to be the best.  </li>
            <li>Although, I never spent much on something for eye lashes</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li>Waiting to see because I know the natural cycle of lashes to regrow under normal conditions (w/o enhancements) is not overnight.</li>
            <li>and I look exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use liner anymore because my lashes are so lush!</li>
            <li>So last year on my birthday I treated myself to my first set of eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After applying this formula 2 times a day for 52 days (8 full weeks), I see absolutely no discernible difference in the length or thickness of my lashes or eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I cannot seem to write a live, user review on your website, the one I bought from, but I will be letting others know that it worked 000.00% as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>She also mentioned that she had to switch mascaras to accommodate her new, natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used City Lash on it and it now is as full as the other one.  </li>
            <li>if this product actually did what all their WORDS say, the photograph would be large AND look like NATURAL lashes, all WITHOUT the phony enhancement of eyeliner!&lt;br</li>
            <li>am one of those people who has a hard time wearing mascara and eye makeup because I am constantly touching my eyes and smudging everything.</li>
            <li>If I stay calm the effects will be minimal.  </li>
            <li>As for the people who said that City Lash caused intense burning, they must have extra sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Seems to be growing my lashes though they are thing  so far.</li>
            <li>So the free shipping they hype is not really free after all if you don&#x27;t like their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s matter of decency, and ethical business practices to not make a customer PAY FURTHER to get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far my lashes are no longer, or thicker</li>
            <li>So far, nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a highly sensitive person and often have reactions to things that others don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Knowing that the product is all natural helps.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the product directly from City Lash and have been using it for over three months.  </li>
            <li>actually grew much longer</li>
            <li>Also, you can at times get this product off of the actually city cosmetics website much cheaper.</li>
            <li>And they keep e-mailing me all kinds of offers for their products now.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m to old</li>
            <li>At least they are better</li>
            <li>Sensitive buyers beware.  </li>
            <li>So far I have noticed the length of my lashes improving</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>CityLash, is the only eyelash product that I have tried that really works.</li>
            <li>the video and BE PATIENT please.&lt;br /&gt;61 years old</li>
            <li>I have to be very cautious when applying it because it does make my eyes red and burn.</li>
            <li>They add that CityLash is one of the few commercially available products that uses this ingredient in the concentration required to work.  </li>
            <li>would rather spend a few more dollars and go back to my old faithfull Revitalash.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from a link on the Consumer Reports website that comes directly from City Lash for $49.99.</li>
            <li>I will never put it anywhere near my eyes again</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and use this product on both lashes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Its been 4 weeks and so far there is no change.</li>
            <li>Of course, being a girl, I just fixed the problem by applying a ton of mascara.</li>
            <li>Then I got old and they went the way of everything else.</li>
            <li>and so far have had no issues.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t give QUITE the POW of a set of professional extensions.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I just wish I had known earlier about the trouble so many people have had with this product.</li>
            <li>within 2 weeks my right eyebrow was similar to the left one.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Regular mascara never did enough for me -- especially not for special occasions.</li>
            <li>For those times when I do, the fabulous results from this product are well worth the slight inconvenience of a little sting and redness.  </li>
            <li>I have in the past used other similar products, such as Latisse, with great results.</li>
            <li>Well, the first container worked well, then I took a short break while ordering and receiving my second container.  </li>
            <li>eyes werre more sensitive to this product than &amp;#34;L&#x27;il Lash&amp;#34;, but no long term negative side effects.</li>
            <li>my sister and I used RapidLash several years ago and had new eyelashes sprouting in every direction from the first tube, but tried a second tube and did not see the same results.</li>
            <li>Now, they&#x27;re not lush at all, which made me sad.&lt;br /&gt;Since I enjoy other City products, I decided to try their eyelash enhancer.</li>
            <li>I went a little too much in the middle of my right one</li>
            <li>Even though I use it daily, I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth in my eye lashes but there is some in my eyebrow area.  </li>
            <li>and I really started to notice a big difference in the last 1-2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only my second day and on both eyes I can tell that my lashes are much fuller and longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past, and there was a significant change, so</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s even hard for me to apply mascara in the first place but after using this product for about five weeks or so, I am noticing a pretty big difference.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and my lashes and brows were definitely thinning.  </li>
            <li>and I had a noticeable bare patch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh, and, by-the-way, it&#x27;s all natural and comes with a 60-day money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>My only warning so far</li>
            <li>Bought this for thinning eyelashes (65 yr old female) who had noticed some stunting in the growth.  </li>
            <li>Will go back to my old one.</li>
            <li>I barely saw a difference Waited for 3 months.</li>
            <li>So far I have had no side effects and my lashes are maintained at the same length and  thickness as Latisse had.</li>
            <li>shorter, and the inner corner of one eye had completely lost all its lashes.</li>
            <li>average being 54% and the highest at 72% increase in lash line&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I have not experienced any burning or redness, I&#x27;ve been able to wear makeup over the City Lash without a problem, and there haven&#x27;t been any issues with my contacts.  </li>
            <li>I decided that at the end of the day, as much money as I spent on going to a stylists to apply fake lashes, I would rather spend on a product to boost my own.</li>
            <li>I had lost most of my lashes and was wearing false lashes when I had to socialize.  </li>
            <li>but they insisted I need to use it more still nothing don&#x27;t waste your money buying this and your time waiting to see EVEN A LITTLE difference...</li>
            <li>I am so excited, with a thick coat of mascara</li>
            <li>However, after two weeks of nightly use, they are longer and more dramatic.  </li>
            <li>City Lash by City Cosmetics is a non-prescription eyelash enhancer that promises longer, darker, more dramatic eyelashes in 42 days.  </li>
            <li>A coworker started on Latisse at the same time that I started with City Lash and so far my lashes are progressing equally with hers.  </li>
            <li>It is too early on for me to see the total effects as I have only been using the product for 3 weeks, but there is a noticable difference in the length of the lashes.</li>
            <li>As a natural blonde with white eyelashes, I didn&#x27;t expect my lashes to get darker, and they haven&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Some of those products did seem to be mainly mineral oil, or petroleum jelly, and, while inexpensive, were not very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Some of those products did seem to be mainly mineral oil, or petroleum jelly, and, while inexpensive, were not very helpful.  </li>
            <li>My tip: Use everyday for 3 weeks, then every other day for 3-4 until your full growth cycle is complete.</li>
            <li>I have used other products that promise the moon but simply do not deliver like Latisse, Smart Lash, Revitalash.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and not one single problem.</li>
            <li>I noticed a lot of new short lashes growing in and now they&#x27;re almost as long as the rest.</li>
            <li>and I have not only noticed that my lashes have stopped falling out (almost immediately after I began using this product), but my once barely there eyelashes are now thicker and fuller AND longer.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it clever, how in the remarkably tiny photos, all the ladies grew a fine line of eyeliner to indicate questionable eyelash growth?  </li>
            <li>My lashes are slightly fuller but definitely much much longer.</li>
            <li>It just means that your lashes might not be receptive to its active main ingredient (Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17).</li>
            <li>much prefer my naturally thick lashes to normal mascara now.  </li>
            <li>It stings a little bit if I get too much on</li>
            <li>and I would occasionally have a &amp;#34;space.&amp;#34; I used City Lash for a little over 3 weeks and noticed the lashes were filling in and grew to be much longer.</li>
            <li>-I have read the reviews, good and bad..</li>

            <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel good.  </li>
            <li> I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> helped alittle but not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I LOVED them for about a month.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> of the issues I had with the product (worth putting up with for the awesome result of eyelash growth)</li>
            <li> and I am sure you will love it as I do!!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Women love to look nice!</li>
            <li> I love City Lash!  </li>
            <li> So glad I did!</li>
            <li> I have to say the results have been pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> Love this for my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I started with RaidLash a couple of years ago and got amazing results.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing , been using it for about one month and can already tell a difference on my lashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I used to have amazing eyelashes that everyone commented on</li>
            <li> I switched to Latisse and got amazing results.</li>
            <li> It has been 2 weeks, and I already see an amazing result.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I purchased this because Amazon no longer carries Li lash which worked amazing.</li>
            <li> I also greatly appreciate that this is a cruelty free brand.</li>
            <li> It seems to be as good or better than Rapid Lash.  </li>
            <li> City Lash might aptly be called Lash</li>
            <li> The best part is, this is REAL mascara</li>
            <li> I use Refresh eye ointment or drops, and the eyes and lashes remain nice and moisturized all night.  </li>
            <li> guess I will never know how effective it could be.</li>
            <li> The best part is, that while the product is pricey, it worked even better than a prescription I once used, so it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to super pricy eyelash extensions that can cost anywhere up to $400.</li>
            <li> so it was very easy for me to see the difference.</li>
            <li> and I feel so much more confident leaving the house without any makeup on!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and even more pleased with the price.</li>
            <li> Mine are some thicker and longer, but are still very fine.  </li>
            <li> This line of products is amazing, great thought has gone in to what people really need and what truly works.</li>
            <li> I have had great success, though not all will, and does in fact have the most, and correct required compound to cause lash growth.</li>
            <li> This product received great reviews and I was willing to try it in order to see if it lived up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> Keeping in mind that I do not use mascara, it was surprising to see how full they got</li>
            <li> it seemed to good to be true</li>
            <li> but my lashes are very light.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, easy application…</li>
            <li> /&gt;received quickly and in good condition....</li>
            <li> It gave a very logical analysis of why this is a superior product.</li>
            <li> I have been using City Lash for almost a year, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad he knew what was best!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find Li Lash to be better.</li>
            <li> most of the time-</li>
            <li> I went on the hunt and came across the consumer guide&#x27;s  top pick for lash growth CITY Lash</li>
            <li> but more to my satisfaction</li>
            <li> They are not noticeably longer yet but there are more of them.  </li>
            <li> When this runs out I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li> + and noticing with age the beginning signs of thinning hair and eyelashes, among many things</li>
            <li> If you hunt around the internet, the forums, the beauty boards, you&#x27;ll find more stories like mine.</li>
            <li> Like others, I was able to procure a package deal thru consumer reports @ $49.99 per tube.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still notable.    </li>
            <li> I have uses Larissa many times and never had the discomfort I had with this..</li>
            <li> Below is most of my letter to the site&#x27;s email contact.</li>
            <li> postage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> The extension of this product on my lashes was phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I believe they think you won&#x27;t be able to see the eyeliner they added to make it look like model&#x27;s eyelashes are fuller.  </li>
            <li> The difference, however, is that many of them admit their deception,...</li>
            <li> Most days I don&#x27;t get any in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I think it helps the lengths a bit too, but mostly it keeps your lashes from falling out and staying in longer, giving you a fuller look.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did end up buying this item.</li>
            <li> Also, I love how my lashes look while wearing City Lash.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I started with City Lash.</li>
            <li> After searching Google for a better mascara, I came across City Lash.</li>
            <li> so you can just use it as your every day mascara, while it does it&#x27;s magic and helps your eye lashes grow.</li>
            <li> They are also darker and have more volume.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the longer I use it the better the results.</li>
            <li> This product make her eye more sexier.</li>
            <li> It makes it darker and longer for the eyelash which make her eye more appealing.</li>
            <li> 40 days or more.</li>
            <li> Rivitalash works much better  </li>
            <li> I found a beutedeparis product that was much better</li>
            <li> City Lash was on the top</li>
            <li> my lashes feel so much more substantive.</li>
            <li> I still have 2 more weeks to go for the growing cycle, however.</li>
            <li> but I still had hope that with more time I would see an improvement</li>
            <li> WHY I LOVE CITY LASH</li>
            <li> LOVE CITY LASH</li>
            <li> Better results than with LiLash.</li>
            <li> and it was okay.  </li>
            <li> Where do I begin, I love my products.</li>
            <li> I can wear my contacts and it just is more flexible than Latisse in use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using city lash for more than 40 days now.</li>
            <li> So my eyelashes are even sparser than most people’s, and I have tried many, many products to aid in their growth.  </li>
            <li> So my eyelashes are even sparser than most people’s, and I have tried many, many products to aid in their growth.  </li>
            <li> and it is one of the most potent ingredients ever to support eyelash growth.</li>
            <li> I have tried Revitalash and had success with that, but thought it was a good idea to check out the competition.  </li>
            <li> tips...be sure to NOT get any into your eye..</li>
            <li> I did not think it burned or irritated any more than Latisse (which did not work for me, but it does work for some women I know.)</li>
            <li> Just buy Revitalash, as that stuff works like magic.  </li>
            <li> I think it should have shown more results by now.  </li>
            <li> I will give it more time</li>
            <li> I started doing more research on reviews from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Now my friends as envious as my look so healthy.  </li>
            <li> It did what it said it was going to do, and it was much more affordable than the comparably-effective competitors.</li>
            <li> I will give this more time to see what happens.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because most of my eyebrows are gone.  </li>
            <li> and I there seems to be more of them too.</li>
            <li> I am going to give this more time</li>
            <li> My lashes looked phenomenal.</li>
            <li> But over the long-haul your lashes will look better and better and better.</li>
            <li> Neither top or bottom lashes appears darker.  </li>
            <li> Really think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> but I will continue to buy it as I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> then tried it on my eye brows and magic</li>
            <li> /&gt;so far so good!  </li>
            <li> If I use City Lash faithfully I have plenty of long, wonderful lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of prescription products on the market, and it still delivers pretty good results.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good lash enhancer</li>
            <li> Consumer reports studied eyelash enhancers (look on their site) and did ultimately rate this as the best, but they do list the top three and give detailed information about each.</li>
            <li> The length of my lashes were significantly longer!</li>
            <li> I also love how easy it is to use, and if you have sparse eyebrow hairs, City Lash also works well on them too.</li>
            <li> , I did notice that my lashes had filled out more and were noticeably thicker.  </li>
            <li> If you want fuller lashes, this product is ok, if are primarily looking for length, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> You also have to be vigilant to make sure it does not get in the eye as it will permanently discolor the whites and the iris of light colored eyes.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it has been wonderful!</li>
            <li> easy to apply</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t have to wait until bedtime to put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take but a minute to do both eyes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> ...keep using the product your lashes look great!&amp;#34;  Easy to use and no itching or redness</li>
            <li> I \\&quot;prep\\&quot; my lids with a nice hot washcloth compress for a minute before applying City Lash.  </li>
            <li> I also missed the fine print about getting a refund before 60 days, so it&#x27;s my fault</li>
            <li> Considering I have very sensitive eyes, I was delighted in suffering no irritation or allergy to the product.</li>
            <li> Eyelash enhancers, which are becoming very popular, they state, have been proven in numerous studies to increase your lash line by up to 70%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> free to send extras.....</li>
            <li> City Lash is a fabulous lash enhancer.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy cheap eye lash products again.</li>
            <li> WHICH IS A FABULOUS ENHANCER TO MY FACE.  </li>
            <li> City Lash is a fantastic method to volumize eye lashes and give them glamour that reminds us all of the stars of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a matter of what&#x27;s important to you.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me--actually I wasn&#x27;t able to give it a good try because it caused such a severe burning sensation that I had to try to rinse it off immediately.</li>
            <li> I should have realized that it as a scam when the pop up insisting that I buy more of the product right away before the  offer ended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results I&#x27;ve gotten even with admittedly sporadic use, and hope the appearance of my lashes will improve even more if I manage to remember to apply twice daily as recommended.</li>
            <li> I LOVE city lash and will continue to enjoy it into my mature years to light up the Light in my eyes!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> When City Lash came in, she was excited and started using it immediately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was excited until I saw the price.</li>
            <li> I then used it every morning after 6 weeks I compared with the original pictures and found no difference</li>
            <li> and there is a SIGNIFICANT difference in the length and fullness of my brows and eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and it really works!</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased and</li>
            <li> Packaging was adequate &amp; fine for product.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with black lashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, consistently (every night) for 3 months and have noticed that my eye lashes appear more full.  </li>
            <li> I may be sensitive to it, but I did not experience the burning sensation with Li lash and got amazing results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the time limit is for a refund; it just says, . . .\\&quot;full</li>
            <li> I can still return for a full refund, where do I send it and to whose attention?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: When I wrote customer service, I was promptly given a polite letter with a RMA# (return merchandise authorization number) and the full amount of $129.99 was credited to my PayPal account, where I am awaiting transfer to my checking account; so then, my out-of pocket expense was just $3.99 return</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that will be true for everyone.  </li>
            <li> My lashes do not fall as often any more, so the life cycle is a lot longer now, and because of that the lash line became much fuller.</li>
            <li> I particularly liked using City Lash because it of its all natural approach and its organic means of stimulating eye lash growth.</li>
            <li> the last part of week #3 and the liquid actually succeeds in making</li>
            <li> The company was good about taking back the product and refunding the money.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have to wait 6 wks or more to see the real results.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product, but I don&#x27;t think I see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and that&#x27;s that.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried City Lash and bought two tubs because of the great price and fake good reviews online.</li>
            <li> In A Flash because in a flash is how quickly I saw improvement, on both my lashes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are noticeably fuller, longer, and only look even better with mascara on top.</li>
            <li> Congrats to the lucky ones who got results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eyelash enhancer for anyone looking to get thicker lashes - it worked even better for me than Latisse did.</li>
            <li> I must admit, that I did not notice a difference until I started using the product daily and am now very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> previously used Lilash with great results.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in trying this, note that the photos are REALLY tiny, and for good reason.  </li>
            <li> I should have stuck with my tried and true RapidLash which give me beautiful long and lush lashes.</li>
            <li> This works very well!!</li>
            <li> and I am happy with my results and have purchased a second City Lash to maintain my new lashes...</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it, I signed up for their e-mail notification on the website, and as a first time customer they give you a huge discount,  </li>
            <li> I really like the City Lash because it made my lashes longer and filled in the gaps which made it look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but my lashes did not grow $70 worth of length.</li>
            <li> Some of my friends recently commented on how nice my eye lashes look.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to give up the fake lashes and use City Lash to nurture my grow my own.</li>
            <li> I am waiting to give this review an honest review after finishing the entire tube.  </li>
            <li> I figured let me try a different kind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read the reviews that said this product doesn&#x27;t work, but also read the ones that were complimentary.  </li>
            <li> Worth a</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to be patient, in the end it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> And their service is quick and consistent.  </li>
            <li> I use the City Lash Enhancer when I want more of a dramatic look and I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> If you have been to sparse lashes it will probably increase it some but nothing to a full set of full lashes let&#x27;s be realistic here people.     </li>
            <li> you might not see results right away</li>
            <li> I also purchased City Lips for my daughter and would have to say that this company is doing something right.</li>
            <li> and it has kept my right eyelashes</li>
            <li> have tried many of the products you can buy from the major cosmetic retailers to lengthen lashes - from serums to mascaras.  </li>
            <li> Before you apply make sure you take the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; off the tip of the wand, it will run into your eyes if not careful.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it has made my eye lid red at times and if you stops using it your eyelashes do go back to their original state.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are really OK but who couldn&#x27;t use a little more length and thickness?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I used it mostly first thing in the morning and also at night right before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> At the ripe old age of 68, I still want to look as good as I possibly can.</li>
            <li> The applicator is so easy to use no wasted product.</li>
            <li> I already had nice long lashes from using Latisse but thought a  friendlier product that could do the same would be better.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to many friends and a few have purchased it so far and they are definitely pleased!</li>
            <li> and he preferred I try this product first.  </li>
            <li> had to be patient as I saw no change in the first 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone willing to listen ;-)  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I did not see a date on this package as with my first package.  </li>
            <li> , i love it , it gave me my lashes back, and it makes me feel</li>
            <li> I started using City Lash Eyelash Enhancer about a month ago, and started seeing noticeable improvement within the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are definitely thicker, longer, and more supple.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this rated higher than the Marini product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> the product cost me $49.99  the first time.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely pleased with the results and encourage to try and see how it works.</li>
            <li> This product is reasonably priced and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I think they are about the same respectable length as when I was using Latisse.</li>
            <li> I noticed more lashes after the second week of use.  </li>
            <li> After the first time of rubbing my eyes</li>
            <li> It is pretty pricey</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed a product before, but am compelled to do so here because of the stellar results using City Lash.</li>
            <li> They are VERY visible (yeah!)</li>
            <li> It works for me...and the results were fast!</li>
            <li> I had lost a lot of lashes and had some bald spots and brittle lashes but after using City Lash for only a week they&#x27;re SOOOO much better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so much happier now!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after my first week of use.</li>
            <li> The first week I used it</li>
            <li> Most of them I used for several months and saw no noticeable change in my lashes, but City Lash works, and noticeably works.</li>
            <li> The first day i tried it, My eye and surrounding lids burned.</li>
            <li> I saw that many people had similar problems with City Lash.</li>
            <li> I first tried another lash product called RapidLash which did not seem to work.  </li>
            <li> I started using the City Lash serum exactly four weeks ago</li>
            <li> The only one I have been able to find that compares to the results i got from Latisse is City Lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise not to waste your money on this product, but buy a good quality, lengthening mascara instead.</li>
            <li> manufacturers further claim that, unlike other lash-enhancing products, CityLash is safe, even for the most sensitive skin and eyes, is natural and fragrance free, can be safely used on eyebrows as well, and, like all CITY Cosmetics, is not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> , I am still using the original applicator, so the price, spread over 5 months so far, is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Most products are geared for younger women but the reviews I read for City Lash Eyelash Enhancer were positive and testimonies raved at the benefits for all.</li>
            <li> Its makers claim that its unique proprietary formula will stimulate eyelash growth and extend the natural life cycle of the lash.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did more damage over the years than good.</li>
            <li> Because using it the amount of time they say to be successful, you use a lot of the product and when it doesn&#x27;t work, they only refund you $20.00 with the excuse that it can&#x27;t be re sold!  </li>
            <li> I think some people are just not going to have any positive response to these products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara too often, but when I do my lashes look long and lovely.</li>
            <li> Though the product is suppose to give thicker eye lashes in 45 days, it doesn&#x27;t because you will not be able to wear it that long.  </li>
            <li> Not Bollywood long, but definitely more than nature gave me.</li>
            <li> I did not notice much length until just now which is about 5 weeks of consistently using.</li>
            <li> , well, the old adage is true.....</li>
            <li> Not sure why this has gotten any good reviews.</li>
            <li> City Lash is an excellent product for anyone who LOVES thick, long lashes and hates the hassle of eyelash extensions or glue-on faux lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both Rapid Lash and Smart Lash before City Lash and saw results in about 7 days with those products.</li>
            <li> seems fine but only used for 3 days so</li>
            <li> it DOES help older thinning lashes!</li>
            <li> (I have little baby eyeslashes, and pray for gorgeous long full beauties).  </li>
            <li> Lashes are much longer now than they used to be</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it worked</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much growth.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were growing in much thicker and longer with both products.</li>
            <li> within 2 weeks my eyelashes were longer than I have ever seen them (I lost a lot of my lashes when I was smoking and since then, they would fall out and were very short).&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> It made my eyes water so much, I could not even keep my eye make-up on.  </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, it really irritates my eyes also.</li>
            <li> It was very east to use</li>
            <li> but my patience has really paid off.</li>
            <li> I used City Lash twice and it resulted in days of redness, burning, and intense itching.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much change in color</li>
            <li> One must realize that if ones lashes are already on the sparse side this lash enhancer will only work with what is available.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a shot, it works really fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks to City Lash</li>
            <li> It took a while, but at the 3 month mark I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a fuller, longer lash!</li>
            <li> Because it really works.  </li>
            <li> The competitors product works very well land</li>
            <li> Really gave me longer thicker lashes after about a month.</li>
            <li> They warn you and it&#x27;s for real.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> It does burn a bit if you poke your eye, but no worse than shampoo - and blinks away immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get a whole brushful of liquid at one time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t happened as fast as some people said</li>
            <li> The product is gentle.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the lash enhancers available without prescription, and I used Latisse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, I highly recommend City Lash!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because I put too much on my eyelid and it ran into my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked this fast for me.  </li>
            <li> I read some reviews and City lash was rated very well, and compared to Latisse.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a change in my lashes</li>
            <li> nothing really can drastically alter the type of eyelashes that you are born with.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really lengthen lashes as much as I had thought.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thing is, it was way way way way too much money.  </li>
            <li> I already have light facial hair on my face</li>
            <li> This really grew my lashes</li>
            <li> This really works I&#x27;ve seen a difference</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my very sparse lashes.</li>
            <li> Give City Lash a fair try of at least a month</li>
            <li> My lashes are now back, but even better they are full and long.</li>
            <li> try.irm a few months ago, when I discovered their eye cream and liked its results.  </li>
            <li> It didnt give me the wow factor of Latisse, but it was enough for me to be satisfied.</li>
            <li> When new ones grow in they are 1/3 + longer and thicker, but you MUST complete a full cycle.</li>
            <li> Since I was satisfied with other products from City Cosmetics, I decided to try this product because they are claiming that it works on eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other lash lengtheners before and had okay results</li>
            <li> Within 3 months my lashes and eyebrows were back to the original short/thin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t work for the company and have used a couple of their other products that I am also pleased with.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used City Lash for the past 2 years and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> I suspect the same is true for this product--I am going to give it a try and see what I come with.....</li>
            <li> The makers state that this ingredient has been proven through many clinical trials to get results - with the average being 54% and the highest at 72% increase in lash line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I became acquainted with this firm a few months ago, when I discovered their eye cream and liked its results.  </li>
            <li> It does sting and makes my eyes red, thus the 4 stars, but not bad or for long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about using this product as I had tried so many others and had little results for my eyelashes that now had basically bald spots from stress</li>
            <li> I have noticed new hairs coming in on my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I have seen more bad reviews than good on this site.</li>
            <li> I continued to use this product for 1 more month twice daily, 7 days a week with no further results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only using for 30 days s of now but most likely buy again.</li>
            <li> At my last checkup, my optometrist told me he didn&#x27;t think it was safe to use Latisse unless I had my eye pressure checked regularly.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product because it has a higher concentration of the important ingredients, without the danger of making dark flecks on my irises.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so much fuller, longer, and lush!</li>
            <li> Those bare spots and thin parts are looking better and better.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> This product had high ratings, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try City Lash if you want to grow your lash and brows in a hurry, with no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product for females.</li>
            <li> CityLash reviews were high, which is why I purchased this brand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend City Lash if you want \\&quot;Latisse like\\&quot; results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some eyebrow problems due to an autoimmune disease and while I don&#x27;t have my full eyebrows back, they are presentable and easy to fill in with dark eye shadow (looks more natural than pencil.)</li>
            <li> My lashes aren&#x27;t quite the way they were before, but they certainly don&#x27;t need mascara, which pleases this busy mama.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CityLash is more expensive than many other available eyelash enhancers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;CityLash is more expensive than many other available eyelash enhancers.  </li>
            <li> Getting older and having a chronic disease, this product gave me a new lease on life.</li>
            <li> I started using City Lash in February, and though the results were slow in coming, by the second month there was a huge difference, and even more so now, in July.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer and fuller than they were when I was young, but not in a &#x27;too much&#x27; way.</li>
            <li> City Lash improved the thickness and length of my lashes so much that it completely eliminated the need for mascara.</li>
            <li> I grew a few more lashes</li>
            <li> Mine has NEVER burned, although my eyelids seems a wee bit irritated for maybe 2 days and all is normal now.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the inconvenience because having my brows and lashes fuller is making me look younger.</li>
            <li> and I emailed customer service asking if this is a normal reaction.</li>
            <li> Length and darker color with this clear last product that does take about 2 or 3 months for full affect.</li>
            <li> After using it morning and night for 5 weeks I have long full lashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply to the upper lash line twice daily, and I was able to see faster lash growth in a spot where I&#x27;d just pulled out a few lashes with a curler.  </li>
            <li> I wasn’t actually concerned, and, if it can do that, it must be helping my lashes, right?  </li>
            <li> I wasn’t actually concerned, and, if it can do that, it must be helping my lashes, right?  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product</li>
            <li> The main reason City Lash is so effective is because they have this listed as the 3rd ingredient on it&#x27;s list - Meaning they are one of the few that use the required amount studies show works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, many so-called eyelash enhancers can’t actually do the job: they are formulated mainly with inexpensive mineral oil, whereas CityLash uses Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 as its main active ingredient.</li>
            <li> This product brings a new meaning to the zombie movie title, &amp;#34;48-day later.&amp;#34; Unless you&#x27;re into torture, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> with any new product you should do a patch test to see if you have a reaction to any of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> have a job now that requires me to meet new people each and every day.</li>
            <li> Matisse gives you a new applicator for each eye and for each night that it is used.</li>
            <li> New growth in areas that hadn&#x27;t had brows in years.</li>
            <li> but I was told this was NEW</li>
            <li> It did work for me as I saw a decrease in lash breakage and new lashes looked a bit healthier/</li>
            <li> I used it for 4 weeks and almost no added growth to my missing eye lashes, at all; even left on their own</li>
            <li> They key is to use City Lash daily and consistently!!  </li>
            <li> I have only been using City Lashes for a few weeks, so will see after a couple more months what I really think.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve tried other lash enhancers, and although this product is expensive, it seems to me to be the best.  </li>
            <li> Although, I never spent much on something for eye lashes</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> Waiting to see because I know the natural cycle of lashes to regrow under normal conditions (w/o enhancements) is not overnight.</li>
            <li> and I look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use liner anymore because my lashes are so lush!</li>
            <li> So last year on my birthday I treated myself to my first set of eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying this formula 2 times a day for 52 days (8 full weeks), I see absolutely no discernible difference in the length or thickness of my lashes or eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I cannot seem to write a live, user review on your website, the one I bought from, but I will be letting others know that it worked 000.00% as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> She also mentioned that she had to switch mascaras to accommodate her new, natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used City Lash on it and it now is as full as the other one.  </li>
            <li> if this product actually did what all their WORDS say, the photograph would be large AND look like NATURAL lashes, all WITHOUT the phony enhancement of eyeliner!&lt;br</li>
            <li> am one of those people who has a hard time wearing mascara and eye makeup because I am constantly touching my eyes and smudging everything.</li>
            <li> If I stay calm the effects will be minimal.  </li>
            <li> As for the people who said that City Lash caused intense burning, they must have extra sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Seems to be growing my lashes though they are thing  so far.</li>
            <li> So the free shipping they hype is not really free after all if you don&#x27;t like their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s matter of decency, and ethical business practices to not make a customer PAY FURTHER to get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far my lashes are no longer, or thicker</li>
            <li> So far, nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a highly sensitive person and often have reactions to things that others don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Knowing that the product is all natural helps.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the product directly from City Lash and have been using it for over three months.  </li>
            <li> actually grew much longer</li>
            <li> Also, you can at times get this product off of the actually city cosmetics website much cheaper.</li>
            <li> And they keep e-mailing me all kinds of offers for their products now.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m to old</li>
            <li> At least they are better</li>
            <li> Sensitive buyers beware.  </li>
            <li> So far I have noticed the length of my lashes improving</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> CityLash, is the only eyelash product that I have tried that really works.</li>
            <li> the video and BE PATIENT please.&lt;br /&gt;61 years old</li>
            <li> I have to be very cautious when applying it because it does make my eyes red and burn.</li>
            <li> They add that CityLash is one of the few commercially available products that uses this ingredient in the concentration required to work.  </li>
            <li> would rather spend a few more dollars and go back to my old faithfull Revitalash.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a link on the Consumer Reports website that comes directly from City Lash for $49.99.</li>
            <li> I will never put it anywhere near my eyes again</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and use this product on both lashes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Its been 4 weeks and so far there is no change.</li>
            <li> Of course, being a girl, I just fixed the problem by applying a ton of mascara.</li>
            <li> Then I got old and they went the way of everything else.</li>
            <li> and so far have had no issues.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t give QUITE the POW of a set of professional extensions.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I just wish I had known earlier about the trouble so many people have had with this product.</li>
            <li> within 2 weeks my right eyebrow was similar to the left one.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Regular mascara never did enough for me -- especially not for special occasions.</li>
            <li> For those times when I do, the fabulous results from this product are well worth the slight inconvenience of a little sting and redness.  </li>
            <li> I have in the past used other similar products, such as Latisse, with great results.</li>
            <li> Well, the first container worked well, then I took a short break while ordering and receiving my second container.  </li>
            <li> eyes werre more sensitive to this product than &amp;#34;L&#x27;il Lash&amp;#34;, but no long term negative side effects.</li>
            <li> my sister and I used RapidLash several years ago and had new eyelashes sprouting in every direction from the first tube, but tried a second tube and did not see the same results.</li>
            <li> Now, they&#x27;re not lush at all, which made me sad.&lt;br /&gt;Since I enjoy other City products, I decided to try their eyelash enhancer.</li>
            <li> I went a little too much in the middle of my right one</li>
            <li> Even though I use it daily, I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth in my eye lashes but there is some in my eyebrow area.  </li>
            <li> and I really started to notice a big difference in the last 1-2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only my second day and on both eyes I can tell that my lashes are much fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past, and there was a significant change, so</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s even hard for me to apply mascara in the first place but after using this product for about five weeks or so, I am noticing a pretty big difference.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and my lashes and brows were definitely thinning.  </li>
            <li> and I had a noticeable bare patch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh, and, by-the-way, it&#x27;s all natural and comes with a 60-day money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> My only warning so far</li>
            <li> Bought this for thinning eyelashes (65 yr old female) who had noticed some stunting in the growth.  </li>
            <li> Will go back to my old one.</li>
            <li> I barely saw a difference Waited for 3 months.</li>
            <li> So far I have had no side effects and my lashes are maintained at the same length and  thickness as Latisse had.</li>
            <li> shorter, and the inner corner of one eye had completely lost all its lashes.</li>
            <li> average being 54% and the highest at 72% increase in lash line&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any burning or redness, I&#x27;ve been able to wear makeup over the City Lash without a problem, and there haven&#x27;t been any issues with my contacts.  </li>
            <li> I decided that at the end of the day, as much money as I spent on going to a stylists to apply fake lashes, I would rather spend on a product to boost my own.</li>
            <li> I had lost most of my lashes and was wearing false lashes when I had to socialize.  </li>
            <li> but they insisted I need to use it more still nothing don&#x27;t waste your money buying this and your time waiting to see EVEN A LITTLE difference...</li>
            <li> I am so excited, with a thick coat of mascara</li>
            <li> However, after two weeks of nightly use, they are longer and more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> City Lash by City Cosmetics is a non-prescription eyelash enhancer that promises longer, darker, more dramatic eyelashes in 42 days.  </li>
            <li> A coworker started on Latisse at the same time that I started with City Lash and so far my lashes are progressing equally with hers.  </li>
            <li> It is too early on for me to see the total effects as I have only been using the product for 3 weeks, but there is a noticable difference in the length of the lashes.</li>
            <li> As a natural blonde with white eyelashes, I didn&#x27;t expect my lashes to get darker, and they haven&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Some of those products did seem to be mainly mineral oil, or petroleum jelly, and, while inexpensive, were not very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Some of those products did seem to be mainly mineral oil, or petroleum jelly, and, while inexpensive, were not very helpful.  </li>
            <li> My tip: Use everyday for 3 weeks, then every other day for 3-4 until your full growth cycle is complete.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that promise the moon but simply do not deliver like Latisse, Smart Lash, Revitalash.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and not one single problem.</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of new short lashes growing in and now they&#x27;re almost as long as the rest.</li>
            <li> and I have not only noticed that my lashes have stopped falling out (almost immediately after I began using this product), but my once barely there eyelashes are now thicker and fuller AND longer.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it clever, how in the remarkably tiny photos, all the ladies grew a fine line of eyeliner to indicate questionable eyelash growth?  </li>
            <li> My lashes are slightly fuller but definitely much much longer.</li>
            <li> It just means that your lashes might not be receptive to its active main ingredient (Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17).</li>
            <li> much prefer my naturally thick lashes to normal mascara now.  </li>
            <li> It stings a little bit if I get too much on</li>
            <li> and I would occasionally have a &amp;#34;space.&amp;#34; I used City Lash for a little over 3 weeks and noticed the lashes were filling in and grew to be much longer.</li>
            <li> -I have read the reviews, good and bad..</li>
            <li> They are thick, full and long.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed by not being able to use the product, but the part I disliked the most is that when I returned it, I got only a partial refund.</li>
            <li> Lashes are probably twice as long as they were a few months ago and even though they&#x27;re not quite as thick as I want yet, I definately have more than I had before.</li>
            <li> but I found another product that is less expensive and works much better - Smartlash!</li>
            <li> but I decided that I would not waste more money on something that seemed impossible to achieve, such as having longer and fuller eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I could not even use City Lash long enough to see if it actually worked.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s been long enough since the last time</li>
            <li> they actually look fake :)  Be patient (normally I am not)</li>
            <li> I would say my eye lashes are medium to normal and with this application they have got thicker and in length, just a, little</li>
            <li> It took a couple months of use to notice my lashes were longer and that they were a little bit fuller than normal.  </li>
            <li> Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 is very expensive and its rare that products use the right</li>
            <li> I used Marini lash in the past, as it was recommended by a nurse in my dermatologist&#x27;s office, and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I have no bare patches now.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have seen a little improvement, but not the big improvement I had using Latisse.</li>
            <li> After about 6 weeks of growth (a little longer than advertised), the bald spot in my lashes completely disappeared!</li>
            <li> It is natural for people as they age to lose their eyelashes, on top of which, I once had the bad nervous habit of tearing them out.  </li>
            <li> It is natural for people as they age to lose their eyelashes, on top of which, I once had the bad nervous habit of tearing them out.  </li>
            <li> The only con is that you have to use it every single day</li>
            <li> This is a great product that will allow you to avoid the pitfalls of expensive extensions that after awhile look pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I have seen NO difference in the thickness or length of my lashes, but on the third day I developed my first ever eye infection, requiring a visit to my opthamologist and an expensive prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lashes have never been very long, and they are still not &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34; long, but they are definitely longer than before City Lash.  </li>
            <li> After using it for the past four months, my lashes are full and thick-- even better than they were before my fake lash application.</li>
            <li> I finally did an extensive review of other eyelash enhancing products and came across City lash.</li>
            <li> I used an over-the-counter product (Visine) and had only minimal relief.</li>
            <li> Will finish the bottle and wait, but so far seems to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My only warning is to be careful not to get it in your eye, or on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my eye lashes are longer, about twice as long and even a bit fuller.</li>
            <li> Only issue is shipping took longer than expected</li>
            <li> this is watery, drips into your eyes stings for a long while, have used every day and nothing is longer or darker.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s a long story).</li>
            <li> My lashes are only MARGINALLY thicker, not longer, not darker, really not even thicker.</li>
            <li> I am careful to keep it on my eye lid just above</li>
            <li> It was loose in a box (no insert in box) and not full, I&#x27;ve ordered directly from the manufacturer before</li>
            <li> City lash is a bit less expensive and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Seriously, in a matter of two days I noticed a difference and have seen steady improvement over the last three months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> helped them grow back fast and thick!</li>
            <li> because of the thin brush and the tight opening of the container, I could be precise on where the product was going</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that make similar claims, but City Lash delivers on their promises!</li>
            <li> Lash not only burns (which is not an experience that I have had with other eyelash enhancer products), and I have not seen any results after a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Finally, they state that CityLash does not contain paraben or prostaglandin like other products.</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t very long</li>
            <li> Another thing, it said it does not irritate your eyes, however, it burned mine when I accidently got it in my eye, so I try to be very careful from now on and apply it ONLY on the lash line, and not blink as often until the stuff dries on the eye.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative experience I&#x27;ve had so far, since it&#x27;s allergy season I rub my eyes a lot.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with mascara and having long full lashes</li>
            <li> Did not live up to it&#x27;s promise and made no difference at all to my eyelashes</li>
            <li> Sadly, the mascara I used only made them darker and full of wet gunk!</li>
            <li> I had been using Lilash for some time but with limited results.</li>
            <li> I was really interested in trying it on my thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It took two solid days of agony before my eyes calmed down again.</li>
            <li> By 8 weeks I had very soft, hardly noticeable lashes.</li>
            <li> It also causes slight burning on the upper lid.</li>
            <li> I actually noticed a few weirdly long ones at about 2 weeks and after probably a month the rest of them had caught up.</li>
            <li> I never wanted to try Latisse because I have very blue eyes and brown pigment would look odd.</li>
            <li> When I was young I had thick eyelashes that reached to my eyebrows and long lower lashes too.</li>
            <li> It was dramatic and pretty immediate with Latisse.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice daily and applied a generous amount to each eyelid with little results.  </li>
            <li> and this definitely  helped but took a little longer.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy, especially if you&#x27;re unhappy with your lash fullness and length.</li>
            <li> The lashes were a bit too much even though I was going back for maintenance appointments which get expensive.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected for me</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I use to have very sparse and thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> After using the entire tube there were no results.&lt;br /&gt;Big waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Utter waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it 3 months now and have seen absolutely no lash growth.  </li>
            <li> Over a month has gone by with absolutely no difference, and I&#x27;ve been applying as directed.</li>
            <li> My wife was always complaining about her short, uneven eye lashes.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical, but thought at the lower price, it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> always careful around my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I continued to use it until the tube was empty and still saw no difference.</li>
            <li> After 3 mos of using it there was absolutely no lash growth at all</li>
            <li> still not using for 46 days; not much difference at this point.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful.</li>
            <li> After applying lashes for several years, I noticed that my natural lashes were looking fairly thin and not as plush as I wanted them to.</li>
            <li> I used City Lash for one week and developed an itching, burning red-eye condition that forced me to stop.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying City Lash because of the lack of success with other products</li>
            <li> Be careful of other brands that claim to use this ingredient.</li>
            <li> The only down side is it can get into your eye and sting a little.  </li>
            <li> Before, they were average only and heavily supplemented by mascara.</li>
            <li> of the things I&#x27;ve learned in dealing with my high sensitivity is that if I freak out when I have a reaction to something, it will get worse.  </li>
            <li> I tried other products before (couple of years ago)</li>
            <li> /&gt;You read other reviews about it stinging your eyes.</li>
            <li> However, one set of lashes r longer then the other set.</li>
            <li> It causes extreme burning of the eyes.  </li>
            <li> it does the same if not better job than Latisse.</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve bought before did that.</li>
            <li> I have also been applying City Lash to the sparse areas of my eye brows due over tweezing.</li>
            <li> I have tried other eyelash enhancers with no noticeable results but City Lash gave me longer, fuller lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and they worked but not as well as City Lash.</li>
            <li> It did not work as well as other eye lash conditioners I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this faithfully for just shy of 2 months and haven&#x27;t see much of ANYTHING!  </li>
            <li> It should not be applied to lower lashes or other skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have tried any other compared to....</li>
            <li> I have tried other lash enhancers before.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I was skeptical at first, but after using City Lash for about 2 weeks I noticed that my lashes were noticeably longer and darker.  </li>
            <li> like I had with other products.</li>
            <li> I think they have a lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptical at First, But after 1 week of using City lash</li>
            <li> I have used latisse in recent past which worked well and did take up to the 4 months.</li>
            <li> Suggestion was to NOT use on lower lashes, due to hair growth on cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Also, you have to be very careful with it.  </li>
            <li> would be very careful with this product as it can irritate some people&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> This helps, they claim, to thicken and lengthen the lash bed and keep older lashes from falling out, and will result in dramatic visible results.</li>
            <li> helpful:\\&quot;City Lash&#x27;s active ingredient is Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken a before and after picture, but I actually didn&#x27;t expect such dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend was always complaining about her eyelashes, saying they were too short and too dull.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> However, my eyes don&#x27;t have dark circles around them like they did when I used Latisse.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark eyelashes</li>
            <li> I must say that I have an average pair of lashes.</li>
            <li> They are average length and thickness.</li>
            <li> I resorted to getting fake lashes but it requires too much time and they have a tendency to fall off.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money for me.....</li>
            <li> After that, use at least 2X a week to maintain them or else they will revert to your former less glorious dust catchers.</li>
            <li> but from other sellers!</li>
            <li> then let it dry for a bit, then apply your makeup as usual.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I got the product since I am Asian and have sparse, short lashes, but</li>
            <li> I had been using another product that was more expensive and difficult to get a hold of.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try City Lash, mainly because it is less expensive</li>
            <li> After faithfully using City Lash Growth Enhancer once daily for 3-4 weeks I began to experience serious redness, swelling &amp; itchiness in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I a year previously</li>
            <li> small growth after but not very much!!!!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I normally wear a lot of mascara or even fake lashes.  </li>
            <li> City Lash has made my lashes long and thick.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Are long and thick.</li>
            <li> At least my eyelashes are long!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product should be used once daily, according to your usual beauty regimen, applied to the base of the upper eyelids, and allowed to dry for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used City Lash for 2 months now and there is a little difference; however I will not pay $70 again for this little</li>
            <li> gave 3 stars because it did work a little...</li>
            <li> I use this product all by itself with a little lip gloss</li>
            <li> I saw little of no difference while using this product.  </li>
            <li> This product does seems to grow lashes a little thicker and longer than not using anything, so it has value.</li>
            <li> I had tried two other lash enhancers in the past which also did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I think my lashes are a little longer</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> Lower lashes longer and a little bit fuller too.  </li>
            <li> My lashes have been thinning over the past few years due to pregnancies, age, stress, etc.</li>
            <li> A few lashes grew really long, but they overall, they were very thin and sparse in between</li>
            <li> I was getting impatient and about to give up on the product, but hold out a little longer</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I tries to use it every time I put it on some went in my eyes and burned like heck.</li>
            <li> hoping this goes from 4 star to 5 star after a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes had split and broken off as a result of illness, and within two weeks of no side effect application, day and night, they grew back longer than when I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> so there is a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced such relentless itching in my eyes before.</li>
            <li> do want to prepare you, though, that on a few occasions when I have gotten this product in my eyes, it did sting.  </li>
            <li> I had some that had been broken off and this product has helped them grow back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of heavy make-up and with City Lash</li>
            <li> I like how this product did not have harsh ingredients or make hair grow on my face, where I didn&#x27;t want hair.</li>
            <li> Visene cleared symptoms in a few days.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday with out exception</li>
            <li> Did not work and I&#x27;m still using it everyday with hope</li>
            <li> Threw out both City Lashes - what a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on City Lash.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I personally will get behind.</li>
            <li> what a waste</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, as this doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Which by the way I consider one of the only places I find to have REAL reviews and not bought, fake, angry, reviews.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I ordered City Lash a few months ago and have been HOOKED ever since.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it.</li>
            <li> A waste of money</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the same deception as when the mascara companies use models wearing FALSE eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint i have is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my sparse eyebrows, but the other products haven&#x27;t made them grow, either.  </li>
            <li> I think lashes look a little fuller, but not sure about length.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is soooo much less expensive and appears to work the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> About 4 months ago I was with friends who were goofing around with lighters, and I had an accident where my eye lashed were burnt off pretty bad.</li>
            <li> My lashes got shorter and less thick.</li>
            <li> If it runs in your eye it does burn a little which is hard not to do when you are trying to get it onto the corners of eyelash bases.</li>
            <li> so it was looks even worse then previously being evenly short and thin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of its results on my eyelashes, it’s a little hard to see.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure of its results on my eyelashes, it’s a little hard to see.  </li>
            <li> I used City Lash for months with very little result.</li>
            <li> My lashes have grown very little.  </li>
            <li> It does work, a little slow, but I see the results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost with very little growth - will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have noticed improvements in my brow area with City Lash which I am extremely thankful for as I did not think there was ever going to be a product to help with sparse brows!!!</li>
            <li> not sure how it will perform....</li>
            <li> The small plastic insert that is used in the bottle to control the amount on the brush has come out and won&#x27;t stay in the bottle</li>
            <li> sting usually goes away in about five minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am 68, and for years had lamented my increasingly sparse eyelashes -such that trying to use mascara was almost useless.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, there is a small percentage that it won&#x27;t work for.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products out there that uses ultra-high quality ingredients and it is affordable, that is a \\&quot;win-win!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I placed the second order, they had changed the formula (probably the FDA.).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> There are no more smudges from mascara on my eyeglasses.</li>
            <li> For about four months after my extension experiment, my lashes looked shorter than usual.</li>
            <li> Because it didnt work for you, it doesn&#x27;t mean the product is a sham.</li>
            <li> I am only using it on one eye as the lashes on that eye got very thin and sparse.  </li>
            <li> It was a big disappointment and a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I usually use mascara that is supposed to thick and lengthen my brows.</li>
            <li> Saw no difference after using the product for 3 months  Very disappointed and didn&#x27;t read the fine print</li>
            <li> I ordered from the site and I could hardly wait for it to arrive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> are that my lashes feel drier than before, and if the serum gets into your eyes or on the sensitive skin contours of your eyes, it burns and stings really bad (some testimonies state</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to give negative feedback.</li>
            <li> LaTrisse, the prescription product is harder to get, expensive, irritated my eyelids, and, although it worked well, required use forevermore to retain the regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LaTrisse, the prescription product is harder to get, expensive, irritated my eyelids, and, although it worked well, required use forevermore to retain the regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would at least make my eyelashes look darker.  </li>
            <li> As the product details explain this takes time, at least 40 days.  </li>
            <li> my lashes, which were basically non-existent, are thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was born with limp, thin, scraggly looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I put the Latisse on under my mascara and found that my lashes were around twice as thick in a month.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> but this works just as well if not better and is so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to a product that really works,  City Lash failed miserably.</li>
            <li> I have very small eye lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> Persuasive reviews on the internet typically I find useless since negative&lt;br /&gt;opinions</li>
            <li> the dramatic before and after look is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I use several of the other products City Cosmetics has with their skincare line and City Lips line and have not been disappointed yet!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the cost is that crazy, compared to all other beauty products.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes still short :(</li>
            <li> I had really hoped this would work and have been very disappointed to find it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Though you may have thicker eye lashes, the only thing people will notice is that your eyes are bloody and irritated.  </li>
            <li> after using city lash for 2 months my lashes are still thin..</li>
            <li> I think I can tell a difference, but the result is not quite fast and shocking.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never experienced any irritation from using</li>
            <li> but I am seventy and my lashes were so thin</li>
            <li> Keep it only on the lash base and out of your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was so upset, but my sister told me about this product and how it had helped her thin lashes grow and become fuller, so I thought why not and tried it.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, they stand behind it:  </li>
            <li> yes they do thin with age ladies.  </li>
            <li> Because you use Citylash on the base of your lashes (like an eyeliner), its VERY likely that you will at one point get the solution in your eye.</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT WORK, it crumbled my eyelashes making them worse.  </li>
            <li> I purchased City Lash approximately 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start to notice baby lashes growing until approximately 2 months after continued use twice a day.</li>
            <li> regrew lashes within a couple weeks for me after mine fell out from allergic reaction to false eyelash glue</li>
            <li> I had my eyelashes ripped out by false exts...</li>
            <li> false advertising and wasting people&#x27;s money.  </li>
            <li> I am asked whether I have on false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering due to some folks saying they had burning or bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried several over the counter eyelash enhancers which were expensive and worthless.  </li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s nothing nasty in this enhancer, which is always a concern when putting stuff near your eyes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this item does not work.</li>
            <li> I had not used an eyelash enhancer before I tried City Lash as I was extreeeemely skeptical.  </li>
            <li> The application is extremely difficult.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive...</li>
            <li> and it burned and was really uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Sadly this product did NOTwork at all for me.</li>
            <li> ill stick with Li-Lash</li>
            <li> but;it was expensive.</li>
            <li> -- unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t born with these and have tried everything under the sun.</li>
            <li> fail to measure any sort of reasoning what so ever.</li>
            <li> Looks like I am going to have to count this as an expensive loss and purchase</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about lash products but decided to give City Lash a try.  </li>
            <li> so was unable to return it.</li>
            <li> but it got to be too expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry no change at all</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the extensions tended not to fall out as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> unfortunately did not work at all for me as some reviewers.</li>
            <li> Very poor results.</li>
            <li> It also burns like crazy if it gets into your eyes.</li>
            <li> City Lash stings like crazy</li>
            <li> Oh what a horrible waste of time I have used this product for over two 1/2  months and not one bit of difference</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, sorry.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll just buy a $5 eyeliner pencil and fake it like the photos!  </li>
            <li> Women get angry when being lied to!</li>
            <li> It was very expensive also.</li>
            <li> I was using another lash enhancer, a very expensive one</li>
            <li> However, since Latisse is very expensive, and I was looking for an alternative that was not quite as expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But disposable fake lashes are too annoying to me.</li>
            <li> so I needed to assess how badly I needed this.</li>
            <li> I should have believed the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I used City Lash for three nights and each night my eyes reacted badly - crusty and gooey-eyed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> either!!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes me sick,</li>
            <li> Nothing yet..........20 days of non stop application but no change, still hopeful, but sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried it, and I was sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> , then you get the product and are disappointed, you won&#x27;t be with City Lash.  </li>
            <li> I am rather disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Stupidly,  I read the reviews for City Lash, believed them and bought two.  </li>
            <li> I used to have the annoying issue of my lashes falling in my eyes, this stopped it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hated the clumpy look and since I have oily skin</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with City Lash product that is suppose to grow your lashes.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> but if you keep using it every night you will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> burns my eyes like crazy!!!!  </li>
            <li> and it was horrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using City Lash for almost a year, and I love it.  I used to use Lilash which seemed to work and then stopped.  However, the City Lash keeps my lashes and brows longer and thicker, and I don&#x27;t seem to become immune to whatever it does.  I am 60 years old and my lashes and brows were definitely thinning.  I only apply in the morning now when I get up and wash my face.  It dries quickly and that&#x27;s that.  I don&#x27;t wear mascara too often, but when I do my lashes look long and lovely.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything at all.  Have used since May and see no difference whatsoever.  Will finish this tube and not continue use.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  I have used it for only a week and I can already see results.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> seems fine but only used for 3 days so not sure how it will perform....&lt;br /&gt;there is some irritation but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received quickly and in good condition....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far so good!  hoping this goes from 4 star to 5 star after a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to give negative feedback. Unfortunately, this item does not work. In addition, the City Eyelash Enhancer  arrived unsealed inside the shipping box. All eye cosmetics should always be sealed and unopened. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work miracles but it definitely works. I have seen actual lash growth where there was no lashes.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice daily and applied a generous amount to each eyelid with little results.  After using for 1 month I saw no difference in the length of my lashes whatsoever however, I did notice that my lashes had filled out more and were noticeably thicker.  I continued to use this product for 1 more month twice daily, 7 days a week with no further results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> City Lash has worked great for me. Lashes are much longer now than they used to be and I&#x27;ve had zero problems. If you&#x27;re like me and want to try Latisse but can&#x27;t afford it, City Lash is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money. Does not work.</li>
            <li> I used this as instructed (twice daily), but have had no change at all.  I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past, and there was a significant change, so I do know what it should have done.  Oh well, wiser now, and hopefully will help someone else to save their money.</li>
            <li> City lash worked a miracle for me.  My eyelashes had split and broken off as a result of illness, and within two weeks of no side effect application, day and night, they grew back longer than when I was a teenager.  I LOVE city lash and will continue to enjoy it into my mature years to light up the Light in my eyes!</li>
            <li> I had lost most of my lashes and was wearing false lashes when I had to socialize.  I asked my Ophthalmologist  for  a prescription and he preferred I try this product first.  I am so glad he knew what was best!&lt;br /&gt;I had to be patient as I saw no change in the first 4 weeks. By 8 weeks I had very soft, hardly noticeable lashes. BUT by week 12!!! ---I had lashes and lots of them!  I had something to use mascara on!  If I use City Lash faithfully I have plenty of long, wonderful lashes. I am grateful every day for this product. I recommend it to anyone willing to listen ;-)  AND I hope to never be without my City Lash.&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to send extras.....</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it worked</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much growth. I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work. don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 1 month &amp; have not noticed any change in my eyelashes yet.  I will continue to use it twice a day until I use it up.  I will not reorder it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I&#x27;ve used both Rapid Lash and Smart Lash before City Lash and saw results in about 7 days with those products.My eyelashes were growing in much thicker and longer with both products. I thought I&#x27;d try something different with city lash. I grew a few more lashes but they were not longer at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected for me I find Li Lash to be better. I will continue to use until supply runs out then will go back to Li Lash.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few weeks now and I see noticable results.  My eyelashes are starting to get longer and somewhat thicker.  My only complaint is the packaging.  The small plastic insert that is used in the bottle to control the amount on the brush has come out and won&#x27;t stay in the bottle so there is a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> I use to have very sparse and thin eyelashes but I&#x27;ve used City Lash for the past 2 years and the difference is amazing. Everyone compliments me on my eyelashes now and sometimes I&#x27;ve even been asked if I was wearing falsies! you might not see results right away but if you keep using it every night you will NOT be disappointed!!! I will never be without this product!</li>
            <li> After using the entire tube there were no results.&lt;br /&gt;Big waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously used Lilash with great results.</li>
            <li> So far, I have seen a little improvement, but not the big improvement I had using Latisse. However, my eyes don&#x27;t have dark circles around them like they did when I used Latisse. I have only been using City Lashes for a few weeks, so will see after a couple more months what I really think. It was dramatic and pretty immediate with Latisse.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve tried other lash enhancers, and although this product is expensive, it seems to me to be the best.  It is actually thinckening my lashes rather than just lengthening them.  The one complaint i have is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my sparse eyebrows, but the other products haven&#x27;t made them grow, either.  At least my eyelashes are long!</li>
            <li> Seems to be growing my lashes though they are thing  so far. only using for 30 days s of now but most likely buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried other products before (couple of years ago) but I decided that I would not waste more money on something that seemed impossible to achieve, such as having longer and fuller eyelashes. Since I was satisfied with other products from City Cosmetics, I decided to try this product because they are claiming that it works on eyebrows too. Last time I trimmed my eyebrows I went a little too much in the middle of my right one and I had a noticeable bare patch.&lt;br /&gt;These are the results I got:&lt;br /&gt;1) within 2 weeks my right eyebrow was similar to the left one.&lt;br /&gt;2) within 2 weeks my eyelashes were longer than I have ever seen them (I lost a lot of my lashes when I was smoking and since then, they would fall out and were very short).&lt;br /&gt;3) within 6 weeks my eyelashes were fuller. Keeping in mind that I do not use mascara, it was surprising to see how full they got naturally.&lt;br /&gt;4) the product lasted me 10 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;5) because of the thin brush and the tight opening of the container, I could be precise on where the product was going and I never got my eyes irritated.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Researched lash enhancing products and picked this one. I wish I had taken before and after pictures so I could post them here. You have to give it a month to see results. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I could not even use City Lash long enough to see if it actually worked.  It made my eyes water so much, I could not even keep my eye make-up on.  I had crusty eyes in the morning and my nose ran continuously.  I am disappointed by not being able to use the product, but the part I disliked the most is that when I returned it, I got only a partial refund.</li>
            <li> I used City Lash for months with very little result. A few lashes grew really long, but they overall, they were very thin and sparse in between so it was looks even worse then previously being evenly short and thin. I started with RaidLash a couple of years ago and got amazing results. Then I tried City Lash and bought two tubs because of the great price and fake good reviews online. Utter waste of money. After months of use, I&#x27;m going to throw the remainder of both tubes away. Oh yeah, it really irritates my eyes also.</li>
            <li> I have just finished chemo and radiation- I have no eyebrows and no eyelashes-I have been using Latisse, a gift from a friend- but I do think my eyes are having a reaction from the product- they do sting and are itchy most of the time- I went on the hunt and came across the consumer guide&#x27;s  top pick for lash growth CITY Lash won-  -I have read the reviews, good and bad..If there is ANYTHING I have learned from having cancer it is that no two of us are alike and the treatment will not affect us all the same way- it will affect each us differfently- I suspect the same is true for this product--I am going to give it a try and see what I come with.....</li>
            <li> This product burned my eyes each time I applied it.  I&#x27;ve been using it 3 months now and have seen absolutely no lash growth.  What a waste of time and money.  I should have stuck with my tried and true RapidLash which give me beautiful long and lush lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used City Lash for 2 months now and there is a little difference; however I will not pay $70 again for this little difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 3 stars because it did work a little... but my lashes did not grow $70 worth of length.</li>
            <li> This works so well.  A coworker started on Latisse at the same time that I started with City Lash and so far my lashes are progressing equally with hers.  Longer but more to my satisfaction my lashes are thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for five weeks and I can already tell I have fuller eyelashes than I did.  They are not noticeably longer yet but there are more of them.  I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t change my eye color.  It stings a little bit if I get too much on but it&#x27;s only for a moment and hasn&#x27;t been a problem. When this runs out I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing , been using it for about one month and can already tell a difference on my lashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am 56 and have noticed for several years that my eyelashes were thinning and I would occasionally have a &amp;#34;space.&amp;#34; I used City Lash for a little over 3 weeks and noticed the lashes were filling in and grew to be much longer. It was very east to use and I am happy with my results and have purchased a second City Lash to maintain my new lashes...oh...and my eyes are still blue!</li>
            <li> I had not used an eyelash enhancer before I tried City Lash as I was extreeeemely skeptical.  I am 40+ and noticing with age the beginning signs of thinning hair and eyelashes, among many things ;)  I decided to take a chance and I&#x27;m so happy I did.  I am at about six weeks of using City Lash and I really started to notice a big difference in the last 1-2 weeks.  My lashes are slightly fuller but definitely much much longer. I am so excited, with a thick coat of mascara they actually look fake :)  Be patient (normally I am not) but my patience has really paid off.</li>
            <li> I see no difference in my lashes then when I started using this product. Very expensive and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this product zero stars if I could. I used City Lash twice and it resulted in days of redness, burning, and intense itching. When I contacted the company for a refund, they refused to pay the return shipping!  Even though their product was defective and didn&#x27;t work for me, I had to pay the costs to ship it back. Their reason for refusing to pay was that they had already paid the cost to ship it to me. So the free shipping they hype is not really free after all if you don&#x27;t like their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s matter of decency, and ethical business practices to not make a customer PAY FURTHER to get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Latisse for years and never had any burning or itching. If you hunt around the internet, the forums, the beauty boards, you&#x27;ll find more stories like mine. I just wish I had known earlier about the trouble so many people have had with this product. I&#x27;ve never experienced such relentless itching in my eyes before. I used an over-the-counter product (Visine) and had only minimal relief. It took two solid days of agony before my eyes calmed down again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I got the product since I am Asian and have sparse, short lashes, but City Lash is a fabulous lash enhancer.  It&#x27;s easy to apply to the upper lash line twice daily, and I was able to see faster lash growth in a spot where I&#x27;d just pulled out a few lashes with a curler.  I could see a difference in both the length and volume of all of my lashes well before the 40 days cited on the company&#x27;s website, even though I did not remember to use it every day.  I have not experienced any burning or redness, I&#x27;ve been able to wear makeup over the City Lash without a problem, and there haven&#x27;t been any issues with my contacts.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results I&#x27;ve gotten even with admittedly sporadic use, and hope the appearance of my lashes will improve even more if I manage to remember to apply twice daily as recommended.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw extra length within a couple of weeks. Haven&#x27;t seen much change in color but my lashes are very light. I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> So far my lashes are no longer, or thicker so&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether it just hasn&#x27;t got started, but I bought &amp; paid for it so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it till it&#x27;s gone.  It burns  if you accidentally get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> still using it. good stuff</li>
            <li> Nothing yet..........20 days of non stop application but no change, still hopeful, but sadly disappointed. Also the&lt;br /&gt;price has reduced by 1/3rd.</li>
            <li> Like others, I was able to procure a package deal thru consumer reports @ $49.99 per tube. This is the LEGIT S***. One needs to have patience with this type of application. One must realize that if ones lashes are already on the sparse side this lash enhancer will only work with what is available. If you have been to sparse lashes it will probably increase it some but nothing to a full set of full lashes let&#x27;s be realistic here people.     I would say my eye lashes are medium to normal and with this application they have got thicker and in length, just a, little but it&#x27;s still notable.    Best of luck to you all.</li>
            <li> I used City Lash religiously twice a day for over 4 weeks and saw no noticeable improvement.  I&#x27;d advise not to waste your money on this product, but buy a good quality, lengthening mascara instead.</li>
            <li> I had been using another product that was more expensive and difficult to get a hold of. City Lash has made my lashes long and thick. I love it!</li>
            <li> followed directions and nothing happened…waste of money</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product, but I don&#x27;t think I see much of a difference.  It was very expensive also.</li>
            <li> I am on my 4th week and my lashes grew thicker and longer!  I have in discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;You read other reviews about it stinging your eyes. This happens only when you get it in your eyes. This product is great. Can&#x27;t wait to see what the net 4 weeks bring!</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering due to some folks saying they had burning or bad reaction.  Mine has NEVER burned, although my eyelids seems a wee bit irritated for maybe 2 days and all is normal now.  Already seeing a difference and I will keep using it!  It is a good product and just needs the instructions followed.</li>
            <li> If you want fuller lashes, this product is ok, if are primarily looking for length, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes werre more sensitive to this product than &amp;#34;L&#x27;il Lash&amp;#34;, but no long term negative side effects.</li>
            <li> This product works!  The only down side is it can get into your eye and sting a little.  It does help keep your eyelashes longer and does not discolor the iris of your eyes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  regrew lashes within a couple weeks for me after mine fell out from allergic reaction to false eyelash glue</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a shot, it works really fast. I have naturally dark eyelashes but they aren&#x27;t very long and I don&#x27;t like wearing mascara. It&#x27;s only my second day and on both eyes I can tell that my lashes are much fuller and longer. Thanks to City Lash I don’t need to use mascara anymore. I will definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> does work but have to keep using it or you lose lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this again.  I am only using it on one eye as the lashes on that eye got very thin and sparse.  It took a while, but at the 3 month mark I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I tries to use it every time I put it on some went in my eyes and burned like heck. I have uses Larissa many times and never had the discomfort I had with this.. I had to rinse my eyes each time&lt;br /&gt;Which defeated the&lt;br /&gt;Purpose</li>
            <li> The application is extremely difficult. And it stings if I get it in my eyes. How soon am I supposed to see results? So far, nothing.</li>
            <li> No changes at all.  I am thinking about changing to LiLash. no discoration and no growth.  I am disappointed, sorry.</li>
            <li> My lashes were thicker and longer in just a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> Since -5 is not listed on the rating, I can&#x27;t give it what it deserves. Considering that it did nothing to enhance, lengthen, or thicken my eyelashes or eyebrows, I can only hope that it did no damage. It has a \\&quot;warming\\&quot; feeling on my eyelids and burns when it seeps into my eyes. Below is most of my letter to the site&#x27;s email contact. I can update this Amazon review later when or if the company answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To: support@ConsumersGuides.com&lt;br /&gt;Oct. 10, 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Customer Service,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerning: CITY LASH ([...] ([...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying this formula 2 times a day for 52 days (8 full weeks), I see absolutely no discernible difference in the length or thickness of my lashes or eyebrows. I cannot seem to write a live, user review on your website, the one I bought from, but I will be letting others know that it worked 000.00% as far as I am concerned. I also took before and after pictures. I don&#x27;t know what the time limit is for a refund; it just says, . . .\\&quot;full refund once the product was returned.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can still return for a full refund, where do I send it and to whose attention?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just made a payment of&lt;br /&gt;$129.99 USD&lt;br /&gt;Your transaction ID for this payment is: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XXXXXX XXXXXX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: When I wrote customer service, I was promptly given a polite letter with a RMA# (return merchandise authorization number) and the full amount of $129.99 was credited to my PayPal account, where I am awaiting transfer to my checking account; so then, my out-of pocket expense was just $3.99 return postage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> Well, the first container worked well, then I took a short break while ordering and receiving my second container.  My lashes are not responding as well to this second container.  I did not see a date on this package as with my first package.  I do not think my lashes are responding as well to this container, or they have stopped responding to City Lash Eyelash Enhancer all together wish I suspect is what has happened.  I am still applying the he&#x27;ll to my lashes unless my lashes fall out all together.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a week. It  made my eyes itch and product is overrated for the price that they charge.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. I&#x27;ve been using it for ten weeks with no results. It also burns like crazy if it gets into your eyes.</li>
            <li> The extension of this product on my lashes was phenomenal. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a fuller, longer lash!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it clever, how in the remarkably tiny photos, all the ladies grew a fine line of eyeliner to indicate questionable eyelash growth?  I tried it, and I was sorely disappointed.  I think I&#x27;ll just buy a $5 eyeliner pencil and fake it like the photos!  If you&#x27;re interested in trying this, note that the photos are REALLY tiny, and for good reason.  I believe they think you won&#x27;t be able to see the eyeliner they added to make it look like model&#x27;s eyelashes are fuller.  I simply magnified the photos, then it&#x27;s obvious.  You&#x27;ve got to consider -- if this product actually did what all their WORDS say, the photograph would be large AND look like NATURAL lashes, all WITHOUT the phony enhancement of eyeliner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the same deception as when the mascara companies use models wearing FALSE eyelashes.  The difference, however, is that many of them admit their deception,...but in the smallest magazine type size, and buried somewhere in the advertising gobbledygook!  You&#x27;ll notice that disclaimer in TV commercials as well, but it&#x27;ll only up for a fraction of a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this lying and deception will come back to bite them all eventually -- I hope beauty product makers note this!  Women get angry when being lied to!</li>
            <li> At the ripe old age of 68, I still want to look as good as I possibly can. Most products are geared for younger women but the reviews I read for City Lash Eyelash Enhancer were positive and testimonies raved at the benefits for all. Three months later..... my lashes, which were basically non-existent, are thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a company that understands that women of all ages want to live their BEST life and that means looking our best in every way!</li>
            <li> City Lash works like it is supposed to.  I used to use Latisse but this works just as well if not better and is so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I would give City Lash ten stars if I could.  Why? Because it really works.  I know you have read reviews like this before, then you get the product and are disappointed, you won&#x27;t be with City Lash.  I was using another lash enhancer, a very expensive one, my eyelashes were falling out, within a week of using city lash that had quit happening, and within two weeks I started to see a difference in the length of my lashes.  After the 42 day growth cycle you will be amazed at how great your lashes look.  Give City Lash a fair try of at least a month and you will see what a difference it makes.  I really can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product, i love it , it gave me my lashes back, and it makes me feel great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I started using City Lash Eyelash Enhancer about a month ago, and started seeing noticeable improvement within the first couple of weeks.  I use it in the morning before applying my mascara, and also after removing my makeup, before bed.  My eyelashes are definitely thicker, longer, and more supple.  I have tried other products that make similar claims, but City Lash delivers on their promises!</li>
            <li> This product had high ratings, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I used Marini lash in the past, as it was recommended by a nurse in my dermatologist&#x27;s office, and it worked very well.  When I saw this rated higher than the Marini product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It has been a month, and I have seen no results.  Also, you have to be very careful with it.  The vapor from it gets into your eyes and it burns.  I&#x27;m going back to a product that really works,  City Lash failed miserably.</li>
            <li> It seems to be as good or better than Rapid Lash.  However, one set of lashes r longer then the other set. for whatever reason!</li>
            <li> Though the product is suppose to give thicker eye lashes in 45 days, it doesn&#x27;t because you will not be able to wear it that long.  It causes extreme burning of the eyes.  Though you may have thicker eye lashes, the only thing people will notice is that your eyes are bloody and irritated.  This product brings a new meaning to the zombie movie title, &amp;#34;48-day later.&amp;#34; Unless you&#x27;re into torture, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> City Lash might aptly be called Lash In A Flash because in a flash is how quickly I saw improvement, on both my lashes and eyebrows.  Seriously, in a matter of two days I noticed a difference and have seen steady improvement over the last three months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried numerous cosmetic products over the years that didn&#x27;t deliver on their promise.  Not so with City Lash.  City Lash over-delivered and astonished.  Oh, and, by-the-way, it&#x27;s all natural and comes with a 60-day money back guarantee.  And their service is quick and consistent.  I always receive my order in three days.  I highly recommend you try City Lash if you want to grow your lash and brows in a hurry, with no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to prepare you, though, that on a few occasions when I have gotten this product in my eyes, it did sting.  I don&#x27;t know if that will be true for everyone.  I&#x27;m a highly sensitive person and often have reactions to things that others don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I&#x27;ve learned in dealing with my high sensitivity is that if I freak out when I have a reaction to something, it will get worse.  If I stay calm the effects will be minimal.  Knowing that the product is all natural helps.  I keep blinking to wash the product out of my eyes, and remember to breathe (which helps to keep me calm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sting usually goes away in about five minutes.  Most days I don&#x27;t get any in my eyes.  For those times when I do, the fabulous results from this product are well worth the slight inconvenience of a little sting and redness.  Well worth the inconvenience because having my brows and lashes fuller is making me look younger.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, consistently (every night) for 3 months and have noticed that my eye lashes appear more full.  I had some that had been broken off and this product has helped them grow back.  I must admit, that I did not notice a difference until I started using the product daily and am now very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with City Lash product that is suppose to grow your lashes.  I purchased the product directly from City Lash and have been using it for over three months.  My lashes have grown very little.  The product does NOT WORK!!  I had started with another lash company and my lashes actually grew much longer but I ran out of the product so I decided to try City Lash, mainly because it is less expensive, well, the old adage is true.....you get what you pay for.  The competitors product works very well land I shall go back to using it.  Hope this helps someone who is thinking about using City Lash.</li>
            <li> I had been using Latisse since it came on the market (under my Doctor&#x27;s care) although the Latisse works it does cause eyelid staining, roughness of the skin, redness and itching. You also have to be vigilant to make sure it does not get in the eye as it will permanently discolor the whites and the iris of light colored eyes. Stay with me…..I tried several over the counter eyelash enhancers which were expensive and worthless.  I had used City Lips and knew it worked so I read the info on City Lash and bought it…………started using it about 6 months ago and have never looked back…..it does the same if not better job than Latisse. No worries about eye discoloration, no redness, itching, breakouts on the eyelid. It is amazing, easy application….great packaging, great product. In addition I have applied it to some thinning spots in my eyebrow area and am seeing re-growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any new product you should do a patch test to see if you have a reaction to any of the ingredients. This line of products is amazing, great thought has gone in to what people really need and what truly works.</li>
            <li> I use the City Lash Enhancer when I want more of a dramatic look and I am really happy with this product. I&#x27;m not a fan of heavy make-up and with City Lash I literally don&#x27;t need anything else on my eyes. I use this product all by itself with a little lip gloss and I&#x27;m set for the day. It&#x27;s truly a girl&#x27;s MUST HAVE item!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 months, at times skipping 2-3 days though. It says to use it every day. It does work, a little slow, but I see the results. My lashes do not fall as often any more, so the life cycle is a lot longer now, and because of that the lash line became much fuller. Also, you can at times get this product off of the actually city cosmetics website much cheaper. The first time I bought it, I signed up for their e-mail notification on the website, and as a first time customer they give you a huge discount,  the product cost me $49.99  the first time. The second time I received a 25% coupon from City Lash through e-mail notifications, and got it for about $56. And they keep e-mailing me all kinds of offers for their products now. Another thing, it said it does not irritate your eyes, however, it burned mine when I accidently got it in my eye, so I try to be very careful from now on and apply it ONLY on the lash line, and not blink as often until the stuff dries on the eye. I do recommend this product if you are trying to have fuller eyelashes. I think it helps the lengths a bit too, but mostly it keeps your lashes from falling out and staying in longer, giving you a fuller look. I wish I could upload a picture to show my results, but I don&#x27;t think I can for this product for some reason.....</li>
            <li> I like how this product did not have harsh ingredients or make hair grow on my face, where I didn&#x27;t want hair. Other products I&#x27;ve bought before did that.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m to old but I could not tell a difference after using it for 8 weeks.  My age may be a factor.</li>
            <li> Although, I never spent much on something for eye lashes I took a chance on this product. I am glad I did end up buying this item. I will never buy cheap eye lash products again. This product does not leave clumps on my lashes. Also, I love how my lashes look while wearing City Lash. Some of my friends recently commented on how nice my eye lashes look. They look fuller and healthier. I even let one of my friends try it out. She plans on buying this product as well. Women love to look nice!</li>
            <li> I had very short tiny lashes. I have always worn lash primer under my mascara just so you could see them. With city lash they are growing. YEA! The applicator is so easy to use no wasted product. I have very sensitive skin and not one single problem. I love this product. I just wish I would have tried it sooner.</li>
            <li> Over a month has gone by with absolutely no difference, and I&#x27;ve been applying as directed. Will finish the bottle and wait, but so far seems to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 30+ days and have not seen any difference in my eyelashes. Also this product if you get it in the eyes stings. I will continue to use since I paid close to $70.00 but unless my eyelashes grow or thicken I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I once had beautiful lashes, but at 61 they became sparser and looked shorter. I decided to give City Lash a try. I started to use it about nine months ago. My lashes may not be what they were at 20, but there is a noticeable difference -- and to me that&#x27;s a successful product.</li>
            <li> after using city lash for 2 months my lashes are still thin..I have to apply a lot of mascara to see my lashes</li>
            <li> Really gave me longer thicker lashes after about a month. Not like up to my eyebrows or anything, but I could definitely tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I have found City Eyelash Enhancer to deliver exceptional results! I had never tried any of the eyelash enhancers out there but I am glad I started with City Lash. It is not only affordable but it works. I have noticed my lashes have become darker as well as longer! I have also been applying City Lash to the sparse areas of my eye brows due over tweezing. I have noticed improvements in my brow area with City Lash which I am extremely thankful for as I did not think there was ever going to be a product to help with sparse brows!!! Overall, I am extremely pleased with the results and encourage to try and see how it works. I use several of the other products City Cosmetics has with their skincare line and City Lips line and have not been disappointed yet!</li>
            <li> I love City Lash!  I have tried other eyelash enhancers with no noticeable results but City Lash gave me longer, fuller lashes.  This product is reasonably priced and worth every penny.  I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple serums with variable results - this one among them - I used it for 2 mos - and found no benefit whatsoever</li>
            <li> I am a 68-year-old Scandinavian woman. In my family, we joke about having &amp;#34;invisible eyelashes.&amp;#34; I started using Latisse about two years ago. It did make my lashes noticeably longer. Not Bollywood long, but definitely more than nature gave me. When I tried going without Latisse, they would start disappearing within a month.  At my last checkup, my optometrist told me he didn&#x27;t think it was safe to use Latisse unless I had my eye pressure checked regularly. I switched to City Lash about 6 weeks ago. I can still see my eye lashes! I think they are about the same respectable length as when I was using Latisse. One warning, though. City Lash stings like crazy if you accidentally get in in your eye.</li>
            <li> After applying lashes for several years, I noticed that my natural lashes were looking fairly thin and not as plush as I wanted them to. I knew this was a bit pricey and I was kind of hesitant in making the purchase, but I believe it was really a great investment. I started with the 30 day supply and immediately saw a difference at the end of that month. I was hooked and bought the 3 month supply. After using it for the past four months, my lashes are full and thick-- even better than they were before my fake lash application. I have recommended it to many friends and a few have purchased it so far and they are definitely pleased! I know it&#x27;s expensive... but it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy, especially if you&#x27;re unhappy with your lash fullness and length.</li>
            <li> I noticed more lashes after the second week of use.  I did not notice much length until just now which is about 5 weeks of consistently using. I used to have the annoying issue of my lashes falling in my eyes, this stopped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative experience I&#x27;ve had so far, since it&#x27;s allergy season I rub my eyes a lot.  After the first time of rubbing my eyes I placed City Lash on soon after and it burned and was really uncomfortable.  My only warning so far but the product is showing noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. It&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of prescription products on the market, and it still delivers pretty good results.  My only warning is to be careful not to get it in your eye, or on your skin.  They warn you and it&#x27;s for real.  Otherwise, give this product a shot if you&#x27;re not into falsies an want some great lashes!</li>
            <li> Bought this for thinning eyelashes (65 yr old female) who had noticed some stunting in the growth.  Have used regularly and believe that there is improvement in my lashes.  At least they are better then they were, but not as great as they once were.</li>
            <li> My wife was always complaining about her short, uneven eye lashes. She wanted to get some work done on them as soon as possible. I found this product online and decided to buy it for her. When City Lash came in, she was excited and started using it immediately. The product was designed for 42 days, but after 36 days I already noticed that her eye lashes began looking thicker and longer. She also mentioned that she had to switch mascaras to accommodate her new, natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product saved me a ton of money on doctor consultation fees and facial enhancement surgery. I highly recommend this product! I also purchased City Lips for my daughter and would have to say that this company is doing something right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and they worked but not as well as City Lash. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I must say that I have an average pair of lashes. They are average length and thickness. I usually use mascara that is supposed to thick and lengthen my brows. Sadly, the mascara I used only made them darker and full of wet gunk! I actually swore off mascara after using a brand that irritated my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a job now that requires me to meet new people each and every day. I want to put my best foot forward which includes making sure I am confident in my looks. I resorted to getting fake lashes but it requires too much time and they have a tendency to fall off. After searching Google for a better mascara, I came across City Lash. I went to the site and read about how this product would actually grow my lashes and make them thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited until I saw the price. It is pretty pricey so I needed to assess how badly I needed this. I decided that at the end of the day, as much money as I spent on going to a stylists to apply fake lashes, I would rather spend on a product to boost my own. I am happy to say, this product is awesome!!!!!!!! I ordered from the site and I could hardly wait for it to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over a month and I see a drastic difference. There is no eye irritation and my lashes are noticeably thinker and a bit longer. I will continue to use until I get my desired look. I waited a while to review this product because I wanted o give it time to work. I am so happy I decided to give up the fake lashes and use City Lash to nurture my grow my own. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I have very small eye lashes to begin with so it&#x27;s even hard for me to apply mascara in the first place but after using this product for about five weeks or so, I am noticing a pretty big difference. I noticed my eye lashes are longer, about twice as long and even a bit fuller. The best part is, this is REAL mascara so you can just use it as your every day mascara, while it does it&#x27;s magic and helps your eye lashes grow.</li>
            <li> I have been using City Lash for over a month now.  The only thing I have noticed is that my lashes do not seem to be a brittle as they used to be.  I do not see any difference in length or thickness.  I bought 2 containers may send the one back for refund.  If it runs in your eye it does burn a little which is hard not to do when you are trying to get it onto the corners of eyelash bases.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t change my lashes at all. I am rather disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months and my lashes have doubled in length. They are also darker and have more volume. I also love how easy it is to use, and if you have sparse eyebrow hairs, City Lash also works well on them too. I recommend this product highly! There are risks with this product too such as itching and burning, so I would practice caution with this product as with any comestic product.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t seen an improvement in the lash dept.  lengthwise or in volume.  But I&#x27;ll continue to use this product and maybe something good will happen.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for 3 weeks.  I can see a difference.  Hopefully the longer I use it the better the results. I have had excellant results with every product I have purchased from you so I expect the same with this.  I gave it four stars because of the short time I have used it.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my girlfriend and she loved it. This product make her eye more sexier. It makes it darker and longer for the eyelash which make her eye more appealing. Using this product always maked her eyelash longer within a week. Highly recommend product for females.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars, I would.  This product doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I also missed the fine print about getting a refund before 60 days, so it&#x27;s my fault I lost out.  Do not waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month. I think I can tell a difference, but the result is not quite fast and shocking. It also causes slight burning on the upper lid.</li>
            <li> I saw little of no difference while using this product.  If anything it caused my eyelids under the lash line to get thicker.</li>
            <li> Sensitive buyers beware.  After faithfully using City Lash Growth Enhancer once daily for 3-4 weeks I began to experience serious redness, swelling &amp; itchiness in my eyes.  I stopped using the product immediately.  Visene cleared symptoms in a few days.</li>
            <li> lashes are definitely fuller but the results take a while to notice. 40 days or more. Rivitalash works much better  but this stuff does the job too. You just have to be patient</li>
            <li> waste of money. Thought this product would help. I found a beutedeparis product that was much better</li>
            <li> Sadly this product did NOTwork at all for me. I&#x27;ve used it everyday with out exception and nothing is happening.</li>
            <li> This works good for eyelashes.  Mine are some thicker and longer, but are still very fine.  It does sting and makes my eyes red, thus the 4 stars, but not bad or for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; is for what it did for my eyebrows!  I had one that was great and one that was sparse and I always had to fill it in with pencil.  I used City Lash on it and it now is as full as the other one.  And I didn&#x27;t even use it as directed!  Just wiped whatever was left on the brush after doing my eyes on that eyebrow.  The difference is amazing.  I wish I had taken a before and after picture, but I actually didn&#x27;t expect such dramatic results.  I am a believer!</li>
            <li> This product does seems to grow lashes a little thicker and longer than not using anything, so it has value. I have blond lashes and it didn&#x27;t darken them at all, It also does not make your eyes red like Latisse.</li>
            <li> I am waiting to give this review an honest review after finishing the entire tube.  So far I have noticed the length of my lashes improving but I have not noticed the thickness improving.  I have been using it on my eyebrows too and they seem thicker and fuller.  Waiting to see because I know the natural cycle of lashes to regrow under normal conditions (w/o enhancements) is not overnight.</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed a product before, but am compelled to do so here because of the stellar results using City Lash. I am 68, and for years had lamented my increasingly sparse eyelashes -such that trying to use mascara was almost useless. I started using City Lash in February, and though the results were slow in coming, by the second month there was a huge difference, and even more so now, in July. To begin with, I applied every night; now, just once or twice a week. The difference is wonderful! My lashes are longer and fuller than they were when I was young, but not in a &#x27;too much&#x27; way. It does burn a bit if you poke your eye, but no worse than shampoo - and blinks away immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Last, I am still using the original applicator, so the price, spread over 5 months so far, is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about using this product as I had tried so many others and had little results for my eyelashes that now had basically bald spots from stress but I read an article on the best products to use and City Lash was on the top so I decided to give it a try and am so happy I did. My lashes now look fuller and I am no longer self-conscious about the gaps in my lashes. I would definitely recommend City Lash!!</li>
            <li> I had been using Lilash for some time but with limited results. I finally did an extensive review of other eyelash enhancing products and came across City lash. it seemed to good to be true so I was skeptical, but thought at the lower price, it was worth a shot. So glad I did! its&#x27; only my third week using it and my lashes feel so much more substantive. They are VERY visible (yeah!) and I have every reason to believe as the weeks go by that my results will continue to be impressive. Very pleased I did that search!</li>
            <li> My mother, my sister, and I all purchased City Lash at the same time and started using it at the same time. I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day - I don&#x27;t know if my mother and my sister are as diligent, but I can tell you that not one of us has noticed any difference in our lashes or brows. I took before pictures and I look exactly the same. I know my lashes can grow - my sister and I used RapidLash several years ago and had new eyelashes sprouting in every direction from the first tube, but tried a second tube and did not see the same results. We&#x27;ve tried several others and now City Lash. We&#x27;ll just add City Lash to the list of enhancers that don&#x27;t work. I am going to give RapidLash another try. Maybe it&#x27;s been long enough since the last time and I&#x27;ll see good result again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had unremarkable lashes all my life.  I wanted this product because it has a higher concentration of the important ingredients, without the danger of making dark flecks on my irises.  I wash off my makeup with good quality soap before bed. I use Refresh eye ointment or drops, and the eyes and lashes remain nice and moisturized all night.  In the morning I \\&quot;prep\\&quot; my lids with a nice hot washcloth compress for a minute before applying City Lash.  In 5 weeks the thickness as well as the length have doubled.  Woo hoo!  I DO have great lashes after all.  My glasses no longer hide my great eyes!</li>
            <li> I have been trying City Lash for one week, based on the glowing review in their advertisement.  I have seen NO difference in the thickness or length of my lashes, but on the third day I developed my first ever eye infection, requiring a visit to my opthamologist and an expensive prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes are burning, red, and itching.  My eyelashes are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will contact the company to see how they handle a return.</li>
            <li> stopped using...burns eyes..latissee does not</li>
            <li> Excellent product....will order again</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 6 weeks. Lashes are probably twice as long as they were a few months ago and even though they&#x27;re not quite as thick as I want yet, I definately have more than I had before. I actually noticed a few weirdly long ones at about 2 weeks and after probably a month the rest of them had caught up. About week 6 I noticed a lot of new short lashes growing in and now they&#x27;re almost as long as the rest. It works for me...and the results were fast! I&#x27;ll post another update in a month or so and let you know if it keeps improving. It&#x27;s a good price, too. I will keep on buying it.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;m 57, so it DOES help older thinning lashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other lash lengtheners before and had okay results but I decided to try City Lash after reading a review of it. I have to say the results have been pretty impressive. I had lost a lot of lashes and had some bald spots and brittle lashes but after using City Lash for only a week they&#x27;re SOOOO much better. I can see that they&#x27;re longer and thicker and I&#x27;m so much happier now!</li>
            <li> I was taken in by the brilliant add. It gave a very logical analysis of why this is a superior product. I should have realized that it as a scam when the pop up insisting that I buy more of the product right away before the  offer ended. I used it for 12 days when I got an eye lid infection. Matisse gives you a new applicator for each eye and for each night that it is used. This product is a FRAUD!!!</li>
            <li> I see no difference, in fact, my lashes seem to be thinner.</li>
            <li> Wish this worked. It didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was sitting across the table from friends at lunch one day..and my one friend JE asked what I was doing...my lashes were so long..may just be the city lash!!!!  easy to apply</li>
            <li> I never wanted to try Latisse because I have very blue eyes and brown pigment would look odd. When I found out about City Lash and its ingredients, I decided to give it a try. I was really interested in trying it on my thin eyebrows. My eyelashes are really OK but who couldn&#x27;t use a little more length and thickness?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always careful around my eyes. I wipe the brush off on the inside of the City Lash bottle so I don&#x27;t get a whole brushful of liquid at one time. It doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes and I&#x27;ve never experienced any irritation from using it.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the great news - my eyebrows are filling in. Those bare spots and thin parts are looking better and better. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks (nothing works overnight) and I&#x27;m very impressed. New growth in areas that hadn&#x27;t had brows in years. I overplucked in my teens and they didn&#x27;t grow back.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m very satisfied with City Lash and City Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> CityLash reviews were high, which is why I purchased this brand. I have in the past used other similar products, such as Latisse, with great results. However, since Latisse is very expensive, and I was looking for an alternative that was not quite as expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;City Lash not only burns (which is not an experience that I have had with other eyelash enhancer products), and I have not seen any results after a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Another great product from City Cosmetics! I used to have amazing eyelashes that everyone commented on and I never used mascara (quite frankly, it made me look like a clown). I guess it&#x27;s a sign of aging that my lashes have been getting thinner and thinner over the years. Now, they&#x27;re not lush at all, which made me sad.&lt;br /&gt;Since I enjoy other City products, I decided to try their eyelash enhancer. It actually works! My lashes aren&#x27;t quite the way they were before, but they certainly don&#x27;t need mascara, which pleases this busy mama. Also, there&#x27;s nothing nasty in this enhancer, which is always a concern when putting stuff near your eyes.</li>
            <li> It did not work as well as other eye lash conditioners I have used.  Will go back to my old one.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but have noticed a tiny difference, not enough to justify the cost.  Save your money</li>
            <li> Very poor results.It was cheaper than Lilash that I tried before and had great results.You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I tried this product once a day for 2 months and did not see any change. I switched to Latisse and got amazing results. Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to it&#x27;s promise and made no difference at all to my eyelashes</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t happened as fast as some people said but I am seventy and my lashes were so thin and this definitely  helped but took a little longer. I would say maybe 6 weeks. I&#x27;m very glad I tried it.I also wanted you to know that some people said it burned their eyes, I had no problem with that at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my eyelashes. It does seem to help regrow my eyebrows.I still have 2 more weeks to go for the growing cycle, however. The product is gentle. It doesn&#x27;t burn. My eyes are watery so it doesn&#x27;t stay on my eyelashes! I have noticed new hairs coming in on my eyebrows! My eyebrows have always been sparse! They are getting thicker. I will buy City Lash again for my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Before using this product I took pictures of my lashes. I then used it every morning after 6 weeks I compared with the original pictures and found no difference but I still had hope that with more time I would see an improvement so I continued to use it until the tube was empty and still saw no difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me, and I used it religiously......ill stick with Li-Lash</li>
            <li> Love it...works great! It has enhanced my lashes beautifully in under 2 weeks! I don&#x27;t need to use liner anymore because my lashes are so lush!</li>
            <li> WHY I LOVE CITY LASH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE CITY LASH BECAUSE IT LENGTHENS MY EYE LASHES AND MAKES THEM LOOK LIKE THEY ARE CURLED.  THE CITY LASH ALSO MAKES MY LASHEA  FULLER MAKING MY EYES LOOK LARGER LIKE THEY USED TO BE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.  CITY LASH ALSO MAKES MY EYES LOOK LIKE I HAVE EYE LINER ON WHICH IS A FABULOUS ENHANCER TO MY FACE.  I AM SO HAPPY WITH CITY&#x27;S  PRODUCTS AND MUST BE GRATEFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND A PRODUCT THAT I LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> I was using Nutraluxe Lash MD eyelash which worked great! I figured let me try a different kind. I read the review so I ordered it. I barely saw a difference Waited for 3 months. Nothing. Also it&#x27;s overpriced. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I went back to Nutraluxe Lash MD Eyelash- after couple of weeks I see the difference.</li>
            <li> Did not work and I&#x27;m still using it everyday with hope but so far...nothing.  I had really hoped this would work and have been very disappointed to find it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all.  After 3 mos of using it there was absolutely no lash growth at all but I did get an allergic reaction to it which caused a itchy bump close to my eye.  I had tried two other lash enhancers in the past which also did nothing for me.  I think some people are just not going to have any positive response to these products.  I happen to be one of them. C&#x27;est la vie!</li>
            <li> it might as well have been just water. i used it faithfully and saw no results. i did not irratate my.</li>
            <li> Used it for one year faithfully. I did not show any difference. I a year previously, I used Lattice but;it was expensive. Lattice gave me back my lashes from my twenties.</li>
            <li> Product works as promised.  Keep it only on the lash base and out of your eyes.  Better results than with LiLash.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good lash enhancer but I found another product that is less expensive and works much better - Smartlash!</li>
            <li> I started out with revitalash and it was okay.  Then,  a friend suggested Li-lash and I loved it.  Stupidly,  I read the reviews for City Lash, believed them and bought two.  Within 3 months my lashes and eyebrows were back to the original short/thin.  Threw out both City Lashes - what a waste of time and money.  Back to Li Lash and my lashes and brows are finally growing and darker.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on City Lash.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin, I love my products. I am obsessed with mascara and having long full lashes -- unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t born with these and have tried everything under the sun. CityLash, is the only eyelash product that I have tried that really works. My lashes are noticeably fuller, longer, and only look even better with mascara on top. I noticed a difference after my first week of use.</li>
            <li> It is too early on for me to see the total effects as I have only been using the product for 3 weeks, but there is a noticable difference in the length of the lashes.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes still short :( I started about 3 weeks ago, Nothing happen yet, I was hoping it would work</li>
            <li> City Lash is a fantastic method to volumize eye lashes and give them glamour that reminds us all of the stars of yesteryear. I particularly liked using City Lash because it of its all natural approach and its organic means of stimulating eye lash growth. There are no chemicals and no additives, thus it is very safe to use. Within days of use, I noticed a difference, a thickening in my eye lashes. Considering I have very sensitive eyes, I was delighted in suffering no irritation or allergy to the product.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I personally will get behind. About 4 months ago I was with friends who were goofing around with lighters, and I had an accident where my eye lashed were burnt off pretty bad. I was so upset, but my sister told me about this product and how it had helped her thin lashes grow and become fuller, so I thought why not and tried it.  I have to say this product was a God send. My lashes are now back, but even better they are full and long. I find that now I get compliments about how beautiful my lashes are. I didn&#x27;t think the cost is that crazy, compared to all other beauty products. I would say this is a product that any girl should have in their make-up collection, 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Tried it...burns my eyes like crazy!!!!  Tried to keep using it....have not seen any results.  I&#x27;ll pass on using this product.</li>
            <li> still not using for 46 days; not much difference at this point.</li>
            <li> the product cam prove its claims, more beautiful eyelashes,</li>
            <li> It works great for my girlfriend. Only issue is shipping took longer than expected</li>
            <li> Persuasive reviews on the internet typically I find useless since negative&lt;br /&gt;opinions fail to measure any sort of reasoning what so ever. After&lt;br /&gt;Purchased the eye lash enhancer on a whim and receiving the item within 3 days&lt;br /&gt;(stunning service) I set out to follow the instructions by applying twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;In the last part of week #3 and the liquid actually succeeds in making the lashes&lt;br /&gt;healthier and they are growing thicker, longer. Use care not to splash into your eyes,&lt;br /&gt;follow the video and BE PATIENT please.&lt;br /&gt;61 years old and I am a believer. I do not spend any time at the department store&lt;br /&gt;cosmetics counter.&lt;br /&gt;Drew (Boston)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work...I used it for 4 weeks and almost no added growth to my missing eye lashes, at all; even left on their own they would have grown the 1/16th of an inch that happened.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash enhancer I have ever used.  My lashes have never been very long, and they are still not &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34; long, but they are definitely longer than before City Lash.  Enough that they can actually be seen without mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many of the products you can buy from the major cosmetic retailers to lengthen lashes - from serums to mascaras.  None seemed to make a difference, except in my wallet.  I have never tried Latisse and will not as I have blue/green eyes and do not want to risk changing the iris color.  I was skeptical about trying City Lash because of the lack of success with other products (some of which irritated my eyes and lids).  I did not experience the irritation with City Lash, and although it took several weeks to notice a difference, I finally did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to have found this product and would recommend giving it a try.  I am sure it is not for everyone, but I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I use Latisse and I really like it. I have to be very cautious when applying it because it does make my eyes red and burn. I wanted to try something that had the same results but didn&#x27;t have the same side effects so I have just started using City Lash about a month ago. It is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t have to wait until bedtime to put it on. You can put it on like eyeliner (like Latisse) then let it dry for a bit, then apply your makeup as usual. I can wear my contacts and it just is more flexible than Latisse in use. So far I have had no side effects and my lashes are maintained at the same length and  thickness as Latisse had. City lash is a bit less expensive and I am pleased with the results. I don&#x27;t work for the company and have used a couple of their other products that I am also pleased with.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly figured the item was returnable if it didn&#x27;t work since all City Lash&#x27;s ads say 100% guarantee or will refund. Lesson learned. Don&#x27;t but from other sellers!</li>
            <li> I have been using this faithfully for just shy of 2 months and haven&#x27;t see much of ANYTHING!  I was so hoping it would help!  I used another product &amp;#34;Smart Last&amp;#34; for 1/3 the price and had MUCH better results!!!  I&#x27;m NOT impresses!  &amp;#62;:o(</li>
            <li> As a natural blonde with white eyelashes, I didn&#x27;t expect my lashes to get darker, and they haven&#x27;t.  However, after two weeks of nightly use, they are longer and more dramatic.  And there is no puffy, redness and irritation like I had with Latisse!</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully every night for 6 weeks and could not tell a difference. I went back to Li Lash which I had used before and worked well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read the reviews that said this product doesn&#x27;t work, but also read the ones that were complimentary.  I should have believed the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Product is great but I was told this was NEW, it was not.  It was loose in a box (no insert in box) and not full, I&#x27;ve ordered directly from the manufacturer before so I know what it is supposed to look like when NEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is wonderful but I will never order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It says 42 days and in 30 days I had thicker lashes. In 42 days they were growing. I have very fair skin with black lashes and eyebrows so it was very easy for me to see the difference. I have some eyebrow problems due to an autoimmune disease and while I don&#x27;t have my full eyebrows back, they are presentable and easy to fill in with dark eye shadow (looks more natural than pencil.) Yes, it&#x27;s pricey but it&#x27;s a matter of what&#x27;s important to you. Getting older and having a chronic disease, this product gave me a new lease on life. Keep in mind, there is a small percentage that it won&#x27;t work for. And don&#x27;t forget to use as directed.</li>
            <li> I started using this product the minute it arrived.  After about three weeks I not only saw thicker lash growth, but my lashes were darker.  They also were noticeably longer, so now I sometimes go without mascara.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and my lashes were defiantly thinning....so happy with this product:)</li>
            <li> Love this for my eyelashes! They are stronger, thicker, and longer. My lashes don&#x27;t fall out. I love this!</li>
            <li> no impact what do I do to return?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using city lash for more than 40 days now. The first week I used it I noticed that my eye lashes started falling and I emailed customer service asking if this is a normal reaction. They replay saying that I should be patient and give the product time to see result and I did. Now after 40 days of using the products my eye lashes are still falling and I notice no growth or length!! I&#x27;m shipping the product back and hopefully I get my money refund but nothing can make up for my falling eyelashes. This product harmed me and I regret using it..</li>
            <li> This product did start to work but after 6 months of nightly applications. So if you are in a time restraint, like I was, trying to get longer lashes for a family wedding. Buy Careprost. Not this product.</li>
            <li> City Lash by City Cosmetics is a non-prescription eyelash enhancer that promises longer, darker, more dramatic eyelashes in 42 days.  Its makers claim that its unique proprietary formula will stimulate eyelash growth and extend the natural life cycle of the lash.  This helps, they claim, to thicken and lengthen the lash bed and keep older lashes from falling out, and will result in dramatic visible results. Eyelash enhancers, which are becoming very popular, they state, have been proven in numerous studies to increase your lash line by up to 70%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, many so-called eyelash enhancers can’t actually do the job: they are formulated mainly with inexpensive mineral oil, whereas CityLash uses Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 as its main active ingredient. The makers state that this ingredient has been proven through many clinical trials to get results - with the average being 54% and the highest at 72% increase in lash line. They add that CityLash is one of the few commercially available products that uses this ingredient in the concentration required to work.  Furthermore, they stand behind it:  they state that if you don&#x27;t get the claimed results with CityLash, as with all their products, they will give you a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturers further claim that, unlike other lash-enhancing products, CityLash is safe, even for the most sensitive skin and eyes, is natural and fragrance free, can be safely used on eyebrows as well, and, like all CITY Cosmetics, is not tested on animals.  Finally, they state that CityLash does not contain paraben or prostaglandin like other products. Prostaglandin may cause permanent color changes in your eyes and skin, as well as irritation and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product should be used once daily, according to your usual beauty regimen, applied to the base of the upper eyelids, and allowed to dry for several minutes.  It should not be applied to lower lashes or other skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became acquainted with this firm a few months ago, when I discovered their eye cream and liked its results.  So I decided to try this product.  It is natural for people as they age to lose their eyelashes, on top of which, I once had the bad nervous habit of tearing them out.  So my eyelashes are even sparser than most people’s, and I have tried many, many products to aid in their growth.  Some of those products did seem to be mainly mineral oil, or petroleum jelly, and, while inexpensive, were not very helpful.  LaTrisse, the prescription product is harder to get, expensive, irritated my eyelids, and, although it worked well, required use forevermore to retain the regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CityLash is more expensive than many other available eyelash enhancers.  I have found that it irritates both my eyes and my eyelids a bit, causing my eyes to itch.  I am not sure of its results on my eyelashes, it’s a little hard to see.  But I have found that it has brought about a surprising regrowth of my eyebrows, with  which I wasn’t actually concerned, and, if it can do that, it must be helping my lashes, right?  Worth a try.irm a few months ago, when I discovered their eye cream and liked its results.  So I decided to try this product.

            <li> Works somewhat.  I think my lashes are a little longer but nothing that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> If you have tried any other compared to....this is watery, drips into your eyes stings for a long while, have used every day and nothing is longer or darker. would rather spend a few more dollars and go back to my old faithfull Revitalash. UG what a waste</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the lash enhancers available without prescription, and I used Latisse. Most of them I used for several months and saw no noticeable change in my lashes, but City Lash works, and noticeably works. I am very pleased with this product and even more pleased with the price. I started seeing results in the second week, and have been using it 3 months now and even my son noticed a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is some detail from the manufacturer you may find helpful:\\&quot;City Lash&#x27;s active ingredient is Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 and it is one of the most potent ingredients ever to support eyelash growth. The main reason City Lash is so effective is because they have this listed as the 3rd ingredient on it&#x27;s list - Meaning they are one of the few that use the required amount studies show works. Be careful of other brands that claim to use this ingredient. Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 is very expensive and its rare that products use the right amount.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I highly recommend City Lash! This is one of the few products out there that uses ultra-high quality ingredients and it is affordable, that is a \\&quot;win-win!</li>
            <li> I got this product because the eyelashes on my left eye are always falling out. Within about a week, I could see a difference. My left eyelashes began to fill in and grow longer and it has kept my right eyelashes strong!&lt;br /&gt;There was only one instance where it burned my eyes but that&#x27;s because I put too much on my eyelid and it ran into my eyes. Other than that, it has been wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product received great reviews and I was willing to try it in order to see if it lived up to the hype.  It&#x27;s been several weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement.  I have tried Revitalash and had success with that, but thought it was a good idea to check out the competition.  So far, City Lash hasn&#x27;t been what I expected.  Still, I will use the remainder of the product in order to determine if a longer period of time is needed in order to see the benefits.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a link on the Consumer Reports website that comes directly from City Lash for $49.99. It works as it claims, I have had great success, though not all will, and does in fact have the most, and correct required compound to cause lash growth. Consumer reports studied eyelash enhancers (look on their site) and did ultimately rate this as the best, but they do list the top three and give detailed information about each. They do post a***WARNING** not to purchase from Amazon as they have been found to be fakes. So if you did purchase from here, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I tried City Lash for about 5 weeks. I did not notice a difference in the thickness or length of my lashes or eyebrows. The company was good about taking back the product and refunding the money.</li>
            <li> Not 42 days into use, but seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promptly and in good shape. It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I decided to try it!  I have tried other lash enhancers before.  Nothing has ever worked this fast for me.  It has been 2 weeks, and I already see an amazing result.&lt;br /&gt;Some tips...be sure to NOT get any into your eye..it doesn&#x27;t feel good.  Before you apply make sure you take the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; off the tip of the wand, it will run into your eyes if not careful. It says to not use on bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and I see no change in my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing this product did was make my eyes burn.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost with very little growth - will not be purchasing again. small growth after but not very much!!!!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I purchased this because Amazon no longer carries Li lash which worked amazing. I read some reviews and City lash was rated very well, and compared to Latisse. The first day i tried it, My eye and surrounding lids burned. I decided that possibly it was because I got some in my eye. Every time I have used it, it burns my lash line. I may be sensitive to it, but I did not experience the burning sensation with Li lash and got amazing results. Looks like I am going to have to count this as an expensive loss and purchase the Li lash else where.</li>
            <li> Plus Im a guy. Wish I could upload a pic of before and after. the dramatic before and after look is unbelievable. Length and darker color with this clear last product that does take about 2 or 3 months for full affect. Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> City Lash is the best lash enhancer I have ever used.  It is so easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take but a minute to do both eyes and eyebrows.  I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> I  have to say that I think some of these products work on some people, and on others, they do not.  I have tried them all, including Latisse, and there was only one eyelash enhancer that ever worked.  It was made by some female doctor--have forgotten the name.  Unfortunately, when I placed the second order, they had changed the formula (probably the FDA.). As for the people who said that City Lash caused intense burning, they must have extra sensitive eyes.  I did not think it burned or irritated any more than Latisse (which did not work for me, but it does work for some women I know.)</li>
            <li> Not worth the money for me.....helped alittle but not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes and brows have been sparse for years and recently my eyelashes began falling off/breaking.  I had patches of area on my eye lids where there were no eyelashes at all.  I have used this product for a little over a month and there is a SIGNIFICANT difference in the length and fullness of my brows and eyelashes.  Placing a second order!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, as this doesn&#x27;t work.  Just buy Revitalash, as that stuff works like magic.  THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> notice no different my lashes after I used it all.</li>
            <li> Been using for 28 days and no visible results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a change in my lashes so I used it on my eyebrows as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only using if about a month.  Maybe I have to wait 6 wks or more to see the real results.  I think lashes look a little fuller, but not sure about length.  I think it should have shown more results by now.  I will give it more time &amp; then I&#x27;ll decide whether to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I Bought My City lash From Their Website. I  Mistakingly believed all the great reviews on their website. Maybe it was the wine I was drinking. I already had nice long lashes from using Latisse but thought a  friendlier product that could do the same would be better. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! Within a month I noticed my lashes were thinner. shorter, and the inner corner of one eye had completely lost all its lashes. I started doing more research on reviews from Amazon. Which by the way I consider one of the only places I find to have REAL reviews and not bought, fake, angry, reviews. I saw that many people had similar problems with City Lash. Either no results, loss of lashes, irritation. Congrats to the lucky ones who got results. I am back to Latisse. I am blonde blue eyed. In three years. It has not changed my eyes color. The only thing is it has made my eye lid red at times and if you stops using it your eyelashes do go back to their original state.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is perfect for everyone. City Lash defiantly is not the product for me. I have seen more bad reviews than good on this site.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I used this for close to 2 months and could not notice one bit of difference in my eyelashes.  It was a big disappointment and a waste of money.  Would not recommend.  Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I used City Lash for one week and developed an itching, burning red-eye condition that forced me to stop. Directions say it should be used for 42 consecutive days,so guess I will never know how effective it could be. I will never put it anywhere near my eyes again</li>
            <li> I ordered City Lash a few months ago and have been HOOKED ever since. After using it for just 2 weeks I noticed a really big change in both the thickness and length of my lashes. I don&#x27;t have to pack on the mascara anymore and I feel so much more confident leaving the house without any makeup on! I highly recommend this eyelash enhancer for anyone looking to get thicker lashes - it worked even better for me than Latisse did.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and use this product on both lashes and eyebrows.  I have seen a wonderful improvement in stronger, thicker eyelashes.......yes they do thin with age ladies.  Now my friends as envious as my look so healthy.  I have used other products that promise the moon but simply do not deliver like Latisse, Smart Lash, Revitalash. They key is to use City Lash daily and consistently!!  Do try it out and I am sure you will love it as I do!!</li>
            <li> I have reached the age where I noticed my eyelashes seems shorter and thinner.  I first tried another lash product called RapidLash which did not seem to work.  I even noticed patches where my lashes fell out.  I was skeptical about lash products but decided to give City Lash a try.  I am very pleased with the results.  I have no bare patches now.  My lashes seem uniform and longer.  I still need to wear mascara, but I can say after 3-4 weeks there is a noticeable difference and improvement.  I did not experience any side effects either.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was skeptical at first, but after using City Lash for about 2 weeks I noticed that my lashes were noticeably longer and darker.  I use a variety of products from the City Cosmetics line and I LOVE all of them!!!</li>
            <li> Saw no difference after using the product for 3 months  Very disappointed and didn&#x27;t read the fine print so was unable to return it.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT PRODUCT!!!  I&#x27;ve tried others and none have given results as the Lash Enhancer.  Incredible. Within a month my lashes were longer and thicker -- darker, too.  I tint my lashes every six weeks, but after two months my cosmetician said &amp;#34;you don&#x27;t need a tint...keep using the product your lashes look great!&amp;#34;  Easy to use and no itching or redness like I had with other products. I&#x27;ve given it to friends and they&#x27;ve had the same results.  We all are amazed by the results -- LOVE \City Lash&#x27;s Eyelash Enhancer!!!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift. I accidently cut my eyelashes (It&#x27;s a long story). I ended up getting eyelash extensions but it got to be too expensive. This product actually made my eyelashes grow back and longer! I love this product and it really works! The only con is that you have to use it every single day and I often forgot to use it. You have to use it religiously.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my City Lash results! After about 6 weeks of growth (a little longer than advertised), the bald spot in my lashes completely disappeared! I was getting impatient and about to give up on the product, but hold out a little longer and you will see results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the issues I had with the product (worth putting up with for the awesome result of eyelash growth) are that my lashes feel drier than before, and if the serum gets into your eyes or on the sensitive skin contours of your eyes, it burns and stings really bad (some testimonies state that the serum does not sting-- this is a lie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with the product. It did what it said it was going to do, and it was much more affordable than the comparably-effective competitors.</li>
            <li> My lashes have been thinning over the past few years due to pregnancies, age, stress, etc. I started using the City Lash serum exactly four weeks ago and I have not only noticed that my lashes have stopped falling out (almost immediately after I began using this product), but my once barely there eyelashes are now thicker and fuller AND longer. This stuff works and I have the lashes to prove it. I think they have a lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptical at First, But after 1 week of using City lash I was blown away. The length of my lashes were significantly longer! Before I would use coats and coats of mascara not anymore! I can get away with using just one coat of City lash. So Ladies if you are  looking for a miracle I suggest City lash Hands down.&lt;br /&gt;Palwinder Sharma</li>
            <li> not seeing a bid difference - going by the directions  My plan is to use all of it and if the results are not there then I will go with Latisse</li>
            <li> Its been 4 weeks and so far there is no change. I have used latisse in recent past which worked well and did take up to the 4 months. I will give this more time to see what happens.</li>
            <li> Noticeably thicker longer eyelashes when curled.  Not like mascara can though.&lt;br /&gt;The product stings the eyes if you accidentally get it in them.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;However nothing really can drastically alter the type of eyelashes that you are born with.</li>
            <li> Had product for almost 3 weeks and I use it daily.  I haven&#x27;t notice any changes to my eyelashes.  What a rip off.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that will help strengthen and protect my existing lashes. It did work for me as I saw a decrease in lash breakage and new lashes looked a bit healthier/longer. It didnt give me the wow factor of Latisse, but it was enough for me to be satisfied. Regarding complaints, here is a reality check: the results will vary from person to person (&amp;#34; average being 54% and the highest at 72% increase in lash line&amp;#34;). Because it didnt work for you, it doesn&#x27;t mean the product is a sham. It just means that your lashes might not be receptive to its active main ingredient (Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17). Also, ANYTHING that comes in contact with your eye will cause redness and irritation. Because you use Citylash on the base of your lashes (like an eyeliner), its VERY likely that you will at one point get the solution in your eye. You have to be careful. Im reordering today.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because most of my eyebrows are gone.  Even though I use it daily, I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth in my eye lashes but there is some in my eyebrow area.  Maybe they should rename the product.</li>
            <li> I have used Citi Lash for 2 years  and my eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;Are long and thick. The best I have used. GREAT RESULTS.</li>
            <li> Thought it would make my lashes look ilk they did on Latisee, not even close…  Not sure why this has gotten any good reviews. My lashes are only MARGINALLY thicker, not longer, not darker, really not even thicker. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This works very well!! I had my eyelashes ripped out by false exts...helped them grow back fast and thick! GREAT</li>
            <li> I researched eyelash enhancers before buying this, and it does nothing and costs a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would at least make my eyelashes look darker.  I can see no difference after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really lengthen lashes as much as I had thought.</li>
            <li> My younger brother has the nicest eyelashes I have ever seen. They are thick, full and long. I was born with limp, thin, scraggly looking lashes. Of course, being a girl, I just fixed the problem by applying a ton of mascara. Unfortunately, this did more damage over the years than good. Then I tried City Lash. My lashes perked up and started growing in just a couple of weeks. After a month, I didn&#x27;t even need mascara for my lashes to be noticed. There are no more smudges from mascara on my eyeglasses. Even my brother tells me I have great lashes now.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me--actually I wasn&#x27;t able to give it a good try because it caused such a severe burning sensation that I had to try to rinse it off immediately. When I used Latisse, it did not burn, nor did it do any thing for my lashes.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was always complaining about her eyelashes, saying they were too short and too dull. She wanted to try something like this, so I ordered this for her and she is happier with herself now. It&#x27;s been two weeks since she has started using City Lash and she said that she is seeing results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend City Lash if you want \\&quot;Latisse like\\&quot; results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Latisse through a prescription from my doctor.  It worked great (I have little baby eyeslashes, and pray for gorgeous long full beauties).  I normally wear a lot of mascara or even fake lashes.  I put the Latisse on under my mascara and found that my lashes were around twice as thick in a month.  I even started leaving the house without mascara at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, it was way way way way too much money.  Between the doctor visit and the actual \\&quot;prescription\\&quot; I was out like $300 bucks a pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started looking for over the counter versions.  The only one I have been able to find that compares to the results i got from Latisse is City Lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is soooo much less expensive and appears to work the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer my naturally thick lashes to normal mascara now.  I hated the clumpy look and since I have oily skin my mascara would always end up all over the place, no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Lattise and Lilash and when I read about how great City Lash is I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...my lashes are what they were before I ever started using lash enhancement products.&lt;br /&gt;Not very happy at all.</li>
            <li> When I was young I had thick eyelashes that reached to my eyebrows and long lower lashes too. Then I got old and they went the way of everything else. My lashes got shorter and less thick. I have been using this for a little over two weeks and I can already see a difference lengthwise and I there seems to be more of them too. I am going to give this more time like the directions say but this does seem to be working great. So far I am very pleased and recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that some reviews say it irritated their eyes. I was worried about this because there are even some eye shadows I can&#x27;t use because of the dye in them. I am careful to keep it on my eye lid just above the lashes- like an eyeliner- and so far have had no issues.</li>
            <li> I really like the City Lash because it made my lashes longer and filled in the gaps which made it look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Sorry no change at all</li>
            <li> ★★★★★&lt;br /&gt;I am one of those people who has a hard time wearing mascara and eye makeup because I am constantly touching my eyes and smudging everything. City Lash improved the thickness and length of my lashes so much that it completely eliminated the need for mascara. This is a great alternative to super pricy eyelash extensions that can cost anywhere up to $400. My eyelashes are so much fuller, longer, and lush! This is basically a set of falsies in a bottle. As the product details explain this takes time, at least 40 days.  So be patient - the results will come!</li>
            <li> I used City Lash for three nights and each night my eyes reacted badly - crusty and gooey-eyed.&lt;br /&gt;I would be very careful with this product as it can irritate some people&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> City Lash is an excellent product for anyone who LOVES thick, long lashes and hates the hassle of eyelash extensions or glue-on faux lashes. Regular mascara never did enough for me -- especially not for special occasions. But disposable fake lashes are too annoying to me. I could never get the hang of attaching them correctly. So last year on my birthday I treated myself to my first set of eyelash extensions. I LOVED them for about a month. My lashes looked phenomenal. Unfortunately, the extensions tended not to fall out as they are supposed to. My lashes kept growing and the extensions kept growing out longer. The lashes were a bit too much even though I was going back for maintenance appointments which get expensive. For about four months after my extension experiment, my lashes looked shorter than usual. This is a great product that will allow you to avoid the pitfalls of expensive extensions that after awhile look pretty bad. The product doesn&#x27;t give QUITE the POW of a set of professional extensions. But over the long-haul your lashes will look better and better and better.</li>
            <li> It took a couple months of use to notice my lashes were longer and that they were a little bit fuller than normal.  I used it mostly first thing in the morning and also at night right before bedtime.  Been using it for 4 months now and still have 1/3 of a container left.  Suggestion was to NOT use on lower lashes, due to hair growth on cheeks.  I already have light facial hair on my face so I went ahead and did it anyway, for two months now.  Lower lashes longer and a little bit fuller too.  Neither top or bottom lashes appears darker.  No irritation, redness or anything else bothersome at all.  Really think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT WORK, it crumbled my eyelashes making them worse.  I did everything they said and used it vigilantly and it was horrible.  Because using it the amount of time they say to be successful, you use a lot of the product and when it doesn&#x27;t work, they only refund you $20.00 with the excuse that it can&#x27;t be re sold!  That is robbery in my opinion. If something doesn&#x27;t work, a person should be refunded 100%.  I think this is snake oil and these people should not be allowed to sell it for what they say it is.</li>
            <li> Did not do a thing for my lashes. I also bought extra and gave to my friends, DID NOT DO A THING FOR them either!!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes me sick, false advertising and wasting people&#x27;s money.  Scammers.</li>
            <li> City Lash is probably the best lash extender I&#x27;ve ever tried. Not only did it make my lashes longer, but they became thicker and increased the life of my current lashes. The best part is, that while the product is pricey, it worked even better than a prescription I once used, so it&#x27;s totally worth the price. I also greatly appreciate that this is a cruelty free brand. In my opinion, this is one of the best lash enhancers on the market.</li>
            <li> Packaging was adequate &amp; fine for product. Will be ordering again when I run out. Know it is working cause when I put reading glasses on, it touches the glass!</li>
            <li> I purchased City Lash approximately 6 months ago. I was starting to feel discouraged because it did not appear to be working. I didn&#x27;t start to notice baby lashes growing until approximately 2 months after continued use twice a day. After 4 months of using the product my lashes have become longer and thicker and I am satisfied with the product. I can&#x27;t explain why the product took longer to work than they have stated in their promotions (maybe my age, 51) but I will continue to buy it as I am completely satisfied. My suggestion is to be patient, in the end it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months ( I bought a 3 month supply at the lower price of $129) and there is no difference at all in my lashes. None! Nada! Nothing! This is a total rip off!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> Well tried this serum and the results for my eyelashes was Zero!!!&lt;br /&gt;But then tried it on my eye brows and magic happened!&lt;br /&gt;So Zero for eyelashes,good for eye brows.</li>
            <li> unfortunately did not work at all for me as some reviewers.</li>
            <li> After using it morning and night for 5 weeks I have long full lashes</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any results.</li>
            <li> Great just ordered another one.  Works</li>
            <li> Oh what a horrible waste of time I have used this product for over two 1/2  months and not one bit of difference nothing zero...half way into the use I contacted the company to tell them but they insisted I need to use it more still nothing don&#x27;t waste your money buying this and your time waiting to see EVEN A LITTLE difference...it does not even give a color change..in fact I  am suspect of any of those &amp;#34;rave reviews&amp;#34; . I would give it a ZERO rating but it was not a option</li>
            <li> This really grew my lashes</li>
            <li> This really works I&#x27;ve seen a difference</li>
            <li> It does not make lashes longer and darker!</li>
            <li> Just started using a month ago after using Revitalash for years with great results. Researched this one and it gets stronger ratings. My tip: Use everyday for 3 weeks, then every other day for 3-4 until your full growth cycle is complete. When new ones grow in they are 1/3 + longer and thicker, but you MUST complete a full cycle. After that, use at least 2X a week to maintain them or else they will revert to your former less glorious dust catchers. I am asked whether I have on false eyelashes. Before, they were average only and heavily supplemented by mascara.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my very sparse lashes. A waste of money</li>
