            <li>This was a gift and well liked.</li>
            <li>I worked in a boutique that sold its own line of essentials oils</li>
            <li>I would have been able to say that I loved the set but--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving these oils.</li>
            <li>this is nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice set.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like many of the scents, but still a good product, would recommend it..</li>
            <li>Oils are nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice set.  </li>
            <li>and I liked the pamphlet that came with it.</li>
            <li>Like that I have so many to experiment with and in time will become really good at which to use for what.</li>
            <li>It is a nice beginner set.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, shipping was fast and product was in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Nice starter kit.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are nicely sealed and labeled.</li>

            <li>They were great to work with and the product seems great so far.</li>
            <li>shipped so quickly and was in great shape.</li>
            <li>Resonable price, shipped quickly, and a great starter kit.</li>
            <li>Excellent set of 14 aromatherapy oils, this price is exceptionally reasonable for the outstanding quality.</li>
            <li>The Patchouli oil is very strong, use sparingly.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li>I blended some lavender, sweet orange, and peppermint with some lotion; It smells amazing, lemongrass is really pleasant, too.</li>
            <li>Be nice to have more flowers in kit.</li>
            <li>What a great product, so worth the money.</li>

            <li>They are amazing quality, better than any</li>
            <li>I loved all the scents they were really awesome nice and strong, not like other brands where you can&#x27;t smell them, really made the house smell GREAT!</li>
            <li>I will always be a loyal customer as they have great customer service, high quality products, fair prices, &amp; lightning speed shipping!</li>
            <li>An excellent starter set with a nice variety of essential oils for aromatherapy !</li>
            <li>I compared some of the oils from the competition oil vendors and I like the fabulous frannie oils as good or better smelling.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a great assortment of oils and a great way to try many different oils without a huge expense.</li>
            <li>Can I give more than 5 stars?</li>
            <li>Most of what you need to get started.</li>
            <li>awesome big bang for your buck</li>
            <li>I love each scent.</li>
            <li>Cute lil vials.</li>
            <li>I bought an aromatherapy to make sure it is not just me.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for anyone who is just starting their journey in the world of aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>This beginner set is an excellent step into the world of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Smell great but a couple didn&#x27;t drop very well but for what it cost</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>As a beginner in this hobby I don&#x27;t think you can find a better deal.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m learning more and more about each oil in the box.</li>
            <li>but I love citrus smells, so that works for me.  </li>
            <li>The top on one of my oils was defective and caused a leak in shipping.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was cute and I still keep the oils in the box they came</li>
            <li>The variety is perfect for experimenting with different recipes and remedies.  </li>
            <li>Love these oils, won&#x27;t buy anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I wish they used better packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used for sure.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the quality and will be purchasing from this company again.</li>

            <li>I use an oil burner with the tea light candles.</li>
            <li>Since you get 140ml in this set, it&#x27;s like getting 8 free bottles.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great quality oils I will purchase and recommend again and again.</li>
            <li>that their are so many sample it would be nice to have more information on the various oils</li>

            <li>Wonderful introductory set into Essential Oils for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, Fabulous Frannie&#x27;s oils seem to be good quality, unlike some others I have ordered.</li>

            <li>Thanks fabulous Frannie!</li>
            <li>If I want to  disperse the fragrance in the room I set the disk on my disk lamp witch actually puts out a good amount of heat.  </li>
            <li>but I would have appreciated an additional layer of bubble wrap just to make sure.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and love the product.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend this set and fabulous frannie oils and products!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the various oil scents which come in this set.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this Essential Oil Starter Set.</li>
            <li>So I did pretty good at reading the former reviews.</li>
            <li>Exactly how it was described!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I look forward to concocting more natural products!</li>
            <li>These are great quality, and not wildly expensive as some other brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them a few times with great results.</li>
            <li>the oils are amazing; especially for the cost.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy having the variety of all the scents at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I use them for so many things - bath soaks, muscle rubs, home made &amp;#34;Vicks&amp;#34; for myself and my two year old, migraine relief, etc.</li>
            <li>I feel it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t go as far as better quality oils do.</li>
            <li>They smell nice, Ives used them several times.</li>
            <li>Next I hope to at the cinnamon, because honestly I want to put it in my tea.</li>
            <li>I like floral scents like jasmine and rose, but not lavender which is the only one included in the set.</li>
            <li>A nice mix of essential oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s collection of most important essential oils.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with essential oils and was looking for an affordable starter kit with a good variety of oils to use in homemade cosmetics.</li>
            <li>These way better than Doterra or Young Living</li>
            <li>nice set...use for different things</li>
            <li>I am having FUN with all the scents.</li>
            <li>Fabulous Frannie essential oils are indeed fabulous!</li>
            <li>It has some of the most popular essential oils with aromas that are easily recognizable for those new to aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li>All the other oils are good to for their uses.</li>
            <li>After trying other brands too I probably would not purchase again but it was a good place to start.</li>
            <li>The quality of the oils is at or near the top and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I searched amazon looking for a set that included various oils, had good reviews, didn&#x27;t break the bank, and seemed of high quality.</li>
            <li>Well, I jumped right on it.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves the lavender and put it to use right away.  </li>
            <li>so many uses and so fun to try new scents that I would not have had they not come in this package with the others I really wanted.</li>
            <li>Of course, there are some less pleasant scents that I may never use, but it&#x27;s subjective.</li>
            <li>Great little starter kit!</li>
            <li>Typically use a different brand but to use in the diffuser works great!</li>
            <li>Got more than my moneys worth overall</li>
            <li>Pretty solid set, just started using it but seems good so far.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping .</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these Essential Oils.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love these oils, especially the grapefruit and peppermint.</li>
            <li>These products could have a better quality control but overall please with the brand, and the product.</li>
            <li>First time ordering.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t interested in selling EO.  </li>

            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Arrived fast!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a beginner and this really helped me get my collection started!</li>
            <li>Many of the DIY products call for essential oils which I had none of.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased these essential oils.</li>
            <li>Only problem is the overwhelming smell from the box.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these :)</li>
            <li>Everything was exactly as described</li>
            <li>Just beginning to get into the essential oils and love this set.  </li>
            <li>Have made several recipes and I have been really pleased.  </li>
            <li>It seems I need to use more oil than other brands, but it&#x27;s nice just the same.</li>
            <li>I think these oils are just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>The great price made me willing to try a few scents I&#x27;m not sure I like, while finally getting eucalyptus for my sinuses and more tropical fruit scents which I really love.  </li>
            <li>I have only used a few so far in cp soap &amp; they smell delightful.</li>
            <li>The day I received my shipment I made a natural febreeze spray using 1 TB baking soda, 2 cups of water, and 10 drops of the sweet orange oil.</li>
            <li>I love how long the scent lasts In my diffuser with these oils!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have experience with other brands to make a comparison, but I&#x27;m very pleased with what I&#x27;ve seen so far from Fabulous Frannie essential oils and will be coming back for more.  </li>
            <li>I like these well enough, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the fragrance is a strong as I would expect it to be.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to pay the high MLM prices ;)</li>
            <li>Every single oil in this package is great and a bargain compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>Some of the scents are very close to the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if I am using the oils as they were intended to be used.  </li>
            <li>Thankyou so much smells delishious</li>
            <li>I would have perfered the kit as it was advertised because I really wanted the patchouli.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Very stable and nothing damaged.  </li>
            <li>gret item  fast shipping..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried too much yet.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really likes the eucalyptus scent</li>
            <li>was amazed at how fast this came.</li>
            <li>It really has everything you need to get started with EO&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and decided to buy this starter kit because it was reasonably priced and has 14 bottles to get you started.</li>
            <li>This issue is very upsetting for me because I use these oils for my health problems..</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>Fast ship.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to someone who is just getting started with oils!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It really helps to take you out of being confined in the mask.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit the patchouli and pine don&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>Their website is very helpful as well.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous not buying essentials oils from a recognized brand name</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much you can do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price for what I needed I voluteer at a big cat rescue center, we use the scents as enrichment for the Tigers/ Lions in their enclosures.</li>
            <li>I have used 3 different oils so far and have greatly enjoyed the smells in the products I have made.</li>
            <li>Nice set of different essential oils!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very experienced with essential oils, but this kit does seem to be a great starter at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Well, I hate to say, but when I&#x27;ve contacted the seller after realizing that 11 out of 14 of my oils weren&#x27;t comoletely filled, they were happy to send me a brand new pack, free of charge.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re new to the essential oils, this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My bottles weren&#x27;t full, nor were they all the same amount of liquid.</li>
            <li>So, did I get more or less than I am supposed to have?  </li>
            <li>There are plenty to choose from and enough volume to try out many different recipes.</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of essential oils but FF is one of my favs.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very surprised that those did not spill as well!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these oils.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>HIGH QUALITY</li>
            <li>Came as promised and high quality scents.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I was so very excited when my package from them was delivered yesterday but that excitement quickly turned to disappointment because when I opened the package and took the oils out of the bubble wrap I smelt a very STRONG scent of different oils then looked at my hands and noticed oil all over my hands</li>
            <li>They seem very fond of the Lemongrass and peppermint so far.</li>
            <li>This was the second time I ordered this set because the oils are that useful.</li>
            <li>That may not seem like much, but it translates to about 0.169 fluid ounces, which is exactly 100 drops of oil.  </li>
            <li>The price compared to other brands is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>One bottle was leaking and they promptly shipped me a new one.</li>
            <li>I will have to buy a few others to complete the set, but a great start none the less</li>
            <li>If you want to get into the essential oil game and save a lot of cash, this is a great starter pack.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t contact them again as I felt compensated enough with the second package they gave me, free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it arrived with one of the bottles broken, so that oil was missing, but the package smelled wonderful!</li>
            <li>I checked the lids, which could have been tighter, but none were super loose.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to smell as strong or last as long as others.</li>
            <li>Interesting smells and scents, not sure if they work but won&#x27;t say they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ll use most of the oils yet, but we&#x27;re still looking through the book I also ordered.</li>
            <li>I use to use Young Living, but I wont be anymore!</li>
            <li>Love these oils, and we use oils on a daily basis bot up and down stairs in our home.</li>
            <li>All bottles were secure, tightly capped, &amp; clearly labeled.</li>
            <li>But, purchasing essential oils by themselves can be a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how fast the Essential Oils Beginner Starter Set were delivered--only 1 day!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, I will definitely be ordering from you again.</li>
            <li>There is naturally some scents that I didn&#x27;t like, Im not a musk person.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of all the scents, but was pleasantly surprised by others.  </li>
            <li>I have had no problems using any of these oils so far.</li>
            <li>and it was fixed within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>She is in school to become an aesthetician and was surprised to see it was the&lt;br</li>
            <li>All oils really are the same in strength</li>
            <li>I use all natural aromatherapy oils with my full-face mask CPAP machine.  </li>
            <li>All natural and non-toxic.</li>
            <li>I have been completely converted.</li>
            <li>I made sure they were as advertised, essential oils, by putting a drop on a sheet of paper to check that there was no oily residue circle on the paper after it dried.  </li>
            <li>These oils are just as good as the expensive &amp;#34;name brands&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all the oils yet but the ones I used in my diffuser smell as good as the expensive ones I ordered from young living</li>
            <li>Cheaper than other brands, I dont know how well that bodes for the source of these fine essential oils.</li>
            <li>so I took the oils out and found that 4 of the oils were HALF full which turns out was from being spilt everywhere</li>
            <li>Although when I received the second pack, they were filled the same way as the first set of bottles I&#x27;ve received... :/.</li>
            <li>Essential oils have been the only thing that has ever WORKED to make me feel even a little bit better</li>
            <li>when I diffuse I can cut down my drops because I can smell it better compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>These oils were okay but didn&#x27;t seem to be as high quality as other oils sold as therapeutic grade oils that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I wish I had been lucky enough to get Cinnamon instead of what is listed, just like some other reviews</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how to rate this product as I am new to essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I used to use essential oils with my mom when I was a teenager, and was really wanting to get back into it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s unnecessary to spend a lot of money for the ones that say they are stronger and more natural.</li>
            <li>I put them in a super heavy sealed bag and that has helped.</li>
            <li>The scents are nice enough, however when mixed with a carrier oil, after a few days it seems to loose its strength of smell and potency.</li>
            <li>The bottle on the right is filled to the base of the lid, whereas the bottle on the left is filled to just below the sticker level.</li>
            <li>No regrets on the purchase, at all.  </li>
            <li>The oil comes out a bit fast so you need to be careful</li>
            <li>Now that they have become so popular they can be quite expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to oils and maybe I&#x27;m missing something on why these are significantly cheaper in price, but I can vouch that I see no difference in quality compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t empty and the rest of the bottles appear to have nearly the same volume and the price was decent for a starter kit.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try essential oils but not ready to invest $100</li>
            <li>so I told them I&#x27;d get them some essential oils to use in diffusers since those generally don&#x27;t give me migranes.</li>
            <li>Also I dont  know if there is a difference between melaleuca EO and Tea tree EO, apparently they are the same</li>
            <li>Okay.:(&lt;br /&gt;I am slowly becoming addicted to this set.</li>
            <li>The first set was for myself quite a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten creative and made my own bug repellent roll on oil blend (and it works!), salt/sugar scrubs, bath bombs, toilet bombs, shower bombs, etc.</li>

            <li> This was a gift and well liked.</li>
            <li> I worked in a boutique that sold its own line of essentials oils</li>
            <li> I would have been able to say that I loved the set but--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving these oils.</li>
            <li> this is nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice set.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like many of the scents, but still a good product, would recommend it..</li>
            <li> Oils are nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice set.  </li>
            <li> and I liked the pamphlet that came with it.</li>
            <li> Like that I have so many to experiment with and in time will become really good at which to use for what.</li>
            <li> It is a nice beginner set.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, shipping was fast and product was in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> Nice starter kit.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are nicely sealed and labeled.</li>

            <li> Resonable price, shipped quickly, and a great starter kit.</li>
            <li> Excellent set of 14 aromatherapy oils, this price is exceptionally reasonable for the outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> The Patchouli oil is very strong, use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li> I blended some lavender, sweet orange, and peppermint with some lotion; It smells amazing, lemongrass is really pleasant, too.</li>
            <li> Be nice to have more flowers in kit.</li>
            <li> What a great product, so worth the money.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re label design is kind of cute, which makes me like them</li>
            <li> They are amazing quality, better than any</li>
            <li> I loved all the scents they were really awesome nice and strong, not like other brands where you can&#x27;t smell them, really made the house smell GREAT!</li>
            <li> I will always be a loyal customer as they have great customer service, high quality products, fair prices, &amp; lightning speed shipping!</li>
            <li> An excellent starter set with a nice variety of essential oils for aromatherapy !</li>
            <li> I compared some of the oils from the competition oil vendors and I like the fabulous frannie oils as good or better smelling.</li>

            <li> The daily joy from that alone was worth the cost of the set and assures me it&#x27;s  great quality!  </li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> when in comparison so many leak and cause everything to stink.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I put a couple of drops on a diffuser disk and place the disk in front of the air filter on my CPAP, and for the most part I like it.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I will continue the practice, but my try another brand.</li>
            <li> Love this set.</li>
            <li> I use the eucalyptus oil in my son&#x27;s humidifier and he&#x27;s never slept better.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> As a beginner in this hobby I don&#x27;t think you can find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m learning more and more about each oil in the box.</li>
            <li> but I love citrus smells, so that works for me.  </li>
            <li> The top on one of my oils was defective and caused a leak in shipping.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was cute and I still keep the oils in the box they came</li>
            <li> The variety is perfect for experimenting with different recipes and remedies.  </li>

            <li> I use an oil burner with the tea light candles.</li>
            <li> Since you get 140ml in this set, it&#x27;s like getting 8 free bottles.  </li>

            <li> that their are so many sample it would be nice to have more information on the various oils</li>

            <li> Wonderful introductory set into Essential Oils for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, Fabulous Frannie&#x27;s oils seem to be good quality, unlike some others I have ordered.</li>

            <li> Thanks fabulous Frannie!</li>
            <li> If I want to  disperse the fragrance in the room I set the disk on my disk lamp witch actually puts out a good amount of heat.  </li>
            <li> but I would have appreciated an additional layer of bubble wrap just to make sure.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love the product.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend this set and fabulous frannie oils and products!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the various oil scents which come in this set.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this Essential Oil Starter Set.</li>
            <li> So I did pretty good at reading the former reviews.</li>
            <li> Exactly how it was described!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I look forward to concocting more natural products!</li>
            <li> These are great quality, and not wildly expensive as some other brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them a few times with great results.</li>
            <li> the oils are amazing; especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy having the variety of all the scents at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I use them for so many things - bath soaks, muscle rubs, home made &amp;#34;Vicks&amp;#34; for myself and my two year old, migraine relief, etc.</li>
            <li> I feel it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t go as far as better quality oils do.</li>
            <li> They smell nice, Ives used them several times.</li>
            <li> Next I hope to at the cinnamon, because honestly I want to put it in my tea.</li>
            <li> I like floral scents like jasmine and rose, but not lavender which is the only one included in the set.</li>
            <li> A nice mix of essential oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s collection of most important essential oils.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with essential oils and was looking for an affordable starter kit with a good variety of oils to use in homemade cosmetics.</li>
            <li> These way better than Doterra or Young Living</li>
            <li> nice set...use for different things</li>
            <li> I am having FUN with all the scents.</li>
            <li> Fabulous Frannie essential oils are indeed fabulous!</li>
            <li> It has some of the most popular essential oils with aromas that are easily recognizable for those new to aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li> All the other oils are good to for their uses.</li>
            <li> After trying other brands too I probably would not purchase again but it was a good place to start.</li>
            <li> The quality of the oils is at or near the top and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I searched amazon looking for a set that included various oils, had good reviews, didn&#x27;t break the bank, and seemed of high quality.</li>
            <li> Well, I jumped right on it.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves the lavender and put it to use right away.  </li>
            <li> so many uses and so fun to try new scents that I would not have had they not come in this package with the others I really wanted.</li>
            <li> Of course, there are some less pleasant scents that I may never use, but it&#x27;s subjective.</li>
            <li> Great little starter kit!</li>
            <li> Typically use a different brand but to use in the diffuser works great!</li>
            <li> Got more than my moneys worth overall</li>
            <li> Pretty solid set, just started using it but seems good so far.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping .</li>

            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a beginner and this really helped me get my collection started!</li>
            <li> Many of the DIY products call for essential oils which I had none of.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased these essential oils.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the overwhelming smell from the box.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these :)</li>
            <li> Everything was exactly as described</li>
            <li> Just beginning to get into the essential oils and love this set.  </li>
            <li> Have made several recipes and I have been really pleased.  </li>
            <li> It seems I need to use more oil than other brands, but it&#x27;s nice just the same.</li>
            <li> I think these oils are just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The great price made me willing to try a few scents I&#x27;m not sure I like, while finally getting eucalyptus for my sinuses and more tropical fruit scents which I really love.  </li>
            <li> I have only used a few so far in cp soap &amp; they smell delightful.</li>
            <li> The day I received my shipment I made a natural febreeze spray using 1 TB baking soda, 2 cups of water, and 10 drops of the sweet orange oil.</li>
            <li> I love how long the scent lasts In my diffuser with these oils!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with other brands to make a comparison, but I&#x27;m very pleased with what I&#x27;ve seen so far from Fabulous Frannie essential oils and will be coming back for more.  </li>
            <li> I like these well enough, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the fragrance is a strong as I would expect it to be.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to pay the high MLM prices ;)</li>
            <li> Every single oil in this package is great and a bargain compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li> Some of the scents are very close to the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if I am using the oils as they were intended to be used.  </li>
            <li> Thankyou so much smells delishious</li>
            <li> I would have perfered the kit as it was advertised because I really wanted the patchouli.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Very stable and nothing damaged.  </li>
            <li> gret item  fast shipping..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried too much yet.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really likes the eucalyptus scent</li>
            <li> was amazed at how fast this came.</li>
            <li> It really has everything you need to get started with EO&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and decided to buy this starter kit because it was reasonably priced and has 14 bottles to get you started.</li>
            <li> This issue is very upsetting for me because I use these oils for my health problems..</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> Fast ship.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to someone who is just getting started with oils!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It really helps to take you out of being confined in the mask.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit the patchouli and pine don&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li> Their website is very helpful as well.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous not buying essentials oils from a recognized brand name</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much you can do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good price for what I needed I voluteer at a big cat rescue center, we use the scents as enrichment for the Tigers/ Lions in their enclosures.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 different oils so far and have greatly enjoyed the smells in the products I have made.</li>
            <li> Nice set of different essential oils!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very experienced with essential oils, but this kit does seem to be a great starter at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Well, I hate to say, but when I&#x27;ve contacted the seller after realizing that 11 out of 14 of my oils weren&#x27;t comoletely filled, they were happy to send me a brand new pack, free of charge.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re new to the essential oils, this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> My bottles weren&#x27;t full, nor were they all the same amount of liquid.</li>
            <li> So, did I get more or less than I am supposed to have?  </li>
            <li> There are plenty to choose from and enough volume to try out many different recipes.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of essential oils but FF is one of my favs.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very surprised that those did not spill as well!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these oils.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> HIGH QUALITY</li>
            <li> Came as promised and high quality scents.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I was so very excited when my package from them was delivered yesterday but that excitement quickly turned to disappointment because when I opened the package and took the oils out of the bubble wrap I smelt a very STRONG scent of different oils then looked at my hands and noticed oil all over my hands</li>
            <li> They seem very fond of the Lemongrass and peppermint so far.</li>
            <li> This was the second time I ordered this set because the oils are that useful.</li>
            <li> That may not seem like much, but it translates to about 0.169 fluid ounces, which is exactly 100 drops of oil.  </li>
            <li> The price compared to other brands is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> One bottle was leaking and they promptly shipped me a new one.</li>
            <li> I will have to buy a few others to complete the set, but a great start none the less</li>
            <li> If you want to get into the essential oil game and save a lot of cash, this is a great starter pack.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t contact them again as I felt compensated enough with the second package they gave me, free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it arrived with one of the bottles broken, so that oil was missing, but the package smelled wonderful!</li>
            <li> I checked the lids, which could have been tighter, but none were super loose.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to smell as strong or last as long as others.</li>
            <li> Interesting smells and scents, not sure if they work but won&#x27;t say they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ll use most of the oils yet, but we&#x27;re still looking through the book I also ordered.</li>
            <li> I use to use Young Living, but I wont be anymore!</li>
            <li> Love these oils, and we use oils on a daily basis bot up and down stairs in our home.</li>
            <li> All bottles were secure, tightly capped, &amp; clearly labeled.</li>
            <li> But, purchasing essential oils by themselves can be a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how fast the Essential Oils Beginner Starter Set were delivered--only 1 day!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, I will definitely be ordering from you again.</li>
            <li> There is naturally some scents that I didn&#x27;t like, Im not a musk person.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of all the scents, but was pleasantly surprised by others.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems using any of these oils so far.</li>
            <li> and it was fixed within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> She is in school to become an aesthetician and was surprised to see it was the&lt;br</li>
            <li> All oils really are the same in strength</li>
            <li> I use all natural aromatherapy oils with my full-face mask CPAP machine.  </li>
            <li> All natural and non-toxic.</li>
            <li> I have been completely converted.</li>
            <li> I made sure they were as advertised, essential oils, by putting a drop on a sheet of paper to check that there was no oily residue circle on the paper after it dried.  </li>
            <li> These oils are just as good as the expensive &amp;#34;name brands&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the oils yet but the ones I used in my diffuser smell as good as the expensive ones I ordered from young living</li>
            <li> Cheaper than other brands, I dont know how well that bodes for the source of these fine essential oils.</li>
            <li> so I took the oils out and found that 4 of the oils were HALF full which turns out was from being spilt everywhere</li>
            <li> Although when I received the second pack, they were filled the same way as the first set of bottles I&#x27;ve received... :/.</li>
            <li> Essential oils have been the only thing that has ever WORKED to make me feel even a little bit better</li>
            <li> when I diffuse I can cut down my drops because I can smell it better compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> These oils were okay but didn&#x27;t seem to be as high quality as other oils sold as therapeutic grade oils that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I wish I had been lucky enough to get Cinnamon instead of what is listed, just like some other reviews</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how to rate this product as I am new to essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I used to use essential oils with my mom when I was a teenager, and was really wanting to get back into it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s unnecessary to spend a lot of money for the ones that say they are stronger and more natural.</li>
            <li> I put them in a super heavy sealed bag and that has helped.</li>
            <li> The scents are nice enough, however when mixed with a carrier oil, after a few days it seems to loose its strength of smell and potency.</li>
            <li> The bottle on the right is filled to the base of the lid, whereas the bottle on the left is filled to just below the sticker level.</li>
            <li> No regrets on the purchase, at all.  </li>
            <li> The oil comes out a bit fast so you need to be careful</li>
            <li> Now that they have become so popular they can be quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to oils and maybe I&#x27;m missing something on why these are significantly cheaper in price, but I can vouch that I see no difference in quality compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t empty and the rest of the bottles appear to have nearly the same volume and the price was decent for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try essential oils but not ready to invest $100</li>
            <li> so I told them I&#x27;d get them some essential oils to use in diffusers since those generally don&#x27;t give me migranes.</li>
            <li> Also I dont  know if there is a difference between melaleuca EO and Tea tree EO, apparently they are the same</li>
            <li> Okay.:(&lt;br /&gt;I am slowly becoming addicted to this set.</li>
            <li> The first set was for myself quite a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten creative and made my own bug repellent roll on oil blend (and it works!), salt/sugar scrubs, bath bombs, toilet bombs, shower bombs, etc.</li>
            <li> The bottle may look small at first but they last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and wanted to try these before I spent hundreds on other kits.</li>
            <li> My cousins been trying to talk me into essential oils for a long time now.</li>
            <li> last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to experiment with Essential Oils for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They are strong scents unlike others I have used that are very weak scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with my purchase from fabulous frannie..</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected and I will definitely purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> After researching reviews, I purchased this book: The Complete Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Handbook for Everyday Wellness by Purchon, Nerys.</li>
            <li> BUT ALSO HAS A HIGH PRICE FOR SO SMALL OF  BOTTLES</li>
            <li> So FABULOUS, I am obsessed with these.</li>
            <li> it is minor, is perhaps with the quality control of their packaging.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use them for candles, so it does provide me with a good base to start with.  </li>
            <li> I mean some of them are not really the greatest base scents.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using some of them with my bath salts and others for aromatherapy diffusers and various other things.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other brands that are subscription only were $150 plus and on auto ship.</li>
            <li> but again I didn&#x27;t smell anything after the dry cycle was done.</li>
            <li> I have not taken any of these oils internally, but I have used a few topically with no carrier oils and had no problem.</li>
            <li> I have ordered it like 3 times and use every single one up then order it again.</li>
            <li> The oils are really nice, but I got grapefruit instead of pine :(</li>
            <li> When I mix them with other brands I usually only smell the scent for the other brand of oil.</li>
            <li> so when I purchase 14 10ML oils but only get between 5-7ml&#x27;s in over HALF of the oils</li>
            <li> But my only problem was that some of the bottles were slightly opened and the lemon bottled had spilled quite a bit onto my other bottles.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I would buy this product again simply because their prices are hard to beat for 100% essential oils.</li>
            <li> then im sure you can imagine my anger and frustration.</li>
            <li> They came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> These oils don&#x27;t have the premium quality smell I expected</li>
            <li> However, the bottles are not filled to the same levels.</li>
            <li> not at all what i expected</li>
            <li> Also, I wanna point out that almost ALL of the caps on the oils were on VERY loosely</li>
            <li> Recieved it faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> One was almost empty.</li>
            <li> My only problems was a few lids I could not get unscrewed.</li>
            <li> Also, they arrived faster than they were expected to so</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The only one I hate is pine, but one of out 14 is not bad at all!</li>
            <li> I did buy some other oils from them</li>
            <li> 2 of the scents were completely empty!</li>
            <li> Oils are as I hoped and expected!</li>
            <li> Even has a small guide for use and such of the oils.</li>
            <li> I was lead to believe that if you bought from these expensive other companies that the quality of the products would be of a higher level.</li>
            <li> but really don&#x27;t know why some are so expensive?</li>
            <li> Oils seem to be &#x27;watered down&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I decided to do some browsing and found this little set for less than ordering three oils from the other EO dealer.  </li>
            <li> Seems that using essential oils is subtle changes.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but after using a few times I was hooked!</li>
            <li> Just not true.</li>
            <li> I did have a little problem with the caps, but it was taken care of.</li>
            <li> They do seem thinner than the other oil brands, not sure if that has any effect on quality as I am not an expert.</li>
            <li> a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps a little heavy on the citrus oils (5 out of 14),</li>
            <li> They all use the Young Living which is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> so I checked out the rest of the oils and noticed another 4 were missing alot of oil</li>
            <li> aroma was not lasting and very weak.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to artificial fragrances and our kids are young teens into candles</li>
            <li> I had a small problem with my reorder</li>
            <li> yet they were still missing lots of oil?!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the bottles are supposed to weigh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it smells like.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I was not able to be in the room with the box of oils.</li>
            <li> I have to tell you I almost didn&#x27;t get these oil because some of the poor reviews, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to them because those reviews were bad reviews!</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a kit that consists of a bunch of oils I like.</li>
            <li> I cant help but feel like lime and tangerine were unnecessary,</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, two bottles were broken when it arrived as the package did not have sufficient padding.</li>
            <li> There was oil and broken glass everywhere.</li>
            <li> The company immediately replaced the broken bottles at no charge but we were stuck with the cleanup.</li>
            <li> However, I have always thought they were too expensive for me to try out.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in the quality of these oils.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed because there is no patchouli in the kit, instead I have cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed after the purchase</li>
            <li> They also helped my cold to go away faster!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these oils! The smell great and work for everything I&#x27;ve needed them for! Way cheaper than doterra and work just as great</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these Essential Oils. Almost purchased a YL kit but decided to try these to see if I liked oils before investing a lot of money in YL. You get so many oils for a very reasonable price from Fabulous Frannie. I have been diffusing lavender every night since receiving these.  I&#x27;m no expert on oils at all but really don&#x27;t know why some are so expensive? These are 100% pure and smell wonderful! If you&#x27;re on the fence trying to decide if you should try these, do so!</li>
            <li> shipped so quickly and was in great shape. A great starter kit! Thanks fabulous Frannie!</li>
            <li> They smell great. I give them 4 stars because one was leaking when they arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and wanted to try these before I spent hundreds on other kits. I an very impressed! I&#x27;ve used them a few times with great results. Would definitely purchase from again!</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit! The only issue is that I want more. :) Seem to be good quality and have nice aromas.</li>
            <li> Excellent selection - I mean some of them are not really the greatest base scents.  I plan to use them for candles, so it does provide me with a good base to start with.  I can&#x27;t really complain.  This was the best price I could find for a variety pack and the oils themselves are high quality with good containers.  I would recommend it as a started pack.  I did buy some other oils from them not included to supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came intact with no spillage.  The bottles are very good - when in comparison so many leak and cause everything to stink.</li>
            <li> very happy with product</li>
            <li> These smell awesome. They came sooner than expected. Will order again.</li>
            <li> These oils are just as good as the expensive &amp;#34;name brands&amp;#34;. I use them for so many things - bath soaks, muscle rubs, home made &amp;#34;Vicks&amp;#34; for myself and my two year old, migraine relief, etc. I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality. If you want to get into the essential oil game and save a lot of cash, this is a great starter pack.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in the quality of these oils.  I used them to make some sugar scrubs and body lotions and it took 2-3 times the amount the recipes called for just to get a hint of the fragrance.  Although the price was good I feel it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Great strong scents for my home-made soaps.  :)</li>
            <li> Some of the scents are very close to the real thing.  I really don&#x27;t know if I am using the oils as they were intended to be used.  I put a couple of drops on a diffuser disk and place the disk in front of the air filter on my CPAP, and for the most part I like it.  If I want to  disperse the fragrance in the room I set the disk on my disk lamp witch actually puts out a good amount of heat.  I am sure I will continue the practice, but my try another brand.</li>
            <li> So far these have been great, I&#x27;m a beginner so its hit and miss.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid set, just started using it but seems good so far.</li>
            <li> Very good products and good quality. I did have a little problem with the caps, but it was taken care of. This company is very honest and helps with any questions you have about the products they sell. I Have told friends about these items. They are strong scents unlike others I have used that are very weak scents. I will buy again when I run out. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These are excellent quality! ! I am used to DoTerra oils but these are just as wonderful for a beginner starter pack.</li>
            <li> Love this set. Great quality and great price! The company even answered my questions quickly and honestly</li>
            <li> This idea is amazing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li> Lots of Oils to choose from... Good Quality Oils</li>
            <li> Thankyou so much smells delishious</li>
            <li> great oils! top grade quality and come in a great package!! they all smell wonderful</li>
            <li> Great set to get started with</li>
            <li> Oils seem to be &#x27;watered down&#x27;. Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> These oils were okay but didn&#x27;t seem to be as high quality as other oils sold as therapeutic grade oils that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> My cousins been trying to talk me into essential oils for a long time now. They all use the Young Living which is extremely expensive. I bought this to see if this was something I would like to do. Love the set &amp; the price! I use the eucalyptus oil in my son&#x27;s humidifier and he&#x27;s never slept better. It helped him get over the flu days faster and he breaths easier at night now. All the other oils are good to for their uses.</li>
            <li> The oils are good quality. I am disappointed because there is no patchouli in the kit, instead I have cinnamon. I would have perfered the kit as it was advertised because I really wanted the patchouli.</li>
            <li> 2 of the scents were completely empty!</li>
            <li> These are great. Great scents. Perfect for beginners.</li>
            <li> Great oils! These smell so fresh and amazing in our ultrasonic diffuser. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and well liked.</li>
            <li> Thank you for prompt delivery!  Gift recipient was VERY impressed and happy about the variety!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to artificial fragrances and our kids are young teens into candles so I told them I&#x27;d get them some essential oils to use in diffusers since those generally don&#x27;t give me migranes. I worked in a boutique that sold its own line of essentials oils and I have to say this brand is an excellent value for the price. It&#x27;s also a great way to start a substantial set of the basic oils. Our purchase arrived intact but I would have appreciated an additional layer of bubble wrap just to make sure. It shipped from CA and made it VA without breakage though.</li>
            <li> These oils don&#x27;t have the premium quality smell I expected and they are runny so they don&#x27;t go as far as better quality oils do.</li>
            <li> Great starter set! It contains a good selection of oils and the bottles are a decent size to begin with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and this is a perfect beginner set. The product is exactly as described. I&#x27;m very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome Oils.  I have used several different brands.  These are great quality, and not wildly expensive as some other brands.  I would highly recommend these oils.</li>
            <li> I would have been able to say that I loved the set but--it arrived with one of the bottles broken, so that oil was missing, but the package smelled wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great Beginners set!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent assortment for first-time user.</li>
            <li> I love my starter kit. It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and I love it.</li>
            <li> This was a GREAT Purchase!!  thank you</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping/delivery ! Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Wish this would&#x27;ve had more info for oil uses.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how fast the Essential Oils Beginner Starter Set were delivered--only 1 day! I love the packaging and the essential oils are even better than I thought it would be! Thank you so much, I will definitely be ordering from you again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils, but I am very happy with this set.  All of the oils smell very nice.  I&#x27;ve been using some of them with my bath salts and others for aromatherapy diffusers and various other things.  This is a pretty good set for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and smell.</li>
            <li> What a great selection of essential oils, mainly use these in my diffuser, So many to choose from I don&#x27;t know which one to use first.</li>
            <li> Love my essential oils..</li>
            <li> Great products...I love them and the great quality</li>
            <li> the oils I have used I do like</li>
            <li> Love the packaging. Very stable and nothing damaged.  The items I&#x27;ve used so far have been very good.</li>
            <li> I wish I had been lucky enough to get Cinnamon instead of what is listed, just like some other reviews but I got what was listed. They smell nice, Ives used them several times. They make great additions to my lotions, looking forward to using them more, they seem like they are good quality and likely will last some time. Cheaper than other brands, I dont know how well that bodes for the source of these fine essential oils. Definitely a good starter set. Next I hope to at the cinnamon, because honestly I want to put it in my tea. There is naturally some scents that I didn&#x27;t like, Im not a musk person. I really loved the peppermint and the grapefruit. I cant help but feel like lime and tangerine were unnecessary, like I dont even know what to do with those. I like floral scents like jasmine and rose, but not lavender which is the only one included in the set. Also I dont  know if there is a difference between melaleuca EO and Tea tree EO, apparently they are the same</li>
            <li> The majority of the oils are citrus.</li>
            <li> Just getting into this however, so far so good</li>
            <li> Now I just need to use them. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave the product 4 stars because, as others wrote, the bottles did not all have the same amount in them and when I opened the package, it was obvious  - both in smell and in volume - the lemon oil had leaked.  It wasn&#x27;t empty and the rest of the bottles appear to have nearly the same volume and the price was decent for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> great started kit, love it.</li>
            <li> Great item,  Great Size,  Smell and feel is wonderful,  Easy to store and organize.</li>
            <li> excellent grade pure essential oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving these oils.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love the product. I&#x27;ve just started using essential oils and I shopped around comparing brands for the best deal, the best oils for the best prices. I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed after the purchase and I&#x27;m not. Will be purchasing more from this company and would recommend them to friends.</li>
            <li> Nice set !  Great value!</li>
            <li> I like  oils. Very fast shipping .</li>
            <li> Very happy will oils they have released my daughter lower back pain.</li>
            <li> Wonderful introductory set into Essential Oils for a reasonable price.  Not a fan of all the scents, but was pleasantly surprised by others.  We use these for several DIY household cleaners and body care products.</li>
            <li> this is nice.  I like the variety and the smells last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great for creating your own scent creation for home made Poo Pouri.  I use 2 table spoons of hand soap to emulsify the oils with water.  I put 60 drops of any combination to fill the 4oz. bottle.  Shake well and spray away.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the different oils yet but so far so good. These are just starter bottles so eventually you will need to buy larger bottles of the ones you know you like. But if you&#x27;re new to the essential oils, this is fantastic. Has just about everything I&#x27;ve seen in recipes I want to try.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for a gift or for yourself!  great shipping too!</li>
            <li> You cant beat this variety for the price... Seems quality but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s digestable! Love it otherwise!</li>
            <li> Great starter kit with everything you need &amp; great product. Bought an extra set for a gift.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these oils, especially the grapefruit and peppermint. I have had no problems using any of these oils so far. The Patchouli oil is very strong, use sparingly. I have not taken any of these oils internally, but I have used a few topically with no carrier oils and had no problem. I have no complaints whatsoever with this product. I received it as described and am very happy with my purchase. Great oils for a great price.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome Starter Set for a beginner.  It has some of the most popular essential oils with aromas that are easily recognizable for those new to aromatherapy.  There are a lot of good blending combinations within the set.  The quality of the oils is at or near the top and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Essential Oils have a wonderful fragrance but it does not last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to oils and maybe I&#x27;m missing something on why these are significantly cheaper in price, but I can vouch that I see no difference in quality compared to other brands. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I blended some lavender, sweet orange, and peppermint with some lotion; It smells amazing, lemongrass is really pleasant, too. I am still playing with the combination, but very satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li> These products could have a better quality control but overall please with the brand, and the product.</li>
            <li> Great variety. First time ordering. Pleased</li>
            <li> Nice set of scents for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> No package issues, no leaks ! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great little starter kit! I will have to buy a few others to complete the set, but a great start none the less</li>
            <li> They smell wonderful.  I have a lot more to learn about my oils.</li>
            <li> Good oils, wish it came with a little more info about the company and how to use.</li>
            <li> I have to tell you I almost didn&#x27;t get these oil because some of the poor reviews, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to them because those reviews were bad reviews! These oils are absolutely wonderful, very strong and smell so good, they are very high-quality perfect starter kit for anyone!!</li>
            <li> These oils are awesome, I have read many reviews about the bottles leaking upon shipment, I did not have this problem. Very good qulity oils for this amazing price! Everything was as expected and I will definitely purchase in the future! Oils are as I hoped and expected!</li>
            <li> The oils smell wonderful. I have not used yet in my salt scrub but the scents are what I was looking for.  The package arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful starter kit!  Great pure scents and perfect for our products!</li>
            <li> These are all good oils. I likw them. Good price too. You get to try alot of them. I use them often and haven&#x27;t ran out yet!</li>
            <li> Very good product and a great way to get into essential oils</li>
            <li> Wished you had more of flower, citrus and woods scents so you could make perfume. Already used Lemon to make soap. Be nice to have more flowers in kit.</li>
            <li> Perfect starter kit.  Love.</li>
            <li> The packaging is great. However, the bottles are not filled to the same levels. Which means the amount of drops you get from each bottle is going to be different. Makes. Big difference with dealing with oils.</li>
            <li> Interesting smells and scents, not sure if they work but won&#x27;t say they don&#x27;t. Used them on sore muscles and the pain was gone overnight.</li>
            <li> Good price for what I needed I voluteer at a big cat rescue center, we use the scents as enrichment for the Tigers/ Lions in their enclosures. We put them on boxes, on their balls and even on trees and stuff around the area. They seem very fond of the Lemongrass and peppermint so far.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to experiment with Essential Oils for a long time.  However, I have always thought they were too expensive for me to try out.  Then, I had a friend add me to her Internet party.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what I wanted to order, with so many to choose from.  Then, they had a sampler set well over one hundred dollars.  Ordering the sampler would then make you a part of the team.  I wasn&#x27;t interested in selling EO.  I just wanted to try some of them out.  So, I bounced between ordering the sampler and being hounded about selling the stuff, or just ordering one.  I decided to do some browsing and found this little set for less than ordering three oils from the other EO dealer.  Well, I jumped right on it.  I ordered the diffuser from Amazon, as well.  I love the fragrance of the oils.  I have tried mixing them and using them separately.  No regrets on the purchase, at all.  I will reorder from this company.</li>
            <li> I like these well enough, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the fragrance is a strong as I would expect it to be.</li>
            <li> I love it cause have use it a lot send i have got it. Mi clients love it 2.</li>
            <li> These are good for the price.  They don&#x27;t seem to smell as strong or last as long as others. When I mix them with other brands I usually only smell the scent for the other brand of oil. Some of these scents do not smell very pleasing others smell great. They do seem thinner than the other oil brands, not sure if that has any effect on quality as I am not an expert. After trying other brands too I probably would not purchase again but it was a good place to start.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to try out all of the most popular oils for beginners. They smell great and seem to be true essential oil.</li>
            <li> Just getting into essential oils.  Great beginner set.</li>
            <li> I loved all the scents they were really awesome nice and strong, not like other brands where you can&#x27;t smell them, really made the house smell GREAT!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with these oils.  I made sure they were as advertised, essential oils, by putting a drop on a sheet of paper to check that there was no oily residue circle on the paper after it dried.  Voila…there was not.  This is a good selection at a good price.</li>
            <li> Worked well for what I needed</li>
            <li> A nice mix of essential oils. Big bang for your buck here!</li>
            <li> I 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍these. Great variety. Everything arrived beautifully packaged. Thank you! I now have essential oils in every office I work in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s collection of most important essential oils. I love this.</li>
            <li> gret item  fast shipping..</li>
            <li> This is a great starter set for an equally great price!</li>
            <li> Love the oils that came in this pack.</li>
            <li> Great set bought it for my girlfriend who&#x27;s studying for massage therapy and she said they were great</li>
            <li> The oils came in on time and as advertised.  My wife loves the lavender and put it to use right away.  I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ll use most of the oils yet, but we&#x27;re still looking through the book I also ordered.</li>
            <li> Very nice variety @  rreasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this set. My husband and kids do too!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Wonderful product! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great starting kit. I haven&#x27;t tried too much yet. But I am just starting out with essential oils. Looking forward to using them more. Price was very good. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love love love love loveeeeeeeeee these oils. I use to use Young Living, but I wont be anymore! ;)</li>
            <li> Love these oils, and we use oils on a daily basis bot up and down stairs in our home.</li>
            <li> I love all of my fabulous frannie oils! All of the oils I have gotten from this company have been great. I have several of their blend sets too.</li>
            <li> aroma was not lasting and very weak.  not at all what i expected</li>
            <li> Love all the oils I received and I&#x27;ve ordered more for myself and family from fabulous frannie</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Love the oils</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the oils yet but the ones I used in my diffuser smell as good as the expensive ones I ordered from young living</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really likes the eucalyptus scent</li>
            <li> Love the product. Shipping was fast!!!!Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a great value. I&#x27;m just getting into the practice of oils.&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how fast this came. I didn&#x27;t even pay for upgraded shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the oils! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this kit!  It really has everything you need to get started with EO&#x27;s.  And the size of the bottles will last you awhile.  Inside the package there was a coupon to use on their website.  I have already ordered more oils.  I had a small problem with my reorder and I sent an email and it was fixed within 24 hours.  Great customer service.  I don&#x27;t normally give anything 5 stars, but I am really happy with this kit.  It also comes in a nice package and could easily be given as a gift.</li>
            <li> excellent would buy again</li>
            <li> Nice set. Just wish they were 15ml bottles! So far, Fabulous Frannie&#x27;s oils seem to be good quality, unlike some others I have ordered.</li>
            <li> The oils are fantastic and work will with the Humidifier Purifier 7 LED Lighting Aroma Diffuser Mist Maker for home office</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like many of the scents, but still a good product, would recommend it..</li>
            <li> Great started set to experiment with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great beginner set at a great value. I used many of these oils in room sprays. There are plenty to choose from and enough volume to try out many different recipes. Bottles came in good shape and packaged nicely in Kraft box for easy storage and retrieval.</li>
            <li> An excellent starter set with a nice variety of essential oils for aromatherapy ! Great deal...</li>
            <li> awesome price, awesome product</li>
            <li> Resonable price, shipped quickly, and a great starter kit.</li>
            <li> Love the variety and the price!</li>
            <li> I used to use essential oils with my mom when I was a teenager, and was really wanting to get back into it. But, purchasing essential oils by themselves can be a little overwhelming. Which ones should I get? How do I know I&#x27;m getting a good price? What&#x27;s the quality like?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found this starter set! It&#x27;s enough oils to really get a feel for what you&#x27;re doing, but not so many that you feel overwhelmed--and they&#x27;re excellent quality as well!</li>
            <li> Strong concentrated oils that work beautifully. Great value!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the various oil scents which come in this set. I often mix multiple scents in my diffuser and am excited to say the scents are wonderful and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love these oils.  I use them in a diffuser.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the vendor and I will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it! She is in school to become an aesthetician and was surprised to see it was the&lt;br /&gt;same set that her instructor had. So I did pretty good at reading the former reviews. She was very&lt;br /&gt;satisfied! THANKS!</li>
            <li> I have been using Essential oils for 20+ years. Now that they have become so popular they can be quite expensive. I did a lot of research and decided to buy this starter kit because it was reasonably priced and has 14 bottles to get you started. Some of the other brands that are subscription only were $150 plus and on auto ship. This one is not. I think these oils are just as good as the more expensive ones. All oils really are the same in strength so it&#x27;s unnecessary to spend a lot of money for the ones that say they are stronger and more natural. Just not true. Don&#x27;t buy into it because these oils are all the same as the others and you get 14 instead of 7.</li>
            <li> Product all nicely sealed and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with essential oils and was looking for an affordable starter kit with a good variety of oils to use in homemade cosmetics. I have used 3 different oils so far and have greatly enjoyed the smells in the products I have made. Seems like nice quality and a great price. I am very happy with my purchase and would buy again from this brand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kit. It&#x27;s a great assortment of oils and a great way to try many different oils without a huge expense.</li>
            <li> Can I give more than 5 stars? No? Okay.:(&lt;br /&gt;I am slowly becoming addicted to this set. I have ordered it like 3 times and use every single one up then order it again. There is no stopping this.</li>
            <li> A very very nice group of oils and well packaged</li>
            <li> Great starter collection of oils.  Smell great and diffuse nicely.</li>
            <li> Just used them &amp; There great so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with my purchase from fabulous frannie.. I was so very excited when my package from them was delivered yesterday but that excitement quickly turned to disappointment because when I opened the package and took the oils out of the bubble wrap I smelt a very STRONG scent of different oils then looked at my hands and noticed oil all over my hands so I took the oils out and found that 4 of the oils were HALF full which turns out was from being spilt everywhere so I checked out the rest of the oils and noticed another 4 were missing alot of oil but those however were NOT spilt and yet they were still missing lots of oil?! What&#x27;s up with that?! Also, I wanna point out that almost ALL of the caps on the oils were on VERY loosely so I&#x27;m very surprised that those did not spill as well! This issue is very upsetting for me because I use these oils for my health problems.. Essential oils have been the only thing that has ever WORKED to make me feel even a little bit better so when I purchase 14 10ML oils but only get between 5-7ml&#x27;s in over HALF of the oils then im sure you can imagine my anger and frustration. I feel ripped off! I have purchased essential oils from different sellers on amazon and never had this problem.</li>
            <li> Great product , great price!</li>
            <li> This was the second time I ordered this set because the oils are that useful. Great for beginners or anyone who needs to restock some of their basic oils. Frannies prices can&#x27;t be beat for the quality. Excellent.</li>
            <li> Oils are great but Fabulous Frannie&#x27;s customer service is the best. One bottle was leaking and they promptly shipped me a new one. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought these for the lady and she loves them. Come home from work and it smells like a tropical escape in the house. Haha</li>
            <li> Just got my oils today they smell great. I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase so far and am glad that I was able to get a starter kit to start my oil journey</li>
            <li> Oils are nice. Typically use a different brand but to use in the diffuser works great!</li>
            <li> Good value and nice set, would love to be able to create my own beginner set to swap some items out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Arrived fast! Great starter kit for oils. The bottle may look small at first but they last a really long time. Its hard to find a kit that consists of a bunch of oils I like. This one has a lot of citrus scents which are my favorites! The only one I hate is pine, but one of out 14 is not bad at all!</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of essential oils but FF is one of my favs. I had this in my cart for weeks before I finally ordered it and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This particular brand seems to have a more potent smell. when I diffuse I can cut down my drops because I can smell it better compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Most of what you need to get started. Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Love my oils! Perfect for my body butters and bath fizzies!</li>
            <li> Every single oil in this package is great and a bargain compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Excellent set of 14 aromatherapy oils, this price is exceptionally reasonable for the outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> Have not had a chance to use it yet - but it looks great and the oils seem top notch!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect gift set for starters!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Fast ship.  Great product.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> All I can say ...is love !!!!!</li>
            <li> Great deal with a good variety!</li>
            <li> The perfect starter set. Addicted to Fabulous Frannie now, will only order their products. Good quality, quick shipments, and great oil selections.  Would highly recommend to someone who is just getting started with oils!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice set.  It seems I need to use more oil than other brands, but it&#x27;s nice just the same.</li>
            <li> Recieved it faster than expected.  Wife is happy with it. Would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Oils smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> Smells disapate quickly</li>
            <li> awesome big bang for your buck</li>
            <li> What a great product, so worth the money.</li>
            <li> The oils are really nice, but I got grapefruit instead of pine :(</li>
            <li> Great buy great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very experienced with essential oils, but this kit does seem to be a great starter at a very reasonable price. I&#x27;m looking forward to putting it to good use!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this Essential Oil Starter Set. I love each scent. I sometime use 3 at a time and dilute with water. It smells up a room in a matter of minutes. I use an oil burner with the tea light candles. I am very very satisfied with the scents, size, potency.</li>
            <li> My bottles weren&#x27;t full, nor were they all the same amount of liquid. One was almost empty.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! High quality. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Cute lil vials. Great scents, good deal.</li>
            <li> So far I love these oils!</li>
            <li> Exactly how it was described! And they work great!</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with this product. a perfect beginners set.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a starter set for my wife along with a handbook. She loves it. No foreseeable issues, but will update if any come up. Price is good, but I suggested she research before trying to eat it (dietary supplements). It makes sense to me that a more expensive set with a specific description noting edibility would be safer (but I don&#x27;t know). Ordered close to xmas and it still arrived on time. After researching reviews, I purchased this book: The Complete Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Handbook for Everyday Wellness by Purchon, Nerys.</li>
            <li> So FABULOUS, I am obsessed with these. I am using them for everything in my home, body, kids, etc.</li>
            <li> These way better than Doterra or Young Living and you don&#x27;t have to pay the high MLM prices ;)</li>
            <li> The packaging was good and I liked the pamphlet that came with it. The only problem I had however was when I tried to use some of the oils for aromatherapy I did not smell anything. I also tried using the oils to make dryer sheets but again I didn&#x27;t smell anything after the dry cycle was done. These are things I&#x27;ve done before with essential oils that have worked for me. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong? I bought an aromatherapy to make sure it is not just me.</li>
            <li> I loved it,its everything I wanted</li>
            <li> Great selection. Great scents. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> nice set...use for different things</li>
            <li> Great starter kit for anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the products price and quality. I am having FUN with all the scents.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have no reason to dispute the quality of the oils, as the fragrance in my diffuser is wonderful.  The price compared to other brands is fantastic.  The only gripe I would have, and it is minor, is perhaps with the quality control of their packaging.  The package smelled of peppermint before I even opened the mail packaging.  I checked the lids, which could have been tighter, but none were super loose.  There was, however, no obvious sign of leaking oil.  What was obvious, and hence the reason for only 4 stars, was the visible difference in volumes between bottles.  I have included photos of the two extremes.  The bottle on the right is filled to the base of the lid, whereas the bottle on the left is filled to just below the sticker level. Two of my bottles weighed only 35 grams, while another two weighed 40 grams.  The rest were in between.  That may not seem like much, but it translates to about 0.169 fluid ounces, which is exactly 100 drops of oil.  I am not sure what the bottles are supposed to weigh.  So, did I get more or less than I am supposed to have?  Either case, I consider that lax quality control.  With that being said, I would buy this product again simply because their prices are hard to beat for 100% essential oils.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for anyone who is just starting their journey in the world of aromatherapy. Great quality oils for a bargain! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Very high quality oils - great starter set</li>
            <li> I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Just what my daughter wanted.  The package arrived quickly and she loved it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I use all natural aromatherapy oils with my full-face mask CPAP machine.  It really helps to take you out of being confined in the mask.  I&#x27;m used to paying about $18 for a 30ml bottle from a CPAP site.  Since you get 140ml in this set, it&#x27;s like getting 8 free bottles.  The great price made me willing to try a few scents I&#x27;m not sure I like, while finally getting eucalyptus for my sinuses and more tropical fruit scents which I really love.  I have to admit the patchouli and pine don&#x27;t do much for me.  With the pine I was hoping for Christmas tree, but didn&#x27;t even get Pine-sol.  I&#x27;m not sure what it smells like.  Two out of 14 was a good gamble for me at this price.</li>
            <li> Love your oils! Very nice beginner set and the oils are all wonderful.</li>
            <li> This a great set with beautiful scents, and it is priced right!</li>
            <li> HIGH QUALITY BUT ALSO HAS A HIGH PRICE FOR SO SMALL OF  BOTTLES</li>
            <li> This is one of my first essential oil purchases and I am very impressed with the brand, packaging, and prompt shipping.  The price is very reasonable and the oils seem to be very good quality and highly fragrant.  I don&#x27;t have experience with other brands to make a comparison, but I&#x27;m very pleased with what I&#x27;ve seen so far from Fabulous Frannie essential oils and will be coming back for more.  This beginner set is an excellent step into the world of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, very nice oils. They leave no residue, like lesser quality oils will. Their website is very helpful as well. My only problems was a few lids I could not get unscrewed. Overall, great quality oils I will purchase and recommend again and again.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the selection. I put a couple drops on a paper towel and placed the towel in the pocket of my heating pad. The daily joy from that alone was worth the cost of the set and assures me it&#x27;s  great quality!  The set arrived in a timely manner. I will happily order again from Fabulous Frannie!</li>
            <li> This kit came with all the basic scents I wanted. The quality ofor the oils is excellent.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> great set of oils at a great price. i&#x27;m a beginner and this really helped me get my collection started!</li>
            <li> Great price on an awesome set of oils.</li>
            <li> These were okay, but I will not be ordering from Fabulous Frannie ever again.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous not buying essentials oils from a recognized brand name but I am very pleased with these! I bought a set to start off with &amp; have made chaptsticks, body butter, toothpaste, and dryer sheets with these. They also helped my cold to go away faster! Very good product!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better starter kit! the oils are amazing; especially for the cost. Must have if you&#x27;re starting out!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how to rate this product as I am new to essential oils.  Have used the peppermint in coconut oil on cup warmer to wake me up, while drinking my coffee in morning.  It works.  Know that lavendar oil works if used at 8 pm and then at bedtime.  Takes time to learn and use the products.  Seems that using essential oils is subtle changes.  Like that I have so many to experiment with and in time will become really good at which to use for what.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with this product. a perfect begginers set.</li>
            <li> This starter kit has some great scents at a great price. Of course, there are some less pleasant scents that I may never use, but it&#x27;s subjective.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Smell great but a couple didn&#x27;t drop very well but for what it cost it&#x27;s okay. Got more than my moneys worth overall</li>
            <li> So far very good I like that their are so many sample it would be nice to have more information on the various oils</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this set and fabulous frannie oils and products! Same quality as big named companies</li>
            <li> The scents are nice enough, however when mixed with a carrier oil, after a few days it seems to loose its strength of smell and potency.</li>
            <li> As a beginner in this hobby I don&#x27;t think you can find a better deal. I searched amazon looking for a set that included various oils, had good reviews, didn&#x27;t break the bank, and seemed of high quality. This set seems to check all the boxes. Now I&#x27;m learning more and more about each oil in the box. From things like application, benefits, dilutions, to blending in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Great assortment for a good price.</li>
            <li> Just got this last week. It is a nice beginner set.  Perhaps a little heavy on the citrus oils (5 out of 14), but I love citrus smells, so that works for me.  Great company, too.  The top on one of my oils was defective and caused a leak in shipping.  The company promptly sent out a replacement for me.  They were great to work with and the product seems great so far.</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly and safely. All bottles were secure, tightly capped, &amp; clearly labeled. Each had the appropriate amount of EOs, &amp; each smelled wonderful. I have only used a few so far in cp soap &amp; they smell delightful.</li>
            <li> After reading mixed reviews for this product, I was hesitant to order.  I really wanted to try essential oils but not ready to invest $100+ dollars with one of the pricier brands.  I went ahead and ordered and was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, shipping was fast and product was in perfect condition.  The packaging was cute and I still keep the oils in the box they came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the oils are great!  The variety is perfect for experimenting with different recipes and remedies.  A little goes a long way so I expect this set to last for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorites are lavender, tea tree, grapefruit, peppermint, and lemon.  I&#x27;ve used them in my baths, made products such as deodorant to stretch mark cream, and added oils to vinegar for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know where to start with oils, I recommend Pinterest.  With that and this set, you&#x27;ll have a great start!</li>
            <li> Fabulous Frannie essential oils are indeed fabulous! Top quality, fast shipping. Love these oils, won&#x27;t buy anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Peppermint seemed to be the best with the best scent, did not blend as well as I had hoped they would</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to make my own natural cleaning products for a while now. Many of the DIY products call for essential oils which I had none of. So I ordered this kit - it is perfect. The day I received my shipment I made a natural febreeze spray using 1 TB baking soda, 2 cups of water, and 10 drops of the sweet orange oil. All natural and non-toxic. I look forward to concocting more natural products!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased these essential oils. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great assortment and great bargain.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and &amp; the oils are wonderful! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great starter kit to know which scents are best suited for me</li>
            <li> Very nice variety, love it</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product.  Oils are awesomely scented.&lt;br /&gt;There are other that are cheaper, but these are the best! Super Quick Delivery...</li>
            <li> great product we have used them for our diffusers, making lip balm and even an exfoliator.... so many uses and so fun to try new scents that I would not have had they not come in this package with the others I really wanted.</li>
            <li> Came as promised and high quality scents. But my only problem was that some of the bottles were slightly opened and the lemon bottled had spilled quite a bit onto my other bottles. Once cleaned everything was beautiful</li>
            <li> Am enjoying already!!!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I have purchased this set. The first set was for myself quite a few months ago.  I was a beginner in oils and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on the bigger brand names out there. I haven&#x27;t used the other oil brands, but these have worked great in our home! I use them for cleaning, treating illnesses, morning sickness.  I&#x27;ve even gotten creative and made my own bug repellent roll on oil blend (and it works!), salt/sugar scrubs, bath bombs, toilet bombs, shower bombs, etc. There&#x27;s so much you can do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a friend expressed interest in oils but also mentioned she didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on the name brand stuff you hear about, I had to get her a set of these!</li>
            <li> Product came as expected and in perfect condition.  I have been using them for a variety of things and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Affordable collection of EOs. Effectiveness? - have not yet used.</li>
            <li> Number one, you can&#x27;t beat the price for these quality oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number two, they&#x27;re label design is kind of cute, which makes me like them a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number three, they strive in providing great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s the FOUR stars for?  Well, I hate to say, but when I&#x27;ve contacted the seller after realizing that 11 out of 14 of my oils weren&#x27;t comoletely filled, they were happy to send me a brand new pack, free of charge.  That was great.  Although when I received the second pack, they were filled the same way as the first set of bottles I&#x27;ve received... :/. I didn&#x27;t contact them again as I felt compensated enough with the second package they gave me, free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good company to work with and affordable oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, in the picture, I am using a nail polish rack that I&#x27;ve also purchased through Amazon for my oils.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and packaged for protection. Everything came intact and perfect. I have used a few of the oils and they are wonderful. Even has a small guide for use and such of the oils.</li>
            <li> Love all these oils!!!  prompt shipping!!! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> the product info did not stat the oils were not to be ingested(used in foods or water). therefore i thought they could be ingested. i had to purchase a set from doterra  that was ingestable</li>
            <li> Nice starter kit.  The oil comes out a bit fast so you need to be careful</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Very potent. The best we&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, two bottles were broken when it arrived as the package did not have sufficient padding. There was oil and broken glass everywhere. The company immediately replaced the broken bottles at no charge but we were stuck with the cleanup. I wish they used better packaging.</li>
            <li> These have the nicest aromas. This is a great starter kit. There are some more famous aromatherapy companies that you can shop from, however I have found that the quality of these oils just as good if not better.  The price of the oils are priced great, too. I compared some of the oils from the competition oil vendors and I like the fabulous frannie oils as good or better smelling. I was lead to believe that if you bought from these expensive other companies that the quality of the products would be of a higher level. I have been completely converted. I am not going to fall for that thinking anymore. I think that the Lavender from here is probably the best I have smelled, ever</li>
            <li> Very good selection of oils. Only problem is the overwhelming smell from the box. I put them in a super heavy sealed bag and that has helped. Otherwise, I was not able to be in the room with the box of oils.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this as a Christmas gift and I love it! I use these oils for everything.</li>
            <li> Great assortment and great quality.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but after using a few times I was hooked! I now SWEAR by these oils!! They are amazing quality, better than any I&#x27;ve ever used for sure. I definitely recommend these :)</li>
            <li> This is a very nice set. It came in two days! The bottles are nicely sealed and labeled. I really enjoy having the variety of all the scents at a reasonable cost. I am satisfied with the quality and will be purchasing from this company again.</li>
            <li> Loved the oils! Also, they arrived faster than they were expected to so that was nice!</li>
            <li> Can you add the lemon or grapefruit to water?</li>
            <li> No complaints here! I love my oils!</li>
            <li> I love Fabulous Franny oils! This item arrived before the estimated date for it to get here and it was packaged well! Everything was exactly as described and I was SO happy with my purchase I ordered a LOT more oils from Fabulous Franny! They all smell amazing and have so many uses! I love how long the scent lasts In my diffuser with these oils! I will always be a loyal customer as they have great customer service, high quality products, fair prices, &amp; lightning speed shipping! Love my oils :)</li>
            <li> Nice set of different essential oils!</li>
            <li> Just beginning to get into the essential oils and love this set.  Have made several recipes and I have been really pleased.  Would recommend, great price and fast delivery.</li>
