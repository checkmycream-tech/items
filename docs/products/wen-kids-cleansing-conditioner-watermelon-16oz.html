            <li>so glad to say the strawberry banana has grown on me!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very gentle, smells wonderful, and does the job without irritation of any kind.</li>

            <li>/&gt;The scent* on apple AMAZING on strawberry banana ick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels AMAZING after using this.</li>
            <li>it does say use 10-20 pumps each time, but honestly I use 1-2 on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>nice comparable alternative to this product is the herbal essences cleansing conditioner (found it at Target for under $5).</li>
            <li>but it kind of felt like it had a coating on it, even after rinsing and rinsing.</li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase and fast service.</li>
            <li>* I am still loving wen kids and i</li>
            <li>I also am really loving these as a face wash with my clarisonic  as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apple is my favorite smelling but watermelon smells really good</li>
            <li>Apple is my favorite smelling but watermelon smells really good</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s getting more and more, and its growing!</li>
            <li>When I saw how perfectly my hair responded to WEN, I started using it on my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, will keep an eye out for discounts as it is more pricey than I normally allow.  </li>
            <li>Wen shampoo makes combing through her hair easy!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s Caucasian and has very fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>, It dosent stay so strong smelling in the hair after shower!</li>
            <li>Love the scent even better than the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; versions.</li>
            <li>I love Wen hair products, and I love the fact there is a product for children.</li>
            <li>I feel like she has more bounce to her curls the longer</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it makes her hair feel so fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed that her hair is growing more faster now as well.</li>
            <li>It acted more like a leave in.</li>
            <li>looks healthy, though I abuse the heck out of it.  </li>
            <li>It seems that strawberry-banana is the most moisturizing, apple is the most cleansing, and watermelon falls between them.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for summer laid back hair as well.  </li>
            <li>Grabbed the watermelon (seemed to be the safest scent) and it&#x27;s been fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>You must use more depending on the length of the hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the kids Wen.  </li>
            <li>but I am not a fan of using menthol on my scalp more then once or twice a week, so</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE how moisturizing it is.subtle scent in your hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li>dab of the conditioner that comes with Nice N&#x27; Easy light blond.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome</li>
            <li>I must say my hair is very clean after using these cleansing conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it give her hair great body and enhances her natural curl!</li>
            <li>Simply the best for removing tangles and keeping them out, and keeping a longer-lasting clean and glow.  </li>
            <li>leaves my hair tangle free, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month every other day and VERY happy (and she isn&#x27;t scratching her head any longer)!</li>
            <li>Kids hair  shines with a healthy glow and is soft, plus it smells good.</li>
            <li>Loved this particular scent.</li>
            <li>I use it as shampoo &amp; conditioner, but I may buy some cheap shampoo to use like once a week to clean her hair a bit better.</li>
            <li>, I would say WEN works just fine.  </li>
            <li>have fine, bleached blond hair.  </li>
            <li>I love Wen and have been a loyal customer TV shopping.  </li>
            <li>and another huge plus</li>
            <li>the product smells like light watermelom</li>
            <li>My daughter has what you would probably call \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair, although much softer than my own.  </li>
            <li>It is allergen free, which means menthol soy, and gluten free.</li>
            <li>works great on my teenage son&#x27;s swimmers hair as well!</li>
            <li>I Love WEN for my hair, so when I found out that WEN also made some for kids I ordered it right away.</li>
            <li>Does smell like jolly ranchers but not a bad scent and very mild once on hair.</li>
            <li>WEN softens the hair and the hair feels fresh and clean, love it.</li>
            <li>so it is a very gentle product great for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And now with the kid friendly conditioner, its super easy.</li>
            <li>worth the price!</li>
            <li>but SO worth it!</li>
            <li>My daughters hair looks clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li>These do clean the oils and product out of your hair.</li>
            <li>a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Her hair was very dry</li>
            <li>I love it and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>(sometimes 30 seconds, sometimes a full 2 minutes)</li>
            <li>The scent of the watermelon is sickly sweet in the bottle</li>
            <li>but once you rinse it out of your hair it leaves the best jolly rancher subtle scent in your hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and leaves my 10 month old daughters hair soft, shinny.</li>
            <li>my boys love it and their hair is so silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Rinse again, rub a dot of leave in conditioner on my hands, quickly apply to ends, before exiting shower.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I find it to be the most moisturizing out of the 3, apple being the most cleansing and strawberry somewhere in the middle..</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly too.</li>
            <li>Works great on my little ones hair.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money not to have to cut her hair or upset her with the tangled brushing.</li>
            <li>My daughter is almost two, she has really soft curly hair that tangles easily and dries out quickly.</li>
            <li>I am honestly thinking of buying it for myself, but my hair is very long and fine and doesn&#x27;t do well with conditioner (it gets VERY oily).</li>
            <li>plus the scent is very kid friendly.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
            <li>This arrived at my home very fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love regular wen</li>
            <li>I will for sure repurchase, I just wish they had bigger sizes!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not year free but worth the extra effort!</li>
            <li>All three scents are very strong in the bottle, but apple and watermelon are much more subtle on my hair, and I really like them.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much worked out to be even.</li>
            <li>Full of volume never heavy at all.</li>
            <li>My daughter has never had a lot of hair since she was born but thanks to this</li>
            <li>You dontbhave to use much product.</li>
            <li>It really does</li>
            <li>It makes her hair very manageable-</li>
            <li>and now her hair holds moisture and is so much easier to comb out .</li>
            <li>It is shiny, bouncy, really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Always wants me to use it on her hair.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I REALLY don&#x27;t like the scent of the strawberry-banana.  </li>
            <li>Smells good you have to use alot for the dosage recommended and after extensive rinsing it still weights my hair down.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I&#x27;m not getting the same feeling of clean, nor shine, nor manageability with this watermelon kids that I did with the adult line.</li>
            <li>Typically, I wash her hair once a week using WEN Kids; there are three scents, Strawberry Banana, Apple, and Watermelon (Watermelon is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.)  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before deciding what I wanted to use on her hair because I&#x27;m particular about using chemicals on her.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I actually started off by using the adult WEN on her hair, Sweet Almond Mint, which is the mildest formula of the line.  </li>
            <li>So glad this product helps keep him moisturized and less flaky!  </li>
            <li>My daughter has fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I really like the kids smells because they are fresh and not as off putting as I find some of the other Wen smells to be.  </li>
            <li>First let me say that I have this in both Apple and Strawberry banana,  The strawberry banana smells so gross to me</li>
            <li>naturally when wen kids came out I had to try it!  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp, and found that WEN Kids was easier on it than the adult scents I&#x27;ve tried: Pomegranate and Tea Tree.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>EVEN MY 9 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER; SAID MAW MAW</li>
            <li>I gave this a 3 star because it did leave my hair soft...</li>
            <li>It also does not work as well as the adult Wen product that I purchased from an authorized retailer.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work better on my 6 year old granddaughter&#x27;s hair which isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li>This gets the knots out easily and very little brushing and &amp;#34;ouchies.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little spendy but so worth the money!</li>
            <li>and I could really tell the difference the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li>She has thick hair and apparently did not do any better than her store bought shampoo.</li>
            <li>I normal don&#x27;t wash her hair daily.  </li>
            <li>her hair before her bath, her hair is silky smooth and hardly gets knots anymore (lots of little curls tend to get knotted quick and often).</li>
            <li>Upon first use, my daughter actually sat still for me to brush her hair (wet) to make her look presentable in public!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair a little less manageable, and more frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has very long wavy hair that becomes very tangled with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>Regular shampoos really do some bad stuff to him and it just isn&#x27;t fair to him to itch and flake all over - especially as a teen.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I after I cut my hair a few inches next week, I may try some of my daughter&#x27;s for a week and see if it&#x27;s even worth the money for myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I buy this for my 15 year old son because he gets really dry scalp in the winter and this doesn&#x27;t make it worse - in fact his scalp is better using the Wen Kids version.  </li>
            <li>The bottle tells you to use a certain amount based on hair length, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I would get by with half the recommended amount (my daughter&#x27;s hair still came out looking like a million dollars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the Almond Mint myself and my 2 year old daughter has curly hair and a dry scalp.</li>
            <li>As an adult female, I use Wen and have for a long time.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not long lasting.</li>

            <li> It acted more like a leave in.</li>
            <li> looks healthy, though I abuse the heck out of it.  </li>
            <li> It seems that strawberry-banana is the most moisturizing, apple is the most cleansing, and watermelon falls between them.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for summer laid back hair as well.  </li>
            <li> Grabbed the watermelon (seemed to be the safest scent) and it&#x27;s been fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> You must use more depending on the length of the hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the kids Wen.  </li>
            <li> but I am not a fan of using menthol on my scalp more then once or twice a week, so</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE how moisturizing it is.subtle scent in your hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li> dab of the conditioner that comes with Nice N&#x27; Easy light blond.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome</li>
            <li> I must say my hair is very clean after using these cleansing conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it give her hair great body and enhances her natural curl!</li>
            <li> Simply the best for removing tangles and keeping them out, and keeping a longer-lasting clean and glow.  </li>
            <li> leaves my hair tangle free, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month every other day and VERY happy (and she isn&#x27;t scratching her head any longer)!</li>
            <li> Kids hair  shines with a healthy glow and is soft, plus it smells good.</li>
            <li> Loved this particular scent.</li>
            <li> I use it as shampoo &amp; conditioner, but I may buy some cheap shampoo to use like once a week to clean her hair a bit better.</li>
            <li> , I would say WEN works just fine.  </li>
            <li> have fine, bleached blond hair.  </li>
            <li> I love Wen and have been a loyal customer TV shopping.  </li>
            <li> and another huge plus</li>
            <li> the product smells like light watermelom</li>
            <li> My daughter has what you would probably call \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair, although much softer than my own.  </li>
            <li> It is allergen free, which means menthol soy, and gluten free.</li>
            <li> works great on my teenage son&#x27;s swimmers hair as well!</li>
            <li> I Love WEN for my hair, so when I found out that WEN also made some for kids I ordered it right away.</li>
            <li> Does smell like jolly ranchers but not a bad scent and very mild once on hair.</li>
            <li> WEN softens the hair and the hair feels fresh and clean, love it.</li>
            <li> so it is a very gentle product great for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And now with the kid friendly conditioner, its super easy.</li>
            <li> worth the price!</li>
            <li> but SO worth it!</li>
            <li> My daughters hair looks clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li> These do clean the oils and product out of your hair.</li>
            <li> a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Her hair was very dry</li>
            <li> I love it and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> (sometimes 30 seconds, sometimes a full 2 minutes)</li>
            <li> The scent of the watermelon is sickly sweet in the bottle</li>
            <li> but once you rinse it out of your hair it leaves the best jolly rancher subtle scent in your hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and leaves my 10 month old daughters hair soft, shinny.</li>
            <li> my boys love it and their hair is so silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Rinse again, rub a dot of leave in conditioner on my hands, quickly apply to ends, before exiting shower.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I find it to be the most moisturizing out of the 3, apple being the most cleansing and strawberry somewhere in the middle..</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly too.</li>
            <li> Works great on my little ones hair.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money not to have to cut her hair or upset her with the tangled brushing.</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost two, she has really soft curly hair that tangles easily and dries out quickly.</li>
            <li> I am honestly thinking of buying it for myself, but my hair is very long and fine and doesn&#x27;t do well with conditioner (it gets VERY oily).</li>
            <li> plus the scent is very kid friendly.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
            <li> This arrived at my home very fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love regular wen</li>
            <li> I will for sure repurchase, I just wish they had bigger sizes!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not year free but worth the extra effort!</li>
            <li> All three scents are very strong in the bottle, but apple and watermelon are much more subtle on my hair, and I really like them.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much worked out to be even.</li>
            <li> Full of volume never heavy at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter has never had a lot of hair since she was born but thanks to this</li>
            <li> You dontbhave to use much product.</li>
            <li> It really does</li>
            <li> It makes her hair very manageable-</li>
            <li> and now her hair holds moisture and is so much easier to comb out .</li>
            <li> It is shiny, bouncy, really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Always wants me to use it on her hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I REALLY don&#x27;t like the scent of the strawberry-banana.  </li>
            <li> Smells good you have to use alot for the dosage recommended and after extensive rinsing it still weights my hair down.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m not getting the same feeling of clean, nor shine, nor manageability with this watermelon kids that I did with the adult line.</li>
            <li> Typically, I wash her hair once a week using WEN Kids; there are three scents, Strawberry Banana, Apple, and Watermelon (Watermelon is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.)  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before deciding what I wanted to use on her hair because I&#x27;m particular about using chemicals on her.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I actually started off by using the adult WEN on her hair, Sweet Almond Mint, which is the mildest formula of the line.  </li>
            <li> So glad this product helps keep him moisturized and less flaky!  </li>
            <li> My daughter has fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I really like the kids smells because they are fresh and not as off putting as I find some of the other Wen smells to be.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that I have this in both Apple and Strawberry banana,  The strawberry banana smells so gross to me</li>
            <li> naturally when wen kids came out I had to try it!  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp, and found that WEN Kids was easier on it than the adult scents I&#x27;ve tried: Pomegranate and Tea Tree.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> EVEN MY 9 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER; SAID MAW MAW</li>
            <li> I gave this a 3 star because it did leave my hair soft...</li>
            <li> It also does not work as well as the adult Wen product that I purchased from an authorized retailer.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work better on my 6 year old granddaughter&#x27;s hair which isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li> This gets the knots out easily and very little brushing and &amp;#34;ouchies.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little spendy but so worth the money!</li>
            <li> and I could really tell the difference the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li> She has thick hair and apparently did not do any better than her store bought shampoo.</li>
            <li> I normal don&#x27;t wash her hair daily.  </li>
            <li> her hair before her bath, her hair is silky smooth and hardly gets knots anymore (lots of little curls tend to get knotted quick and often).</li>
            <li> Upon first use, my daughter actually sat still for me to brush her hair (wet) to make her look presentable in public!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair a little less manageable, and more frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has very long wavy hair that becomes very tangled with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Regular shampoos really do some bad stuff to him and it just isn&#x27;t fair to him to itch and flake all over - especially as a teen.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I after I cut my hair a few inches next week, I may try some of my daughter&#x27;s for a week and see if it&#x27;s even worth the money for myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I buy this for my 15 year old son because he gets really dry scalp in the winter and this doesn&#x27;t make it worse - in fact his scalp is better using the Wen Kids version.  </li>
            <li> The bottle tells you to use a certain amount based on hair length, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I would get by with half the recommended amount (my daughter&#x27;s hair still came out looking like a million dollars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the Almond Mint myself and my 2 year old daughter has curly hair and a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> As an adult female, I use Wen and have for a long time.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Very small bottle, and it goes WAY to fast for the amount of money!!</li>
            <li> It is still a very thick and rich conditioner</li>
            <li> and it was starting to get really really dry this summer (</li>
            <li> It tamed some of the frizz but did not completely take it away.</li>
            <li> , I rinse her hair well, work in the Wen for as long as she lets me</li>
            <li> But due to current needs (chemo)</li>
            <li> I use this in the summer when my daughters hair gets dry and knotted from swimming.  </li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> Hope it helps someone else with dry winter scalp as well!</li>
            <li> then I do regular wen, almost half as much!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has very very long curly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes it takes a few extra minutes</li>
            <li> The product is expensive, but it saves me so much money on other hair products--conditioners, leave in conditioners, moisturizers, etc.--that from a financial perspective</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other product for their hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I am a Wen user, and decided to try the kids version due to reviews.</li>
            <li> I dry, straighten or curl my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> Not worth all the money for the hype.</li>
            <li> but my daughters hair still didn&#x27;t look greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I use way less than suggested</li>
            <li> so its not like  you are getting any less of a luxurious product.  </li>
            <li> My little girl has long Curley hair that was hard to manage, until I got this this product.</li>
            <li> Gift for my niece who has curly long hair that usually is so unmanageable.... but not now!</li>
            <li> Shampoos are too harsh and dry and dull the hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey though.</li>
            <li> Purchased this cleaning conditioner for my little granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I wash with this everyday.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well on my hair as the adult WEN scents I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that it&#x27;s EXPENSIVE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a legitimate product.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s impossible when it comes to rinsing and a few times I haven&#x27;t completely rinsed out the product on accident</li>
            <li> * very thick and luxurious just like all other wen products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate wasting WEN, but I dislike the strawberry-banana scent so much that I&#x27;m not going to finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very fake smelling.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  :-(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It left my daughters hair looking oily.  I normal don&#x27;t wash her hair daily.  With this product I had to wash her hair daily.  It tamed some of the frizz but did not completely take it away.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, will keep an eye out for discounts as it is more pricey than I normally allow.  But due to current needs (chemo) it&#x27;s very gentle, smells wonderful, and does the job without irritation of any kind. Especially like that there&#x27;s no menthol in this product.</li>
            <li> Simply the best for removing tangles and keeping them out, and keeping a longer-lasting clean and glow.  My eight-year-old loves it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.. It locks the moisture in my son&#x27;s hair..the product smells like light watermelom</li>
            <li> The ONLY shampoo I use on my daughter! The kids scents all smell awesome! It&#x27;s not year free but worth the extra effort!</li>
            <li> My daughter has never had a lot of hair since she was born but thanks to this she&#x27;s getting more and more, and its growing!</li>
            <li> Kids hair  shines with a healthy glow and is soft, plus it smells good. You dontbhave to use much product. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good. Love the scent even better than the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; versions. Not too jarring.</li>
            <li> great for kids hair, and smell awesome</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old granddaughter. She has thick hair and apparently did not do any better than her store bought shampoo. It seemed to work better on my 6 year old granddaughter&#x27;s hair which isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li> Smelled wonderful like watermelon jolly ranchers! I only use WEN on my hair. Shampoos are too harsh and dry and dull the hair. WEN is my best friend</li>
            <li> I love Wen hair products, and I love the fact there is a product for children. My granddaughter has very long wavy hair that becomes very tangled with regular shampoo. Wen shampoo makes combing through her hair easy! And it give her hair great body and enhances her natural curl! It&#x27;s a little spendy but so worth the money!</li>
            <li> This works fabulous for my grandkids hair and it smells great</li>
            <li> It works great in my daughters hair will be buying more</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I bought it for my daughter. She&#x27;s Caucasian and has very fine curly hair. I use it as shampoo &amp; conditioner, but I may buy some cheap shampoo to use like once a week to clean her hair a bit better. It really does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Her hair was very dry a where her bangs are and now they have some life and volume. I am honestly thinking of buying it for myself, but my hair is very long and fine and doesn&#x27;t do well with conditioner (it gets VERY oily). Maybe I after I cut my hair a few inches next week, I may try some of my daughter&#x27;s for a week and see if it&#x27;s even worth the money for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Oh it does say use 10-20 pumps each time, but honestly I use 1-2 on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has shoulder length, and it works just as well. I just put it on at the beginning of the bath and let it sit until I&#x27;m finished bathing her. I feel like she has more bounce to her curls the longer it sits.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It does what it says.  However, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel any differently when I use my Redken shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;So, I would say WEN works just fine.  It is a little pricey though.</li>
            <li> What a great product. My little girl has long Curley hair that was hard to manage, until I got this this product. It&#x27;s everything advertised. The watermelon scent it great.</li>
            <li> Gift for my niece who has curly long hair that usually is so unmanageable.... but not now! WEN is a one wash saving grace! And now with the kid friendly conditioner, its super easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter (who has *the curliest* and *frizziest* hair on the planet), and boy, it stands up to the WEN name.  Upon first use, my daughter actually sat still for me to brush her hair (wet) to make her look presentable in public!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s EXPENSIVE.  The bottle tells you to use a certain amount based on hair length, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I would get by with half the recommended amount (my daughter&#x27;s hair still came out looking like a million dollars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice comparable alternative to this product is the herbal essences cleansing conditioner (found it at Target for under $5).</li>
            <li> EVEN MY 9 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER; SAID MAW MAW IF IT AIN&#x27;T WEN IT DON&#x27;T COME IN !!!!!!!! LOL</li>
            <li> My 18 month daughter has a ton of curly hair (she was born with a lot of hair)...and it was starting to get really really dry this summer (and she was scratching her head a lot).  I did a lot of research before deciding what I wanted to use on her hair because I&#x27;m particular about using chemicals on her.  I decided to try WEN and am so happy we did.  I like how we don&#x27;t have to use a shampoo &amp; a conditioner &amp; a detangler!!!!  Her hair is beautiful with WEN - her curls are gorgeous and her hair silky to touch...not to mention I love the watermelon smell!  We&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month every other day and VERY happy (and she isn&#x27;t scratching her head any longer)!</li>
            <li> We use nothing but Wen haircare products in my home.  I buy this for my 15 year old son because he gets really dry scalp in the winter and this doesn&#x27;t make it worse - in fact his scalp is better using the Wen Kids version.  Regular shampoos really do some bad stuff to him and it just isn&#x27;t fair to him to itch and flake all over - especially as a teen.  So glad this product helps keep him moisturized and less flaky!  And no - I don&#x27;t work for Wen - nor is this product sold as a dandruff shampoo.  I&#x27;m just sharing our experiences with it.  Hope it helps someone else with dry winter scalp as well!</li>
            <li> This product smells so good.</li>
            <li> Great aroma. Loved this particular scent.</li>
            <li> I use this in the summer when my daughters hair gets dry and knotted from swimming.  It makes her hair very manageable- plus the scent is very kid friendly. It is great for adults as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN! I started using it about three years ago. It&#x27;s now the only hair product I use.  When I saw how perfectly my hair responded to WEN, I started using it on my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair (she was about 3 at the time.)  It makes her hair feel soft and moisturized, with springy, non-frizzy curls, and it&#x27;s so much easier to manage (her hair is extremely thick.)  I am bi-racial; my husband white.  My daughter has what you would probably call \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair, although much softer than my own.  Typically, I wash her hair once a week using WEN Kids; there are three scents, Strawberry Banana, Apple, and Watermelon (Watermelon is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.)  I actually started off by using the adult WEN on her hair, Sweet Almond Mint, which is the mildest formula of the line.  It too worked wonders on her hair, but after WEN Kids was created, I switched to that line.  The product is expensive, but it saves me so much money on other hair products--conditioners, leave in conditioners, moisturizers, etc.--that from a financial perspective it&#x27;s pretty much worked out to be even. Furthermore, it makes her hair feel so fantastic!  There&#x27;s nothing like Wen! I love it and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Smells great.  I love Wen and have been a loyal customer TV shopping.  I really like the kids smells because they are fresh and not as off putting as I find some of the other Wen smells to be.  All Wen products are great!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Does smell like jolly ranchers but not a bad scent and very mild once on hair. Kids love it!</li>
            <li> Went thru all kinds, brands, sizes of conditioners. WEN softens the hair and the hair feels fresh and clean, love it.</li>
            <li> I Love WEN for my hair, so when I found out that WEN also made some for kids I ordered it right away. I LOVE this product!!! Smells great, and leaves my 10 month old daughters hair soft, shinny. I have also noticed that her hair is growing more faster now as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My daughters hair looks clean and conditioned. My daughter has fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. She hates washing her hair, so it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s one step and your done. She&#x27;s impossible when it comes to rinsing and a few times I haven&#x27;t completely rinsed out the product on accident but my daughters hair still didn&#x27;t look greasy or weighed down. It acted more like a leave in. I use way less than suggested and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> As an adult female, I use Wen and have for a long time. It&#x27;s dramatically improved my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, those whom say, &amp;#34;it makes my hair fall out&amp;#34; they aren&#x27;t using the correct amount when applying. It takes about 14 pumps for medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they HAVE KIDS! WOOT, WOOT! my boys love it and their hair is so silky smooth and soft. Won&#x27;t use any other product for their hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am a Wen user, and decided to try the kids version due to reviews. Unfortunately I&#x27;m not getting the same feeling of clean, nor shine, nor manageability with this watermelon kids that I did with the adult line. I gave this a 3 star because it did leave my hair soft...but it kind of felt like it had a coating on it, even after rinsing and rinsing. I didnt feel that with the others. I think SIX13 is the best for moisture and shine...I will return to that.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for tangled curly hair</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost two, she has really soft curly hair that tangles easily and dries out quickly. I got this WEN about a month ago and I could really tell the difference the first few times I used it. I was her hair three times a week and now her hair holds moisture and is so much easier to comb out .</li>
            <li> Purchased this cleaning conditioner for my little granddaughter. She loves this conditioner and the watermelon scent. Very happy with purchase and fast service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using wen on my hair for several years and decided to start using this on my daughter since she didn&#x27;t like the scents that I use.  I also use it as a leave in conditioner and it works great and keeps her hair from tangling.</li>
            <li> Best thing to happen to my hair ever.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, bleached blond hair.  I wash with this everyday.  I use 2 pumps, was, rinse, then 1 pump and leave on while I finish shower. Rinse again, rub a dot of leave in conditioner on my hands, quickly apply to ends, before exiting shower.&lt;br /&gt;When I towel dry my hair it removes any excess.  I dry, straighten or curl my hair everyday.  It is shiny, bouncy, really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I looks healthy, though I abuse the heck out of it.  Wen+a dab of the conditioner that comes with Nice N&#x27; Easy light blond.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a legitimate product. The fragrance is not long lasting. It also does not work as well as the adult Wen product that I purchased from an authorized retailer. Maybe these issues are because it is a &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; version, but it seems to just be an inferior product. I also cannot find it offered on the official Wen website.</li>
            <li> Smells good you have to use alot for the dosage recommended and after extensive rinsing it still weights my hair down. Not worth all the money for the hype. Very disappointed!  :-(</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works great on my little ones hair.  She loves the scent.  Always wants me to use it on her hair.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp, and found that WEN Kids was easier on it than the adult scents I&#x27;ve tried: Pomegranate and Tea Tree.  My scalp isn&#x27;t peeling, breaking out, or itching when I use WEN kids.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well on my hair as the adult WEN scents I&#x27;ve tried.  My hair a little less manageable, and more frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all three of the WEN Kids scents.  It seems that strawberry-banana is the most moisturizing, apple is the most cleansing, and watermelon falls between them.  All three scents are very strong in the bottle, but apple and watermelon are much more subtle on my hair, and I really like them.  Unfortunately, I REALLY don&#x27;t like the scent of the strawberry-banana.  I hate wasting WEN, but I dislike the strawberry-banana scent so much that I&#x27;m not going to finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hair isn&#x27;t quite as manageable with WEN Kids as it is with regular WEN, I&#x27;m going to stick with it, since it&#x27;s calming for my scalp.  I strongly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
            <li> Great for the kids and great for me.  No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has very very long curly thick hair.  This gets the knots out easily and very little brushing and &amp;#34;ouchies.&amp;#34;  Perfect for summer laid back hair as well.  I used it on my own hair and its great.  Worth the money not to have to cut her hair or upset her with the tangled brushing.</li>
            <li> I use the Almond Mint myself and my 2 year old daughter has curly hair and a dry scalp. Grabbed the watermelon (seemed to be the safest scent) and it&#x27;s been fantastic! I don&#x27;t need to &amp;#34;pre comb&amp;#34; her hair before her bath, her hair is silky smooth and hardly gets knots anymore (lots of little curls tend to get knotted quick and often). Very happy with the result and will continue using Wen on my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only need 4 pumps per her, I rinse her hair well, work in the Wen for as long as she lets me (sometimes 30 seconds, sometimes a full 2 minutes), then let it sit for 5-8 minutes while she plays, and rinse out. Any greasy feeling would result from not pre-rinsing the hair enough or fully rinsing out all the conditioner. Yes it takes a few extra minutes but SO worth it!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and smells so good! This arrived at my home very fast. This shipped from the Wen company it self.</li>
            <li> This came in a timely manner! I love this product. My daughter has wavy hair, and this product does not frizz her hair out. I like that. Watermelon smells....okay. Very fake smelling. I will try another scent next time! Please know, that you have to use 10 pumps of this product, per the instructions on the back. You must use more depending on the length of the hair. My daughter has shoulder length hair, so 10 pumps was efficient. However, you will go through this like no ones business! Very small bottle, and it goes WAY to fast for the amount of money!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the kids Wen.  It smells amazing and works great on my daughters hair.  LOVE IT!  Wen is always great and now we will add this to our must haves.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have this in both Apple and Strawberry banana,  The strawberry banana smells so gross to me but I refuse to return a good product so I will use it up, It dosent stay so strong smelling in the hair after shower! The apple smells absolutely delicious thought! YUM! I love regular wen but I am not a fan of using menthol on my scalp more then once or twice a week, so naturally when wen kids came out I had to try it!  It is allergen free, which means menthol soy, and gluten free. It is still a very thick and rich conditioner so its not like  you are getting any less of a luxurious product.  I also used it as a face wash with my clarisonic and my face wasnt irritated at all so it is a very gentle product great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The scent* on apple AMAZING on strawberry banana ick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;texture* very thick and luxurious just like all other wen products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cleansing ability* These do clean the oils and product out of your hair. I must say my hair is very clean after using these cleansing conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;conditioner ability* This is a great great conditioner. leaves my hair tangle free, shiny and healthy. Full of volume never heavy at all. My hair looks and feels AMAZING after using this. I will for sure repurchase, I just wish they had bigger sizes!  Oh and another huge plus is that I need to use way lesss of this then I do regular wen, almost half as much!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** update** I am still loving wen kids and im so glad to say the strawberry banana has grown on me! I just placed another order buying all 3 so I could try watermelon as well. I also am really loving these as a face wash with my clarisonic  as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** another update** Wen watermelon is amazing! I find it to be the most moisturizing out of the 3, apple being the most cleansing and strawberry somewhere in the middle.. The scent of the watermelon is sickly sweet in the bottle but once you rinse it out of your hair it leaves the best jolly rancher subtle scent in your hair. I LOVE IT. Apple is my favorite smelling but watermelon smells really good and I LOVE how moisturizing it is.subtle scent in your hair. I LOVE IT. Apple is my favorite smelling but watermelon smells really good and I LOVE how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me Wen and I love it! I hadn&#x27;t heard of it before and was happy to find it on Amazon. I actually use the kids cleanser because the scents are so yummy. works great on my teenage son&#x27;s swimmers hair as well! I received the product quickly too. Very pleased with product and ease of ordering.</li>
            <li> Works really great, but does not smell great!</li>
