    <ol>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>I have had one of these for years and find it to be durable and absolutely awesome for removing those unwanted blemishes.</li>
            <li>Does not have the best shape.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the best at removing blackheads/whiteheads either</li>
            <li>So this is an excellent buy.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect if you have tourture in mind.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have blackheads, but it works great on whiteheads.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on my face.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool to have around.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman is a great brand</li>
            <li>A cosmetologist told me to use 2 cotton swabs when removing black/white heads and honestly I think this works the best.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>A great price on an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>The customer service was outstanding!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I feel like if you have large pores it would work great (worked great on my husband *</li>
            <li>I saw Dr. Oz say to you use one these instruments to safely remove blackheads while watching his show.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off using finger nails.</li>
            <li>Much more sanitary than using your fingers.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to sanitize the remover before each use.</li>
            <li>I could just use my fingers and get better results.</li>
            <li>But quite frankly it&#x27;s much better (and more sanitary) than using your hands, and of course there is the chance of scarring then too.</li>
            <li>Make sure to remove the cotton on one of the swabs.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman has always been the top of the line product.  </li>
            <li>Certainly better than trying to squeeze out blackheads with your fingers</li>
            <li>I love Tweezerman and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective for fast and safe removal of affected spots.</li>
            <li>unless you use a hot towel, take a shower, or wash you face with warm water.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to remember is to clean both the device AND your face both before and after use.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman makes fine equipment I use a lot of their nail instruments (I&#x27;m a licensed nail technician).</li>
            <li>but the results were less than impressive.    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see how this could be used for a blackhead unless the blackhead was huge.</li>
            <li>Using them incorrectly can cause permanent damage to your skin, but using then correctly can make a huge difference in your complexion.  </li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t forget to sanitize it after every use :)     Have fun being blemish free ^^</li>
            <li>This device is great for removing both white heads and stubborn blackheads.  </li>
            <li>much perfer the Revlon, as it is angled better and had a tighter loop to all for more targetted use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, very sleek.&lt;br</li>
            <li>possibly tears :p</li>
            <li>I was excited about this when I ordered it</li>
            <li>I purchased this tool, thinking it would help me clean out some blackheads on my chin, and a couple of whiteheads that were also on my chin.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I had whiteheads it basically \\&quot;sanded\\&quot; off the top layer, but really I still had a lot of stuff underneath.</li>
            <li>I know this whole process might sound a bit gross, but it really feels great getting all that who-knows-what out of your skin.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset with this product and strongly recommend against it.</li>
            <li>The whitehead remover portion (more wire shaped) also works really well to gently push it up and scrape it off.</li>
            <li>The thing is, the first time I tried it I forgot to wash my face with warm water to open up the pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised to say this instrument does exactly what it says it will, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Seems pretty well made.</li>
            <li>I got my products exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get many white heads</li>
            <li>I said that*)</li>
            <li>He told me it really works and doesn&#x27;t hurt and got those stubborn ones right away.</li>
            <li>I HAD NO IDEA THAT I HAD SKIN ALLERGIES TO THIS CERTAIN METAL.</li>
            <li>I HAVE NEVER HAD A REACTION BEFORE, THE SIDE OF THE EXTRACTOR SAYS STAINLESS INDIA, WHAT</li>
            <li>This makes it MUCH easier to extract even the smallest blackheads.  </li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>This Tweezerman blackhead remover really just pushes out the blackhead from the bottom up.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Using this tool is much easier than try to squeeze them out.</li>
            <li>and it stayed for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the product much, but it does what it is intended</li>
            <li>what I really wanted after I got it.</li>
            <li>Very durable and sturdy</li>
            <li>I hear from a few people that this product hurts a bit for them, but honestly I didn&#x27;t really feel anything at all.</li>
            <li>I received e-mails providing the status of my order and when I had an item to return, it was extremely EASY with absolutely no hassles.</li>
            <li>I use this particular product myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much too old to have blackheads, but when I read about it them</li>
            <li>I now ADORE this blackhead remover item and CANNOT live without it.</li>
            <li>I am a female adult in my 30s, well past the stage of adolescent breakouts, and have had the good fortune to experience clear skin 99 days out of every 100.  </li>
            <li>In fact, this is the second one I&#x27;m ordering, lost the first one in the move from CA to TX.</li>
            <li>but was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>With this one that technique will not usually work.</li>
            <li>they are all clustered on my chin, in the exact areas I was pressing with the tool 3 days prior).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was my first time using such a product</li>
            <li>Thanks for such high quality.</li>
            <li>it definitely gets the blackheads out, but to really get them out, you will have to feel some pain..</li>
            <li>This is highly unusual for my health history; in fact, I have never had such a thing happen to me.  </li>
            <li>Better to get the one that is round with a hole in the middle.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i needed, although a little more difficult than using one with a round end.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, and good for the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty dumb-friendly, just press and slowly drag and all the nasties come out.</li>
            <li>I finally did what I should have done before all the black marks, I bought a blackhead extractor which is face friendly.  </li>
            <li>After cleaning the brand new instrument with isopropyl alcohol, and following the instructions for usage, it popped the whiteheads, but did not do anything to remove in any blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afraid it sounded and looked more useful then it is.</li>
            <li>On rare occasions, I will have a stubborn whiteheads that grow next to each other.  </li>
            <li>The thing about Proactive, and other face wash, is that it scrubs the outer layer really well but doesn&#x27;t get all the gunk out of the bottom.</li>
            <li>With the spoon style you simply mash straight down on the pimple and it pops.</li>
            <li>A little too large for what it&#x27;s made for.</li>

            <li> With the spoon style you simply mash straight down on the pimple and it pops.</li>
            <li> A little too large for what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li> It looks like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a $5 tool from Avon (Canada) that is completely flat, including the loop.</li>
            <li> You use the flat end and press it on the blackhead (with the blackhead still visible, but just at the root of it) and it comes out.     </li>
            <li> This tool works and is well made, but it has a really wide head on one end that is angled in such as way that you have to hold the tool perpendicular to your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s almost too big to be a black head remover</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A STAINLESS STEEL METAL.</li>
            <li> I have been using it to remove a few tiny whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> However, I picked mine up at a beauty supply store a few years ago for double the price here.</li>
            <li> If you use this as recommended, you will find that there is minimal damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> Both work adequately on larger blackheads but for smaller ones the loop&#x27;s metal is just too thick.</li>
            <li> The loop exerts pressure on only three sides of the blemish and allows the pressure to escape towards the fourth side, and that reduction in pressure keeps the blemish from being forced to pop.</li>
            <li> This product was extremely helpful in removing blemished areas.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son, who going through those teenage years had a hard time with his skin.</li>
            <li> It works well on hard flat parts of the face like the forehead where the bone shows.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some money and use cotton swabs which hurt less, work and are disposable.</li>
            <li> Less of a chance of inflaming the problem area, which makes for quicker healing.</li>
            <li> If you buy this product another word of caution is to be careful not to be too excessive because I hear there might be a slight chance of scarring.</li>
            <li> but if you have small pores I hate to say it but fingernails work better.      </li>
            <li> The tool is just too big to be used for small pores or delicate areas of the face.</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T WORK AS STATED, VERY HARD TO USE &amp; MADE SKIN RED!</li>
            <li> You have to push down way to hard and than afterwards it leaves a mark on your face.</li>
            <li> Stubborn black heads are the worst to rid yourself of and this made it really easy.  </li>
            <li> No better than any others out there.  </li>
            <li> These blemish extractors come in at least two styles: a wire loop like this one, and a style where the end looks like a small spoon with a hole in the bottom.</li>
            <li> I learned blackheads on the lip line are a common consequence of wearing lipstick, chap stick, etc.</li>
            <li> (my terrible skin has made me a pro, unfortunately), Avon has the better remover.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this was designed by a sociopath or masochist.  </li>
            <li> this tool is useless for what I needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Later addition: After my spoon style tool failed on me sometimes I gave this one another try and after learning how to use it I&#x27;ve revised my opinion.</li>
            <li> Popping at the wrong time can lead to scarring.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, waste of money.</li>
            <li> SO BAD</li>
            <li> Thought it was bad product.</li>
            <li> Made my face look as if I have a bad rash</li>
            <li> One of the worst inventions ever!</li>

            <li> it definitely gets the blackheads out, but to really get them out, you will have to feel some pain.. possibly tears :p</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A STAINLESS STEEL METAL. MY FACE SWELLED SO BAD THAT I HAD TO GO TO ER AND THEN STAY THE NIGHT!!!! I HAD NO IDEA THAT I HAD SKIN ALLERGIES TO THIS CERTAIN METAL. I HAVE NEVER HAD A REACTION BEFORE, THE SIDE OF THE EXTRACTOR SAYS STAINLESS INDIA, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!???</li>
            <li> The customer service was outstanding! I got my products exactly as ordered. I received e-mails providing the status of my order and when I had an item to return, it was extremely EASY with absolutely no hassles. I will definitely do business with them again!</li>
            <li> I have two Tweezerman blackhead removers, a square handle and a rounded one. Both work adequately on larger blackheads but for smaller ones the loop&#x27;s metal is just too thick. I have a $5 tool from Avon (Canada) that is completely flat, including the loop. This makes it MUCH easier to extract even the smallest blackheads.  Tweezerman can&#x27;t be beat when it comes to tweezers but for blackhead extraction (my terrible skin has made me a pro, unfortunately), Avon has the better remover.</li>
            <li> After watching my dermatologist use a tool like this on me for whiteheads, I decided to buy one for myself and save a trip. Love this item. In fact, this is the second one I&#x27;m ordering, lost the first one in the move from CA to TX. I don&#x27;t have blackheads, but it works great on whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been abele to do anything with this. I&#x27;m better off using finger nails. I&#x27;m afraid it sounded and looked more useful then it is.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know if this product was going to work  but was pleasantly surprised!  Works great!  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> IT ARRIVED PROMPTLY BUT DIDN&#x27;T WORK AS STATED, VERY HARD TO USE &amp; MADE SKIN RED!</li>
            <li> This product was extremely helpful in removing blemished areas. Easy to use and effective for fast and safe removal of affected spots.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see how this could be used for a blackhead unless the blackhead was huge. It works well on big whiteheads though.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews. Had doubts about this item but it really works. Would recommend this to others. Much more sanitary than using your fingers. Just be sure to sanitize the remover before each use.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to have around. Tweezerman is a great brand and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This device is great for removing both white heads and stubborn blackheads.  I would advise anyone who buys one or is thinking of buying one to do some research on YouTube on the proper way to use these.  Using them incorrectly can cause permanent damage to your skin, but using then correctly can make a huge difference in your complexion.  The most important thing to remember is to clean both the device AND your face both before and after use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend it. this tool is useless for what I needed. I could just use my fingers and get better results.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for years and find it to be durable and absolutely awesome for removing those unwanted blemishes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get many white heads so it&#x27;s almost too big to be a black head remover but it has worked a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Does not have the best shape. Better to get the one that is round with a hole in the middle.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed, although a little more difficult than using one with a round end.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, and good for the money</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I always use to have blackheads around the sides of my nose and used a plethora of skin care products to try to get rid of them. The thing about Proactive, and other face wash, is that it scrubs the outer layer really well but doesn&#x27;t get all the gunk out of the bottom. Whenever I had whiteheads it basically \\&quot;sanded\\&quot; off the top layer, but really I still had a lot of stuff underneath. This Tweezerman blackhead remover really just pushes out the blackhead from the bottom up. You use the flat end and press it on the blackhead (with the blackhead still visible, but just at the root of it) and it comes out.     The thing is, the first time I tried it I forgot to wash my face with warm water to open up the pores. It really doesn&#x27;t work unless you use a hot towel, take a shower, or wash you face with warm water. The whitehead remover portion (more wire shaped) also works really well to gently push it up and scrape it off. I know this whole process might sound a bit gross, but it really feels great getting all that who-knows-what out of your skin.     I hear from a few people that this product hurts a bit for them, but honestly I didn&#x27;t really feel anything at all. I now ADORE this blackhead remover item and CANNOT live without it. If you buy this product another word of caution is to be careful not to be too excessive because I hear there might be a slight chance of scarring. But quite frankly it&#x27;s much better (and more sanitary) than using your hands, and of course there is the chance of scarring then too. Also, don&#x27;t forget to sanitize it after every use :)     Have fun being blemish free ^^</li>
            <li> Did not work. Thought it was bad product.</li>
            <li> These blemish extractors come in at least two styles: a wire loop like this one, and a style where the end looks like a small spoon with a hole in the bottom. For me, the spoon style works and the loop style does not. The loop exerts pressure on only three sides of the blemish and allows the pressure to escape towards the fourth side, and that reduction in pressure keeps the blemish from being forced to pop. The spoon style puts pressure on all four sides and works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later addition: After my spoon style tool failed on me sometimes I gave this one another try and after learning how to use it I&#x27;ve revised my opinion. This one requires a different technique. With the spoon style you simply mash straight down on the pimple and it pops. With this one that technique will not usually work. Instead you have to scrape the pimple with the loop. It does put pressure on the pimple and will pop it when used that way. Both styles work for me to varying degrees.</li>
            <li> This product sometimes works and sometimes does not. It works well on hard flat parts of the face like the forehead where the bone shows. It does not work well on the chin or side of the nose. You have to push down way to hard and than afterwards it leaves a mark on your face. A cosmetologist told me to use 2 cotton swabs when removing black/white heads and honestly I think this works the best. Make sure to remove the cotton on one of the swabs. Lastly this product does not work on blackheads, only whiteheads. Save yourself some money and use cotton swabs which hurt less, work and are disposable.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman has always been the top of the line product.  This whitehead/blackhead remover does work.  I have been using it to remove a few tiny whiteheads.  Using this tool is much easier than try to squeeze them out.</li>
            <li> Horrible, waste of money. Made my face look as if I have a bad rash and it stayed for the whole day. Wasn&#x27;t the best at removing blackheads/whiteheads either</li>
            <li> It does the job I bought it for. Certainly better than trying to squeeze out blackheads with your fingers lol.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this when I ordered it but the results were less than impressive.    I feel like if you have large pores it would work great (worked great on my husband *don&#x27;t tell him I said that*) but if you have small pores I hate to say it but fingernails work better.      The tool is just too big to be used for small pores or delicate areas of the face.</li>
            <li> I am a female adult in my 30s, well past the stage of adolescent breakouts, and have had the good fortune to experience clear skin 99 days out of every 100.  On rare occasions, I will have a stubborn whiteheads that grow next to each other.  Popping at the wrong time can lead to scarring.  I also have tiny blackheads that are only visible upon close scrutiny (but I know they&#x27;re there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this tool, thinking it would help me clean out some blackheads on my chin, and a couple of whiteheads that were also on my chin.  After cleaning the brand new instrument with isopropyl alcohol, and following the instructions for usage, it popped the whiteheads, but did not do anything to remove in any blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the tool since that one time on that one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, 3 days later, I have 6 pimples in various stages developing on my chin (coincidence?  I think not.  I do not have any pimples anywhere else...they are all clustered on my chin, in the exact areas I was pressing with the tool 3 days prior).  This is highly unusual for my health history; in fact, I have never had such a thing happen to me.  I followed the instructions to the letter, and my efforts have resulted in mass breakouts.  I&#x27;m very upset with this product and strongly recommend against it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product much, but it does what it is intended well and is well made.</li>
            <li> Or it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this so I could stop using my grubby hands on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I gave up though because I couldn&#x27;t figure it out.</li>
            <li> This tool works and is well made, but it has a really wide head on one end that is angled in such as way that you have to hold the tool perpendicular to your face.&lt;br /&gt;I much perfer the Revlon, as it is angled better and had a tighter loop to all for more targetted use.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman and this is no exception.  A great price on an amazing product.  Thanks for such high quality.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x60;t what I really wanted after I got it.</li>
            <li> Very durable and sturdy</li>
            <li> I have been licensed cosmotologist for about 15 years. I use this particular product myself. However, I picked mine up at a beauty supply store a few years ago for double the price here. So this is an excellent buy. If you use this as recommended, you will find that there is minimal damage to the skin. Less of a chance of inflaming the problem area, which makes for quicker healing. I would suggest though, if you have this item and are using it, please don&#x27;t forget to sanitize it after each use. If you do not, then you are just transferring bacteria back onto the skin. I also think this should be given to every teenager so they are showed the correct way to extract those unsightly whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li> No better than any others out there.  In fact, I prefer the model my husband had before I met him and it isn&#x27;t a Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect if you have tourture in mind.  Otherwise, keep shopping and find something different.  All this product does is cause pain to the point of streaming tears.  Seriously, this was designed by a sociopath or masochist.  One of the worst inventions ever!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, very sleek.&lt;br /&gt;It was my first time using such a product and I was worried without instructions I may not know how to properly use it lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty dumb-friendly, just press and slowly drag and all the nasties come out.</li>
            <li> I will def recommend this product to anyone with blackheads. I was nervous because I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was looking for then when it arrived I tried it and it works great.</li>
