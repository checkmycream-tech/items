            <li>I ended up having to cut a top of the top off!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing makeup application and finish.</li>

            <li>love this system.</li>

            <li>And forget about touching it up, you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I also love the combinations of the colors provided.</li>
            <li>but now I love it</li>
            <li>The bag is cute and all the things you see on the ad are mailed to you.</li>
            <li>love this product.....</li>
            <li>So...no more questions asked...</li>
            <li>if you use a sunscreen/moisturizer...make sure you give it time to soak in before applying the makeup.</li>
            <li>Make up is ok.</li>
            <li>this stuff is just OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and easy wear off.</li>
            <li>I needed to use a good consealer first.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend the air brush to anyone that wants a flawless look.</li>
            <li>Glam air is better and runs through this machine just fine.</li>
            <li>(That is why I gave it two stars: very very cool looking.)  </li>
            <li>, Sure we will ship you a bottle for FREE, what color do you want?</li>
            <li>it’s so easy to use the makeup colors</li>
            <li>I have never used an airbrush before, but this is easy to learn and use.  </li>
            <li>the communication was by e-mail and the airbrush gun was sent out and I received it and a pre-paid label to return within 2 days very quick.</li>
            <li>Its easy for her to apply when we go on dates and whenever she needs to &amp;</li>
            <li>you are going to love how it looks and how quick and easy it</li>
            <li>(Im fine with that).</li>
            <li>give up too quickly!  </li>
            <li>Everything works as it should as is easy to use great coverage that last all day.</li>
            <li>This is a great set for starting out.  </li>
            <li>Practice on your hand and make sue to keep the makeup spray light on your face.  </li>
            <li>It covered well, and felt light on my skin.</li>
            <li>see my review on the light tan photo finish to see why.</li>
            <li>So far, the system is very easy to use and the makeup goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It was very user friendly which for me is great because i can be very ditsy at times but</li>
            <li>My first time airbrushing and I am hooked!!</li>
            <li>The spray keeps on clogging although I clean it everytime</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly &amp; gives your make-up a nice professional look</li>
            <li>This kit also comes with a packet full of tips for using your system.</li>
            <li>If taking extra good care of it is all it takes then</li>
            <li>…I love it so much I have been using the kit since November  </li>
            <li>It is very loght and smooth.</li>
            <li>when it states to make sure any lotions you use are completely dry/absorbed....</li>
            <li>I actually loved the product the first day I used it, but after the first day, it stopped working properly.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural look and the finishing is lovely.</li>
            <li>airbrush machine itself was pretty good, and easy to use, but it&#x27;s just not worth the risk of wearing this stuff out of the house when so much can ruin it completely with no hope of touching it</li>
            <li>If you have never used an airbrush for makeup before, be patient, it takes time to get it right, but</li>
            <li>It rubbed right off.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a product for a photo shoot, a night out where it&#x27;s dark or someone with flawless skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, clear instructions.</li>
            <li>and it last all day and the airbrush gun is pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li>super quick and looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li>It covers up my spots after the first coat.</li>
            <li>when I returned the first airbrush gun</li>
            <li>Works perfectly , love the way this makeup looks on my skin and last all day.</li>
            <li>This is the exact make up kit</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first airbrush, I was doing a lot of research before I got this.</li>
            <li>but apparently that wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used airbrush makeup and this was easier to use</li>
            <li>it was too heavy and did not match good.</li>
            <li>This is frustrating to me, I was VERY EXCITED to receive this item, and frankly I was debating on if I wanted to spend the money on this because it ain&#x27;t cheap!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get my new gun and thank you Photo Finish for your quick response and solving my problem.</li>
            <li>To get the coverage I needed I had to use too much.</li>
            <li>This will increase the look of any creases you have in your skin (wrinkles look deeper), so you can&#x27;t really use it on your eyes.</li>
            <li>Much appreciated...</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>REALLy</li>
            <li>I really want to try Temptu through it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to really....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and the makeup stays for a long time.</li>
            <li>but my skin looks good after I use it and its less oily later in the day.</li>
            <li>Once you get it down, again, you will love</li>
            <li>Now, after just a little more than a month, not so much, I am actually very upset.</li>
            <li>The company took it back promptly &amp; refunded my money quickly.</li>
            <li>i wear it everyday and it is very friendly to my face.</li>
            <li>Not great for every day use since you do need to thoroughly clean it each time, but I use it for dates and special occasions!</li>
            <li>They assured me that the compressor was new but the old/used gun was sent on accident.   </li>
            <li>This has been my nicest make-up kit so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s water based, it&#x27;s not cakey, and it&#x27;s last whole day.</li>
            <li>I liked everything about the machine itself but wearability of the make up was poor.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Before I went to use it the second time (after the initial first use), I went to open a different color foundation than the one I used the first time.</li>
            <li>It can be used everyday as well as on special occasions.</li>
            <li>I must start out by saying airbrush make up is new to me, and I tried one of the big brand, for one day and the gun would not work, so I sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li>sending me a new gun the same day!!</li>
            <li>so I am going to give a higher review, however, as a consumer trying to warn other consumers what they should and should not have to pay for</li>
            <li>After three or four tries, I was ready to return it, thinking it was too sticky, tacky and Cakey.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is flawless and I tried tempt and hated it.</li>
            <li>ill be honest, it took me couple wks to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I decided to return the product and within 1 hours I had a reply that a refund had been issued and a pre paid label sent, bad product good company</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get my new gun and thank you Photo Finish for your quick response and solving my problem.</li>
            <li> To get the coverage I needed I had to use too much.</li>
            <li> This will increase the look of any creases you have in your skin (wrinkles look deeper), so you can&#x27;t really use it on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Much appreciated...</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> REALLy</li>
            <li> I really want to try Temptu through it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to really....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on and the makeup stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> but my skin looks good after I use it and its less oily later in the day.</li>
            <li> Once you get it down, again, you will love</li>
            <li> Now, after just a little more than a month, not so much, I am actually very upset.</li>
            <li> The company took it back promptly &amp; refunded my money quickly.</li>
            <li> i wear it everyday and it is very friendly to my face.</li>
            <li> Not great for every day use since you do need to thoroughly clean it each time, but I use it for dates and special occasions!</li>
            <li> They assured me that the compressor was new but the old/used gun was sent on accident.   </li>
            <li> This has been my nicest make-up kit so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water based, it&#x27;s not cakey, and it&#x27;s last whole day.</li>
            <li> I liked everything about the machine itself but wearability of the make up was poor.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Before I went to use it the second time (after the initial first use), I went to open a different color foundation than the one I used the first time.</li>
            <li> It can be used everyday as well as on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I must start out by saying airbrush make up is new to me, and I tried one of the big brand, for one day and the gun would not work, so I sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li> sending me a new gun the same day!!</li>
            <li> so I am going to give a higher review, however, as a consumer trying to warn other consumers what they should and should not have to pay for</li>
            <li> After three or four tries, I was ready to return it, thinking it was too sticky, tacky and Cakey.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is flawless and I tried tempt and hated it.</li>
            <li> ill be honest, it took me couple wks to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I decided to return the product and within 1 hours I had a reply that a refund had been issued and a pre paid label sent, bad product good company</li>
            <li> I have naturally blushing cheeks, and wanted to cover that, as well as dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was able to do so, but anyone who hasn&#x27;t been in the beauty industry might be a little confused.</li>
            <li> but am nervous it was REALLy clog sine temptu is thick.</li>
            <li> this stuff lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> Before I bought this I viewed other similar products but what caught my attention was the woman who did the video.  </li>
            <li> Seller replied back in less than an hour with</li>
            <li> They say &amp;#34;easy enough for beginner home use&amp;#34; not true</li>
            <li> few tips for anyone just starting....</li>
            <li> After 20 minutes of this battle, I have up, waited a few days to try it again and same thing....</li>
            <li> But I finally took it slow and with the points above, it was flawless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they said they are sending me a new gun and asked me to take down my negative review because they didn&#x27;t have a chance to resolve the problem.  </li>
            <li> A little didn&#x27;t go a long way with me.</li>
            <li> no orange colors like I have received before in other airbrush makeup.</li>
            <li> it hides every blemish that  all my other  foundations couldn’t cover!</li>
            <li> I also saw green type rust when I opened up the gun at the other end.  </li>
            <li> Again, in less than an hour I got a response</li>
            <li> She has been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too heavy</li>
            <li> Usually every age spot is showing within an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> Now, the spray seems to be uneven, it was on and off, no stable and create an ineven surface!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating, I was very excited to use this product but disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 other airbrush makeups before and was looking for less expensive -</li>
            <li> Hard to match</li>
            <li> made two attempts two separate days, ...too hard for me.  </li>
            <li> acts like the makeup is too thick to spray.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put on a thick layer.</li>
            <li> had to order a new spray gun never worked :(</li>
            <li> The mix-up, while forgivable was unfortunate and sloppy.  </li>
            <li> it looks cakes and fake.  </li>
            <li> it was difficult.  </li>
            <li> It was scary to try to figure everything out.</li>
            <li> I waited for this, so imagine my disappointment when after 10 minutes it stops spraying product.  </li>
            <li> I learned the hard way!!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has been using it everyday. She says it is the best makeup she has ever used the colors are great. Everything works as it should as is easy to use great coverage that last all day. Best of all I can not even tell she is wearing makeup but she just looks like she has a flawless face. She is happy so I an happy did good with this gift points for me.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and the foundation is easy to apply. Also because it&#x27;s made in the US, I feel safe when using it.</li>
            <li> I must start out by saying airbrush make up is new to me, and I tried one of the big brand, for one day and the gun would not work, so I sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the drawing board of finding a system that would work for me. Then I found Photo Finish, so I researched, Can’t find many videos about it and they don’t seem to have a web site. But they do have great reviews on Amazon. So I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;I love this system. I have contacted the seller many times as I have been known to be a pain. I asked about repair parts, just in case. Seller replied back in less than an hour with yes we carrier them.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order, system works great, very easy to use, but I didn’t like the way the mat finish look on me, my fault I order the mat, when I should have ordered the luminous.&lt;br /&gt;So, I contacted the seller and asked if I could order some luminous finish make up because I didn’t like the mat finish. Again, in less than an hour I got a response, Sure we will ship you a bottle for FREE, what color do you want? OMG, this seller is great, and no I don’t know them and we are not related.&lt;br /&gt;This is what we need in a system for beginners, someone who cares about the project they sell and doesn’t mine helping.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing makeup application and finish. People have asked of I&#x27;ve has something done to my face when I wear it.  I would certainly recommend the air brush to anyone that wants a flawless look.</li>
            <li> This has been my nicest make-up kit so far. I love the color combinations. It&#x27;s easy to put on the foundation and it gives a perfect finishing. It covers up my spots after the first coat. The color matches with my skin. I feel so changed and I now I love myself even more!</li>
            <li> I love my kit it’s so easy to use the makeup colors are great no orange colors like I have received before in other airbrush makeup. The foundation is not sticky covers well and I have a lot of discoloration on my face. I put this on in the morning and it last all day and the airbrush gun is pretty easy to clean. I have used luminess before and I like this much better it gives your skin a nice healthy glow covers all your flaws but looks like your skin.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, clear instructions. I watched some videos as well. My first time airbrushing and I am hooked!! Not great for every day use since you do need to thoroughly clean it each time, but I use it for dates and special occasions!</li>
            <li> This is a great set for starting out.  I have never used an airbrush before, but this is easy to learn and use.  If you have never used an airbrush for makeup before, be patient, it takes time to get it right, but once you do...you are going to love how it looks and how quick and easy it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips for anyone just starting....I learned the hard way!!!!  1) follow the instructions!  2) when it states to make sure any lotions you use are completely dry/absorbed....please do so......it will definitely make and keep the makeup tacky if you don&#x27;t. 3) lightly cover!  Practice on your hand and make sue to keep the makeup spray light on your face.  If it&#x27;s too heavy it looks cakes and fake.  Once you get it down, again, you will love how it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t give up too quickly!  After three or four tries, I was ready to return it, thinking it was too sticky, tacky and Cakey.  But I finally took it slow and with the points above, it was flawless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in my mid fifties, I was worried it would show every wrinkle, but, it actually helped hide those that I have.  And one last point.....this stuff lasts a long time!  Usually every age spot is showing within an hour or so.  I didn&#x27;t touch up all day and at bedtime, this makeup was still holding up!</li>
            <li> 1 tried 2 different airbrush guns with this system and it will not spray the product. acts like the makeup is too thick to spray. In order to get it to spray makeup it took up to 30 minutes of test spraying on a tissue and after one use neither airbrush would spray again. Very frustrating, I was very excited to use this product but disappointed with the quality. The product comes with NO instructions as all and NO customer service number either. when I returned the first airbrush gun the communication was by e-mail and the airbrush gun was sent out and I received it and a pre-paid label to return within 2 days very quick. I decided to return the product and within 1 hours I had a reply that a refund had been issued and a pre paid label sent, bad product good company</li>
            <li> Works perfectly , love the way this makeup looks on my skin and last all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tacky to touch.  Hard to match and I regret purchasing it. To get the coverage I needed I had to use too much. I needed to use a good consealer first.  I have used 2 other airbrush makeups before and was looking for less expensive - Luminess is still the best.</li>
            <li> A great kit to have when putting make-up on somebody or yourself. It goes on evenly &amp; gives your make-up a nice professional look</li>
            <li> It covered well, and felt light on my skin. A little didn&#x27;t go a long way with me. I have naturally blushing cheeks, and wanted to cover that, as well as dark circles under my eyes. This will increase the look of any creases you have in your skin (wrinkles look deeper), so you can&#x27;t really use it on your eyes. Once it&#x27;s on your skin, you can&#x27;t touch it in ANY way. No one else can, either. Forget it if you have an itch on your face, or get water or sweat anywhere. You will start to look like a zombie. And forget about touching it up, you can&#x27;t. You basically have to take it all off and start from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The airbrush machine itself was pretty good, and easy to use, but it&#x27;s just not worth the risk of wearing this stuff out of the house when so much can ruin it completely with no hope of touching it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful to you, please give it a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Like a kid waits for Christmas I waited for this, so imagine my disappointment when after 10 minutes it stops spraying product.  I should have known because after opening it I saw residue product in it.  I also saw green type rust when I opened up the gun at the other end.  I contacted the seller and they said they are sending me a new gun and asked me to take down my negative review because they didn&#x27;t have a chance to resolve the problem.  They assured me that the compressor was new but the old/used gun was sent on accident.   When it was working I loved it so I am going to give a higher review, however, as a consumer trying to warn other consumers what they should and should not have to pay for I am going to leave these pictures up.  The mix-up, while forgivable was unfortunate and sloppy.  However, they are immediately fixing the problem for me.  I will post further if need be.  Can&#x27;t wait to get my new gun and thank you Photo Finish for your quick response and solving my problem.</li>
            <li> This is the exact make up kit I was looking for. This kit has all the things that I needed. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and easy wear off. Even if you&#x27;re sweating, it won&#x27;t wear off. I also love the combinations of the colors provided. The results are a beauty. So happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Just I want somebody make an video abut how I can use all staff</li>
            <li> Just started this week with Photo Finish and I like it so far...easy to use.  Before I bought this I viewed other similar products but what caught my attention was the woman who did the video.  Much appreciated...Thanks.</li>
            <li> had to order a new spray gun never worked :(</li>
            <li> THE COLORS INCLUDED IN THIS KIT IS JUST FOR CAUCASIAN WOMEN.</li>
            <li> I actually loved the product the first day I used it, but after the first day, it stopped working properly. Before I went to use it the second time (after the initial first use), I went to open a different color foundation than the one I used the first time. I shook the bottle and went to put drops in the cup, but it wasn&#x27;t coming out. I tried using a toothpick to get the hole to open, that did not work. I ended up having to cut a top of the top off! THEN, when I went to put drops is the cup, a bunch poured out! Now, I have lost quite a bit of foundation, I THEN proceeded to use the airbrush. Well now, it&#x27;s not spraying any mist!! After 20 minutes of this battle, I have up, waited a few days to try it again and same thing....NO MIST!! This is frustrating to me, I was VERY EXCITED to receive this item, and frankly I was debating on if I wanted to spend the money on this because it ain&#x27;t cheap!! I would have definitely given this review a 5 star rating, but I have had problems with the kit since day one. Thank you.</li>
            <li> When my system arrived(extremely quickly), I was pleased to find that all components were very nicely packaged. This kit also comes with a packet full of tips for using your system. So far, the system is very easy to use and the makeup goes on very smoothly. Overall, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a Photo finish machine and I have had no problems with it. The coverage is flawless and I tried tempt and hated it. it was too heavy and did not match good. Honestly, I have had a really great experience with the product. Like anything else it took me a bit to get used to but now I love it and so does everyone I know! It was very user friendly which for me is great because i can be very ditsy at times but really…I would recommend it to anyone and I have</li>
            <li> Was a gift and well liked. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This made me a nervous wreck.  I&#x27;m nervous just thinking about my attempts. They say &amp;#34;easy enough for beginner home use&amp;#34; not true it was difficult.  If I was an artist maybe I could figure out the color blending and spraying.  I watched videos, read instructions, made two attempts two separate days, ...too hard for me.  The bag is cute and all the things you see on the ad are mailed to you. (That is why I gave it two stars: very very cool looking.)  I&#x27;m in the process of returning it, I&#x27;ll keep you posted on if they will let me return this equipment.</li>
            <li> I was very happy a month ago, a week after I received my kit. It was working great for me. Flawless spray and awesome result. Now, after just a little more than a month, not so much, I am actually very upset. The spray keeps on clogging although I clean it everytime I use it, and I take a very good care of it. Now, the spray seems to be uneven, it was on and off, no stable and create an ineven surface! Please advise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first airbrush, I was doing a lot of research before I got this. This is really good airbrush. The pressure of the air is controllable and the most amazing thing is their product. It&#x27;s water based, it&#x27;s not cakey, and it&#x27;s last whole day. It is very loght and smooth. Love it!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t come with directions on what any of the things are. comes with maintenance and tips/trics packet, but it needs a guide that shows you what everything is. It was scary to try to figure everything out. I was able to do so, but anyone who hasn&#x27;t been in the beauty industry might be a little confused. Also, the brush clogs VERY easily. I thought I cleaned it out REALLy well but apparently that wasn&#x27;t good enough. I ran a degreaser through it because I used it once and it seemed like it was shot. Anyway, I don&#x27;t hate it and it&#x27;s great for the price. I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be the best, but Im on a budget. If taking extra good care of it is all it takes then I guess I just have to do that. (Im fine with that). The makeup isn&#x27;t the best. see my review on the light tan photo finish to see why. Just don&#x27;t put on a thick layer. makeup isn&#x27;t good for contouring or concealing so you will have to conceal before you apply. I bough Glam air to go with this. Glam air is better and runs through this machine just fine. I really want to try Temptu through it but am nervous it was REALLy clog sine temptu is thick.</li>
            <li> ill be honest, it took me couple wks to get the hang of it. but, once i figured it out, i absolutely LOVE the product!!!!!!! i wear it everyday and it is very friendly to my face. love this product.....</li>
            <li> I bought my kit about two months ago. I had never used airbrush before...but the reviews were great on this one. I was still getting used to using it when my gun broke. I went back to using regular makeup and started breaking out again. I decided to contact the seller and ask if they could replace it even though it had been a while. They told me how to try to fix it...but that didn&#x27;t work. So...no more questions asked...they&#x27;re sending me a new gun the same day!! The makeup is good! I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to really....but my skin looks good after I use it and its less oily later in the day. I can throw some on before running out to the store...super quick and looks pretty natural. One suggestion...if you use a sunscreen/moisturizer...make sure you give it time to soak in before applying the makeup. I actually blot my face before applying the makeup so it doesn&#x27;t separate or cake after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> I liked everything about the machine itself but wearability of the make up was poor. It rubbed right off. It also sunk into my pores &amp; tiny lines. This is definitely a product for a photo shoot, a night out where it&#x27;s dark or someone with flawless skin. The company took it back promptly &amp; refunded my money quickly.</li>
            <li> Skin has never looked beter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this kit in November …I love it so much I have been using the kit since November  and my skin always looks good it hides every blemish that  all my other  foundations couldn’t cover! I am so in love and so ready for the weekend to go out and show my face off again lol!!!! Skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used airbrush makeup and this was easier to use then I thought it would be. It came with very good instructions which made it easy to use this for my first time. The makeup looks amazing on my skin and it was easy to match my color love this!!!</li>
            <li> I got these for my girlfriend on her birthday. She was requesting this make up kit. I&#x27;ve told her several times she doesn&#x27;t need makeup. But i made her happy by getting it. Its easy for her to apply when we go on dates and whenever she needs to &amp;#34;fix up&amp;#34; her makeup.</li>
            <li> My mother bought it for me. I find it an irreplaceable makeup kit. It&#x27;s easy to put on and the makeup stays for a long time. It has no side-effects instead it minimizes skin imperfections. It gives a natural look and the finishing is lovely. It&#x27;s also water resistant and smudge proof. It can be used everyday as well as on special occasions. So happy with it, recommended!</li>
            <li> Make up is ok. I have used airbrush make up before this stuff is just OK.</li>
