            <li>Great product that I have been using for over a year now.  </li>
            <li>Either the makeup consultants tell me that nothing will look better on me, or I try something else on just to realize how perfect the Caramel Anastasia Tinted Brow Gel is for me.</li>
            <li>This brow gel is so easy to apply and matched my hair color perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product is great when you have the correct color...</li>

            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>so I know about everything and have tried most of them</li>
            <li>My favorite brow tint ever.</li>
            <li>Love this line because they have so many variations.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It seems like for that purpose an eye brow pencil or powder might work better.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this brow gel for so many years.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brow remedy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day which I love.</li>
            <li>It stays on okay, but it is not water proof or sweat proof and will wear off eventually throughout the day</li>
            <li>Love this product but it drys out after about 2-3 weeks and there is a lot of product still in the tube.</li>
            <li>I have used this brow gel for some years now and l just love it.  </li>
            <li>The color is great and natural looking.  </li>
            <li>After trying other brands and types of brow tints, I like this brand of brow gel the best.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily when I was my face.</li>
            <li>I just pull it out and sweep, and if there is any imperfection, I just smooth it/pick it up with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>My lashes and skin tone are light and this color seems to work for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when you have grey in your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Most of my eye brows are white, and this gel colors them so nicely</li>
            <li>so basically i&#x27;m a happy camper and would highly recommend, especially if you&#x27;re an in-between redhead.</li>
            <li>This product fills in brows nicely, and color coats not only the eyebrow hairs, but shades the skin underneath for a full looking brow.  </li>
            <li>so they pop and better accent my eyes, but the shade is still very natural and gives them color without giving me a made up look.  </li>
            <li>and it all looks very natural, so I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for every day where, even when I have minimal makeup on overall.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the old blond option.</li>
            <li>so it was fun to try a color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and easy to use - especially with those who have blonde eye brows to make them look natural but visible</li>
            <li>Most companys just have blonde, brunette, redhead.</li>
            <li>Eyebrows really make a difference!</li>
            <li>It REALLY makes my eyes POP!  </li>
            <li>First of all, this gel has some sort of a shimmer in it.</li>
            <li>i have the traditionally sparse, fine brows of a fair maiden and tend to look washed out if i don&#x27;t do something about it, but can easily verge on looking ridiculous if i do too much about it.</li>
            <li>i still need to fill some spots with a pencil or powder, then apply the gel to give me added oomph without taking things over the top (as long as i&#x27;m applying sparingly).</li>
            <li>It is a bit wet going on first, but I love the result.</li>
            <li>which is surprising since I have ash undertones (grey that mixes in with my blonde).</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t look really look like it does on the Amazon&#x27;s page.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for at lease 5 years and have received many compliments on my eyebrows (which is not something I ever expected).  </li>
            <li>I really like this brow gel.</li>
            <li>the Jane Iredale Auburn color Brow Gel, which is more of a light auburn or dark strawberry blond color (and definitely has more red tones than this caramel) as it seems to work just as well and look natural with my age and coloring.</li>
            <li>More reasonable price than other sites.</li>
            <li>--I find the opposite to be true.  </li>
            <li>I am very blonde and unfortunately listened to the advice in the reviews saying the Carmel was the best color for blondes...</li>
            <li>With careful application, you have darker more natural looking brows.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find great make-up for redheads.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake and the color is very natural.</li>
            <li>and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>and I think it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about when they say it&#x27;s easy to mess up</li>
            <li>because the caramel is subtle--it does exactly what I need it to do, but just, and I feel darker hair will want the next darker shade of the brow color.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, though I am not sure it would would as well if you have sparse brow hair and want a fuller look.  </li>
            <li>The color is a definitely a Caramel, but it does have a metallic sheen to it, which concerned me at first, but which does not seem to be a problem once the gel is applied.</li>
            <li>I really like this product as it gives my thinning brows control and just enough color to match my graying brunette hair !  </li>
            <li>Gives my sparse brows a thicker, natural look.</li>
            <li>This is a new color since the last time I purchased an Anastasia product.</li>
            <li>Has red color in it, because of being old old.</li>
            <li>I have natural red hair and my eyebrows are blond.  </li>
            <li>or I can press a little harder with the wand and lightly color the skin along my brow bone beneath the brow hairs to thicken my thinning brows</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the level of fill and darkening I need, with very little room for error.  </li>

            <li> While the product goes on easily, and is not the least bit messy the color just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Second, it didn&#x27;t go on my eyebrows that well leaving some dry pieces of the gel here and there.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to hide my grey eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Although I have them dyed when I have my hair colored, my brows turn grey even before my hair.</li>
            <li> The difference is subtle but very noticeable, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark blonde and use caramel...</li>
            <li> I have eyebrows that are thick and well defined, but so blonde they barely register on my face.  </li>
            <li> I think I have a little bit of red in my hair which works with this color.</li>
            <li> a little goes a looooooong long long way.</li>
            <li> chose Caramel because I&#x27;m a dirty blonde, and it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li> It works well for me and my skin and hair tones -- I am a graying red head with pale skin and some freckles.</li>
            <li> This seems to thicken up and tame the ones I have left.</li>
            <li> I like a natural look and this completely covers the grey in my eye brows without looking heavy or fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several years and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts quite a long time for a small tube.</li>
            <li> A little dark for me, but hard to find the blonde.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little darker than it looks on the computer.  </li>
            <li> (i know, it&#x27;s complicated) with slight pink undertones in my complexion, and the caramel color suits me perfectly (same goes for the pencil and powder duo).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
            <li> This brow gel is defective, old, dry, impossible to be used.</li>
            <li> I have very black eyebrows, I use the shade Caramel to lighten them up a notch.</li>
            <li> i usually scrape the brush down thoroughly as i&#x27;m pulling it out of the tube and apply delicately thereafter.</li>
            <li> This brow tint covers the white hairs in my eyebrows without looking fake.  </li>
            <li> so I do sometimes reapply in the afternoon if it&#x27;s been a tough</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this color if your in the auburn shades.</li>
            <li> So I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate using pencil on my eyebrows.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product as it gives my thinning brows control and just enough color to match my graying brunette hair !  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to hide my grey eyebrows.  The color is great and natural looking.  The price is awesome!  More reasonable price than other sites.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It&#x27;s exactly the level of fill and darkening I need, with very little room for error.  I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about when they say it&#x27;s easy to mess up--I find the opposite to be true.  I just pull it out and sweep, and if there is any imperfection, I just smooth it/pick it up with my fingers.  Never had an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Caramel because I&#x27;m a dirty blonde, and it&#x27;s just right.  I do think those with darker hair should select a darker hue, because the caramel is subtle--it does exactly what I need it to do, but just, and I feel darker hair will want the next darker shade of the brow color.  It tames the brows as well as filling, so this does all the things and I recommend it as a great multi-tasker.  I have a skincare company so I know about everything and have tried most of them--this is a great product.</li>
            <li> My favorite brow tint ever. Love this line because they have so many variations. Most companys just have blonde, brunette, redhead. I&#x27;m a dark blonde and use caramel...which is surprising since I have ash undertones (grey that mixes in with my blonde). I like a natural look and this completely covers the grey in my eye brows without looking heavy or fake.</li>
            <li> The Anastasia Tinted Brow Gel in Caramel is perfect for me.  I have natural red hair and my eyebrows are blond.  This brow gel is so easy to apply and matched my hair color perfectly.  The color doesn&#x27;t look really look like it does on the Amazon&#x27;s page.  I think it&#x27;s a little darker than it looks on the computer.  I have been using this for at lease 5 years and have received many compliments on my eyebrows (which is not something I ever expected).  A couple of times I have thought about trying something else and go to a makeup department.  The same thing happens each time.  Either the makeup consultants tell me that nothing will look better on me, or I try something else on just to realize how perfect the Caramel Anastasia Tinted Brow Gel is for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is great when you have the correct color... I am very blonde and unfortunately listened to the advice in the reviews saying the Carmel was the best color for blondes... I should have ordered the blonde! While the product goes on easily, and is not the least bit messy the color just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow gel I have found. It doesn&#x27;t flake and the color is very natural.</li>
            <li> Best brow get that I have found. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my third or fourth Anatasia Tinted Brown Gel Caramel tube I have used.  I love it.  Gives my sparse brows a thicker, natural look.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Goes on without clumping or stickiness.  Blends perfectly and the color looks natural.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this color if your in the auburn shades.</li>
            <li> I was given one for a gift.  When it ran out, I ordered it in carmel.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> need an auburn one...</li>
            <li> I have eyebrows that are thick and well defined, but so blonde they barely register on my face.  This brow gel in Caramel is the perfect solution.  It tints my eyebrow hairs so they pop and better accent my eyes, but the shade is still very natural and gives them color without giving me a made up look.  It is perfect for every day where, even when I have minimal makeup on overall.  I absolutely love it, though I am not sure it would would as well if you have sparse brow hair and want a fuller look.  It seems like for that purpose an eye brow pencil or powder might work better.</li>
            <li> I use this to groom and fill my eyebrows.  I like the product, I still use brow powder with it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this brow gel for so many years. Most of my eye brows are white, and this gel colors them so nicely and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Great product.  A little dark for me, but hard to find the blonde.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and easy to use - especially with those who have blonde eye brows to make them look natural but visible</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;matured&amp;#34; (ahem) my brows have become sparse. This seems to thicken up and tame the ones I have left.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, and it is always perfect. It not only tints your eye brows. it also tames them. Will order forever.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brow remedy and I&#x27;ve tried a few. My lashes and skin tone are light and this color seems to work for me. I think I have a little bit of red in my hair which works with this color. It goes on nicely and I think it looks very natural. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product. Eyebrows really make a difference!</li>
            <li> I never knew I needed this until I used this. The difference is subtle but very noticeable, if that makes sense. I have very black eyebrows, I use the shade Caramel to lighten them up a notch.</li>
            <li> Great gel.  Brows look natural and the range of colors is perfect!</li>
            <li> It is a bit wet going on first, but I love the result. It lasts all day which I love.</li>
            <li> I really like this brow gel. It works well for me and my skin and hair tones -- I am a graying red head with pale skin and some freckles. The color is a definitely a Caramel, but it does have a metallic sheen to it, which concerned me at first, but which does not seem to be a problem once the gel is applied. Although it is called caramel, it is a \\&quot;gingery\\&quot; color so it works great for this aging \\&quot;ginger haired\\&quot; baby-boomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found I can use the wand to color just my brow hairs (which are turning gray) or I can press a little harder with the wand and lightly color the skin along my brow bone beneath the brow hairs to thicken my thinning brows and it all looks very natural, so I am pleased with the product. It stays on okay, but it is not water proof or sweat proof and will wear off eventually throughout the day so I do sometimes reapply in the afternoon if it&#x27;s been a tough day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the Jane Iredale Auburn color Brow Gel, which is more of a light auburn or dark strawberry blond color (and definitely has more red tones than this caramel) as it seems to work just as well and look natural with my age and coloring.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead who is gradually graying.  This brow tint covers the white hairs in my eyebrows without looking fake.  Also keeps brow hairs in place.  Washes out easily when I was my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several years and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.  now I&#x27;ll just buy from Amazon.  Beautiful colors, easy to use.</li>
            <li> this has been a life saver for my brows/face! i have dirty-blondish reddish-copperyish hair (i know, it&#x27;s complicated) with slight pink undertones in my complexion, and the caramel color suits me perfectly (same goes for the pencil and powder duo). i have the traditionally sparse, fine brows of a fair maiden and tend to look washed out if i don&#x27;t do something about it, but can easily verge on looking ridiculous if i do too much about it. this brow gel has been the perfect solution. a little goes a looooooong long long way. i usually scrape the brush down thoroughly as i&#x27;m pulling it out of the tube and apply delicately thereafter. this product will add volume and pizzaz, but it won&#x27;t fill in. i still need to fill some spots with a pencil or powder, then apply the gel to give me added oomph without taking things over the top (as long as i&#x27;m applying sparingly). it also keeps my browse in place like gorilla glue. so basically i&#x27;m a happy camper and would highly recommend, especially if you&#x27;re an in-between redhead.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have purchased this brow gel. After trying other brands and types of brow tints, I like this brand of brow gel the best. It&#x27;s great when you have grey in your eyebrows. Although I have them dyed when I have my hair colored, my brows turn grey even before my hair. This is great  between trips to the salon. It also lasts quite a long time for a small tube.</li>
            <li> Love this product but it drys out after about 2-3 weeks and there is a lot of product still in the tube. I have to add some oil or water.</li>
            <li> Great product that I have been using for over a year now.  With careful application, you have darker more natural looking brows.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This brow gel is defective, old, dry, impossible to be used. Has red color in it, because of being old old. Shame!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have used this brow gel for some years now and l just love it.  Applicator is terrific at separating brows.</li>
            <li> This is a new color since the last time I purchased an Anastasia product. I like it better than the old blond option. Works well - brows are neat and stay in place.</li>
            <li> I hate using pencil on my eyebrows. You can always tell  it&#x27;s pencil, because it sticks to the skin, and not the hair itself.  This product fills in brows nicely, and color coats not only the eyebrow hairs, but shades the skin underneath for a full looking brow.  It REALLY makes my eyes POP!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I saw a demo on YouTube that raved about this product. It&#x27;s difficult to find great make-up for redheads. This gel surpassed all expectations. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have strawberry blond hair, so I got this item in caramel color. First of all, this gel has some sort of a shimmer in it. I understand some people might like it, but it wasn&#x27;t a part of the description. I wouldn&#x27;t want my eyebrows all shimmery when I&#x27;m working or going to school. Second, it didn&#x27;t go on my eyebrows that well leaving some dry pieces of the gel here and there. So I was disappointed. Will keep looking.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter and gave it a whirl myself.  I usually buy the clear so it was fun to try a color</li>
            <li> I have blond eyebrows. This product allows me to have visible eyebrows without having to draw on somewhat fake-looking eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil.</li>
