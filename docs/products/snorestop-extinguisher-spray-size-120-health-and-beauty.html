    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Your best bet is to go out and buy a mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work the best... not this water spray.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product my husband has used.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work great.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job to reduce it.</li>
            <li>As most of us have tried a lot of promised products that don&#x27;t work, the SnoreStop is awesome.  </li>
            <li>- seems to work for us, which is good.</li>
            <li>and she flips to the side and all is good...</li>
            <li>But right now I&#x27;m very happy with its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more can you say -- it works!</li>
            <li>My wife is thrilled.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine told me about this product and it has helped me sleep better, because my husband&#x27;s snoring is more like purring now!</li>
            <li>Very important to both her and me.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the many products I have tried to see if my snoring could be reduced.</li>
            <li>It works best when I am on my side, and not so well when I am on my back.</li>
            <li>Shake the the snorestop when it arrives, to make sure the stuff is in the extinguisher.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve known better.  </li>
            <li>Size 120 of this product lasts for a month at most.  </li>
            <li>I was hopeful that this would do more to stop my snoring.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products for snoring.  </li>
            <li>It will get better if you use this product.</li>
            <li>and I have started to get better sleep.</li>
            <li>, I sleep a lot better at night because I am not being awaken by my husband to turn over.</li>
            <li>I am impressed enough with Snorestop Extinguisher to write a review about it.</li>
            <li>That seems to be my magic formula.</li>
            <li>Worth a try for your own situation.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>She can get to sleep fine when I take it</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with BreatheRight Advanced strips to keep my nasal passages open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was in a sound sleep...</li>
            <li>Snorestop really does work!!!  </li>
            <li>I was so glad I found it on Amazon, and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>is my update on this product (original review in May,</li>
            <li>I still snore some, but its much quieter and more manageable.</li>
            <li>this this, I can sleep in the same bed and we can both get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>I sleep better and much quieter after using it.</li>
            <li>1 shot in the mouth for a full nights sleep.</li>
            <li>Helps some but does not cure even mild snoring for us.</li>
            <li>In fairness, I achieve the truly stellar lows (1!)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s worth 5 stars in my book.</li>
            <li>and I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s only olive oil and cloves or something that makes it taste nice.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Anyway, It was still worth trying.</li>
            <li>It was certainly worth trying.</li>
            <li>It was rare for me to wake up feeling rested.  </li>
            <li>but over all worth the money.</li>
            <li>I not only sleep more comfortable but so does my wife</li>
            <li>It is pretty clear that this is nothing more than a placebo.  </li>
            <li>Not a complete stopping of snoring, but a nice decrease in volume.</li>
            <li>In that event, I gently nudge him and he gives his throat a quick squirt of the Snorestop, and we both are able to quickly get back to sleep!  </li>
            <li>, I was willing to try it.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought she was cured because the snoring appeared to stop.  </li>
            <li>The first night, no snore.  </li>
            <li>The first night or two it seemed to work but not since.</li>
            <li>I followed the insert instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>but that didn&#x27;t happen after the first spray.  </li>
            <li>OMG it really works!</li>
            <li>No bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;Product does help but it does not always completely eliminate the snoring.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy, just a spray at the back of your throat and under the tongue at bedtime.  </li>
            <li>nasal spray didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t do much for my snoring.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pills helped with the snoring some, but not as much as the throat spray 6/10</li>
            <li>throat spray is what really worked for me, 9/10.</li>
            <li>Now if only it was available through Prime.</li>
            <li>but I am very thankful for it.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really care for this item.</li>
            <li>It has really help reduce his snoring.</li>
            <li>And when he does snore it is much quieter.</li>
            <li>This has helped me so much.</li>
            <li>The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work very well and by the time you manage to get a spray or two in your throat and one or two under your tongue, you&#x27;ve used up a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>This product REALLY works ...</li>
            <li>Also had a very drying effect on my throat.</li>
            <li>My husband says It really works</li>
            <li>this product does not work for any kind of snoring it only work if your snoring is within your throat only</li>
            <li>seems like some nights it works better than other nights...</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I will not purchase this again, but I will tell you that the pills have worked miracles and there are many sweet dreams in our house now!!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend said I snored significantly less, and when I did, it was very light.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hth, high</li>
            <li>My better half hasn&#x27;t kicked me once since using!</li>
            <li>This stops the snoring COMPLETELY!  </li>
            <li>Have since gotten the mouth insert and that DOES work and I&#x27;m finally getting a peaceful nights sleep.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that has worked consistently and well for me.</li>
            <li>Holds the freight train snoring down to about a commuter train level, but the tracks are still going right through my bedroom!  </li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with a lung herbal that keeps my lungs and bronchi clear</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and would otherwise be wearing a mouth guard or CPAP.  </li>
            <li>The whole mouth open, gigglesnort thing that wakes you up at night.  </li>
            <li>Mechanism of action just may not be for us.</li>
            <li>Actually the spray has done absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>Only extinguisher really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and my husband assures me that it works very well.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work the first couple nights as long as he wasn&#x27;t on his back.</li>
            <li>Potential regular users should have access to a much cheaper payment alternative.</li>
            <li>It does work, but a bit pricey for about a week and a half&#x27;s worth of no snoring.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this product actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li>Call the nurses hotline for any questions as I am not a medical professional</li>
            <li>The product does not work as advertise, it does not stop the snoring completely only decreased the snoring loudness, but is is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend was getting really upset with my snoring, and this brought me down to a level where she can sleep again.  </li>
            <li>I seriously doubt there are 120 full sprays in it.  </li>
            <li>I use an app called SnoreLab on my iPhone and my scores have dropped from the 60s down to the single digits, which is basically not snoring at all, after using this product consistently.  </li>

            <li> I seriously doubt there are 120 full sprays in it.  </li>
            <li> I use an app called SnoreLab on my iPhone and my scores have dropped from the 60s down to the single digits, which is basically not snoring at all, after using this product consistently.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible to get up in the middle of the night for some water or to use the bathroom &amp; you can&#x27;t get back to sleep because the other person in bed is sawing logs (LOL)!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, but it was so easy to use</li>
            <li> Some may find this strange, but my wife has a pretty serious snore - not me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete waste of money and should be sold at the dollar star as a novelty gift.</li>
            <li> Snoring isn&#x27;t just annoying to others - it means you&#x27;re not getting good sleep.</li>
            <li> Opted for surgery as this purchase and a few others from Amazon were my last stop prior to uvula removal.</li>
            <li> So snoring happens and apparently it is not fun to sleep next to me.</li>
            <li> I purchased the snorestop extinguisher spray because I snore a little at night and my husband is an extremely light sleeper, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding it a second time though</li>
            <li> It may have helped somewhat but did not really reduce snoring.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small area in the back of the throat that can get dry at night, and this product moistures the spot.  </li>
            <li> He uses a couple of sprays to the back of the throat just before bed and that usually stops his snoring all night.  </li>
            <li> If he&#x27;s consumed salty chips or other foods before bed, then he might wake me up with snoring (Salt dries the throat.).  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the spray actually works or not.  </li>
            <li> This product worked for me as advertised I would recommend it, I have used other sprays that also work well.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does not taste bad or have an after taste.</li>
            <li> but alas it is typically only an intermission as  she eventually rolls on her back again to start the symphony all over again.  </li>
            <li> So when I saw this and all the positive reviews I was skeptical but hopeful.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product in the drug store before but it is less expensive on amazon...when I used it the first time it worked</li>
            <li> However, when my husband tried to use the pump the liquid would run out of the pump and down the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Seems odd, but this size does do the job.</li>
            <li> That is too expensive for a homeopathic, non prescription, remedy that simply sprays a few drops of a soothing liquid to the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It might do a little, but there is not a noticeable effect on me.  </li>
            <li> does your spouse/partner snore a little or a lot?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this stuff, but since it had gotten to the point where my snoring was keeping my girlfriend up at night and I had to sleep in a separate room, I was willing to try it. I ordered the starter kit from the company&#x27;s website, which comes with smaller packages of all 3 of their products: the nasal spray, throat spray, and tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nasal spray didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t do much for my snoring. She rates it a 4/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills helped with the snoring some, but not as much as the throat spray 6/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The throat spray is what really worked for me, 9/10. I still snore some, but its much quieter and more manageable. She can get to sleep fine when I take it and it&#x27;ll keep my snoring in check all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the effectiveness for each product will depend on what is causing your snoring. For me its the air passage in my throat not staying open enough to allow sufficient airflow. I use it in conjunction with BreatheRight Advanced strips to keep my nasal passages open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this this, I can sleep in the same bed and we can both get a good night&#x27;s sleep. That&#x27;s worth 5 stars in my book. Now if only it was available through Prime.</li>
            <li> I  have used this multiple times over several different time periods in my life.  It has always worked for me and I require only 2 sprays to the back of my throat.  I love it.  I am 60 years old and would otherwise be wearing a mouth guard or CPAP.  I use it in conjunction with a lung herbal that keeps my lungs and bronchi clear so maybe that is why I only require the 2 sprays -I don&#x27;t know but I am very thankful for it.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really care for this item. it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I still woke up my husband.</li>
            <li> Bought this project for my husband. It has really help reduce his snoring. And when he does snore it is much quieter.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all, I used it for 10 days, too see result. I think it is just an another product to get your money.</li>
            <li> It was received as stated, in the time stated.  I like the product - seems to work for us, which is good.</li>
            <li> Altho my husband had to re-spray during the night, it generally kept him from snoring and he&#x27;s a bad snorer.  I have had trouble finding it a second time though so hope they are not taking it off the market.</li>
            <li> This is one of the many products I have tried to see if my snoring could be reduced. Bought the app to monitor my snoring during the night before and after using this product too and the result was the same. It is useless.</li>
            <li> Some may find this strange, but my wife has a pretty serious snore - not me.  The whole mouth open, gigglesnort thing that wakes you up at night.  Usually, I give her an elbow and she flips to the side and all is good... but alas it is typically only an intermission as  she eventually rolls on her back again to start the symphony all over again.  We bought her a mouth guard and that sort of helped, but not always.  So when I saw this and all the positive reviews I was skeptical but hopeful.  We have tried it several times.  At first, I thought she was cured because the snoring appeared to stop.  However, it did not last.  The first night, no snore.  The next 5 nights - SNORE!  It is pretty clear that this is nothing more than a placebo.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Your best bet is to go out and buy a mouth guard.  It seems to work the best... not this water spray.  Sorry for the bad news.</li>
            <li> Helps some but does not cure even mild snoring for us. Worth a try for your own situation. Mechanism of action just may not be for us.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, but it was so easy to use and I figured it was worth a try.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  My wife said she couldn&#x27;t tell any difference when I used it.</li>
            <li> My wife says it works well. It is easy to use and does not taste bad or have an after taste.</li>
            <li> This has helped me so much. I sleep better and much quieter after using it. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best product my husband has used.  It eliminates his nighttime snoring for about 7 hours and lets me sleep.  Now...how do I get him to stop pushing me in the middle of the night?</li>
            <li> I have used this at the request of my wife, for a couple years. She says it helps. It works best when I am on my side, and not so well when I am on my back. She wakes me up to remind me if I forget to use it. She has never woken me up to use it when I have already used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hth, high</li>
            <li> Snorestop really does work!!!  My husband has tried almost every product to stop snoring at night.  He uses a couple of sprays to the back of the throat just before bed and that usually stops his snoring all night.  If he&#x27;s consumed salty chips or other foods before bed, then he might wake me up with snoring (Salt dries the throat.).  In that event, I gently nudge him and he gives his throat a quick squirt of the Snorestop, and we both are able to quickly get back to sleep!  There&#x27;s a small area in the back of the throat that can get dry at night, and this product moistures the spot.  I believe it&#x27;s only olive oil and cloves or something that makes it taste nice.  He&#x27;s been using this nightly for a few years now and hasn&#x27;t had any problems with the squirt dispenser.</li>
            <li> Tried this stuff, and it did not work.  I feel like it was a waste of money.  Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to work... but it does! My girlfriend said I snored significantly less, and when I did, it was very light. Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the spray actually works or not.  I used it some nights and had my iphone app track my sleep.  It seems to have minimalized my snoring.  But...  On another occasion my bed partner said it wasn&#x27;t working....</li>
            <li> After years of listening to my husband snore like a bear every night we finally found a solution.  Believe me, we had tried EVERYTHING.  This stops the snoring COMPLETELY!  (Here is a tip though, you can buy it at Walmart for around $10.)</li>
            <li> Tried it. Doesn&#x27;t work. Opted for surgery as this purchase and a few others from Amazon were my last stop prior to uvula removal.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for us.  Have since gotten the mouth insert and that DOES work and I&#x27;m finally getting a peaceful nights sleep.</li>
            <li> I did not expect Snorestop to work, but my wife says that it definitely helps with snoring! What more can you say -- it works!</li>
            <li> My wife should be writing this review. She loves it because it does stop my snoring.&lt;br /&gt;just like it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. The taste is bearable but the effects do not last. The first night or two it seemed to work but not since. I figured i&#x27;d give it another week but it still does not work.</li>
            <li> This works for me.  2 sprays and it&#x27;s quiet the entire night.  I wish they made a larger spray extinguisher but it just means you need to purchase a few.  Shake the the snorestop when it arrives, to make sure the stuff is in the extinguisher.</li>
            <li> Says under $5 an oz in (  ) after the $19 + price it actually costs for .4 ounces!!!  It has been working for me, but way too pricey.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, this product did not provide any relief from snoring.  I should&#x27;ve known better.  I would say it&#x27;s a waste of money, at least for my situation.</li>
            <li> I saw this product and figured why not give it a try. Needless to say you get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not a complete stopping of snoring, but a nice decrease in volume. My husband can get his sleep now! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend snores all the time. Seemed to work the first couple nights as long as he wasn&#x27;t on his back. Later nights, I commented on it, he said he stopped taking it. Perhaps it has lasting effects? I have no need to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Snorestop is an expensive placebo. It made me feel as though I was doing something to fix my snoring problem. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work. According to my husband, I still snore like a freight train!</li>
            <li> The product does not work as advertise, it does not stop the snoring completely only decreased the snoring loudness, but is is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great. My better half hasn&#x27;t kicked me once since using! Not big into homeopathic stuff but a must buy.</li>
            <li> Size 120 of this product lasts for a month at most.  This translates to a cost of about $180 a year.  That is too expensive for a homeopathic, non prescription, remedy that simply sprays a few drops of a soothing liquid to the back of your mouth. Potential regular users should have access to a much cheaper payment alternative.</li>
            <li> The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work very well and by the time you manage to get a spray or two in your throat and one or two under your tongue, you&#x27;ve used up a lot of it.  I seriously doubt there are 120 full sprays in it.  It does work, but a bit pricey for about a week and a half&#x27;s worth of no snoring.</li>
            <li> Tried this for a week and it didn&#x27;t work at all. Too bad. I&#x27;ve tried every on-line remedy. Finally went to the doctor. You should too. Snoring isn&#x27;t just annoying to others - it means you&#x27;re not getting good sleep. So don&#x27;t buy some spray on Amazon, deal with it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product and a few others, does not even slow my husband down.  The dogs have left the room.&lt;br /&gt;I am still in search of a product that will help, besides sleeping pills for me.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely useless. I followed the insert instructions exactly. I would not buy it again. Save your money.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived everything was still together, undamaged.  However, when my husband tried to use the pump the liquid would run out of the pump and down the bottle.  After releasing about 1/2 of the liquid the pump worked.  I think it is awful that you have to release so much of the product to get the pump to work.  Needless to say, I will not purchase this again, but I will tell you that the pills have worked miracles and there are many sweet dreams in our house now!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the snorestop extinguisher spray because I snore a little at night and my husband is an extremely light sleeper, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work. I even tried to use above the recommended dose along with the Snore Stop nasal spray, but that didnt work either.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was getting really upset with my snoring, and this brought me down to a level where she can sleep again.  Very important to both her and me.</li>
            <li> This product worked for me as advertised I would recommend it, I have used other sprays that also work well.</li>
            <li> It would be a dream to simply spray a solution into my throat and instantly stop blowing my wife&#x27;s ear drums out with my obnoxious animal roar of a snore but that didn&#x27;t happen after the first spray.  Actually the spray has done absolutely nothing.  It&#x27;s a complete waste of money and should be sold at the dollar star as a novelty gift.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried different sizes of the same product with zero results. Seems odd, but this size does do the job.</li>
            <li> I know its working because my husband doesn&#x27;t wake me up in the middle of the night  to turn over anymore</li>
            <li> Holds the freight train snoring down to about a commuter train level, but the tracks are still going right through my bedroom!  Anyway, It was still worth trying.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this product actually does what it claims. I have only used it when I need it, not on a regular basis, when I wake and keep myself up. It works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Thank god for this product. My husbands snoring has been keeping me up for years. We&#x27;ve tried a lot and this actually works.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  No bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;Product does help but it does not always completely eliminate the snoring.&lt;br /&gt;It will definitely reduce the amount and severity of the snores.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to believe the rave reviews.  This stuff works where other remedies have failed.  My wife is thrilled.</li>
            <li> not sure this product actually works but for the sake of my significant other, I decided to give it a try...have received mixed results</li>
            <li> I get a scratch throat when I work in the yard -and causes my throat to swell and have difficulty breathing at night as a result. This product does a great job to reduce it.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that this would do more to stop my snoring.  It might do a little, but there is not a noticeable effect on me.  Some people have different causes for snoring, so it might help others.  It was certainly worth trying.</li>
            <li> I have had a snoring problem for years.  As most of us have tried a lot of promised products that don&#x27;t work, the SnoreStop is awesome.  My sister recommended it as she noticed she wasn&#x27;t waking up tired every morning.  It was rare for me to wake up feeling rested.  The SnoreStop has made such a difference.  We use the SnoreStop Extinguisher spray.  It&#x27;s so easy, just a spray at the back of your throat and under the tongue at bedtime.  This is the answer to stop snoring.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for snoring.  I was hoping that it would work. Unfortunately, this spray did not help at all. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product REALLY works ... does your spouse/partner snore a little or a lot? It will get better if you use this product. It&#x27;s terrible to get up in the middle of the night for some water or to use the bathroom &amp; you can&#x27;t get back to sleep because the other person in bed is sawing logs (LOL)! A++++++++ recommendation!!!</li>
            <li> this does NOT WORK !!!! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! My husband threw it in the trash it did NOT WORK AT ALL FOR HIM!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work that well for me.  It may have helped somewhat but did not really reduce snoring.  Also had a very drying effect on my throat.</li>
            <li> Yeah yeah I have sinus problems, allergies, and all that stuff. So snoring happens and apparently it is not fun to sleep next to me. So I saw this product and I thought, oh what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it. OMG it really works! Just one spray to the back of my throat, and I&#x27;m quiet all night. I tried nose spray from the same company and it didn&#x27;t do s***. Only extinguisher really worked for me.</li>
            <li> this product does not work for any kind of snoring it only work if your snoring is within your throat only</li>
            <li> I was not sure if it was bs...but it worked!  It lasts about 6 hours so I do use it again during the night.  My honey can finally get some sleep.  Tastes fine...just weird and slippery.</li>
            <li> I bought this after searching and reading up on what can I do to eliminate my snoring problem. My wife tells me that it does not make any difference what so ever for my snoring problem. I guess I will keep searching.</li>
            <li> This snore stop does help quite a lot.  My husband uses it every night and I have started to get better sleep. Thank you to the people that made this product.</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me but that doesnt mean  it might not work for you. Will try the pills, maybe those will work.</li>
            <li> Bought this product in the drug store before but it is less expensive on amazon...when I used it the first time it worked so well my girlfriend woke me up because she thought I was awake and I was in a sound sleep...seems like some nights it works better than other nights...but over all worth the money.</li>
            <li> My husband says It really works, I sleep a lot better at night because I am not being awaken by my husband to turn over.</li>
            <li> Snore Stop has become difficult to find in stores.  I was so glad I found it on Amazon, and the price was very reasonable.  I have used this product for several years and my husband assures me that it works very well.</li>
            <li> I am impressed enough with Snorestop Extinguisher to write a review about it. I&#x27;ve purchased an array of products to combat my snoring (and spare my poor spouse yet another night in the guest room). This is the only one that has worked consistently and well for me. After 2 weeks of use I&#x27;m sold. If it stops working at some point I&#x27;ll update this review. But right now I&#x27;m very happy with its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my update on this product (original review in May, now it is November 2013). 6 months later I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I use an app called SnoreLab on my iPhone and my scores have dropped from the 60s down to the single digits, which is basically not snoring at all, after using this product consistently.  In fairness, I achieve the truly stellar lows (1!) when I have a cup of decaf coffee after dinner AND use my Snorestop. That seems to be my magic formula.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this product and it has helped me sleep better, because my husband&#x27;s snoring is more like purring now!</li>
            <li> 1 shot in the mouth for a full nights sleep. I not only sleep more comfortable but so does my wife</li>
            <li> Consult your doctor before you buy! I will never ever recommend this product and my doctor agrees. Call the nurses hotline for any questions as I am not a medical professional</li>
