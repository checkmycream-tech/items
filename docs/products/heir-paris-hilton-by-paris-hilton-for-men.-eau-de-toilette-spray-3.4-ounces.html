            <li>PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>but I LOVE the scent as do the ladies who smell it on me.  </li>
            <li>im completely satisfied</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M NOT ONLY THE ONE THAT THINKS SHE&#x27;S OUTRAGEOUSLY BEAUTIFUL, BUT MANY CELEBRITY MAKES COLOGNES FOR MEN AND WOMEN AND END UP FROM THE MACYS COUNTER TO CVS PHARMACY.</li>
            <li>I think this is good for teenagers or 15-25 ages, its a fresh fragance but fades very fast!</li>
            <li>&quot; I LOVE THE CLEAN SCENT (ITS LIKE A MIXTURE OF CITRUS, WOODY,RED WINE SCENT)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this one i just wish it didnt fade away so quickly.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh, clean smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>a very fresh, right outta the shower smell.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the smell to much more older smell</li>
            <li>It is a soft, fresh and very nice cologne but for everyday use is fine!</li>
            <li>Very citrus-y, light, playful.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for those men who like sweet and gentle fragrance!</li>
            <li>Must be applied fairly to feel it, because suddenly is very soft as I said earlier!</li>
            <li>MY 3RD BOTTLE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of paris hilton colognes since the first one was recommended to me by a saleswoman in perfumania.</li>
            <li>Smells cool and fresh last a couple of hours .</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I expected much more from the Hilton name.</li>
            <li>The other one for men is better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or overwhelming and really comes out when your body heats</li>
            <li>Is nice when you are with your partner because notes are not strong!</li>
            <li>My 7 yr old daughter wears it now.</li>
            <li>Definitely for the young.</li>

            <li> The only thing I dislike is that I think does not last long.</li>
            <li> The past fragrances lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The scent is good but the longivity is pathetic.</li>
            <li> I do get compliments on it, but unfortunately, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long and needs to be reapplied, otherwise it sits extremely close to you that no one can smell it.</li>
            <li> I am always asked what I am wearing and it makes me a little embarrased to answer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is always my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m not sure what to wear.  </li>
            <li> Just a small quirk.</li>
            <li> my rank  1.HEIR BY PARIS HILTON  </li>
            <li> I really hate to admit this...</li>

            <li> PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing! its the best out of all the PH for men! i love it! it has a baby powder smell to it! not so strong and fruity just how i like it! 10 stars!!!!! ignore all the haters! my rank  1.HEIR BY PARIS HILTON  2.PARIS HILTON FOR MEN  3.JUST ME FOR MEN BY PARIS HILTON</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I expected much more from the Hilton name. I was seriuosly dissapointed. The scent is good but the longivity is pathetic. My 7 yr old daughter wears it now. I also use it to spray the bathrooms and interior of our vehicles at times. The low price is there for a reason.</li>
            <li> I think this is good for teenagers or 15-25 ages, its a fresh fragance but fades very fast!</li>
            <li> I had it before and everyone loved the smell and so did I so i decided to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M NOT ONLY THE ONE THAT THINKS SHE&#x27;S OUTRAGEOUSLY BEAUTIFUL, BUT MANY CELEBRITY MAKES COLOGNES FOR MEN AND WOMEN AND END UP FROM THE MACYS COUNTER TO CVS PHARMACY. BUY \\&quot;HEIR FOR MEN IS AWESOME\\&quot; I LOVE THE CLEAN SCENT (ITS LIKE A MIXTURE OF CITRUS, WOODY,RED WINE SCENT) MY 3RD BOTTLE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Great smelling Cologne . Smells cool and fresh last a couple of hours . Smells like you just got out of the shower</li>
            <li> excellent product meets my expectations</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell to much more older smell I&#x27;m a younger smell.</li>
            <li> Is nice when you are with your partner because notes are not strong! but fragance is very nice</li>
            <li> I really hate to admit this... but I LOVE the scent as do the ladies who smell it on me.  I am always asked what I am wearing and it makes me a little embarrased to answer.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second bottle and for the price... this can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very fresh, right outta the shower smell.  It&#x27;s not too heavy or overwhelming and really comes out when your body heats up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is always my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m not sure what to wear.  I&#x27;m actually wearing it now as I type this review.</li>
            <li> Not her best scent.  The other one for men is better in my opinion.  This scent is just very generic.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of paris hilton colognes since the first one was recommended to me by a saleswoman in perfumania. I love the smell of this one i just wish it didnt fade away so quickly. The past fragrances lasted much longer. Other than that im completely satisfied</li>
            <li> Light, fresh, clean smelling cologne. This is going to be my third bottle, everyone loves this one on me and am always asking what the name is!</li>
            <li> It is a soft, fresh and very nice cologne but for everyday use is fine! I recommend it for those men who like sweet and gentle fragrance! The only thing I dislike is that I think does not last long. Must be applied fairly to feel it, because suddenly is very soft as I said earlier!</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells. Very citrus-y, light, playful. Definitely for the young. I do get compliments on it, but unfortunately, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long and needs to be reapplied, otherwise it sits extremely close to you that no one can smell it. Something I noticed, is that, when I go swimming and I have it on, it projects the smell while swimming. Actually kind of pleasant! Just a small quirk.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, he loves it!</li>
            <li> Great A++ Always loved all her products.</li>
