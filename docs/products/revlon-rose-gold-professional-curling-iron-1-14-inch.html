    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Curls my hair awesome!!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s going to be best for those who are curling all over (all of the hair).</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this item.</li>
            <li>I am truly impressed with the quickness in which this heats (</li>
            <li>This will end up being an option that needs to be messed with for a while before I can find what the best setting is for me.  </li>
            <li>Is it the best iron on the market?  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The color is wonderful too!!</li>
            <li>I thought ceramic irons were the best</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I noticed that my hair was shinier after using the iron!</li>
            <li>I do recommend, however, using it with good styling products for the best results.  </li>
            <li>Perfect curls, I just love it!</li>
            <li>I will say my daughter tried it and didn&#x27;t think it was as great.  </li>
            <li>and I got great curls that lasted until I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great idea that I had never seen before.  </li>
            <li>Great curling iron.</li>
            <li>experience of using the iron is great.  </li>
            <li>results are also great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not that impressed with the \\&quot;rose gold\\&quot; barrel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You will be happy with this curling iron if you like this size of barrel!&lt;br /&gt;ps</li>
            <li>And it has a nice look!</li>
            <li>This barrel size is perfect for me, and the heat control makes it easy to adjust accordingly.</li>
            <li>That can be a good thing, hotter can hold the curls longer.</li>
            <li>to be good at, but there you have it.  </li>
            <li>that feature seems to come and go.t, but in the under $30.00 price range it&#x27;s a good quality product.  </li>
            <li>With the rose gold barrel and pearl-like handle, this curling iron was very nice to look at, and I didn&#x27;t mind displaying it on my counter.</li>
            <li>But it does a very good job very quickly.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Out of all of those this is one of my top 2!  </li>
            <li>The large one and a quarter inch barrel is perfect for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>- I plugged it in and it got warm almost immediately</li>
            <li>no matter what kind of heat styling I am doing on my hair.  </li>
            <li>produce a nice, long-lasting curl.  </li>
            <li>Still, I liked how my hair behaves with this iron.</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you are going to purchase this curling iron, just be sure to protect your hair before using it (there are many, many great leave-ins that will protect your hair from heat).</li>
            <li>This iron does a wonderful job of smoothing out the curl making it look soft!  </li>
            <li>The barrel of this curling iron is rose gold (made of gold and copper) and has a very smooth surface with no imperfections, so my hair just slides over it.</li>
            <li>So far it has been perfect for this purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The top feature for her, though, is the heat control.</li>
            <li>It is not as high-end quality as most &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; curling irons, but I would recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li>What I love about it....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought a curling iron in many years.  </li>
            <li>cord - Wasn&#x27;t sure how to put this.  </li>
            <li>So the heat is applied ot any portion of the hair touching the metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more damaging than anything else I am doing.  </li>
            <li>Ok, then let&#x27;s talk about this curling</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many that I have gone through over the years</li>
            <li>but it is many.  </li>
            <li>You would think that would be the case with most curling irons, but I&#x27;ve had some before that had too many problems with their design.</li>
            <li>It gives it a more feminine color and appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I feel better letting you know that I would consider this better for adults.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>also would be better off using this on medium to longer hair.  </li>
            <li>Read a number of reviews to get the best overall opinion.  </li>
            <li>This is a great feature for curling iron newbies - you can use your fingers to steady the iron without burning yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is designed safely so I don&#x27;t burn myself too easily</li>
            <li>so I can maneuver it around without the cord becoming tangled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to find a product that you like and that works really well, when it&#x27;s something that you use just about every day.</li>
            <li>I love that it has temperature control - this is really important for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Handle stays cool during use!  </li>
            <li>Her assessment: This is a well-designed product, easy to hold and operate.</li>
            <li>The grip is easy to hold and does not slip or feel too bulky.  </li>
            <li>The on/off switch is easy to see, as is the heat-level selector.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, the package says 30 seconds</li>
            <li>This item is a pretty nice curling iron but has a couple deficiencies</li>
            <li>1-5 for fine hair means if your hair is close to falling out, use 1?</li>
            <li>This is a super curling iron!  </li>
            <li>To me, this curling iron appears to be a Mighty Wand, something a techno-wizard might wield in combat against the cybernetic army.  </li>
            <li>IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li>Overall, great curling iron.  </li>
            <li>This Revlon Rose Gold Barreled curling iron works very well at curling hair.  </li>
            <li>plastic feels cheap</li>
            <li>Better get in the habit of flat-out unplugging this (which is always a good idea anyway) or purchase a different one with an automatic turn-off.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a nice large cool</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly (I know this from accidentally brushing my hand against it seconds after turning it on), and the iron is easy to hold despite</li>
            <li>It gives a nice smooth, kind of loose waves.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is from a reputable brand, doesn&#x27;t cost too much, and is easy to use - or in my case, to learn how to use, as I am a hair styling novice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t say this to downplay the importance of getting a good curling iron because I do think it is important, but I also think the products you use on your hair are equally important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On first glance, I figured this was another regular large barrel iron even though it was the most attractive one I have seen.</li>
            <li>BUT be sure to use an appropriate product to protect your hair from this bare barrel.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; your hair in the &amp;#34;foot stand&amp;#34; like many models of curling irons do.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot to like about this Revlon Rose Gold Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li>Besides being very functional, this curling iron is simply nice to look at with its white handle and tip against the rose gold barrel.</li>
            <li>Really good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>and they both seem to make a huge difference in keeping my hair soft, healthy, and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>Cool tip</li>
            <li>Yes the tip is cool and it has a stand</li>
            <li>The iron heats up very quickly and gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li>The iron heated quickly and maintained its heat throughout the styling process.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I have to work quickly and pay attention at this setting</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>- Yes.&lt;br /&gt;It has quite a  large scale for temperatures, one of which is sure to be right for your hair.</li>
            <li>This iron gets HOT and it gets there mighty quick.  </li>
            <li>Overall, she is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a professional stylist and feel comfortable with the different settings, this would probably be great for you.  </li>
            <li>I can say that it gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>This is more of an adult curling iron, that is to say someone more responsible.  </li>
            <li>Not by a long shot, but in the under $30.00 price range it&#x27;s a good quality product.  </li>
            <li>Having watched many YouTube videos before getting a curling iron, just to see how easy/feasible it would be for me to do, I learned that 1\\&quot; barrels are good for shoulder length hair, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inch is good for hair that falls past the shoulder, and 2\\&quot; for very long hair.</li>
            <li>The cool white tip is nice because I can grab it to hold it in place while curling a section of hair without the danger of burning my fingers.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use good products I notice my hair starts feeling brittle and dry</li>
            <li>(I had a curling iron that got too hot to hold once while using it!</li>
            <li>You MUST unplug it first though rather than risk electrocution!</li>
            <li>I have straight, shoulder-length, fine hair, in layers.</li>
            <li>though a good curling iron for when I want big curls, does the job, gets hot and gets hot quick.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little curling iron.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would recommend this to anyone who uses a curling iron on a regular basis, with 30 heat settings even fine hair ladies should be able to use it without damage.</li>
            <li>Well, this new Revlon Rose Gold Professional showed me that significant advancements can and have been made in the technology of curling irons.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice solid feel to it</li>
            <li>Curling my hair in big chunks, it gave me some nice body.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice that I can set it low</li>
            <li>First, it heats up really quickly, like in 30 to 60 seconds</li>
            <li>&gt; The “Rose Gold” technology is really nothing special, but the entire metal portion does get heated and maintains heat well.  </li>
            <li>The iron itself works great for long lasting curls and waves compared to the older ones and like anything else, if you want quality then you will pay a bit more to get something nice that will last.  </li>
            <li>So it takes some guess work to find the right heat you want for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t make it so my hair get caught and torn right at the bend, for example.</li>
            <li>&amp; &amp;#34;curls fall right out after using&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The 1.25&amp;#34; barrel is perfect for soft large curls and wave as opposed to tight or spiralled.</li>
            <li>However, I have to say that the &#x60;cool tip&#x27; area at the top is larger than the one on my pricey salon iron.  </li>
            <li>One of the best things about it is that there are 30 different heat settings that are selected with the little dial on the handle.</li>
            <li>It could be also be that I found the right setting that was not too hot.</li>
            <li>This iron heats up fast and curls my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>In 2014, I&#x27;m surprised manufacturers continue to do so since a curling iron is one of the really easy items to forget to turn</li>
            <li>I love the larger rings the 1 1/2&amp;#34; iron gives me.  </li>
            <li>The curl settles into more of a wave, but that wave lasts for several hours.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that it will cost you over 3 times what this curling iron costs.  </li>
            <li>features are pretty much standard fare for most curling irons, even those in the bargain price range.  </li>
            <li>so when I first plugged this one in I thought it would take some time to heat up.  </li>
            <li>I will admit I am a nervous ninny with hot things</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s always been a Hot Tools gal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Heats up very fast and gets nice and hot!&lt;br /&gt;Makes nice big long lasting</li>
            <li>You want a curling iron that performs flawlessly and causes the least amount of damage possible to your hair?  </li>
            <li>The 30 different settings seemed a bit much, but I guess it gives you more fine-tuning capabilities.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Multiple settings for hair type - Great idea, but not sure if it is my own inexperience or the iron that means this is really just some glorified heat setting with very little heat change between number settings.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, the barrel is easy to clean if you&#x27;re curling your hair with styling products, however I suspect that long term use will wear down the coating since I already see a chip coming off at the top.</li>
            <li>But I love this iron and use it every time I wash and dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I loved this curling iron, it is a huge improvement over my other curling iron that is only about a year old.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s large size.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this iron to my friends.</li>
            <li>is known to provide one of the better electrical conductors because it offers little resistance, and won&#x27;t corrode over time as easily, hence reliability.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The huge barrel (1.25 &amp;#34; is huge compared to the standard 3/4&amp;#34; or 1&amp;#34; barrel) will produce larger, hence softer curls.</li>
            <li>She used a setting of 6 which produced smooth, lasting curls.  </li>
            <li>It has great heat, it curls your hair (and mine is thin</li>
            <li>She writes that the curling iron works very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m in a real hurry i&#x27;ll turn it all the way up to 30 which is about 400°.</li>
            <li>I like that because I feel like I am not doing as much damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a smooth finish and the only improvement I would suggest</li>
            <li>but mine was ready much sooner.  </li>
            <li>(OI/ ABSOLUTE BEAUTIFYING POTION) both from Davines</li>
            <li>It is ready to use in 30 seconds as promised.  </li>
            <li>Fast heat-up&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I really like the size of the barrel.  </li>
            <li>so if I do not &amp;#34;uncurl&amp;#34; it, it is very kinky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it performs reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much heat to scorch the tips of my hair</li>
            <li>which I like; it resulted in very natural-looking curls that lasted all day.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast</li>
            <li>up fast?</li>
            <li>It really does pay to do your homework.</li>
            <li>It also has the indicator light and auto-shut-off that is critical in a heated styling tool.</li>
            <li>I want to preface my review by saying that when it comes to hair styling tools the old adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is right on the money (so to speak).  </li>
            <li>I threw out my old (although not very old) curling iron and this one will move into first place as a gentle, reliable and easy to use part of my styling routine.  </li>
            <li>and I doubt anything would happen on my bathroom counter, but having that small safety piece would make this a 5 star for sure!</li>
            <li>She has very fine hair and shies away from using curling irons because they’re usually too hot and tend to damage her hair.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very easy to handle (something I took for granted until I got a flat iron that made my hand ache with regular use) and maneuver around my head.  </li>
            <li>I love to use a curling iron to add a little more body to my hair and also to make the look of my hair less severe when I choose to wear it straight.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I like the multiple settings.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>* High Heat&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hair requires really high temperatures in order to hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Likewise, I love the large barrel that creates big, loose curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum: ready in jiff, super hot, big barrel, big bouncy curls ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a capable adult</li>
            <li>My one huge worry is how this curling iron has no real coating to protect hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cord attaches via a swivel at the end which is great for not getting the cord all twisted up while working on your hair.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>, I know they class this a professional curling iron, but profession curling irons are much heavier duty in their weight</li>
            <li>I really like this iron, it makes curling my hair pretty simple.</li>
            <li>my mom, who has really thick hair, she was able to turn the temperature up to its maximum and liked using it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls aren&#x27;t very tight,</li>
            <li>It also makes my split ends look more tame and unnoticeable!&lt;br</li>
            <li>With little time to get ready in the mornings, I appreciated that it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a new curling iron in 20+ years</li>
            <li>I find that unplugging the curling iron, and running cool water on the barrel ONLY, is the quickest way to cool it down.  </li>
            <li>think its a decent curling iron, but I would hesitate to call it professional.</li>
            <li>it cool down fast?</li>
            <li>On the other hand, there is not protective coating on the iron (like most of the straighteners have) to protect your hair against the barrage (if you&#x27;re doing it daily) of heat.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;2) gets hot enough to curl my difficult-to-curl hair</li>
            <li>it get hot enough to curl my hair?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very solid, not heavy but not flimsy like so many other irons.  </li>
            <li>It performs exactly as I expect and while my hair does tend to get damaged over time with heat styling (not just from this product but also my blowdryer and flat iron)</li>
            <li>so it was more comfortable to hold than other irons that I&#x27;ve used, and I have used ALOT of different irons in the past 20</li>
            <li>In order to get ringlets or soft curls, I&#x27;d have to do much smaller sections or hold the iron in place for much longer.</li>
            <li>Longer barrel than my old Conair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and layered and I can get  consistent curls everywhere.  </li>
            <li>My hair has a natural wave</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, the occasional curler, this might be too much for you.</li>
            <li>Then get a salon professional bio-ionic iron with a ceramic coated barrel.  </li>
            <li>one does very well with short hair also.  </li>
            <li>I used it on the higher end of hot, because my hair is trouble holding a curl.</li>
            <li>It also has a kick stand which allows it to sit on my bathroom counter to cool down when I&#x27;m done using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For someone with short hair or someone young, you would only be able to bob the hair or give it really big, loose waves&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really the only thing I miss from an experience standpoint is a digital readout.  </li>
            <li>1-1/4\\&quot; barrel will deliver a medium size curl or loose wave depending on how much hair you wrap around the barrel.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is thick while mine is fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is easy to curl, so 15 is what I settled on for everyday use for loose curls and body.</li>
            <li>The other one had a flocked barrel which really gripped your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional stylist, this great idea is going to be complicated enough that I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;ll be willing to work with it before I give up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is slick, another words it glides over your hair and leave super curls that LAST.  </li>
            <li>apparently use actual gold in the mix for the part of the iron that heats up!&lt;br /&gt;Gold</li>
            <li>cools down fast</li>
            <li>I did not feel lots of heat on the hair or the scalp but the curls were definitely long lasting -- much longer than my stick straight hair usually holds a curl.  </li>
            <li>- literally only takes a few seconds to get hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this barrel size for those with shoulder length or longer hair; I think this will be a little too large for short hair (or lots of short layers).  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Curls my hair awesome!!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s going to be best for those who are curling all over (all of the hair).</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> I am truly impressed with the quickness in which this heats (</li>
            <li> This will end up being an option that needs to be messed with for a while before I can find what the best setting is for me.  </li>
            <li> Is it the best iron on the market?  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The color is wonderful too!!</li>
            <li> I thought ceramic irons were the best</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I noticed that my hair was shinier after using the iron!</li>
            <li> I do recommend, however, using it with good styling products for the best results.  </li>
            <li> Perfect curls, I just love it!</li>
            <li> I will say my daughter tried it and didn&#x27;t think it was as great.  </li>
            <li> and I got great curls that lasted until I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a really great idea that I had never seen before.  </li>
            <li> Great curling iron.</li>
            <li> experience of using the iron is great.  </li>
            <li> results are also great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not that impressed with the \\&quot;rose gold\\&quot; barrel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You will be happy with this curling iron if you like this size of barrel!&lt;br /&gt;ps</li>
            <li> And it has a nice look!</li>
            <li> This barrel size is perfect for me, and the heat control makes it easy to adjust accordingly.</li>
            <li> That can be a good thing, hotter can hold the curls longer.</li>
            <li> to be good at, but there you have it.  </li>
            <li> that feature seems to come and go.t, but in the under $30.00 price range it&#x27;s a good quality product.  </li>
            <li> With the rose gold barrel and pearl-like handle, this curling iron was very nice to look at, and I didn&#x27;t mind displaying it on my counter.</li>
            <li> But it does a very good job very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Out of all of those this is one of my top 2!  </li>
            <li> The large one and a quarter inch barrel is perfect for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> - I plugged it in and it got warm almost immediately</li>
            <li> no matter what kind of heat styling I am doing on my hair.  </li>
            <li> produce a nice, long-lasting curl.  </li>
            <li> Still, I liked how my hair behaves with this iron.</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you are going to purchase this curling iron, just be sure to protect your hair before using it (there are many, many great leave-ins that will protect your hair from heat).</li>
            <li> This iron does a wonderful job of smoothing out the curl making it look soft!  </li>
            <li> The barrel of this curling iron is rose gold (made of gold and copper) and has a very smooth surface with no imperfections, so my hair just slides over it.</li>
            <li> So far it has been perfect for this purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The top feature for her, though, is the heat control.</li>
            <li> It is not as high-end quality as most &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; curling irons, but I would recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> What I love about it....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a curling iron in many years.  </li>
            <li> cord - Wasn&#x27;t sure how to put this.  </li>
            <li> So the heat is applied ot any portion of the hair touching the metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more damaging than anything else I am doing.  </li>
            <li> Ok, then let&#x27;s talk about this curling</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many that I have gone through over the years</li>
            <li> but it is many.  </li>
            <li> You would think that would be the case with most curling irons, but I&#x27;ve had some before that had too many problems with their design.</li>
            <li> It gives it a more feminine color and appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I feel better letting you know that I would consider this better for adults.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> also would be better off using this on medium to longer hair.  </li>
            <li> Read a number of reviews to get the best overall opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is a great feature for curling iron newbies - you can use your fingers to steady the iron without burning yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is designed safely so I don&#x27;t burn myself too easily</li>
            <li> so I can maneuver it around without the cord becoming tangled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to find a product that you like and that works really well, when it&#x27;s something that you use just about every day.</li>
            <li> I love that it has temperature control - this is really important for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Handle stays cool during use!  </li>
            <li> Her assessment: This is a well-designed product, easy to hold and operate.</li>
            <li> The grip is easy to hold and does not slip or feel too bulky.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch is easy to see, as is the heat-level selector.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, the package says 30 seconds</li>
            <li> This item is a pretty nice curling iron but has a couple deficiencies</li>
            <li> 1-5 for fine hair means if your hair is close to falling out, use 1?</li>
            <li> This is a super curling iron!  </li>
            <li> To me, this curling iron appears to be a Mighty Wand, something a techno-wizard might wield in combat against the cybernetic army.  </li>
            <li> IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li> Overall, great curling iron.  </li>
            <li> This Revlon Rose Gold Barreled curling iron works very well at curling hair.  </li>
            <li> plastic feels cheap</li>
            <li> Better get in the habit of flat-out unplugging this (which is always a good idea anyway) or purchase a different one with an automatic turn-off.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a nice large cool</li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly (I know this from accidentally brushing my hand against it seconds after turning it on), and the iron is easy to hold despite</li>
            <li> It gives a nice smooth, kind of loose waves.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is from a reputable brand, doesn&#x27;t cost too much, and is easy to use - or in my case, to learn how to use, as I am a hair styling novice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t say this to downplay the importance of getting a good curling iron because I do think it is important, but I also think the products you use on your hair are equally important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On first glance, I figured this was another regular large barrel iron even though it was the most attractive one I have seen.</li>
            <li> BUT be sure to use an appropriate product to protect your hair from this bare barrel.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; your hair in the &amp;#34;foot stand&amp;#34; like many models of curling irons do.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot to like about this Revlon Rose Gold Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> Besides being very functional, this curling iron is simply nice to look at with its white handle and tip against the rose gold barrel.</li>
            <li> Really good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> and they both seem to make a huge difference in keeping my hair soft, healthy, and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> Cool tip</li>
            <li> Yes the tip is cool and it has a stand</li>
            <li> The iron heats up very quickly and gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li> The iron heated quickly and maintained its heat throughout the styling process.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I have to work quickly and pay attention at this setting</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> - Yes.&lt;br /&gt;It has quite a  large scale for temperatures, one of which is sure to be right for your hair.</li>
            <li> This iron gets HOT and it gets there mighty quick.  </li>
            <li> Overall, she is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a professional stylist and feel comfortable with the different settings, this would probably be great for you.  </li>
            <li> I can say that it gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> This is more of an adult curling iron, that is to say someone more responsible.  </li>
            <li> Not by a long shot, but in the under $30.00 price range it&#x27;s a good quality product.  </li>
            <li> Having watched many YouTube videos before getting a curling iron, just to see how easy/feasible it would be for me to do, I learned that 1\\&quot; barrels are good for shoulder length hair, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inch is good for hair that falls past the shoulder, and 2\\&quot; for very long hair.</li>
            <li> The cool white tip is nice because I can grab it to hold it in place while curling a section of hair without the danger of burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use good products I notice my hair starts feeling brittle and dry</li>
            <li> (I had a curling iron that got too hot to hold once while using it!</li>
            <li> You MUST unplug it first though rather than risk electrocution!</li>
            <li> I have straight, shoulder-length, fine hair, in layers.</li>
            <li> though a good curling iron for when I want big curls, does the job, gets hot and gets hot quick.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little curling iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend this to anyone who uses a curling iron on a regular basis, with 30 heat settings even fine hair ladies should be able to use it without damage.</li>
            <li> Well, this new Revlon Rose Gold Professional showed me that significant advancements can and have been made in the technology of curling irons.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice solid feel to it</li>
            <li> Curling my hair in big chunks, it gave me some nice body.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice that I can set it low</li>
            <li> First, it heats up really quickly, like in 30 to 60 seconds</li>
            <li> &gt; The “Rose Gold” technology is really nothing special, but the entire metal portion does get heated and maintains heat well.  </li>
            <li> The iron itself works great for long lasting curls and waves compared to the older ones and like anything else, if you want quality then you will pay a bit more to get something nice that will last.  </li>
            <li> So it takes some guess work to find the right heat you want for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t make it so my hair get caught and torn right at the bend, for example.</li>
            <li> &amp; &amp;#34;curls fall right out after using&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The 1.25&amp;#34; barrel is perfect for soft large curls and wave as opposed to tight or spiralled.</li>
            <li> However, I have to say that the &#x60;cool tip&#x27; area at the top is larger than the one on my pricey salon iron.  </li>
            <li> One of the best things about it is that there are 30 different heat settings that are selected with the little dial on the handle.</li>
            <li> It could be also be that I found the right setting that was not too hot.</li>
            <li> This iron heats up fast and curls my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> In 2014, I&#x27;m surprised manufacturers continue to do so since a curling iron is one of the really easy items to forget to turn</li>
            <li> I love the larger rings the 1 1/2&amp;#34; iron gives me.  </li>
            <li> The curl settles into more of a wave, but that wave lasts for several hours.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that it will cost you over 3 times what this curling iron costs.  </li>
            <li> features are pretty much standard fare for most curling irons, even those in the bargain price range.  </li>
            <li> so when I first plugged this one in I thought it would take some time to heat up.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I am a nervous ninny with hot things</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s always been a Hot Tools gal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Heats up very fast and gets nice and hot!&lt;br /&gt;Makes nice big long lasting</li>
            <li> You want a curling iron that performs flawlessly and causes the least amount of damage possible to your hair?  </li>
            <li> The 30 different settings seemed a bit much, but I guess it gives you more fine-tuning capabilities.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Multiple settings for hair type - Great idea, but not sure if it is my own inexperience or the iron that means this is really just some glorified heat setting with very little heat change between number settings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, the barrel is easy to clean if you&#x27;re curling your hair with styling products, however I suspect that long term use will wear down the coating since I already see a chip coming off at the top.</li>
            <li> But I love this iron and use it every time I wash and dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I loved this curling iron, it is a huge improvement over my other curling iron that is only about a year old.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s large size.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this iron to my friends.</li>
            <li> is known to provide one of the better electrical conductors because it offers little resistance, and won&#x27;t corrode over time as easily, hence reliability.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The huge barrel (1.25 &amp;#34; is huge compared to the standard 3/4&amp;#34; or 1&amp;#34; barrel) will produce larger, hence softer curls.</li>
            <li> She used a setting of 6 which produced smooth, lasting curls.  </li>
            <li> It has great heat, it curls your hair (and mine is thin</li>
            <li> She writes that the curling iron works very well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m in a real hurry i&#x27;ll turn it all the way up to 30 which is about 400°.</li>
            <li> I like that because I feel like I am not doing as much damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It has a smooth finish and the only improvement I would suggest</li>
            <li> but mine was ready much sooner.  </li>
            <li> (OI/ ABSOLUTE BEAUTIFYING POTION) both from Davines</li>
            <li> It is ready to use in 30 seconds as promised.  </li>
            <li> Fast heat-up&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I really like the size of the barrel.  </li>
            <li> so if I do not &amp;#34;uncurl&amp;#34; it, it is very kinky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it performs reasonably well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much heat to scorch the tips of my hair</li>
            <li> which I like; it resulted in very natural-looking curls that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast</li>
            <li> up fast?</li>
            <li> It really does pay to do your homework.</li>
            <li> It also has the indicator light and auto-shut-off that is critical in a heated styling tool.</li>
            <li> I want to preface my review by saying that when it comes to hair styling tools the old adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is right on the money (so to speak).  </li>
            <li> I threw out my old (although not very old) curling iron and this one will move into first place as a gentle, reliable and easy to use part of my styling routine.  </li>
            <li> and I doubt anything would happen on my bathroom counter, but having that small safety piece would make this a 5 star for sure!</li>
            <li> She has very fine hair and shies away from using curling irons because they’re usually too hot and tend to damage her hair.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very easy to handle (something I took for granted until I got a flat iron that made my hand ache with regular use) and maneuver around my head.  </li>
            <li> I love to use a curling iron to add a little more body to my hair and also to make the look of my hair less severe when I choose to wear it straight.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and I like the multiple settings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> * High Heat&lt;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair requires really high temperatures in order to hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Likewise, I love the large barrel that creates big, loose curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum: ready in jiff, super hot, big barrel, big bouncy curls ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a capable adult</li>
            <li> My one huge worry is how this curling iron has no real coating to protect hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cord attaches via a swivel at the end which is great for not getting the cord all twisted up while working on your hair.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> , I know they class this a professional curling iron, but profession curling irons are much heavier duty in their weight</li>
            <li> I really like this iron, it makes curling my hair pretty simple.</li>
            <li> my mom, who has really thick hair, she was able to turn the temperature up to its maximum and liked using it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls aren&#x27;t very tight,</li>
            <li> It also makes my split ends look more tame and unnoticeable!&lt;br</li>
            <li> With little time to get ready in the mornings, I appreciated that it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a new curling iron in 20+ years</li>
            <li> I find that unplugging the curling iron, and running cool water on the barrel ONLY, is the quickest way to cool it down.  </li>
            <li> think its a decent curling iron, but I would hesitate to call it professional.</li>
            <li> it cool down fast?</li>
            <li> On the other hand, there is not protective coating on the iron (like most of the straighteners have) to protect your hair against the barrage (if you&#x27;re doing it daily) of heat.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;2) gets hot enough to curl my difficult-to-curl hair</li>
            <li> it get hot enough to curl my hair?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very solid, not heavy but not flimsy like so many other irons.  </li>
            <li> It performs exactly as I expect and while my hair does tend to get damaged over time with heat styling (not just from this product but also my blowdryer and flat iron)</li>
            <li> so it was more comfortable to hold than other irons that I&#x27;ve used, and I have used ALOT of different irons in the past 20</li>
            <li> In order to get ringlets or soft curls, I&#x27;d have to do much smaller sections or hold the iron in place for much longer.</li>
            <li> Longer barrel than my old Conair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and layered and I can get  consistent curls everywhere.  </li>
            <li> My hair has a natural wave</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, the occasional curler, this might be too much for you.</li>
            <li> Then get a salon professional bio-ionic iron with a ceramic coated barrel.  </li>
            <li> one does very well with short hair also.  </li>
            <li> I used it on the higher end of hot, because my hair is trouble holding a curl.</li>
            <li> It also has a kick stand which allows it to sit on my bathroom counter to cool down when I&#x27;m done using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For someone with short hair or someone young, you would only be able to bob the hair or give it really big, loose waves&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really the only thing I miss from an experience standpoint is a digital readout.  </li>
            <li> 1-1/4\\&quot; barrel will deliver a medium size curl or loose wave depending on how much hair you wrap around the barrel.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is thick while mine is fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair is easy to curl, so 15 is what I settled on for everyday use for loose curls and body.</li>
            <li> The other one had a flocked barrel which really gripped your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional stylist, this great idea is going to be complicated enough that I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;ll be willing to work with it before I give up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is slick, another words it glides over your hair and leave super curls that LAST.  </li>

            <li> cools down fast</li>
            <li> I did not feel lots of heat on the hair or the scalp but the curls were definitely long lasting -- much longer than my stick straight hair usually holds a curl.  </li>
            <li> - literally only takes a few seconds to get hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this barrel size for those with shoulder length or longer hair; I think this will be a little too large for short hair (or lots of short layers).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to wait any longer than usual, but it also wasn&#x27;t significantly faster at cooling down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is 100% necessary, but my flat iron has it</li>
            <li> The barrel length is long enough (standard) not to cause problems.</li>
            <li> Normally I set it at about 20 to 25 and at that setting I can hold it in place a little longer.</li>
            <li> and I think it should last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It gives you big curls which is what I like with long hair.  </li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t last long in my house!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has one of their flat irons &amp; uses that as a curler too.  </li>
            <li> I typically curl my hair on the highest setting of my other iron, but this one does not have to be the highest in order to keep the curl in my board straight hair.  </li>
            <li> This could make this product a potential fire hazard for the forgetful OR a perpetual annoyance for those who cannot remember if they turned it off as they leave the drive-way.</li>

            <li> I have a hand me down curling iron from my sister, which is no-frills and simply has an on/off switch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She was initially skeptical about the advantages of using gold and copper in a curling iron, but found that it does heat up remarkably quickly.</li>
            <li> the curling iron tended to stick, because of the hairspray I use, where my other curling iron doesn&#x27;t.  </li>

            <li> Works well, still practicing, haven&#x27;t used a curling iron in a long time and have a bad shoulder which hampers my use.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Longer barrel than my old Conair.  Curls my hair awesome!! And it has a nice look!</li>
            <li> Finally one that works the way it&#x27;s supposed to.  This iron heats up fast and curls my hair quickly.  My hair is long and layered and I can get  consistent curls everywhere.  I love the larger rings the 1 1/2&amp;#34; iron gives me.  Also the curls last even into the next day leaving my hair wavy and fuller looking.  I love this curling iron.  It has 30 heat settings and I keep it set around 25-28.  I will say my daughter tried it and didn&#x27;t think it was as great.  Her hair is crazy straight and almost down to her waist.  She complained it wasn&#x27;t curling her hair but I saw curls in back so I don&#x27;t know what she was expecting.  Maybe with the length of her hair, she needed help in the back.  But I love this iron and use it every time I wash and dry my hair.</li>
            <li> To me, this curling iron appears to be a Mighty Wand, something a techno-wizard might wield in combat against the cybernetic army.  Being that I have limited use for the thing, I asked a close acquaintance of the fairer side to check it out and give me her input.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was initially skeptical about the advantages of using gold and copper in a curling iron, but found that it does heat up remarkably quickly. The top feature for her, though, is the heat control. She has very fine hair and shies away from using curling irons because they’re usually too hot and tend to damage her hair. She used a setting of 6 which produced smooth, lasting curls.  Her assessment: This is a well-designed product, easy to hold and operate. It’s definitely an improvement over any curling iron she has used.</li>
            <li> The iron is 1 1/4 inch so it&#x27;s one of the bigger sizes (meaning big curls) so it&#x27;s going to be best for those who are curling all over (all of the hair). The iron heats up very quickly and gets extremely hot. I&#x27;ve been in straightener mode for the past year or so over the years of using straighteners and curling irons have noticed that straighteners tend to heat up quicker and run hotter than curling irons. This curling iron reminds me of a straightener (the quickness to heat and the temperature). That can be a good thing, hotter can hold the curls longer. On the other hand, there is not protective coating on the iron (like most of the straighteners have) to protect your hair against the barrage (if you&#x27;re doing it daily) of heat. So keep that in mind. If you plan on using it daily, you may either want to look for one *with* a protective coating or invest in some product spray to protect your hair against the heat. IMPORTANT: This does *not* have an automatic turn off. That can be a *big* issue for some.</li>
            <li> When I received this item I sort of thought &amp;#34;what can they do to improve a curling iron?&amp;#34;  Well, this new Revlon Rose Gold Professional showed me that significant advancements can and have been made in the technology of curling irons.  I was happily surprised to find that this iron has a difficult to describe &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; quality to the way that it curls the hair.  I did not feel lots of heat on the hair or the scalp but the curls were definitely long lasting -- much longer than my stick straight hair usually holds a curl.  The iron heated quickly and maintained its heat throughout the styling process.  I threw out my old (although not very old) curling iron and this one will move into first place as a gentle, reliable and easy to use part of my styling routine.  I am very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> This is a super curling iron!  It heats up fast, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; your hair in the &amp;#34;foot stand&amp;#34; like many models of curling irons do.  It has great heat, it curls your hair (and mine is thin but I have tons of it).  It is slick, another words it glides over your hair and leave super curls that LAST.  It has a safety end that is helpful, although I am used to using curling irons with or without the end.  The grip is easy to hold and does not slip or feel too bulky.  The only down fall is it does not have automatic turn off.  I am used to using a &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; curling iron that I can walk away from when I&#x27;m done or one that I don&#x27;t have to panic if I forget to turn it off.  This doesn&#x27;t have that option and it scares me to leave it or rather &amp;#34;forget&amp;#34; about it.  I&#x27;m a capable adult and I doubt anything would happen on my bathroom counter, but having that small safety piece would make this a 5 star for sure!</li>
            <li> I am truly impressed with the quickness in which this heats (my T3 flat-iron takes a bit of time to reach an optimal temperature). Likewise, I love the large barrel that creates big, loose curls. My one huge worry is how this curling iron has no real coating to protect hair. My flat-iron ([[ASIN:B00HZ5G85Y T3 SinglePass Flat Iron]] was a small fortune, but has a tourmaline coating that alleges to protect hair ... and, while I use it sparingly, the flat-iron has yet to make my hair look or feel damaged. Here, it&#x27;s just a matter of time. Therefore, if you are going to purchase this curling iron, just be sure to protect your hair before using it (there are many, many great leave-ins that will protect your hair from heat). (And, as advised by stylists, use it for only two or three seconds per section ... or else you risk doing serious damage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: this product does not have an automatic turn-off. This could make this product a potential fire hazard for the forgetful OR a perpetual annoyance for those who cannot remember if they turned it off as they leave the drive-way. Better get in the habit of flat-out unplugging this (which is always a good idea anyway) or purchase a different one with an automatic turn-off. (Do take this into consideration if you are purchasing this for a tween/teen who may have a lot on her mind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum: ready in jiff, super hot, big barrel, big bouncy curls ... BUT be sure to use an appropriate product to protect your hair from this bare barrel.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the curling iron for a few weeks now. She writes that the curling iron works very well. It heats up quickly. The on/off switch is easy to see, as is the heat-level selector. There are several levels of heat and they do vary. I have straight, shoulder-length, fine hair, in layers. The curl settles into more of a wave, but that wave lasts for several hours. There is no silicone sleeve though, so I can&#x27;t put the iron away until it cools down. Overall, she is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> There is a lot to like about this Revlon Rose Gold Professional Curling Iron. First, it heats up really quickly, like in 30 to 60 seconds it&#x27;s ready to go. The barrel of this curling iron is rose gold (made of gold and copper) and has a very smooth surface with no imperfections, so my hair just slides over it. The large one and a quarter inch barrel is perfect for my shoulder length hair. It gives a nice smooth, kind of loose waves. One of the best things about it is that there are 30 different heat settings that are selected with the little dial on the handle. If I&#x27;m in a real hurry i&#x27;ll turn it all the way up to 30 which is about 400°. I have to work quickly and pay attention at this setting so I don&#x27;t burn my hair. But it does a very good job very quickly. Normally I set it at about 20 to 25 and at that setting I can hold it in place a little longer. My hair curls just as well and the curls are just as long-lasting at that temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a swivel cord so I can maneuver it around without the cord becoming tangled. It also has a flip-up stand so I can set it on the counter while I&#x27;m combing out a of section of hair (or pause to answer the phone or reply to a text ). The cool white tip is nice because I can grab it to hold it in place while curling a section of hair without the danger of burning my fingers. It has a nice solid feel to it and I think it should last for a long time. Besides being very functional, this curling iron is simply nice to look at with its white handle and tip against the rose gold barrel. It&#x27;s good to find a product that you like and that works really well, when it&#x27;s something that you use just about every day.</li>
            <li> I have very long (butt length) thick hair, so finding a curling iron that works for me is hard. I need a lot of heat to curl my hair well, and this could have gotten hotter. Curling my hair in big chunks, it gave me some nice body. In order to get ringlets or soft curls, I&#x27;d have to do much smaller sections or hold the iron in place for much longer. I like that it has a nice large cool are at the tip so you don&#x27;t burn yourself, and I like that the cord swivels as you turn, so it doesn&#x27;t get all messed up.</li>
            <li> This is a great little curling iron.  It heats up quickly and I like the multiple settings.  I typically curl my hair on the highest setting of my other iron, but this one does not have to be the highest in order to keep the curl in my board straight hair.  I like that because I feel like I am not doing as much damage to my hair.  It has a smooth finish and the only improvement I would suggest would be to include a sleeve of some sort to keep it covered/protected when not in use and when finished with use.  I believe Revlon makes others that have this sleeve, but this one does not have it for some reason.  Overall, great curling iron.  It is not as high-end quality as most &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; curling irons, but I would recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved this curling iron, it is a huge improvement over my other curling iron that is only about a year old.  What I love about it....&lt;br /&gt;It is very solid, not heavy but not flimsy like so many other irons.  It heats up very quickly, the package says 30 seconds but mine was ready much sooner.  It gives you big curls which is what I like with long hair.  I have very thick, course hair and I got great curls that lasted until I washed my hair.  It comes with a swivel cord meaning no more tangled cords, why cant every hair care product do this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this to anyone who uses a curling iron on a regular basis, with 30 heat settings even fine hair ladies should be able to use it without damage.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is from a reputable brand, doesn&#x27;t cost too much, and is easy to use - or in my case, to learn how to use, as I am a hair styling novice. I have a hand me down curling iron from my sister, which is no-frills and simply has an on/off switch. I could never master how to use it, and its 1\\&quot; barrel was a little too small for my hair length. Having watched many YouTube videos before getting a curling iron, just to see how easy/feasible it would be for me to do, I learned that 1\\&quot; barrels are good for shoulder length hair, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inch is good for hair that falls past the shoulder, and 2\\&quot; for very long hair. (At least, this is what the beauty gurus on YouTube told me!) This barrel size is perfect for me, and the heat control makes it easy to adjust accordingly. I used it on the higher end of hot, because my hair is trouble holding a curl. It heats up really quickly (I know this from accidentally brushing my hand against it seconds after turning it on), and the iron is easy to hold despite it&#x27;s large size. It also has a kick stand which allows it to sit on my bathroom counter to cool down when I&#x27;m done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get five stars is that by its second use it started squeaking when I opened the barrel clip.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a curling iron in many years.  My hair has a natural wave and I generally have little time to style my hair.  Despite that, I like having a curling iron for a random date night, and this one sounded really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quick-heating - I plugged it in and it got warm almost immediately&lt;br /&gt;Spinny cord - Wasn&#x27;t sure how to put this.  The cord is not stationary on the end.  When you turn the curling iron, the cord moves around without getting tangled or twisted&lt;br /&gt;Multiple settings for hair type - This is a really great idea that I had never seen before.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is thick while mine is fine.  In theory, we would just need to change the setting to do either her hair or mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Big waves only - The barrel is much bigger than I realized.  For someone with short hair or someone young, you would only be able to bob the hair or give it really big, loose waves&lt;br /&gt;Multiple settings for hair type - Great idea, but not sure if it is my own inexperience or the iron that means this is really just some glorified heat setting with very little heat change between number settings.  Also, why a number range for different hair types? 1-5 for fine hair means if your hair is close to falling out, use 1? This will end up being an option that needs to be messed with for a while before I can find what the best setting is for me.  I&#x27;m not a professional stylist, this great idea is going to be complicated enough that I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;ll be willing to work with it before I give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is just a curling iron.  If you&#x27;re a professional stylist and feel comfortable with the different settings, this would probably be great for you.  If you&#x27;re like me, the occasional curler, this might be too much for you.</li>
            <li> This Revlon Rose Gold Barreled curling iron works very well at curling hair.  The 1.25&amp;#34; barrel is perfect for soft large curls and wave as opposed to tight or spiralled. It heats up almost instantly and although I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the 30 temperature settings (it&#x27;s a tiny plastic dial on the side) I can say that it gets very hot.  I suspect the coating of the barrel has a lot to do with it and it feels like you&#x27;re singing your hair since there&#x27;s not teflon or textured coating that gives the impression of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature that I find perplexing is that it doesn&#x27;t have an &amp;#34;auto-off&amp;#34; feature.  In 2014, I&#x27;m surprised manufacturers continue to do so since a curling iron is one of the really easy items to forget to turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the barrel is easy to clean if you&#x27;re curling your hair with styling products, however I suspect that long term use will wear down the coating since I already see a chip coming off at the top.</li>
            <li> Things to like about this curling iron:&lt;br /&gt;Heats up very fast and gets nice and hot!&lt;br /&gt;Makes nice big long lasting curls.&lt;br /&gt;The cord attaches via a swivel at the end which is great for not getting the cord all twisted up while working on your hair.&lt;br /&gt; The “Rose Gold” technology is really nothing special, but the entire metal portion does get heated and maintains heat well.  So the heat is applied ot any portion of the hair touching the metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don’t like:&lt;br /&gt;The plastic feels cheap, I know they class this a professional curling iron, but profession curling irons are much heavier duty in their weight and feel.&lt;br /&gt;The temperature settings are just 30 notches on a dial, and you have no idea what they mean.  So it takes some guess work to find the right heat you want for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though a good curling iron for when I want big curls, does the job, gets hot and gets hot quick.  Overall I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron. I have thin hair and the clip will hold small sections without pulling too hard. Really good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect curls, I just love it!</li>
            <li> I have thick blonde hair that is just past my shoulders.  I love to use a curling iron to add a little more body to my hair and also to make the look of my hair less severe when I choose to wear it straight.  So far it has been perfect for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experience of using the iron is great.  It heats up quickly.  And it&#x27;s very easy to handle (something I took for granted until I got a flat iron that made my hand ache with regular use) and maneuver around my head.  Really the only thing I miss from an experience standpoint is a digital readout.  I don&#x27;t think it is 100% necessary, but my flat iron has it and it&#x27;s made me a little spoiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are also great.  It performs exactly as I expect and while my hair does tend to get damaged over time with heat styling (not just from this product but also my blowdryer and flat iron) it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more damaging than anything else I am doing.  I do recommend, however, using it with good styling products for the best results.  I use a relaxing moisturizing fluid and a hair oil (OI/ ABSOLUTE BEAUTIFYING POTION) both from Davines and they both seem to make a huge difference in keeping my hair soft, healthy, and frizz free.  When I don&#x27;t use good products I notice my hair starts feeling brittle and dry no matter what kind of heat styling I am doing on my hair.  I don&#x27;t say this to downplay the importance of getting a good curling iron because I do think it is important, but I also think the products you use on your hair are equally important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I want to preface my review by saying that when it comes to hair styling tools the old adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is right on the money (so to speak).  You want a curling iron that performs flawlessly and causes the least amount of damage possible to your hair?  Then get a salon professional bio-ionic iron with a ceramic coated barrel.  Just be aware that it will cost you over 3 times what this curling iron costs.  Don&#x27;t want to blow your budget?  Ok, then let&#x27;s talk about this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1-1/4\\&quot; barrel will deliver a medium size curl or loose wave depending on how much hair you wrap around the barrel.  I&#x27;d recommend this barrel size for those with shoulder length or longer hair; I think this will be a little too large for short hair (or lots of short layers).  This iron gets HOT and it gets there mighty quick.  It is ready to use in 30 seconds as promised.  Features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;* Fast heat-up&lt;br /&gt;* High Heat&lt;br /&gt;* Adjustable heat settings&lt;br /&gt;* Cool tip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These features are pretty much standard fare for most curling irons, even those in the bargain price range.  However, I have to say that the &#x60;cool tip&#x27; area at the top is larger than the one on my pricey salon iron.  This is a great feature for curling iron newbies - you can use your fingers to steady the iron without burning yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not that impressed with the \\&quot;rose gold\\&quot; barrel.  I actually prefer a ceramic coated barrel as it allows the hair to slide while you&#x27;re moving the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to let you in on a secret...I can wield a curling iron like nobody&#x27;s business!  Have you ever seen the movie \\&quot;The Highlander\\&quot;?  Replace the sword with a curling iron and that&#x27;s me.  Weird (and fairly useless) thing to be good at, but there you have it.  I&#x27;m telling you this because I can vouch for the fact that this iron does what it says it&#x27;s going to do:  produce a nice, long-lasting curl.  Is it the best iron on the market?  Not by a long shot, but in the under $30.00 price range it&#x27;s a good quality product.  And remember...\\&quot;there can be only one!\\&quot; (That&#x27;s for the \\&quot;Highlander\\&quot; fans out there, lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I uploaded a couple of pictures to show what the 1-1/4\\&quot; curl looks like on medium length hair.  Not sure if they&#x27;ll show on the product page or not...that feature seems to come and go.t, but in the under $30.00 price range it&#x27;s a good quality product.  And remember...\\&quot;there can be only one!\\&quot; (That&#x27;s for the \\&quot;Highlander\\&quot; fans out there, lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I uploaded a couple of pictures to show what the 1-1/4\\&quot; curl looks like on medium length hair.

            <li> This is a wonderful curling iron.  I cannot tell you how many that I have gone through over the years but it is many.  Out of all of those this is one of my top 2!  The other one had a flocked barrel which really gripped your hair.  Even if it was short.&lt;br /&gt;This one does very well with short hair also.  I really like the size of the barrel.  I have a perm so if I do not &amp;#34;uncurl&amp;#34; it, it is very kinky.  This iron does a wonderful job of smoothing out the curl making it look soft!  It also makes my split ends look more tame and unnoticeable!&lt;br /&gt;You will be happy with this curling iron if you like this size of barrel!&lt;br /&gt;ps The color is wonderful too!!</li>
            <li> This item is a pretty nice curling iron but has a couple deficiencies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it performs reasonably well.  however, I didn&#x27;t like the blister pack that it came in, it was hard to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the curling iron tended to stick, because of the hairspray I use, where my other curling iron doesn&#x27;t.  I guess its in the &amp;#34;rose gold&amp;#34; coating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think its a decent curling iron, but I would hesitate to call it professional.</li>
            <li> I thought ceramic irons were the best but this one heats up faster than my ceramic wand - literally only takes a few seconds to get hot. I love that it has temperature control - this is really important for my fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t take much heat to scorch the tips of my hair so it&#x27;s nice that I can set it low; I keep it on its lowest setting. Even then, I only had to go over each bit of hair once with the curling iron; I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over and over the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my mom, who has really thick hair, she was able to turn the temperature up to its maximum and liked using it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls aren&#x27;t very tight, which I like; it resulted in very natural-looking curls that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I really like this iron, it makes curling my hair pretty simple. You would think that would be the case with most curling irons, but I&#x27;ve had some before that had too many problems with their design. This one doesn&#x27;t make it so my hair get caught and torn right at the bend, for example. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When it comes to curling irons, I look for these features:&lt;br /&gt;1) Heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;2) gets hot enough to curl my difficult-to-curl hair&lt;br /&gt;3) Is designed safely so I don&#x27;t burn myself too easily&lt;br /&gt;4) has correct barrel size for my hair and style&lt;br /&gt;5) cools down fast so I can put it away before heading out the door&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s see how this stacks up on my scale:&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast? Yes- 30 seconds or less.&lt;br /&gt;They apparently use actual gold in the mix for the part of the iron that heats up!&lt;br /&gt;Gold is known to provide one of the better electrical conductors because it offers little resistance, and won&#x27;t corrode over time as easily, hence reliability.  This also allows the heat to transfer rapidly to the curling iron. The only metals that can exceed Gold&#x27;s conductivity are Copper and Silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it get hot enough to curl my hair? - Yes.&lt;br /&gt;It has quite a  large scale for temperatures, one of which is sure to be right for your hair. My hair requires really high temperatures in order to hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a safety tip (which is a MUST) and a little stand to prop it up when setting it down 9another MUST HAVE feature.) The barrel length is long enough (standard) not to cause problems. (I tried a travel curling iron once that had a 4&amp;#34;-long barrel- it was awful., Took forever to curl my hair and ended up overheating...but that&#x27;s another story.) Handle stays cool during use!  (I had a curling iron that got too hot to hold once while using it! That didn&#x27;t last long in my house!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Rose&amp;#34; part of the description is just for looks. It gives it a more feminine color and appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The huge barrel (1.25 &amp;#34; is huge compared to the standard 3/4&amp;#34; or 1&amp;#34; barrel) will produce larger, hence softer curls. I prefer a smaller barrel, but occasionally need larger ones for the lower part of the strands,  This is a matter of personal taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it cool down fast? Maybe. I didn&#x27;t have to wait any longer than usual, but it also wasn&#x27;t significantly faster at cooling down. I find that unplugging the curling iron, and running cool water on the barrel ONLY, is the quickest way to cool it down.  You MUST unplug it first though rather than risk electrocution!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a new curling iron in 20+ years so when I first plugged this one in I thought it would take some time to heat up.  Wrong, it was hot almost immediately and it was hotter than anything I could ever have imagined.  Was going to give this to my teenage granddaughters but I&#x27;m afraid of them getting burnt.  This is more of an adult curling iron, that is to say someone more responsible.  Yes the tip is cool and it has a stand and you can control the temp but I feel better letting you know that I would consider this better for adults.&lt;br /&gt;You also would be better off using this on medium to longer hair.  The barrel is really to big for short hair.  The iron itself works great for long lasting curls and waves compared to the older ones and like anything else, if you want quality then you will pay a bit more to get something nice that will last.  I will admit I am a nervous ninny with hot things so don&#x27;t just go buy what one person says.  Read a number of reviews to get the best overall opinion.  It really does pay to do your homework.</li>
            <li> On first glance, I figured this was another regular large barrel iron even though it was the most attractive one I have seen. With the rose gold barrel and pearl-like handle, this curling iron was very nice to look at, and I didn&#x27;t mind displaying it on my counter. The handle tapers so it was more comfortable to hold than other irons that I&#x27;ve used, and I have used ALOT of different irons in the past 20+ years curling my hair. The 30 different settings seemed a bit much, but I guess it gives you more fine-tuning capabilities. My hair is easy to curl, so 15 is what I settled on for everyday use for loose curls and body. Surprisingly, I noticed that my hair was shinier after using the iron! It could be also be that I found the right setting that was not too hot. Still, I liked how my hair behaves with this iron. With little time to get ready in the mornings, I appreciated that it heats up quickly. It also has the indicator light and auto-shut-off that is critical in a heated styling tool. I would certainly recommend this iron to my friends.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Wife.  She&#x27;s always been a Hot Tools gal.  She has one of their flat irons &amp; uses that as a curler too.  Thought I&#x27;d get some brownie points for gifting what I thought was gonna be a gimme.  Turns out that &amp;#34;it takes forever to heat up&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;curls fall right out after using&amp;#34;.  Anyway, not quite dog house material, but definitely didn&#x27;t score me any points either.  I guess if you&#x27;re a guy trying to score points, this ain&#x27;t it</li>
