            <li>the tip is very nice and easy to control.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know why all liquid eyeliner isn&#x27;t made this way.</li>
            <li>Ladies, this eyeliner is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>I was very unsure about this product , but i&#x27;m so glad I took a risk and bought it because I can say its one of the best liquid eye liners I have ever used.</li>
            <li>So I  like this eyeliner because it it so very easy to use</li>
            <li>Love Love the price!</li>
            <li>Well, it dries super quick, which is not a problem if you put it on perfectly.</li>
            <li>My Eyes is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li>This is not paraben free nor is it any good.</li>
            <li>On using this i didnt find it as good as it was made to sound in the reviews.</li>
            <li>so i ordered this because it was a good deal, and alot of the reviews are pretty good</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>Great product, packaged well and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>i liked the eyeliner, it was easy to use and goes on very smooth</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply &amp; clean up!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more for the price, so I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I would love for any one on here with a chemical degree (chemist) to look at the ingredients and tell me, is it a repackaged sharpie?</li>
            <li>A sharpie would&#x27;ve worked better for me.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
            <li>This is officially my favorite liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with the product it self, it was alright.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the look and product</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>i love shany cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Love it--easy to use, stays on-does not flake like others I have tried.</li>
            <li>The tip of it looks just like a magic marker..</li>
            <li>the easiest application i have ever had :)</li>
            <li>IT ALL!, AFTER MORE THAN 4 HOURS OF WORK</li>
            <li>I love that this liquid eye liner is water based since most of the time my eyes are watery.</li>
            <li>Stila has a better formula.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>i thought okay</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>lasted most of the day for me, did have to re-apply in the evening....</li>
            <li>To top it off, I have oily skin since I hit my 30s</li>
            <li>so I just have so many reasons for a liner not working out for me.</li>
            <li>To top all of this off...</li>
            <li>Love this, will be buying again.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS EYE LINER...</li>
            <li>2 MORE</li>
            <li>I WILL BE ORDERING SOME MORE</li>
            <li>YOU WILL LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Okay, Let me tell you about myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love that its more like a pen and not a brush, I have way better control with the pen</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a magic marker for eyes that isn&#x27;t as flexible as the photo provided would lead one to believe.</li>
            <li>I find it cute</li>
            <li>It gives you the precise line that every girl desires!</li>
            <li>and you can make all kinds of cat-eye looks and so much more with this.</li>
            <li>I recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Finally, I have found it - the perfect liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re creative, you can keep the pen from drying out.</li>
            <li>Nice product stays put allday and smooth, however I do wish it was waterproof.</li>
            <li>They said &amp;#34;smudge proof&amp;#34; and they meant it! :)</li>
            <li>Must have a steady hand, this is great for getting close to eyelash line.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner is pretty good</li>
            <li>easy easy easy!</li>
            <li>This eyeliner absolutely is easy to apply to the top or bottome lid of your eye.</li>
            <li>I actually laughed when I got this in the mail because I was certain I had just been bamboozled.</li>
            <li>It is true to its name, it never smudged for me!</li>
            <li>Its as easy marking up your eyes with a fat sharpie pen (not that I ever tried that).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply...</li>
            <li>It smears fairly easily.</li>
            <li>However, it dries out VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can just easily draw a line.</li>
            <li>smudge proof and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>But the Shany mark it eyeliner is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use</li>
            <li>Also, it dries out quickly!</li>
            <li>Avoid putting it on powders unless you&#x27;re going to give it a quick rinse afterwards, or try a bit of Vaseline where the cap snaps on to lock out more air.</li>
            <li>SHANY is so easy to apply that my liner is flawless (especially for women of a certain age).</li>
            <li>This is really the first liquid eyeline makeup that I&#x27;ve ever used, and It is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This pen is great when you want a bigger line on your lids....</li>
            <li>It stays on cleanly for my whole work day like it was just applied and yet washes off so easily with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t great if you are looking for precision wing tips, but is brilliant or everyday basic top lid lining.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>HOW THIS CHEAP EYE LINER WORK</li>
            <li>After a few practice with this eye liner, i started drawing perfect wings in no time!</li>
            <li>Great product for a low price.</li>
            <li>, it is very easy and fun to apply and great for short term wear, or quick application if you are in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is my second order with amazon, the marker is very nice and accentuates the eye, i will go 4 this anytime</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I was excited, but</li>
            <li>I SO LOVE THIS EYE LINER, I WORK IN A KITCHEN WITH HOT WATER, SWEAT, AND VAPOR..</li>
            <li>I was excited ...BUTTTTT.....</li>
            <li>No packaging of its own - net even a sealer around the top.</li>
            <li>Application is super easy and you can create some very pretty looks.  </li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly so you dont have to worry about smearing it like most liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, boldly and it goes on very clean and you can effortlessly draw the cat like lines I love so much which just doesn&#x27;t look right with a gel or pencil liners.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked this eyeliner, but after using it a few times I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I have searched and searched for the true eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge, run or fade.  </li>
            <li>I get irritated skin most of the time and if it&#x27;s not that it has a very glue like feel and</li>
            <li>:) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that to be true at all.</li>
            <li>This is such a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li>this eyeliner does not smudge unless your really trying to take it off doesn&#x27;t flake like most liquid liners its like the pencil but doesn&#x27;t smudge if you accidentally wipe your face like i do when i forget i have eye liner on</li>
            <li>This is awesome eyeliner, normally I&#x27;m a makeup snob, and stick exclusively to MAC eyeliner, but this little marker styled liquid liner is truly fantastic</li>
            <li>The line was precise and the color of black was very nice as well.</li>
            <li>great because its not so liquid like other liners i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy use and no mess!</li>
            <li>This eyeliner&#x27;s shape is great for super sharp lines, if you want a smudgy line you&#x27;ll have to work quickly.</li>
            <li>I love eyeliner and have tried many different liquid liners.</li>
            <li>The good is that its super dark and the fat packaging makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply, it dries fast, doesnt smudge.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eye liner!!!</li>
            <li>The style is different from many liquid eyeliner !</li>
            <li>I will definitely repurchase this, and gift it to many of my friends!</li>
            <li>Application is an absolute breeze, and it looks soooo smooth all day.</li>
            <li>Otherwise totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Bobbi Brown, MAC and Lancome eyeliners (yes, over $100 worth) and none of them work.</li>
            <li>I ordered a different kind this time because of that problem.</li>
            <li>But The eyliner at first was great and was dark</li>
            <li>it is amazing, can apply more or less, thicker line or thinner line depending on preference, I will never buy another liquid liner again!</li>
            <li>I got this eyeliner and thought at first it might be too big, but after using it a few times, I found it to be an excellent eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The tip is just stiff enough to give me the perfect line.</li>
            <li>I am a lil scarced to use this because it looks, feels, smells and even writes exactly like a sharpie</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of liquid eyeliners over the years that I&#x27;ve lost count and</li>
            <li>First of all...</li>
            <li>im pretty upset.</li>
            <li>First, the color went on inconsistently.  </li>
            <li>I will definately be getting more of these in the future!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, and it&#x27;s probably the only liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
            <li>This liquid eye liner really helps me alot!</li>
            <li>However, as an eye contact user, I have found that there are other eyeliners that are more friendly to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will have a much better experience with this eye liner than pencils and brushes, which makes you constantly pull and tug on you eye for exact placement.</li>
            <li>but, it is MUCH easier to use that the \\&quot;old\\&quot; liquid eye liners!</li>
            <li>Thanks SHANY!</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t even see it at first.</li>
            <li>After that, I got a Stila Smudge Stick Waterproof Eyeliner, which was perfect but too expensive</li>
            <li>I love that this is actually like a pen</li>
            <li>The eyeliner was great but its starting to dry out on me</li>
            <li>This eye liner is ok, it goes on easilly but kind of heavilly, and takes forever to dry, and if it isnt dry it comes off very easily, it still comes off when its dry too, but just smudges.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably use it next Halloween (and that&#x27;s the only good thing I can see coming out of it).</li>
            <li>I use it daily and go through one tube every couple months, but for $6.00, that is more then reasonable.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the positive reviews about this product.</li>
            <li>Hard to make a nice thin line with, but awesome for outer thicker line.</li>
            <li>I kept it in a cool dark place, made sure the lid was always secure and it did not dry out.</li>
            <li>This is the first time Ive really &#x27;worn&#x27; liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>t dry out as quickly as most (ex:WnW eyeliners) but</li>
            <li>I think the thinner liquidy ones are harder to apply and take more practice.  </li>
            <li>I could never get the lines straight</li>
            <li>I would absolutely and have already recommended this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>so much I wear it every day, and I&#x27;ve never worn eyeliner like that.</li>
            <li>This dries out really fast and does not allow for anytime to smudge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this product is water based, you can expect that the longevity of wear is not that fantastic, especially if you have watery eyes.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This liner came almost as cheap as the Maybelline Define-A-Line with the same quality</li>
            <li>But nice and black !</li>
            <li>It dries super fast so there&#x27;s no long wait time.</li>
            <li>Your can make it thin or thick and it stay&#x27;s on all day and the best part it washes off easily with just soap and water.</li>
            <li>The marker clearly says LA Girl on the top of the marker, which is not clearly visible in the picture shown here.</li>
            <li>It essentially resembles a marker which is kind of strange, but that&#x27;s what make up is after all - art for your face!</li>
            <li>More like a fine-tip black permanent marker that doesn&#x27;t mark very well.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful with this item because it can screw up easily or put too much than you wanted</li>
            <li>My problem is that my skin is pretty sensitive when it comes to liquid liners.</li>
            <li>Remember as a kid, sometimes you had store those magic markers upside down?</li>
            <li>IT LOOKS LIKE NEW!</li>
            <li>I have used many different kinds of eyeliner and change in b/t liquid and regular.</li>
            <li>It makes a nice thick, even line that dries fast lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The black is very rich..</li>
            <li>and the tip is VERY VERY think and hard to use, out of all the liquid liners ive used this has to be the most dissapointing.</li>
            <li>The felt tip liner is huge and fatter than I expected, but still manageable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, goes on jet black and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>The blackest of black colors and so easy to use-</li>
            <li>the only thing i don&#x27;t really like about this is that it dries out really fast.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it, but the lining does not go on consistently or thick.</li>
            <li>it worked just fine, so i sat down and was applying it.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, well packaged and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Also, I got this a day early!</li>
            <li>Overall, I LOVE this product and will definitely be buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li>Blackest black, dries quickly, and stays on all day!</li>
            <li>I have spent some ridiculous amounts for a great eyeliner and even bought ones that everyone has sworn by and yet, I sit there</li>
            <li>Much like a lot of the other reviewers, I really like this pen, but dislike how fast the pen dries up.  </li>
            <li>If this liquid liner was a rich dark black color I would have gladly given it it 5 stars, but it falls short.</li>
            <li>And it goes on smooth and dark!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly also which is a plus and means you can add other things without waiting a bit.</li>
            <li>I read some of the other reviews saying how quickly this product dries up.</li>
            <li>I like how you are able to intensify the thickness of the line by the angle you apply the liner, but it is just not a dark enough jet black color.  </li>
            <li>You can go heavy or light.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and let&#x27;s me finally make those cat eyes</li>
            <li>Third, it wasn&#x27;t very long-lasting or smudge-proof as the product details state.  </li>
            <li>The one I got has \\&quot;SHANY\\&quot; marked on both its package and the liner body.</li>
            <li>but if so they need to change it ASAP because it looks very unprofessional and just gross..</li>
            <li>The tip is like a marker, which is much easier to handle than those tiny paintbrush types.</li>
            <li>and i love to wear thick eyeliner</li>
            <li>It makes thick lines, or thin depending on you preferences perfect for any look!</li>
            <li>Great for people who have a hard time with liquid eyeliners and make a mess!</li>
            <li>The only thing that caused some dismay is how the product seemed to dry up quickly.</li>
            <li>Great to start at the edge of eye for the cat like line, but when its time to go thin this is not what you want!!</li>
            <li>Am not one bit happy with this :( cant do much now.</li>
            <li>Its super black and doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li>I normally wash off my make up with a facial bar in the shower, but I had to use makeup remover or baby oil to remove all the traces of the liner.  </li>
            <li>I¡¦d say you have about a month to a month and a half worth of workable product.</li>
            <li>I have a good amount of practice with felt eyeliners but this was difficult to put on and definitely did not stay on.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews because usually someone else has already conveyed what I wanted to say pretty well, but I think when it comes to make up you really can&#x27;t read enough reviews since everyone has a different experience most of the time.</li>
            <li>I went from Maybelline define-a-line mechanical eyeliner pencil, and let me tell you, that stuff will smudge, smear, and run like NO OTHER.</li>
            <li>The pricing is just right, the same as a typical drugstore liquiliner, but the quality far surpasses the drugstore brands!</li>
            <li>The felt tip almost seemed dried up and the effect i got was a very light black line.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much on eyeliners that were never going to work.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday from a casual day to a date out night because it last all day long and makes my makeup look beautiful!</li>
            <li>Very black, goes on smooth, stays on for long period&#x27;s of time...</li>
            <li>other than that i really really like it.</li>
            <li>ONLY CON is that i like to do the winged lines which is more difficult to do with this one, but after a few tries &amp; you get used to it, its fine!</li>
            <li>You can make thin or thick lines which is great.</li>
            <li>My original go to was Gel Eyeliner, but unfortunately, as a student, I don&#x27;t have much time to do so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I open the lid, the tip was a little damaged but it didn&#x27;t influence the applying a lot.</li>
            <li>Personally I am a gel eyeliner girl but somewhere down the line I got really into these pen-like eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve raved about it to my friends, and even some who barely wore liner because they had trouble keeping a steady hand.</li>
            <li>There are some good and bad about this product.</li>

            <li> but this creates a more easier way to wear it!</li>
            <li> the tip is very nice and easy to control.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why all liquid eyeliner isn&#x27;t made this way.</li>
            <li> Ladies, this eyeliner is the absolute best.</li>
            <li> I was very unsure about this product , but i&#x27;m so glad I took a risk and bought it because I can say its one of the best liquid eye liners I have ever used.</li>
            <li> So I  like this eyeliner because it it so very easy to use</li>
            <li> Love Love the price!</li>
            <li> Well, it dries super quick, which is not a problem if you put it on perfectly.</li>
            <li> My Eyes is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li> This is not paraben free nor is it any good.</li>
            <li> On using this i didnt find it as good as it was made to sound in the reviews.</li>
            <li> so i ordered this because it was a good deal, and alot of the reviews are pretty good</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> Great product, packaged well and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> i liked the eyeliner, it was easy to use and goes on very smooth</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply &amp; clean up!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more for the price, so I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I would love for any one on here with a chemical degree (chemist) to look at the ingredients and tell me, is it a repackaged sharpie?</li>
            <li> A sharpie would&#x27;ve worked better for me.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
            <li> This is officially my favorite liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with the product it self, it was alright.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the look and product</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> i love shany cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Love it--easy to use, stays on-does not flake like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> The tip of it looks just like a magic marker..</li>
            <li> the easiest application i have ever had :)</li>
            <li> IT ALL!, AFTER MORE THAN 4 HOURS OF WORK</li>
            <li> I love that this liquid eye liner is water based since most of the time my eyes are watery.</li>
            <li> Stila has a better formula.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> i thought okay</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> lasted most of the day for me, did have to re-apply in the evening....</li>
            <li> To top it off, I have oily skin since I hit my 30s</li>
            <li> so I just have so many reasons for a liner not working out for me.</li>
            <li> To top all of this off...</li>
            <li> Love this, will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS EYE LINER...</li>
            <li> 2 MORE</li>
            <li> I WILL BE ORDERING SOME MORE</li>
            <li> YOU WILL LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Okay, Let me tell you about myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love that its more like a pen and not a brush, I have way better control with the pen</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a magic marker for eyes that isn&#x27;t as flexible as the photo provided would lead one to believe.</li>
            <li> I find it cute</li>
            <li> It gives you the precise line that every girl desires!</li>
            <li> and you can make all kinds of cat-eye looks and so much more with this.</li>
            <li> I recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Finally, I have found it - the perfect liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re creative, you can keep the pen from drying out.</li>
            <li> Nice product stays put allday and smooth, however I do wish it was waterproof.</li>
            <li> They said &amp;#34;smudge proof&amp;#34; and they meant it! :)</li>
            <li> Must have a steady hand, this is great for getting close to eyelash line.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This eyeliner is pretty good</li>
            <li> easy easy easy!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner absolutely is easy to apply to the top or bottome lid of your eye.</li>
            <li> I actually laughed when I got this in the mail because I was certain I had just been bamboozled.</li>
            <li> It is true to its name, it never smudged for me!</li>
            <li> Its as easy marking up your eyes with a fat sharpie pen (not that I ever tried that).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply...</li>
            <li> It smears fairly easily.</li>
            <li> However, it dries out VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can just easily draw a line.</li>
            <li> smudge proof and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> But the Shany mark it eyeliner is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use</li>
            <li> Also, it dries out quickly!</li>
            <li> Avoid putting it on powders unless you&#x27;re going to give it a quick rinse afterwards, or try a bit of Vaseline where the cap snaps on to lock out more air.</li>
            <li> SHANY is so easy to apply that my liner is flawless (especially for women of a certain age).</li>
            <li> This is really the first liquid eyeline makeup that I&#x27;ve ever used, and It is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This pen is great when you want a bigger line on your lids....</li>
            <li> It stays on cleanly for my whole work day like it was just applied and yet washes off so easily with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t great if you are looking for precision wing tips, but is brilliant or everyday basic top lid lining.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> HOW THIS CHEAP EYE LINER WORK</li>
            <li> After a few practice with this eye liner, i started drawing perfect wings in no time!</li>
            <li> Great product for a low price.</li>
            <li> , it is very easy and fun to apply and great for short term wear, or quick application if you are in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is my second order with amazon, the marker is very nice and accentuates the eye, i will go 4 this anytime</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was excited, but</li>
            <li> I SO LOVE THIS EYE LINER, I WORK IN A KITCHEN WITH HOT WATER, SWEAT, AND VAPOR..</li>
            <li> I was excited ...BUTTTTT.....</li>
            <li> No packaging of its own - net even a sealer around the top.</li>
            <li> Application is super easy and you can create some very pretty looks.  </li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly so you dont have to worry about smearing it like most liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, boldly and it goes on very clean and you can effortlessly draw the cat like lines I love so much which just doesn&#x27;t look right with a gel or pencil liners.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked this eyeliner, but after using it a few times I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for the true eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge, run or fade.  </li>
            <li> I get irritated skin most of the time and if it&#x27;s not that it has a very glue like feel and</li>
            <li> :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that to be true at all.</li>
            <li> This is such a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner does not smudge unless your really trying to take it off doesn&#x27;t flake like most liquid liners its like the pencil but doesn&#x27;t smudge if you accidentally wipe your face like i do when i forget i have eye liner on</li>
            <li> This is awesome eyeliner, normally I&#x27;m a makeup snob, and stick exclusively to MAC eyeliner, but this little marker styled liquid liner is truly fantastic</li>
            <li> The line was precise and the color of black was very nice as well.</li>
            <li> great because its not so liquid like other liners i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy use and no mess!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner&#x27;s shape is great for super sharp lines, if you want a smudgy line you&#x27;ll have to work quickly.</li>
            <li> I love eyeliner and have tried many different liquid liners.</li>
            <li> The good is that its super dark and the fat packaging makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply, it dries fast, doesnt smudge.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eye liner!!!</li>
            <li> The style is different from many liquid eyeliner !</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase this, and gift it to many of my friends!</li>
            <li> Application is an absolute breeze, and it looks soooo smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Otherwise totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Bobbi Brown, MAC and Lancome eyeliners (yes, over $100 worth) and none of them work.</li>
            <li> I ordered a different kind this time because of that problem.</li>
            <li> But The eyliner at first was great and was dark</li>
            <li> it is amazing, can apply more or less, thicker line or thinner line depending on preference, I will never buy another liquid liner again!</li>
            <li> I got this eyeliner and thought at first it might be too big, but after using it a few times, I found it to be an excellent eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The tip is just stiff enough to give me the perfect line.</li>
            <li> I am a lil scarced to use this because it looks, feels, smells and even writes exactly like a sharpie</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of liquid eyeliners over the years that I&#x27;ve lost count and</li>
            <li> First of all...</li>
            <li> im pretty upset.</li>
            <li> First, the color went on inconsistently.  </li>
            <li> I will definately be getting more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, and it&#x27;s probably the only liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
            <li> This liquid eye liner really helps me alot!</li>
            <li> However, as an eye contact user, I have found that there are other eyeliners that are more friendly to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will have a much better experience with this eye liner than pencils and brushes, which makes you constantly pull and tug on you eye for exact placement.</li>
            <li> but, it is MUCH easier to use that the \\&quot;old\\&quot; liquid eye liners!</li>
            <li> Thanks SHANY!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t even see it at first.</li>
            <li> After that, I got a Stila Smudge Stick Waterproof Eyeliner, which was perfect but too expensive</li>
            <li> I love that this is actually like a pen</li>
            <li> The eyeliner was great but its starting to dry out on me</li>
            <li> This eye liner is ok, it goes on easilly but kind of heavilly, and takes forever to dry, and if it isnt dry it comes off very easily, it still comes off when its dry too, but just smudges.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use it next Halloween (and that&#x27;s the only good thing I can see coming out of it).</li>
            <li> I use it daily and go through one tube every couple months, but for $6.00, that is more then reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the positive reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> Hard to make a nice thin line with, but awesome for outer thicker line.</li>
            <li> I kept it in a cool dark place, made sure the lid was always secure and it did not dry out.</li>
            <li> This is the first time Ive really &#x27;worn&#x27; liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> t dry out as quickly as most (ex:WnW eyeliners) but</li>
            <li> I think the thinner liquidy ones are harder to apply and take more practice.  </li>
            <li> I could never get the lines straight</li>
            <li> I would absolutely and have already recommended this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> so much I wear it every day, and I&#x27;ve never worn eyeliner like that.</li>
            <li> This dries out really fast and does not allow for anytime to smudge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this product is water based, you can expect that the longevity of wear is not that fantastic, especially if you have watery eyes.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This liner came almost as cheap as the Maybelline Define-A-Line with the same quality</li>
            <li> But nice and black !</li>
            <li> It dries super fast so there&#x27;s no long wait time.</li>
            <li> Your can make it thin or thick and it stay&#x27;s on all day and the best part it washes off easily with just soap and water.</li>
            <li> The marker clearly says LA Girl on the top of the marker, which is not clearly visible in the picture shown here.</li>
            <li> It essentially resembles a marker which is kind of strange, but that&#x27;s what make up is after all - art for your face!</li>
            <li> More like a fine-tip black permanent marker that doesn&#x27;t mark very well.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with this item because it can screw up easily or put too much than you wanted</li>
            <li> My problem is that my skin is pretty sensitive when it comes to liquid liners.</li>
            <li> Remember as a kid, sometimes you had store those magic markers upside down?</li>
            <li> IT LOOKS LIKE NEW!</li>
            <li> I have used many different kinds of eyeliner and change in b/t liquid and regular.</li>
            <li> It makes a nice thick, even line that dries fast lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The black is very rich..</li>
            <li> and the tip is VERY VERY think and hard to use, out of all the liquid liners ive used this has to be the most dissapointing.</li>
            <li> The felt tip liner is huge and fatter than I expected, but still manageable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, goes on jet black and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> The blackest of black colors and so easy to use-</li>
            <li> the only thing i don&#x27;t really like about this is that it dries out really fast.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it, but the lining does not go on consistently or thick.</li>
            <li> it worked just fine, so i sat down and was applying it.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, well packaged and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Also, I got this a day early!</li>
            <li> Overall, I LOVE this product and will definitely be buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Blackest black, dries quickly, and stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I have spent some ridiculous amounts for a great eyeliner and even bought ones that everyone has sworn by and yet, I sit there</li>
            <li> Much like a lot of the other reviewers, I really like this pen, but dislike how fast the pen dries up.  </li>
            <li> If this liquid liner was a rich dark black color I would have gladly given it it 5 stars, but it falls short.</li>
            <li> And it goes on smooth and dark!</li>
            <li> It dries quickly also which is a plus and means you can add other things without waiting a bit.</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews saying how quickly this product dries up.</li>
            <li> I like how you are able to intensify the thickness of the line by the angle you apply the liner, but it is just not a dark enough jet black color.  </li>
            <li> You can go heavy or light.  </li>
            <li> It works really well and let&#x27;s me finally make those cat eyes</li>
            <li> Third, it wasn&#x27;t very long-lasting or smudge-proof as the product details state.  </li>
            <li> The one I got has \\&quot;SHANY\\&quot; marked on both its package and the liner body.</li>
            <li> but if so they need to change it ASAP because it looks very unprofessional and just gross..</li>
            <li> The tip is like a marker, which is much easier to handle than those tiny paintbrush types.</li>
            <li> and i love to wear thick eyeliner</li>
            <li> It makes thick lines, or thin depending on you preferences perfect for any look!</li>
            <li> Great for people who have a hard time with liquid eyeliners and make a mess!</li>
            <li> The only thing that caused some dismay is how the product seemed to dry up quickly.</li>
            <li> Great to start at the edge of eye for the cat like line, but when its time to go thin this is not what you want!!</li>
            <li> Am not one bit happy with this :( cant do much now.</li>
            <li> Its super black and doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> I normally wash off my make up with a facial bar in the shower, but I had to use makeup remover or baby oil to remove all the traces of the liner.  </li>
            <li> I¡¦d say you have about a month to a month and a half worth of workable product.</li>
            <li> I have a good amount of practice with felt eyeliners but this was difficult to put on and definitely did not stay on.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews because usually someone else has already conveyed what I wanted to say pretty well, but I think when it comes to make up you really can&#x27;t read enough reviews since everyone has a different experience most of the time.</li>
            <li> I went from Maybelline define-a-line mechanical eyeliner pencil, and let me tell you, that stuff will smudge, smear, and run like NO OTHER.</li>
            <li> The pricing is just right, the same as a typical drugstore liquiliner, but the quality far surpasses the drugstore brands!</li>
            <li> The felt tip almost seemed dried up and the effect i got was a very light black line.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much on eyeliners that were never going to work.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday from a casual day to a date out night because it last all day long and makes my makeup look beautiful!</li>
            <li> Very black, goes on smooth, stays on for long period&#x27;s of time...</li>
            <li> other than that i really really like it.</li>
            <li> ONLY CON is that i like to do the winged lines which is more difficult to do with this one, but after a few tries &amp; you get used to it, its fine!</li>
            <li> You can make thin or thick lines which is great.</li>
            <li> My original go to was Gel Eyeliner, but unfortunately, as a student, I don&#x27;t have much time to do so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I open the lid, the tip was a little damaged but it didn&#x27;t influence the applying a lot.</li>
            <li> Personally I am a gel eyeliner girl but somewhere down the line I got really into these pen-like eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve raved about it to my friends, and even some who barely wore liner because they had trouble keeping a steady hand.</li>
            <li> There are some good and bad about this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sweet time in drying, this can be rectified but powdering it with a little black eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and can make very thick or very thin lines quite easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been scared of liquid eyeliner due to some early disasters in my makeup wearing career.  </li>
            <li> This is a major disappointment since all other Shany products I have bought for my wife have been amazing.</li>
            <li> Although the pen applicator feels a bit awkward, like you&#x27;re using a permanent marker, it makes application very easy.</li>
            <li> Second, it didn&#x27;t dry very fast, so it was hard to not have it smear.  </li>
            <li> The tube also doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the awkwardness of holding a marker to your eyelid, then this is a decent product.  </li>
            <li> i have thought about cutting the tip off to try to get  more of a point</li>
            <li> Most gals are afraid of liquid eye liners, perfering to use pencils and brushes to thicken their eye rim.</li>
            <li> Over the many years of using eyeliners it has always been quite a disappointment..</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long with no smearing or smudging.</li>
            <li> anyway, those didn;t stay pointy for long.</li>
            <li> Definitely store it standing up so that the tip stays wet.</li>
            <li> I did get lasting intensive thin lines on the first day of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently tried dipping it in other liquid eyeliner bottles to take advantage of the fat pen and brush tip.  </li>
            <li> I always have a hard time keeping my hands steady when putting on eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Basically if you have a hard time steadying those thin liquid liner brushes than you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> and it went dry.</li>
            <li> I loved it, but alas also TOO EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for people who like heavy black eyeliner....</li>
            <li> Also i didn&#x27;t like how it was just loose rolling around in a box</li>
            <li> The black is a deep shade, not faded at all.</li>
            <li> My MAC eyeliner even appeared like glue across my lids so my male co-worker said \\&quot;You&#x27;ve got black goo all over your eyes.\\</li>
            <li> This is comparable to the Stila liquid liner but the difference is this one doesnt last as long and the pen dried out faster.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work out, it&#x27;s just $5 which is much less than even the liners you can buy at Target and such places.</li>
            <li> This is not a permanent marker, it is a wide eyeliner.</li>
            <li> it wasnt what i expected it does not say SHANY any where on the product</li>
            <li> but I also store it upside down so that the tip doesn&#x27;t have the opportunity to dry out.</li>
            <li> After a month this eyeliner dried out and the tip went flat.</li>
            <li> It is smudge proof and long lasting as it states (maybe that is why it is hard to remove).  </li>
            <li> It made me extremely nervous to try it on because It basically looked like a used Sharpie..</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I did not have the problem with it drying out as other people have mentioned..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars due to packaging.</li>
            <li> Other than that it didn&#x27;t smudge when used</li>
            <li> The pen is dry after 2 uses!!!  </li>
            <li> Goes on dark</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only negative thing.</li>
            <li> It was such a thick line</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick body and simple swipes of the hand.</li>
            <li> I would recommend storing it upside down so that you get maximum coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stored it upside down and snapped shut.  </li>
            <li> So, I recommend keeping the pen upside down when not in use.</li>
            <li> i shook it and now its upside down, but if i go to swatch it</li>
            <li> I tried shaking and storing it upside down</li>
            <li> I keep it upside down</li>
            <li> It dries out and only produces feint thick lines even if I close the lid tight and keep the tip down.</li>
            <li> If you store upside down or slightly tilted, you will not have a problem.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the felt tip can sometimes become dried out.</li>
            <li> It is like a black mark,  </li>
            <li> it probably took like a week to come or less.</li>
            <li> it smears off and leaves you looking black underyour eyes ..</li>
            <li> Then, I came across Shany&#x27;s Mark it Black Liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need a good liner as a base for my false lashes.</li>
            <li> and I always just ended up making a mess all over my face.</li>
            <li> It comes out very dark black, and I have no need to go over it again.</li>
            <li> so I am a little terrified...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> and I am going to stock up on a few of these because with how my luck always is...</li>
            <li> For example, when you write with a marker, some letters might be uneven and thicker than others.</li>
            <li> Liner themselves lasted about a month with everyday wear (once a day)</li>
            <li> Just like another reviewer said it is a MARKER!!!!I was hoping for a tip that bent with the motion you moved it, but just like a marker it was a stiff end.</li>
            <li> Also, the tip got very dull long before it was out of liquid.</li>
            <li> The color itself is very black and does NOT smear.</li>
            <li> I have a horrible time controlling liquid eyeliners but this one is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Using this eyeliner very much felt like drawing on something with sharpie, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a matter of angles and pressure to get a thin line, and there&#x27;s no problem doing a thick line either.</li>
            <li> but this was just a total fail.</li>
            <li> &gt;.&gt;</li>
            <li> but i usually screw it up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way past the delivery date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is how the company distributes this item</li>
            <li> I bought mine this past july</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t dried out since I put the cap on correctly (duh)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I got a bad product out of all they had, I remember it took a long long time to even get this</li>
            <li> but it does have a pretty thick base.  </li>
            <li> cause it was hard for me</li>
            <li> Or at least it changed the way I use eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing lately.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re an eyeliner fanatic like me</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a thick marker like applicator then this is the eyeliner for you.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, marker felt tip type applicator.</li>
            <li> Thin, thick, winged out, or subtle -</li>
            <li> You can make your line as thin or thick as you want</li>
            <li> The tip is thick so its easier to use!</li>
            <li> When I received it, the tip was broken and fell out of the liner itself.</li>
            <li> This is no good, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> YOU WONT BE SORRY</li>
            <li> This smudges and is difficult to remove or correct when smudged.</li>
            <li> I am unable to find it again on amazon..</li>
            <li> you can draw as thin a line as your heart desires!</li>
            <li> I found this eyeliner on Amazon and saw all the bad reviews about it, but I decided to go for it and try it out.</li>
            <li> disappointed 2 hours after I had applied it and gone out.     </li>
            <li> I use to hate wearing liquid eyeliners</li>
            <li> The way it is shaped is terrible and makes that impossible.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was very wrong!!!</li>
            <li> and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner does not stay on and it has awful packaging.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to reapply color to a brush or used a dreadful eye liner pencil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This eyeliner pen is one of the best makeup items I&#x27;ve ever bought. Certainly a good investment!!! Application is an absolute breeze, and it looks soooo smooth all day. It dries pretty quickly so you dont have to worry about smearing it like most liquid eyeliners. I would recommend storing it upside down so that you get maximum coverage.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS EYELINER! it is amazing, can apply more or less, thicker line or thinner line depending on preference, I will never buy another liquid liner again! ONLY CON is that i like to do the winged lines which is more difficult to do with this one, but after a few tries &amp; you get used to it, its fine!</li>
            <li> Much like a lot of the other reviewers, I really like this pen, but dislike how fast the pen dries up.  I was hoping for more for the price, so I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> So I  like this eyeliner because it it so very easy to use and I have tried tons and tons of liquid liner the issue - sharpie?  because I am almost certain someone took the packaging off a plain ole sharpie and viola fancy eyeliner.. I am a lil scarced to use this because it looks, feels, smells and even writes exactly like a sharpie so I am a little terrified... I actually laughed when I got this in the mail because I was certain I had just been bamboozled. I would love for any one on here with a chemical degree (chemist) to look at the ingredients and tell me, is it a repackaged sharpie?</li>
            <li> A sharpie would&#x27;ve worked better for me.  The pen is dry after 2 uses!!!  I&#x27;ve stored it upside down and snapped shut.  I&#x27;ve recently tried dipping it in other liquid eyeliner bottles to take advantage of the fat pen and brush tip.  After reading the reviews, I was excited, but no....just no.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of liquid eyeliners over the years that I&#x27;ve lost count and Mark My Eyes is by far one of the best. The black is a deep shade, not faded at all. Although the pen applicator feels a bit awkward, like you&#x27;re using a permanent marker, it makes application very easy. The only complaint I have is that the felt tip can sometimes become dried out. So, I recommend keeping the pen upside down when not in use.</li>
            <li> This is not Shany. It is like a black mark,  I haven&#x27;t use it yet. i hope will be great!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply &amp; clean up! I just wish it was a tad darker. Best eye marker i&#x27;ve owned, though!</li>
            <li> This eye liner is ok, it goes on easilly but kind of heavilly, and takes forever to dry, and if it isnt dry it comes off very easily, it still comes off when its dry too, but just smudges.  not the best use of my/anyones money.</li>
            <li> First of all... The felt tip liner is huge and fatter than I expected, but still manageable.  When I received it, the tip was broken and fell out of the liner itself. Terrible.  But I shoved it back in... Let&#x27;s hope it works!  For the quality, it could have been WAY cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good.  It reminds me of a sharpy with a pointier tip but it does have a pretty thick base.  Its easy to apply, it dries fast, doesnt smudge.  You can go heavy or light.  This is the first time Ive really &#x27;worn&#x27; liquid eyeliner and Im very pleased.  I think the thinner liquidy ones are harder to apply and take more practice.  I would definitely buy this again!    Also, I got this a day early!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is pretty good but I&#x27;ve used better. It doesn&#x27;t smudge, but it will fade away after a while. The tube also doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This is officially my favorite liquid eyeliner. It&#x27;s only a matter of angles and pressure to get a thin line, and there&#x27;s no problem doing a thick line either. The color itself is very black and does NOT smear. It dries super fast so there&#x27;s no long wait time. Overall, I LOVE this product and will definitely be buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> In fact it was the brand &#x27;L.A. girl&#x27;. I&#x27;m okay with the product it self, it was alright. But the brand was not as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is awesome eyeliner, normally I&#x27;m a makeup snob, and stick exclusively to MAC eyeliner, but this little marker styled liquid liner is truly fantastic, it goes on well, it stays on well, although it does as stated take it&#x27;s sweet time in drying, this can be rectified but powdering it with a little black eyeshadow.  For the price, this is truly an impressive eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It works really well and let&#x27;s me finally make those cat eyes I&#x27;ve always wanted to make. It dries quickly also which is a plus and means you can add other things without waiting a bit. I didn&#x27;t give it a perfect because there was a learning curve of about 5-10 minutes to make sure you have a handle at it. Otherwise totally worth the cost. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great to start at the edge of eye for the cat like line, but when its time to go thin this is not what you want!! Hard to make a nice thin line with, but awesome for outer thicker line.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why all liquid eyeliner isn&#x27;t made this way. This product is wonderful. I have wasted so much money to try and get that \\&quot;liquid eyeliner\\&quot; look but I could never apply correctly - I could never get the lines straight and I always just ended up making a mess all over my face. Not anymore! I have purchased two of these. Its as easy marking up your eyes with a fat sharpie pen (not that I ever tried that). It looks really great - I have received numerous compliments. Every woman&#x27;s MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for the true eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge, run or fade.  This eyeliner absolutely is easy to apply to the top or bottome lid of your eye. Your can make it thin or thick and it stay&#x27;s on all day and the best part it washes off easily with just soap and water. I would absolutely and have already recommended this to everyone I know. Would make an excellent christmas  stocking stuffer for those you love.    thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Bobbi Brown, MAC and Lancome eyeliners (yes, over $100 worth) and none of them work. They all turn to grease by noon of each day. I look like \\&quot;Rita the Raccoon\\&quot; by lunch. My MAC eyeliner even appeared like glue across my lids so my male co-worker said \\&quot;You&#x27;ve got black goo all over your eyes.\\&quot; I checked the mirror and was mortified. I ordered SHANY waterproof liner and my issues went away. I love the look and product so much I wear it every day, and I&#x27;ve never worn eyeliner like that. You should order two for the price. I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much on eyeliners that were never going to work. SHANY is so easy to apply that my liner is flawless (especially for women of a certain age). I&#x27;m getting lots of compliments about my eye make-up and the only thing different is the SHANY waterproof eyeliner. I don&#x27;t know what I would do if it is ever discontinued. Ladies, this eyeliner is the absolute best. I dare you to try it and review it differently.</li>
            <li> okay so i ordered this because it was a good deal, and alot of the reviews are pretty good, so i got my package about 10 minutes ago, and i open it up and i went thru all the makeup i had purchased, and when i got to this i opened it up, and i swached it on the back of my hand and it worked just fine, so i sat down and was applying it. and it went dry. i didnt even get to do 1 eye! i shook it and now its upside down, but if i go to swatch it nothing comes out. im pretty upset. and the tip is VERY VERY think and hard to use, out of all the liquid liners ive used this has to be the most dissapointing. i love shany cosmetics. but this was just a total fail. i might return it. but i think im just going to throw it in the garbage. &gt;.&gt; beware of this eyeliner</li>
            <li> This is not a permanent marker, it is a wide eyeliner. I often have allergic reactions to make-up, but not this time. Love it--easy to use, stays on-does not flake like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner changed my life. Or at least it changed the way I use eyeliner. It is so wonderful. You should buy it.</li>
            <li> The marker clearly says LA Girl on the top of the marker, which is not clearly visible in the picture shown here.</li>
            <li> There were several things that I did not like about this eyeliner.  First, the color went on inconsistently.  Second, it didn&#x27;t dry very fast, so it was hard to not have it smear.  Third, it wasn&#x27;t very long-lasting or smudge-proof as the product details state.  I would not recommend this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The SHANY Liquid Liner looses a couple stars for me.  I like how you are able to intensify the thickness of the line by the angle you apply the liner, but it is just not a dark enough jet black color.  Goes on dark but once it dries it lightens up.  The \\&quot;fatness\\&quot;f the pen does make it easier to hold and control.  I had some issues when trying to wash it off.  Even though it states it is water-based, it does not come off simply with soap and water.  I normally wash off my make up with a facial bar in the shower, but I had to use makeup remover or baby oil to remove all the traces of the liner.  It is smudge proof and long lasting as it states (maybe that is why it is hard to remove).  If this liquid liner was a rich dark black color I would have gladly given it it 5 stars, but it falls short.</li>
            <li> I have bought plenty of eye liners, and plenty of liquid eye liners and I have NEVER found anything like this! You can make your line as thin or thick as you want and it&#x27;s so easy to hold in your hand. I will definately be getting more of these in the future! I highly recommend this eye liner!!! And it goes on smooth and dark! I love it!</li>
            <li> I find this eye liner very easy to use and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is really the first liquid eyeline makeup that I&#x27;ve ever used, and It is AMAZING! It is so easy to apply... The tip of it looks just like a magic marker.. It lasts all day long with no smearing or smudging. The black is very rich.. I love this eyeliner, and it&#x27;s probably the only liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
            <li> The one I got has \\&quot;SHANY\\&quot; marked on both its package and the liner body. The first time I open the lid, the tip was a little damaged but it didn&#x27;t influence the applying a lot. I did get lasting intensive thin lines on the first day of using it. But this is all. It dries out and only produces feint thick lines even if I close the lid tight and keep the tip down.</li>
            <li> I found this eyeliner on Amazon and saw all the bad reviews about it, but I decided to go for it and try it out. I was very wrong!!! Just like another reviewer said it is a MARKER!!!!I was hoping for a tip that bent with the motion you moved it, but just like a marker it was a stiff end. I did one eye and it was horrible. It was such a thick line it looked costume like. Beware of this product! But if you&#x27;re looking for a thick marker like applicator then this is the eyeliner for you. I&#x27;ll probably use it next Halloween (and that&#x27;s the only good thing I can see coming out of it).</li>
            <li> i liked the eyeliner, it was easy to use and goes on very smooth but..... It smears fairly easily. i found myself taking it along with me for touch ups through out the day. Also, the tip got very dull long before it was out of liquid. i have thought about cutting the tip off to try to get  more of a point but i&#x27;m worried that would just ruin it further. I ordered a different kind this time because of that problem.</li>
            <li> This is not paraben free nor is it any good. I wore it to work and about an hour later it was already smudging. It smells just like a sharpie which just adds to it&#x27;s flaws. This is no good, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been scared of liquid eyeliner due to some early disasters in my makeup wearing career.  This eyeliner has cured me of those fears.  It&#x27;s so easy to use, goes on jet black and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> For those with monolids, reconsider!!!! This dries out really fast and does not allow for anytime to smudge. It is almost impossibleto use and look good. DO NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I have used many different kinds of eyeliner and change in b/t liquid and regular. I like liquid but i usually screw it up so i tend to stick with pencil. This stuff makes it easy!!! Its like combining the 2..the easiest application i have ever had :)</li>
            <li> I havent recieve this product. It&#x27;s way past the delivery date and i tried trackingthe package but there is no news of this product ever since May 22. This product went all over the place. I don&#x27;t know whats going on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. This eyeliner does not stay on and it has awful packaging. It made me extremely nervous to try it on because It basically looked like a used Sharpie.. NO JOKE! I&#x27;m not sure if this is how the company distributes this item but if so they need to change it ASAP because it looks very unprofessional and just gross.. I will not be buying this item again.</li>
            <li> I SO LOVE THIS EYE LINER, I WORK IN A KITCHEN WITH HOT WATER, SWEAT, AND VAPOR.. THIS EYE LINER RESIT IT ALL!, AFTER MORE THAN 4 HOURS OF WORK IT LOOKS LIKE NEW!, IS JUST PERFECT!!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product yet, you must! This is my favorite liquid eyeliner! I use this everyday from a casual day to a date out night because it last all day long and makes my makeup look beautiful! I love that this liquid eye liner is water based since most of the time my eyes are watery. This liquid eye liner really helps me alot! My favorite!!</li>
            <li> Personally I am a gel eyeliner girl but somewhere down the line I got really into these pen-like eyeliners. There are some good and bad about this product. The good is that its super dark and the fat packaging makes it easy to hold. The only con is that it dies out ¼ It doesn¡¦t dry out as quickly as most (ex:WnW eyeliners) but you can¡¦t leave it in your collection for months. I¡¦d say you have about a month to a month and a half worth of workable product. If pen eyeliners are your thing, I recommend giving it a try because of its price and application.</li>
            <li> This is comparable to the Stila liquid liner but the difference is this one doesnt last as long and the pen dried out faster. Stila has a better formula.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner. I have a horrible time controlling liquid eyeliners but this one is very easy to use. It essentially resembles a marker which is kind of strange, but that&#x27;s what make up is after all - art for your face!</li>
            <li> If you can get past the awkwardness of holding a marker to your eyelid, then this is a decent product.  It is made in Germany, and is at a great price for its quality.  However, as an eye contact user, I have found that there are other eyeliners that are more friendly to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product is water based, you can expect that the longevity of wear is not that fantastic, especially if you have watery eyes.  It will smudge and smear in the corners of your eyes.  Other than that, it is very easy and fun to apply and great for short term wear, or quick application if you are in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I ordered it through Amazon and received it quickly and in perfect condition.  I kept it in a cool dark place, made sure the lid was always secure and it did not dry out.</li>
            <li> I got this eyeliner and thought at first it might be too big, but after using it a few times, I found it to be an excellent eyeliner. I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, well packaged and long lasting.  I did not have the problem with it drying out as other people have mentioned.. but I also store it upside down so that the tip doesn&#x27;t have the opportunity to dry out.</li>
            <li> Initially I loved this product and wrote a glowing review.  Application is super easy and you can create some very pretty looks.  However, it dries out VERY quickly.  I would not recommend purchasing this product because of the short shelf life.</li>
            <li> Most gals are afraid of liquid eye liners, perfering to use pencils and brushes to thicken their eye rim. Gel liners are GREAT and I use them a lot because of the ease of application, however, the SHANY Mark liquid eye liner gives you more control with it&#x27;s thick body and simple swipes of the hand. You will have a much better experience with this eye liner than pencils and brushes, which makes you constantly pull and tug on you eye for exact placement. No this isn&#x27;t a gel but, it is MUCH easier to use that the \\&quot;old\\&quot; liquid eye liners! Believe me! Thanks SHANY!</li>
            <li> More like a fine-tip black permanent marker that doesn&#x27;t mark very well. It has a felt ink cartridge floating in it when you shake it, ergo, NOT liquid as advertised. Will not purchase again and definitely will not be recommending to anyone. This is a major disappointment since all other Shany products I have bought for my wife have been amazing.</li>
            <li> Liquid eye liner is a must for me so when i seen everyones reviews i thought i would give it a try.  well when i finally got it... it probably took like a week to come or less. I was excited ...BUTTTTT..... it wasnt what i expected it does not say SHANY any where on the product it says LA GIRL....buttt.. since i needed eye liner since mine had ran out i thought okay i will try it.. well i gave it ONE star because it does apply on good... HOWEVErrr....it DOESNT stay on .. it smears off and leaves you looking black underyour eyes .. i didnt like it and have not used it since... waist of my money!!!!</li>
            <li> This product only works okay. I really wanted to love it, but the lining does not go on consistently or thick. When I go over the line again, it continues to get lighter and lighter. Additionally, after a month or so this liner started to smell like dirt.</li>
            <li> This pen is great when you want a bigger line on your lids....lasted most of the day for me, did have to re-apply in the evening....just on the outer corners....great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Must have a steady hand, this is great for getting close to eyelash line.  I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars due to packaging. It was rolling around in a box with another product.  I almost missed it. No packaging of its own - net even a sealer around the top. None whatsoever. Looked like it was just thrown in the box from someone&#x27;s purse.  Reluctant to use it, but did anyway after trying to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; it just in case...</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the positive reviews about this product. On using this i didnt find it as good as it was made to sound in the reviews. The felt tip almost seemed dried up and the effect i got was a very light black line. I tried shaking and storing it upside down but it still gives the same output. I&#x27;l stick to known brands in future. maybe what i received was a defective piece. Am not one bit happy with this :( cant do much now.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner was great but its starting to dry out on me and ive only had it for a week. Also i didn&#x27;t like how it was just loose rolling around in a box i didn&#x27;t even see it at first. But The eyliner at first was great and was dark and i love to wear thick eyeliner and this helps me alot when doing that.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews because usually someone else has already conveyed what I wanted to say pretty well, but I think when it comes to make up you really can&#x27;t read enough reviews since everyone has a different experience most of the time. Over the many years of using eyeliners it has always been quite a disappointment.. I have spent some ridiculous amounts for a great eyeliner and even bought ones that everyone has sworn by and yet, I sit there disappointed 2 hours after I had applied it and gone out.     My problem is that my skin is pretty sensitive when it comes to liquid liners. I get irritated skin most of the time and if it&#x27;s not that it has a very glue like feel and every time I blink, you FEEL the liquid liner..eww. To top it off, I have oily skin since I hit my 30s so I just have so many reasons for a liner not working out for me. But this SHANY liner is a godsent! It goes on smoothly, boldly and it goes on very clean and you can effortlessly draw the cat like lines I love so much which just doesn&#x27;t look right with a gel or pencil liners. It stays on cleanly for my whole work day like it was just applied and yet washes off so easily with soap and warm water. To top all of this off... this liner only cost me $5!!! I just can&#x27;t believe it and I am going to stock up on a few of these because with how my luck always is... my favorite makeup always disappears off the market!    If you have had similar problems as me, I suggest you buy this product. If it doesn&#x27;t work out, it&#x27;s just $5 which is much less than even the liners you can buy at Target and such places.</li>
            <li> I love eyeliner and have tried many different liquid liners. I was really excited about it when I ordered this because I thought it would be perfect. Well, it dries super quick, which is not a problem if you put it on perfectly. The way it is shaped is terrible and makes that impossible. For example, when you write with a marker, some letters might be uneven and thicker than others. That is what your eyelid will look like. Also, it dries out quickly! After using it three times, I noticed it was drying out, and had to throw it away. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, marker felt tip type applicator. It makes a nice thick, even line that dries fast lasts all day. It isn&#x27;t great if you are looking for precision wing tips, but is brilliant or everyday basic top lid lining. I use it daily and go through one tube every couple months, but for $6.00, that is more then reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye liner a couple of times since I&#x27;ve received it. It&#x27;s fantastic. I keep it upside down so it&#x27;s ready to use. It goes on smooth. I don&#x27;t have to reapply color to a brush or used a dreadful eye liner pencil. I can just easily draw a line. It comes out very dark black, and I have no need to go over it again. It makes my eyes dramatically pop. The tip has stayed pointed which is great for the cat eye look I&#x27;ve been doing lately. Love this, will be buying again.</li>
            <li> OH GOD I LOVE THIS EYE LINER...ITS THE BEST LIQUID EYE LINER YOU WILL FIND PLEASE BUY IT YOU WILL BE AMAZE HOW THIS CHEAP EYE LINER WORK I ORDER ONE TO JUST TEST IT OUT THE NEXT DAY I ORDER 2 MORE I WILL BE ORDERING SOME MORE SOON THIS IS THE BEST LIQUID EYE LINER YOU WONT BE SORRY IF YOU PURCHASE THIS ITEM TRUST ME YOU WILL LOVE LOVE LOVE IT IT DOESN&#x27;T FADES LAST ALL DAY FOR ME I ALWAYS APPLY AN EYE SHADOW PRIMER ALL OVER MY EYES BEFORE I APPLY MY SHANY LIQUID EYE LINER AND SOME PEOPLE SAID IT&#x27;S LIKE A SHARPIE NO ITS NOT TRUST ME....5 STARS</li>
            <li> One of my favorite liquid eyeliners! Easy to use! After a few practice with this eye liner, i started drawing perfect wings in no time! :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great for people who have a hard time with liquid eyeliners and make a mess! The tip is thick so its easier to use!</li>
            <li> Okay, Let me tell you about myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a definite eyeliner type of girl. My original go to was Gel Eyeliner, but unfortunately, as a student, I don&#x27;t have much time to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Gel/Cream Eyeliner was a no go, I went to mechanical eyeliner pencils. I went from Maybelline define-a-line mechanical eyeliner pencil, and let me tell you, that stuff will smudge, smear, and run like NO OTHER. After that, I got a Stila Smudge Stick Waterproof Eyeliner, which was perfect but too expensive and I ran out with in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner. I loved it, but alas also TOO EXPENSIVE. Then, I came across Shany&#x27;s Mark it Black Liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liner came almost as cheap as the Maybelline Define-A-Line with the same quality as the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re an eyeliner fanatic like me, this is a must buy if you want affordable and quality products.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. The tip is like a marker, which is much easier to handle than those tiny paintbrush types. I bought mine this past july and it hasn&#x27;t dried out since I put the cap on correctly (duh) Basically if you have a hard time steadying those thin liquid liner brushes than you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked this eyeliner, but after using it a few times I LOVE IT! The tip is just stiff enough to give me the perfect line. I love that its more like a pen and not a brush, I have way better control with the pen and I just love it. Its super black and doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> smudge proof and easy to put on. great because its not so liquid like other liners i&#x27;ve used. its like a marker! easy easy easy! don&#x27;t know how else to say it. you know that feeling when you do your liner perfect, yeah ladies this is the liner you need!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a magic marker for eyes that isn&#x27;t as flexible as the photo provided would lead one to believe. I must return it. I need a good liner as a base for my false lashes. This smudges and is difficult to remove or correct when smudged. I will stick with liquid liner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people are saying its just like a sharpie.. because its not! I have used gel liner, pencil liner, and liquid liner and i have been looking for a liner felt tip pencil like this one - that would actually stay on all day! &amp; it does!</li>
            <li> i am very pleased with this product this is my second order with amazon, the marker is very nice and accentuates the eye, i will go 4 this anytime</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews saying how quickly this product dries up. I didn&#x27;t find that to be true at all. Think of this as a marker for your eyes. Remember as a kid, sometimes you had store those magic markers upside down? Same thing goes here. If you store upside down or slightly tilted, you will not have a problem. It is easy to hold and can make very thick or very thin lines quite easily. I don&#x27;t have issues with smudge and it doesn&#x27;t take 2 years to wash it off of my eyes at night! I say yes: you should buy this!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner works great!... Very black, goes on smooth, stays on for long period&#x27;s of time... Highly recommend for people who like heavy black eyeliner....</li>
            <li> After a month this eyeliner dried out and the tip went flat. It worked great for about 2 weeks. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Nibs (is that the word for the tip of the liner?) anyway, those didn;t stay pointy for long. Liner themselves lasted about a month with everyday wear (once a day)</li>
            <li> The style is different from many liquid eyeliner ! I find it cute, it&#x27;s like a pen. Definitely will purchase and try it out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It gives you the precise line that every girl desires! I am unable to find it again on amazon.. That&#x27;s the only negative thing. Great product for a low price. I hope to find it again in the future!</li>
            <li> I was very unsure about this product , but i&#x27;m so glad I took a risk and bought it because I can say its one of the best liquid eye liners I have ever used. I use to hate wearing liquid eyeliners cause it was hard for me and i wasn&#x27;t used to it. But the Shany mark it eyeliner is so easy to use. the tip is very nice and easy to control. the only thing i don&#x27;t really like about this is that it dries out really fast. other than that i really really like it.</li>
            <li> Did not stay well on eyes. I have a good amount of practice with felt eyeliners but this was difficult to put on and definitely did not stay on.</li>
            <li> This is such a good eyeliner. Its easy to use and you can make all kinds of cat-eye looks and so much more with this. I recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Finally, I have found it - the perfect liquid eyeliner! Thin, thick, winged out, or subtle - this eyeliner can do it all. Blackest black, dries quickly, and stays on all day! Definitely store it standing up so that the tip stays wet. I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly impressed with this liner. Its easy to grip and perfect for creating all sorts of liner looks. It is true to its name, it never smudged for me! The pricing is just right, the same as a typical drugstore liquiliner, but the quality far surpasses the drugstore brands! I&#x27;ve raved about it to my friends, and even some who barely wore liner because they had trouble keeping a steady hand. The line was precise and the color of black was very nice as well. I will definitely repurchase this, and gift it to many of my friends! Thank you Shany, you&#x27;ve hit the target with this incredible liner!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner&#x27;s shape is great for super sharp lines, if you want a smudgy line you&#x27;ll have to work quickly. If you&#x27;re creative, you can keep the pen from drying out. Avoid putting it on powders unless you&#x27;re going to give it a quick rinse afterwards, or try a bit of Vaseline where the cap snaps on to lock out more air.</li>
            <li> The blackest of black colors and so easy to use- you can draw as thin a line as your heart desires! I love that this is actually like a pen and you don&#x27;t need to sharpen it!!! The tip never gets blunt!!!</li>
            <li> This eye liner marker has a fat tip, but it lasts and looks great. It is also very easy use and no mess!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner has wonderful application! I always have a hard time keeping my hands steady when putting on eyeliner. This is great and it fits very nicely in your hands. I know a lot of my friends can&#x27;t wear liquid but this creates a more easier way to wear it! Love Love the price!</li>
            <li> I did not have a very good report for this one. It might of been I got a bad product out of all they had, I remember it took a long long time to even get this and when I d id it wasent anything like what it said</li>
            <li> Nice product stays put allday and smooth, however I do wish it was waterproof.You can make thin or thick lines which is great. I would buy this product anyday verses e.l.f. liquid liner which comes off like plastic after it dies. But nice and black !</li>
            <li> this eyeliner does not smudge unless your really trying to take it off doesn&#x27;t flake like most liquid liners its like the pencil but doesn&#x27;t smudge if you accidentally wipe your face like i do when i forget i have eye liner on so i recommend anyone who is thinking about this product</li>
            <li> Great product, packaged well and shipped very fast. People have been asking me who is my makeup by and lots of ppl are unfamiliar with SHANY! I will be a repeat customer! They said &amp;#34;smudge proof&amp;#34; and they meant it! :)</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with this item because it can screw up easily or put too much than you wanted and then you have to redo it all.</li>
            <li> Liquid eyeliner is always the hardest to put on. Shany&#x27;s is a lot like a marker! It makes thick lines, or thin depending on you preferences perfect for any look!</li>
            <li> Using this eyeliner very much felt like drawing on something with sharpie, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing. I had a lot of ease drawing on designs because of it&#x27;s pen-like design. The only thing that caused some dismay is how the product seemed to dry up quickly. Other than that it didn&#x27;t smudge when used but you needed to reapply it after a while because it just sort of faded away as the day went on.</li>
