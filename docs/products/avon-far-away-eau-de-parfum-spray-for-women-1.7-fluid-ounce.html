            <li>I have worn Far Away for so many years.  </li>

            <li>I love this smell it last all day</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted.  </li>

            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Still to this day I get more compliments wearing this fragrance than any other.</li>
            <li>It wears off quickly, other Avon perfumes smell way better.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to have pay high price for high quality.  </li>
            <li>timeless scent, highly requested.</li>
            <li>It came in a good box, but when I opened up to check the bottle, it was more than slightly worn and dusty.  </li>
            <li>The perfume came at the expected time and while the perfume box was a little crushed on one corner the perfume bottle was in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>It is also long lasting I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying more on throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This is a very old fragrance.</li>
            <li>I could tell by the discoloration of the box the product is pretty  old but the  aroma was doable and I  wanted it for an event outting that didn&#x27;t  allow me to go shopping at the last minute.</li>
            <li>Far Away</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me, or if the perfume is old and turning.</li>
            <li>They need Far Away Paradise..</li>
            <li>I used to sell Avon a few years back and fell in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get her something extra special during a rough period</li>
            <li>Been wearing Far Away since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really into perfumes and have only ever tried a few, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I guess its due to its originality and the change in colour because the one i bought from Amazon is always pinkish in colour but the one from Avon is slightly orangish golden.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this perfume was a favorite of mine I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The only avon perfume I wear.  Everyone loves it on me.  Best price.  Easiest way to buy, will keep coming back.</li>
            <li> Been wearing Far Away since I was a teen. Has a light sensual smell. Jasmine, freesia,tuberose and a hint of peach I think. Still to this day I get more compliments wearing this fragrance than any other. Men seem to love this stuff.</li>
            <li> my favorite if you like a light sweet fragance try it.</li>
            <li> Love this purfume  fast shipping  thanks</li>
            <li> I love Far Away I use it now for many Years and for the first Time I found it on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> This is a very old fragrance. When I was younger I remembered smelling it on my mom &amp; it was calming &amp; soothing. I purchased 1 for her &amp; myself &amp; I wear it on special occasions. People even comment about how good it smells</li>
            <li> It never disappoints, you got to love it. I will definitely order again. I just got my order today and cant wait to wear it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> The perfume came at the expected time and while the perfume box was a little crushed on one corner the perfume bottle was in excellent condition.  I have had no problems and am satisfied with my purchase.  This was a blind buy for me and I am glad I took the risk.  Good price.</li>
            <li> This is on sale in the Avon book for $9.99 most of the time.  It is a wonderful fragrance, but should not be sold on amazon.  Avon does not allow this.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think it smells great at all as soome reviews mentioned. It wears off quickly, other Avon perfumes smell way better. Is it expired or something?</li>
            <li> good smelling perfume</li>
            <li> I received it quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I remember.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me, or if the perfume is old and turning.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my sis as she&#x27;s in love with its smell but me, not so keen. She says she receives heaps of compliments when wearing this perfume but only when bought from Avon. I guess its due to its originality and the change in colour because the one i bought from Amazon is always pinkish in colour but the one from Avon is slightly orangish golden. Plus the fragrance lasts longer when bought from Avon!!!</li>
            <li> Great shipping time !!!!! I love this perfume</li>
            <li> This is a very sensual smelling perfume and can definitely be worn on an everyday basis. Never smelled this perfume prior to buying, but after reading the reviews for the perfume through amazon, I ordered it on a whim. Very good for the price and a very beautiful perfume.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell of this perfume. It&#x27;s smell lasts for a long time and most of people ask me what your perfume is.</li>
            <li> I always love this perfume ever since I was a kid when my ma &amp; grandma would order it out of Avon! Love the smell!</li>
            <li> My daughter gave this perfume to me as a gift more than 10 years ago.......I have not purchased another fragrance since!  This fragrance makes me feel dressed up and special, even in jeans-----lasts all day (and night). Truly gets noticed--- and lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I got it earlier than I expected</li>

            <li> love it, love it, love it, i have been looking for this perfume.</li>
            <li> The best scent!!!!! Gets better as u wear it because it softens. A nice warm scent soft and not overpowering. Very sensual not strong or floral. Closer to a musk vanilla amber fragrance. Strong scents give me a headache this is nice n soft yet noticeable</li>
            <li> The perfume smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I looooove it. Planning on getting it for my mother inlaw. #perfect</li>

            <li> Smells spicy and delicious (but not in a food way). Has good staying power. Wearing it makes me feel sensual and sultry. I&#x27;m not really into perfumes and have only ever tried a few, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have love Faraway since forever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using AVON for over 30 years and just love this scent.  I get lots of compliments from people asking what I&#x27;m wearing.  You don&#x27;t have to have pay high price for high quality.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It smells nasty and its very musky bought it through a avon representative never again</li>

            <li> I have worn Far Away for so many years.  I started wearing it when it first came out.  People are always coming up to me and asking what fragrance I am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea this was available on Amazon and when I stumbled across it, so much easier than through a rep.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Mom favorite perfume she l loved it.  N shipping was fast. Thks Amazon</li>
            <li> I used to sell Avon a few years back and fell in love with this fragrance. It lasts me all day.</li>
            <li> I love this scent for the price you can&#x27;t beat it, the scent last all day, very pretty pleasent scent, don&#x27;t take my word buy a bottle, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it smells great, it&#x27;s long-lasting, it never fails to get a compliment.  Shipping was fast, and the packaging was great.  I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It has a powdery, floral type of smell and lasts literally all day on you! The guys love this stuff, every time I wear this, I get several compliments on it.</li>

            <li> love the scent, Ive been using this since a long time and always get compliments. :)</li>
            <li> My grandma&#x27;s favorite perfume. I wanted to get her something extra special during a rough period so I picked this up. It is hard to find because it retired but this is a great price. Definitely will get again when we runs out.</li>
            <li> I could tell by the discoloration of the box the product is pretty  old but the  aroma was doable and I  wanted it for an event outting that didn&#x27;t  allow me to go shopping at the last minute.</li>
            <li> IT WASN&#x27;T A STRONG SMELL LIKE I REMEMBER FROM YEARS AGO.  IT STILL SMELLED GOOD BUT WASN&#x27;T LASTING AND YOU DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW WONDERFUL IT SMELLS IF NO ONE TELLS YOU.  FAST DELIVERY AND NICE PERSON TO WORK WITH.</li>
            <li> Did have same smell but was still good</li>
            <li> timeless scent, highly requested.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Wife love it :)</li>
            <li> I really dislike floral and powdery scents, so most traditional perfumes are off the table, but I love this scent.</li>
            <li> this was bought as a gift for my Mom.  It came in a good box, but when I opened up to check the bottle, it was more than slightly worn and dusty.  I had to wipe the bottle to make it look presentable.  The perfume itself is gook, as far as I know; It&#x27;s not too strong and is somewhat pleasurable.  This makes an ok side gift, as long as you have something else to give with it.</li>
