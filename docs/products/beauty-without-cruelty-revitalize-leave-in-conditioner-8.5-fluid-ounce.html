            <li>This is a nice leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is so moisturizing without being too greasy and it even has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>I have started to switch to more earth friendly products and this is a great fit to my hair care routine</li>
            <li>The service and delivery was great, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing purely because it just doesn&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping, works well on fine hair!</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>Am going to buy more as soon as I get the chance.</li>
            <li>I love how it smooths the texture.</li>

            <li>I love it in the winter when my hair gets static.</li>
            <li>And another benefit it that it is cruelty free!</li>
            <li>I am in love and i want more now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can find reviews on it on Youtube. :)</li>
            <li>This works great on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>good fast service.</li>
            <li>nice natural and effective product.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a strong smell</li>
            <li>this is a fine product to use if you are looking for a leave-in conditioner that is not tested on animals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The leave in is lightweight, too light for my hair</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s cruelty free, how can you beat that???</li>
            <li>Bonus points for being cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because it is cruelty free</li>
            <li>my hair was smooth all day and didn&#x27;t have any weight.  </li>
            <li>It smells natural but good</li>
            <li>Perfect for a post-shower leave-in conditioner for my medium length, fine, dry, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>And the price is great for a ALL natural product that really takes all the dryness away and keeps it away.</li>
            <li>it might be good for healthy hair but in my case this product is not useful at all for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>and I love the ethical stand that BWC takes.</li>
            <li>In Conditioner would fair in my hair, alongside the Daily Shampoo and Conditioner combination.</li>
            <li>Perfect for african american hair.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, works just as the non-animal-friendly stuff, which is great because I now use this and never will go back to the other stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This is perfect, it leaves my hair soft and manageable without that weighed down, greasy look.</li>
            <li>It worked very well!!</li>
            <li>I really like this for my fine hair and don&#x27;t find it greasy</li>
            <li>This would go more so for someone who has finer and/or straight hair, and I&#x27;ve seen good results on those folks as well; you&#x27;ll probably need much less.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also VERY affordable and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I only had to use the tiniest pea sized amount, rub it in my hands and then kind of comb it through my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li>I reapplied more to my edges and scalp with a spray bottle of water, but it wasn&#x27;t what I desired as far as moisture coverage.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s vegan and all natural, but I just need something with a stronger moisture factor.</li>
            <li>This is the second BWC product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m loving their stuff.</li>
            <li>I have really fine, European hair, but a very greasy scalp, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how this Leave</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing again, even before I&#x27;m finished with my first bottle - I will purchase another one in advance.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>With that said, this is great for taming hair a bit too (curly/frizzy) to some degree, but without completely weighing it down.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, light smelling leave in, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for very curly hair as it doesn&#x27;t moisturoize my hair as much as I&#x27;d like (for those of you who are familiar with it, I have thick 3a and 3b curls).</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/frizzy hair and have a troublesome time finding a product that works for by hair and is also animal friendly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy (unless you put too much on), has a nice consistency, and it actually makes my hair tame yet healthy-bouncy after a while, makes my curls look nice, etc.</li>
            <li>I love the that it has biotin in it, among other hair-health ingredients, and I do feel like they produce healthier hair over time and with consistent use.</li>
            <li>This makes my naturally wavy hair feel silky smooth whether I wear it natural or blow it straight.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, frizzy hair, that needs LOTS of leave in conditioner in order to keep the curls togther.</li>
            <li>I was definitely able to detangle my wet hair with it.</li>
            <li>I knew it was a winner because I instantly could feel how smooth my hair was.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;hair cocktail\\&quot; really nourishes, protects and smooths out the frizzies.</li>
            <li>With the sun, heat, pollution, salt water, etc my hair was REALLY suffering to where it was breaking off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just always good when a hair product has a nice scent, but I guess that is part of putting more crap into it!</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that keeps my very curly hair tamed!!!</li>
            <li>Good way to calm down dry itchy hair at night.</li>
            <li>I love this leave-in conditioner; it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
            <li>Sometimes products that are better for when I leave my hair curly are too heavy for when I have it straight.</li>
            <li>He keeps his hair short, so most people would probably not notice his hair is really coarse.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it when I&#x27;m leaving my hair curly.</li>
            <li>and i have very soft curly/wavy hair that is very picky about what is in it.</li>
            <li>Before this, I&#x27;d used Giovanni&#x27;s leave-in and found that to be thicker and much more moisturizing, but the smell bothered me as I got down to the end of the bottle, so I figured I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>So to my amazement it defined my curls and had a decent but not hard hold in my hair.</li>
            <li>Just a little bit rubbed in keeps the comb moving through pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product because it does not leave a residue nor heaviness when applied.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years (even in other locations)--many of which left my hair feeling funky, greasy, or dried out--this is the only one that actually conditions, moisturizes, and leaves my hair feeling great, as it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
            <li>Ive been using mixed chicks leave in conditioner for a long time and decided i wanted to go a more natural route.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Usually add a bit of olive oil for more moisture and relief.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixed, so my hair is naturally pretty curly.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m ordering my third bottle, which I can safely say has never happened with other products tut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly hair and leaving the conditioner in left my hair flat and not as springy as I like.  </li>
            <li>We have similar hair texture (pretty soft, yet very curly), but it could be because she has less hair than me right now.</li>
            <li>But this product really surprised me.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, and manageable...</li>
            <li>With as much product that I&#x27;m going to have to use daily, I think this bottle will be gone before 2 months.</li>
            <li>and it has not harsh smell</li>
            <li>It leaves by hair soft, bouncy and easier to maintain.</li>
            <li>This leave-in makes his hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I was however surprised that it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Not sure we will order more because of this reason, specially if we find any other products with big pump up bottles for affordable prizing.</li>
            <li>But I have very dry hair mostly due to processing with color and this product helps my curly hair look better.</li>
            <li>We have tried many different leave-in-conditioners and none of them seem to tame his hair.</li>
            <li>I simply put a lot more when I leave it to dry naturally versus when blow dry.</li>
            <li>This leave-in has a slight smell similar to Giovanni&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s not as strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just a little herbaceous.</li>
            <li>I prefer leave-in conditioners, and this one seems to leave my hair as good as any, while guaranteeing at least nominally less cruelty to animals.</li>
            <li>To test it i did my normal routine as i do with mixed chick.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and not dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell, though it is rather mild and can be easily masked, and it eventually fades.</li>
            <li>My hair has been very damaged and I recently spent a month in the Philippines.</li>
            <li>It just adds extra moisture to my hair, naturally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other natural hair products that usually do not do any justice.</li>
            <li>And when it dried it didnt leave my hair hard and crunchy like mixed chicks, not to mention i am very comfortable with everything in the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair because of thinning and hair loss due to medication (beta blocker)</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy (unless you put too much on), has a nice consistency, and it actually makes my hair tame yet healthy-bouncy after a while, makes my curls look nice, etc.</li>
            <li> I love the that it has biotin in it, among other hair-health ingredients, and I do feel like they produce healthier hair over time and with consistent use.</li>
            <li> This makes my naturally wavy hair feel silky smooth whether I wear it natural or blow it straight.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy hair, that needs LOTS of leave in conditioner in order to keep the curls togther.</li>
            <li> I was definitely able to detangle my wet hair with it.</li>
            <li> I knew it was a winner because I instantly could feel how smooth my hair was.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;hair cocktail\\&quot; really nourishes, protects and smooths out the frizzies.</li>
            <li> With the sun, heat, pollution, salt water, etc my hair was REALLY suffering to where it was breaking off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just always good when a hair product has a nice scent, but I guess that is part of putting more crap into it!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that keeps my very curly hair tamed!!!</li>
            <li> Good way to calm down dry itchy hair at night.</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in conditioner; it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> Sometimes products that are better for when I leave my hair curly are too heavy for when I have it straight.</li>
            <li> He keeps his hair short, so most people would probably not notice his hair is really coarse.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it when I&#x27;m leaving my hair curly.</li>
            <li> and i have very soft curly/wavy hair that is very picky about what is in it.</li>
            <li> Before this, I&#x27;d used Giovanni&#x27;s leave-in and found that to be thicker and much more moisturizing, but the smell bothered me as I got down to the end of the bottle, so I figured I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li> So to my amazement it defined my curls and had a decent but not hard hold in my hair.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit rubbed in keeps the comb moving through pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product because it does not leave a residue nor heaviness when applied.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years (even in other locations)--many of which left my hair feeling funky, greasy, or dried out--this is the only one that actually conditions, moisturizes, and leaves my hair feeling great, as it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
            <li> Ive been using mixed chicks leave in conditioner for a long time and decided i wanted to go a more natural route.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Usually add a bit of olive oil for more moisture and relief.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed, so my hair is naturally pretty curly.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m ordering my third bottle, which I can safely say has never happened with other products tut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly hair and leaving the conditioner in left my hair flat and not as springy as I like.  </li>
            <li> We have similar hair texture (pretty soft, yet very curly), but it could be because she has less hair than me right now.</li>
            <li> But this product really surprised me.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, and manageable...</li>
            <li> With as much product that I&#x27;m going to have to use daily, I think this bottle will be gone before 2 months.</li>
            <li> and it has not harsh smell</li>
            <li> It leaves by hair soft, bouncy and easier to maintain.</li>
            <li> This leave-in makes his hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I was however surprised that it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Not sure we will order more because of this reason, specially if we find any other products with big pump up bottles for affordable prizing.</li>
            <li> But I have very dry hair mostly due to processing with color and this product helps my curly hair look better.</li>
            <li> We have tried many different leave-in-conditioners and none of them seem to tame his hair.</li>
            <li> I simply put a lot more when I leave it to dry naturally versus when blow dry.</li>
            <li> This leave-in has a slight smell similar to Giovanni&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s not as strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just a little herbaceous.</li>
            <li> I prefer leave-in conditioners, and this one seems to leave my hair as good as any, while guaranteeing at least nominally less cruelty to animals.</li>
            <li> To test it i did my normal routine as i do with mixed chick.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and not dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell, though it is rather mild and can be easily masked, and it eventually fades.</li>
            <li> My hair has been very damaged and I recently spent a month in the Philippines.</li>
            <li> It just adds extra moisture to my hair, naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other natural hair products that usually do not do any justice.</li>
            <li> And when it dried it didnt leave my hair hard and crunchy like mixed chicks, not to mention i am very comfortable with everything in the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair because of thinning and hair loss due to medication (beta blocker)</li>
            <li> Detangled and smoothed out my long straight hair without weighing it down</li>
            <li> I try not to use it when flat-ironing because it can get a little heavy, though it may be possible to put a lot less on for better results.</li>
            <li> It makes my soft and easier to manage (wet and dry).</li>
            <li> i with my thick curly hair, I didn&#x27;t have the pretty curls</li>
            <li> I have tightly coiled short afro hair in it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li> I really expected more out of this leave-in, but I&#x27;m sadly disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can actually run my finger through my wet hair after putting it in.</li>
            <li> I use it as a detangler for my daughters long curly hair.</li>
            <li> So I happened to stumble across this product and reluctantly decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5+ years and it is my must-have to help nourish long curly hair that has a tendency to split if not moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to be gentle on my hair and give it some moisture because it was weak, fragile and like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps other people with a similar hair type as mine.</li>
            <li> This may work for someone else, but unfortunately did not show any significant changes to my hair.</li>
            <li> However, the smell does go away once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Not so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I had been fighting with my dry, damaged hair from being bleached and nothing was working not even my go to oil.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair that can get oily with the use of silicones.  </li>
            <li> After toweling my hair dry, I apply two drops of [[ASIN:B00BFZFVW6</li>
            <li> After I had used both of the products, I put in the Leave In Conditioner, and toweled my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Since my hair was dry, brittle and always tangled I decided to get it a try.  </li>
            <li> Then combed my hair and blow dry....</li>
            <li> i advise you to pick up this little treasure whereas it is a lot less expensive than mixed chicks and a lot better for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I can actually run my hands through my hair and can pull it down and look at it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin and a little past my shoulders-it gets tangled instantly even if a puff of wind blows into it</li>
            <li> Her hair is always very dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve certainly smelled worse, tut.</li>
            <li> Put in my wet hair about two quarter-size amount.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use a quarter-sized amount on damp hair (not sopping wet), and I don&#x27;t need to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate to give reviews of anything lower than a 5, but I have to be honest.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent, and leaves my hair soft yet not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to with other products though.</li>
            <li> So I guess that&#x27;s the only downfall, that the bottles are so small that I would have to order 100</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have used other</li>
            <li> and I can put it on dry hair with a little water and it won&#x27;t leave it feeling sticky or crunchy.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to those with dry or limp hair.</li>
            <li> When my hair dried with this product in, I noticed my scalp was very dry</li>
            <li> I have the usual multiracial (w, b, native American) hair madness going on, where few products seem to work, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li> : even if you have thick, coarse, semi-coarse, or textured hair, keep in mind that this is a mostly-natural product.</li>
            <li> I even tried it in the conventional way--putting it on while showering, letting it stay for a few minutes and then washing it out.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair increase drops slowly until you get shine without greasiness.</li>
            <li> Though it is somewhat expensive based on its size, it actually lasts a long while, even for my long, extremely thick hair that falls to passed bra-strap length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I deviate a little from their directions.</li>
            <li> I just put a little in and comb it through.</li>
            <li> I also live in dry climate, high elevation, and with nasty well water to add to my troubles.</li>
            <li> It works well but is a little heavy</li>
            <li> My husband has very thick, curly, coarse hair!</li>
            <li> After using this product you will wonder why did people make similar products with unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> Smooths some of the frizziness out my hair without making it to heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years anyway.</li>
            <li> so I got this stuff hoping it would help me comb through it after showers and not leave it greasy or heavy during the day.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s also code for concentrated, like concentrated orange juice--you don&#x27;t want too much or you&#x27;ll get bad results.</li>
            <li> This is not the result I usually get from a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it has a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> So, if you are not sure about purchasing it</li>
            <li> I have heavy, thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick difficult hair, and this product can actually hold it quite well.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as to if i would find something that was natural and that would keep my curls shapely and defined.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair .</li>
            <li> Very little products work for me, but this one does!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick in mass, yet thin in strand.</li>
            <li> he using it for styling he has very thick corse hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not tested on defenseless animals.</li>
            <li> I hope the maker can provider some small packages or bottles since it is inconvenient to pack when travelling.</li>
            <li> but, unfortunately, it did not work for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> , it felt dirty and like it had a film on it.</li>
            <li> the moisture just made it look dirty.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fabulous product! Love it!</li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent, and leaves my hair soft yet not greasy.  Some leave in conditioners will make my neck break out, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this one.</li>
            <li> good fast service. product smells nice, works</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. Am going to buy more as soon as I get the chance.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great! Really effective and smells good. Glad to support awesome products like this!!!</li>
            <li> Not a lot to say except this is a fine product to use if you are looking for a leave-in conditioner that is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy being beautiful without cruelty!</li>
            <li> Ehhhhh it did alright i with my thick curly hair, I didn&#x27;t have the pretty curls I&#x27;m use to with other products though. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> I use it once in a while, but I realized it does more good on my daughter than on me. We have similar hair texture (pretty soft, yet very curly), but it could be because she has less hair than me right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other natural hair products that usually do not do any justice. But this product really surprised me. It leaves my hair very soft and manageable. I can actually run my finger through my wet hair after putting it in.</li>
            <li> Love the way it works! Love the way my hair feels with it!  And LOVE the scent!!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, works well on fine hair!</li>
            <li> Great product. After using this product you will wonder why did people make similar products with unnecessary chemicals. I have started to switch to more earth friendly products and this is a great fit to my hair care routine</li>
            <li> This makes my naturally wavy hair feel silky smooth whether I wear it natural or blow it straight. I love how it smooths the texture. This is not the result I usually get from a leave in conditioner. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great herbal scent! Smooths some of the frizziness out my hair without making it to heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product because it does not leave a residue nor heaviness when applied. Moisturizes my curly locks.</li>
            <li> nice natural and effective product. cleane scent and you get a lot for your money, it lasts a while. you only need a pinch for effectiveness</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and not dry</li>
            <li> After having done my research on leave-in conditioners, I can definitely say this met my expectations! The only downside is that it has a weird smell to it. However, the smell does go away once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a post-shower leave-in conditioner for my medium length, fine, dry, very curly hair.  Love it!  Love that it isn&#x27;t tested on animals.  Works so well do not need to use a styling product after.  Put in my wet hair about two quarter-size amount.  Works for most of the day.  Good with the humidity too, living on the coast.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Not the greatest smell, but is not bad. It&#x27;s just always good when a hair product has a nice scent, but I guess that is part of putting more crap into it! We have used it for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is mixed. Her hair is always very dry so we need to put tons of product on it. So I guess that&#x27;s the only downfall, that the bottles are so small that I would have to order 100 jut to do a week. Not sure we will order more because of this reason, specially if we find any other products with big pump up bottles for affordable prizing.</li>
            <li> I use it as a detangler for my daughters long curly hair. Just a little bit rubbed in keeps the comb moving through pretty smoothly. Feels nice on her hair afterward.</li>
            <li> This leave in does a really good job of taming frizz and making nice waves.  I don&#x27;t feel it moisturizes as well as it could, but that&#x27;s the only drawback.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I wear my hair natural and the scent of this conditioner is wonderful!!!  It leaves my hair soft, and manageable...Thanks BWC!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years anyway. I can&#x27;t say I have used other leave -in products to actually compare it to. But I have very dry hair mostly due to processing with color and this product helps my curly hair look better. Not so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product is great on my hair. It makes my soft and easier to manage (wet and dry). After three years of using this, I recommend everyone use it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair because of thinning and hair loss due to medication (beta blocker) I bought this product to be gentle on my hair and give it some moisture because it was weak, fragile and like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like he results at all, it felt dirty and like it had a film on it. I had to wash it out. it might be good for healthy hair but in my case this product is not useful at all for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use \\&quot;Its A 10\\&quot; leave in spray and deep conditioning mask and I am getting very good results</li>
            <li> Good way to calm down dry itchy hair at night. Usually add a bit of olive oil for more moisture and relief. For the day I add a bit of aloe Vera gel for hold</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy hair, that needs LOTS of leave in conditioner in order to keep the curls togther. This product is AMAZING. Very little products work for me, but this one does! It&#x27;s also VERY affordable and cruelty free. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite leave in conditioner. I have thick difficult hair, and this product can actually hold it quite well.</li>
            <li> Ive been using mixed chicks leave in conditioner for a long time and decided i wanted to go a more natural route.  I was very skeptical as to if i would find something that was natural and that would keep my curls shapely and defined. So I happened to stumble across this product and reluctantly decided to purchase it. To test it i did my normal routine as i do with mixed chick. I washed and conditioned my hair then applied the product. To my astonishment it looked lovely in my hair!!  I am mostly american indian mixed with liberian and i have very soft curly/wavy hair that is very picky about what is in it. So to my amazement it defined my curls and had a decent but not hard hold in my hair. And when it dried it didnt leave my hair hard and crunchy like mixed chicks, not to mention i am very comfortable with everything in the ingredient list. So, if you are not sure about purchasing it i advise you to pick up this little treasure whereas it is a lot less expensive than mixed chicks and a lot better for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin and a little past my shoulders-it gets tangled instantly even if a puff of wind blows into it so I got this stuff hoping it would help me comb through it after showers and not leave it greasy or heavy during the day. Check on both accounts. I only had to use the tiniest pea sized amount, rub it in my hands and then kind of comb it through my hair with my fingers. It worked very well!! Definately recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> It works well but is a little heavy</li>
            <li> I hate to give reviews of anything lower than a 5, but I have to be honest. I really expected more out of this leave-in, but I&#x27;m sadly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It states that it&#x27;s for all hair types. I have tightly coiled short afro hair in it&#x27;s natural state. It&#x27;s thick in mass, yet thin in strand. I used this leave-in after co washing with the BWC conditioner in the shower. The leave in is lightweight, too light for my hair and that&#x27;s why I give it three stars. I was definitely able to detangle my wet hair with it. When my hair dried with this product in, I noticed my scalp was very dry and so was my hair seemingly. I reapplied more to my edges and scalp with a spray bottle of water, but it wasn&#x27;t what I desired as far as moisture coverage. Before this, I&#x27;d used Giovanni&#x27;s leave-in and found that to be thicker and much more moisturizing, but the smell bothered me as I got down to the end of the bottle, so I figured I&#x27;d try something new. This leave-in has a slight smell similar to Giovanni&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s not as strong. I love that it&#x27;s vegan and all natural, but I just need something with a stronger moisture factor. With as much product that I&#x27;m going to have to use daily, I think this bottle will be gone before 2 months. I hope this review helps other people with a similar hair type as mine.</li>
            <li> I received this in a ipsy glam bag in a sample size. I had been fighting with my dry, damaged hair from being bleached and nothing was working not even my go to oil. As soon as I put this in my hair I knew it was a winner because I instantly could feel how smooth my hair was. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5+ years and it is my must-have to help nourish long curly hair that has a tendency to split if not moisturized. I apply this, then Aubrey&#x27;s design gel. This \\&quot;hair cocktail\\&quot; really nourishes, protects and smooths out the frizzies.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It smells good and does great things for your hair.  It moisturizes your hair without leaving some kind of unwanted effects.  What it does for you in the beginning is what it does for you in the end also.  No surprises or disappointments.  And the price is great for a ALL natural product that really takes all the dryness away and keeps it away. I will be purchasing again, even before I&#x27;m finished with my first bottle - I will purchase another one in advance. I can see this product being out of stock eventually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this stuff. My hair has been very damaged and I recently spent a month in the Philippines. With the sun, heat, pollution, salt water, etc my hair was REALLY suffering to where it was breaking off. When I got home, I cut about 2 inches off and started using this leave in conditioner. This is the second BWC product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m loving their stuff. I&#x27;m mixed, so my hair is naturally pretty curly. I&#x27;ve been straightening it for years. Sometimes products that are better for when I leave my hair curly are too heavy for when I have it straight. This product has worked for both instances. I simply put a lot more when I leave it to dry naturally versus when blow dry.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this stuff he using it every day and has not caused any problems. he using it for styling he has very thick corse hair and it has not harsh smell</li>
            <li> I prefer leave-in conditioners, and this one seems to leave my hair as good as any, while guaranteeing at least nominally less cruelty to animals.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for. I have naturally curly/frizzy hair and have a troublesome time finding a product that works for by hair and is also animal friendly. This product met both requirements and exceeded my expectations. I have continued to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This leave in is great. I have dry curly hair that can get oily with the use of silicones.  They also make my scalp break out. This conditioner does not and preps my curls for my gel. It smells natural but good and I love the ethical stand that BWC takes. I bought it from OxKom and the product and customer service are excellent.</li>
            <li> This works great on my naturally curly hair. It holds in moisture and defines and holds curls.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that keeps my very curly hair tamed!!! Plus it&#x27;s cruelty free, how can you beat that???</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair . I love this leave-in conditioner; it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and I can put it on dry hair with a little water and it won&#x27;t leave it feeling sticky or crunchy. Bonus points for being cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. My hair is coarse and the rinse out conditioners I have tried gunk up my drain. This is perfect, it leaves my hair soft and manageable without that weighed down, greasy look.</li>
            <li> I believe this product works b/c it&#x27;s a leave-in conditioner that keeps on working after your hair dries.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s organic, paraben-free and it&#x27;s not tested on defenseless animals. I deviate a little from their directions. I use it like a regular conditioner except that I don&#x27;t wash it off. After toweling my hair dry, I apply two drops of [[ASIN:B00BFZFVW6 Coconut (Fractionated) Carrier Oil]] all over my short hair for extra shine. If you have long hair increase drops slowly until you get shine without greasiness. My hair stays shiny until I wash it again. This has never happened before. I recommend this product to those with dry or limp hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, hoping it would make a difference, and I didn&#x27;t feel it see any difference. This may work for someone else, but unfortunately did not show any significant changes to my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because it is cruelty free but, unfortunately, it did not work for my hair.  I have fine, naturally curly hair and leaving the conditioner in left my hair flat and not as springy as I like.  I even tried it in the conventional way--putting it on while showering, letting it stay for a few minutes and then washing it out.  Same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May work for others but not for me....darn.</li>
            <li> I have really fine, European hair, but a very greasy scalp, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how this Leave In Conditioner would fair in my hair, alongside the Daily Shampoo and Conditioner combination. After I had used both of the products, I put in the Leave In Conditioner, and toweled my hair dry. My hair was greasy, it looked like it had not been washed and the moisture just made it look dirty. I would recommend maybe using it without the Daily Conditioner? I will try that next time, and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Detangled and smoothed out my long straight hair without weighing it down</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It just adds extra moisture to my hair, naturally. There isn&#x27;t a strong smell and I can see shiny and moisture added to my hair as results. I use this once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have heavy, thick, wavy hair.  I use trader joes tea tree shampoo and when I do not use the conditioner, I use the leave in conditioner by BWC... LOVE LOVE LOVE  It leaves by hair soft, bouncy and easier to maintain.</li>
            <li> Crap. I have tried every organic hair product on the market and no matter what they just don&#x27;t work as well as the stuff with chemicals. Sorry.</li>
            <li> This is a nice leave in conditioner. I love it in the winter when my hair gets static. I just put a little in and comb it through.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, works just as the non-animal-friendly stuff, which is great because I now use this and never will go back to the other stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Very recommended!!!</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing. It is so moisturizing without being too greasy and it even has a nice scent to it. Perfect for african american hair.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light smelling leave in, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for very curly hair as it doesn&#x27;t moisturoize my hair as much as I&#x27;d like (for those of you who are familiar with it, I have thick 3a and 3b curls). The service and delivery was great, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing purely because it just doesn&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has very thick, curly, coarse hair! We have tried many different leave-in-conditioners and none of them seem to tame his hair. This leave-in makes his hair soft and managable. He keeps his hair short, so most people would probably not notice his hair is really coarse. What a great product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the 2 fl oz leave in conditioner to try.  Since my hair was dry, brittle and always tangled I decided to get it a try.  I tend to not purchase &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; items only because my hair gets oily by the end of the day.  I was however surprised that it didn&#x27;t.  I put the &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; conditioner after I showered, like a gel or mousse.  Then combed my hair and blow dry.... my hair was smooth all day and didn&#x27;t have any weight.  Therefore by the end of the day it wasn&#x27;t greasy or gross.  And another benefit it that it is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I really like this for my fine hair and don&#x27;t find it greasy</li>
            <li> BWC makes superb hair products...good for your hair...good for the planet !!&lt;br /&gt;OxCom is efficient and prompt. Everything I have ordered has been delivered on time and in perfect condition  Thanks !!</li>
            <li> I loved this. The product works miricles on my hair. This made my hair just grow and grow.  I can actually run my hands through my hair and can pull it down and look at it. I am in love and i want more now.</li>
            <li> I knew about this product from my colleague. I know about its quality and feel satisfactory by myself with continuously purchase. I hope the maker can provider some small packages or bottles since it is inconvenient to pack when travelling.</li>
            <li> I have the usual multiracial (w, b, native American) hair madness going on, where few products seem to work, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. I also live in dry climate, high elevation, and with nasty well water to add to my troubles. Though I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years (even in other locations)--many of which left my hair feeling funky, greasy, or dried out--this is the only one that actually conditions, moisturizes, and leaves my hair feeling great, as it&#x27;s meant to do. Best of all: no funky ingredients. I love the that it has biotin in it, among other hair-health ingredients, and I do feel like they produce healthier hair over time and with consistent use. Though it is somewhat expensive based on its size, it actually lasts a long while, even for my long, extremely thick hair that falls to passed bra-strap length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell, though it is rather mild and can be easily masked, and it eventually fades. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just a little herbaceous. I&#x27;ve certainly smelled worse, tut. I mainly use it when I&#x27;m leaving my hair curly. I try not to use it when flat-ironing because it can get a little heavy, though it may be possible to put a lot less on for better results. With that said, this is great for taming hair a bit too (curly/frizzy) to some degree, but without completely weighing it down. It&#x27;s not greasy (unless you put too much on), has a nice consistency, and it actually makes my hair tame yet healthy-bouncy after a while, makes my curls look nice, etc. In fact, I&#x27;m ordering my third bottle, which I can safely say has never happened with other products tut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: even if you have thick, coarse, semi-coarse, or textured hair, keep in mind that this is a mostly-natural product. That&#x27;s also code for concentrated, like concentrated orange juice--you don&#x27;t want too much or you&#x27;ll get bad results. This would go more so for someone who has finer and/or straight hair, and I&#x27;ve seen good results on those folks as well; you&#x27;ll probably need much less. I don&#x27;t even use a quarter-sized amount on damp hair (not sopping wet), and I don&#x27;t need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find reviews on it on Youtube. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EWG Skindeep Toxicity Score: 2 out of 10 with no carcinogens (woohoo!)</li>
