            <li>/&gt;It felt so good, I think I&#x27;ll wash my face again with it - and not wait until tomorrow when there will be more makeup to remove!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling great all day.</li>
            <li>but my skin looks great</li>
            <li>Not to mention it smells GREAT</li>
            <li>is a really great cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is a great product by burts bees.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser</li>
            <li>Looks great, she loves it.  </li>
            <li>The peach-colored tube with attractive graphics has now become a peculiar off-white.</li>
            <li>: smells great and does improve skin smoothness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a great smell and texture.</li>
            <li>That would be great if you&#x27;re also using an oil-based makeup</li>
            <li>of my skin has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell, and does the job.  </li>
            <li>This does the job and that is what I like the most about it and what you need with a cleanser is really excellent make-up removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells great (and it even tastes good, as I found when it got in my mouth -- not that I would suggest eating it).  </li>
            <li>The orange scent is pleasant but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>Works well and had good reviews from the Environmental Working Group for its ingredients.</li>
            <li>What I also loved was that I didn&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it smells good.</li>
            <li>While it feels tacky going on it does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>Loved everything I&#x27;ve tried from Burts Bees</li>
            <li>The smell was good</li>
            <li>It smelled good, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good at removing eye make-up, even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising given the way it feels in your hand, but it has never been a problem with my contact lenses.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel any freshness or cleanness followed not to mention I didn&#x27;t feel this product makes a good lather</li>
            <li>My face no longer feels &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; after I wash it, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Has good smell but dirt and make up stay still on my skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser smells good</li>
            <li>From the second I opened the tube and smelled the delicious orange scent, I knew I had found an excellent product.</li>
            <li>The review is surprising as most of the products from this line have been great.</li>
            <li>nice reliable face cleanser...even tastes good....</li>
            <li>I love this one!</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser!  </li>
            <li>I love the orange fragrance!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not, it just also isn&#x27;t stripping all of the sebum from your skin, which is better for you!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love anything by Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li>The product smells very good, but probably is best for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but leaves my face greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t take my makeup off.  </li>
            <li>Gives kind of a waxy-feel to the skin.</li>
            <li>It did smell nice, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>The cleanser also leaves a sort of sticky or tacky kind of feel on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It keeps you skin moist and has a really nice orange scent.</li>
            <li>But it felt good :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save, I get a nice discount.</li>
            <li>However this does kind of leave a texture to my face</li>
            <li>The orange scent was nice</li>
            <li>I was worried that with its rather oily texture and that it doesn&#x27;t foam up, that my face wouldn&#x27;t get clean but it does and feels great.</li>
            <li>And I switched from Eucerin Sensitive Skin, which is one of the best cleansers on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible, really.    </li>
            <li>Honest, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Might be good for your skin but the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clean is it&#x27;s downfall.</li>
            <li>This cleanser also has a very pleasant natural orange scent.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>People are used to sodium lauryl sulfate in most \\&quot;soaps\\&quot;, which strips the skin and that is why this product feels \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; to them.</li>
            <li>i should have read the description better.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of Burts products and love 90% of them.</li>
            <li>it does feel better after I use it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several and this seems to work best for my skin.  </li>
            <li>And, like all BB products, almost entirely organic and cruelty free! WIN!</li>
            <li>It does seem a tad more drying.</li>
            <li>this is magic.</li>
            <li>and I normally love Burt&#x27;s Bee products</li>
            <li>wash MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I love burts bees products, they rock</li>
            <li>The smell is okay.</li>
            <li>I had just thought I&#x27;d try Burt&#x27;s Bees as I like most of their products.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate the environmentally safe ingredients which is why I&#x27;m giving this product 2 stars.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>I love the company because it&#x27;s eco-friendly.</li>
            <li>I like this better.</li>
            <li>is more oily</li>
            <li>If anything, my acne gets better when I use this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good, but not as good as the old formula.</li>
            <li>I will order it again as there is still nothing comparable that I have found, but I sure wish they had kept to the fantastic one I have been accustomed to for years!</li>
            <li>I would have to agree that it is not for the better.  </li>
            <li>Love the orange essence of this product.  </li>
            <li>and I really do love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a makeup remover before using it however because it does not contain ingredients that will cut through makeup.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite face wash for years.  </li>
            <li>If anything, I haven&#x27;t had more break outs.</li>
            <li>Being oil based, it&#x27;s basically a more convenient alternative to the OCM (oil cleansing method).</li>
            <li>(nothing&#x27;s perfect) but the overall quality (elasticity, texture, etc.)</li>
            <li>Love the smell but feel it leaves a coating after washing.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully with a warm, wet washcloth.</li>
            <li>Love the orange scent.</li>
            <li>I love citrus and this smells just like a juicy orange.</li>
            <li>This would probably be best for people with really dry skin.</li>
            <li>Smells good, cleans gently :)</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then I&#x27;m sure this is fine...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very good price--better than what I just paid at Target earlier this week.</li>
            <li>Really does a good job at keeping your face moisturize but then also cleans it.</li>
            <li>It feels slightly warm when you are applying it and smells like a fresh orange.  </li>
            <li>Was it really worth it to disappoint long-time fans of the product, and to dishonor their own respected brand name?</li>
            <li>While I never used the older formula and so can&#x27;t compare the two, this new mix is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite lovely, but my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean at all.  </li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this for it&#x27;s awesome smell and make-up cleaning properties, but if you have sensitive or dry skin I would keep looking for a moisturizing product, or just not give a rip and use it anyway because it does do an awesome cleansing job.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin smooth and supple, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel really smooth and does not leave any oily residue or anything</li>
            <li>She uses it 3 days a week along with her regular cleanser and it has greatly improved her complexion.</li>
            <li>I do use a toner afterwards, which would remove any remaining residue from my skin (I find that oil-based cleansers often leave residue and this one is no exception, although it&#x27;s quite light compared to some competing products).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on this cleanser&#x27;s effectiveness at treating teen acne, but it has been great for mine as an adult!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In a nutshell, this cleanser is all natural, smells wonderful, leaves skin soft and clean, and moisturizes as well.</li>
            <li>Only clean, smooth, radiant and happily moisturised skin remained.</li>
            <li>really what is the purpose of a cleanser that cannot clean the skin on its own.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fresh orange smell!</li>
            <li>It looks, smells and feels inferior to the original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance alone is enough to make this a favorite of elmosnaturals, but the product is so much more!</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I found out about this product.</li>
            <li>Did it clean my face?</li>
            <li>This clean my face well</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel that clean after using it.</li>
            <li>The cleanser has a nice smooth texture and feels soft.</li>
            <li>Too greasy and oily; my face did not feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>GREAT.. it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>My pores have never been so clean.</li>
            <li>Even though this cleanser is all natural (which I love!)</li>
            <li>Smells very tropical, citrusy and refreshing.</li>
            <li>it did such a good job unblocking my pores I recommended it to my acne-prone niece.</li>
            <li>However, this time I received an Orange Essence which was noticeably different, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>really wonder why people give more than 2 starts for this product.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s about the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li>Because I use this, I very rarely have to use moisturizer, my skin always feels soft and fresh and it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>smells good, makes my skin feel clean, so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin fresh, clean and glowing.</li>
            <li>An hour later, my skin seem more supple and more moist which was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel like it actually cleans my face, however it gets waterproof mascera off well and smells great (very orange).</li>
            <li>It seems like it will work great on all skin types and persons with mature or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Gonna give Burt&#x27;s one more chance with something more exfoliating, but I sure wish they&#x27;d just bring back my favorite: Lemon Poppy Facial Scrub.</li>
            <li>I regretted the purchase quickly.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees facial cleanser is the best facial wash I have used.  </li>
            <li>The initial smell of the facial cleanser is what you would expect - orangey &amp; delightful.</li>
            <li>My issue is mostly that this is oil-based, and although oil-based cleansers are popular these days, they don&#x27;t seem to be right for my skin (combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily T-zone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product cleans your face very nicely and leaves it soft and refreshed not dried out.</li>
            <li>I love this facewash, it keeps my face clear and clean.</li>
            <li>stuff is premo for removing make-up, it takes it right off and cleans up your face good, I love Lush&#x27;s Ultra Bland more for the moisturizing aspect, but it doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li>, it is not a horrible cleanser, but it has some new ingredients and a longer list of them.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>I do feel like I have a film leftover, but if you do the full regiment, it comes right off.</li>
            <li>It smelled nice and felt warm on my face, but it didn&#x27;t foam or scrub or do any of the usual soapy behaviors I am used to.</li>
            <li>It cleansed your face and allowed you to feel fresh.</li>
            <li>The old recipe was much better.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about that.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling fresh and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li>But, wow, I fell in love with its&#x27; citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>do enjoy this product, but I am going to look for a more moisturizing and hydrating cleanser next,</li>
            <li>I can definitely see this working for some people, though, and it should fit in many people&#x27;s budgets.  </li>
            <li>Fresh orange scent;</li>
            <li>This cleanser pretty much doesn&#x27;t produce suds at all, which again, is great for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with that soapy &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; feeling, as many cleansers do, but my face didn&#x27;t feel totally clean afterwards either...</li>
            <li>This went right in trash after 2 uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being cheap and not wanting to toss TT$75 down the drain, I cautiously attempted a second use and found it to be quite good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is the right cleanser for me, but it will definitely be great for some people.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleaners and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This left mY face feeling very clean, refreshed, and definitely smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Although it seems somewhat \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; in texture it amazingly manages to clear up our adult break outs.  </li>
            <li>I got this at the local pharmacy for $75 just because it was cheaper than the Radiance cleanser with the same great reviews.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the fact that it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip my skin dry and instead leaves a nice moisture after wash.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good, natural cleanser.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have less makeup coming off with my toner, which means this is doing a good job of getting rid of the makeup in my first cleansing step.  </li>
            <li>Orange Essense Facial Cleanser used to be not just my favorite cleanser by far, but my favorite of Burt&#x27;s Bees whole line.</li>
            <li>find this very gentle and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>My favorite facial cleanser</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing more I could want from a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>My husband and i both love Burts Orange Facial Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Used to love this product but haven&#x27;t used it in several years.</li>
            <li>At first it smells like oranges</li>
            <li>skin is often pretty acne-prone and this hasn&#x27;t made it break out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 and my skin looks as smooth and clear as it ever has.</li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite facial products.</li>
            <li>that, it hasn&#x27;t ever made my skin break out, it seems to keep that under control pretty darn well</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Was super highly recommended on some online skin stores</li>
            <li>I find it not quite as effective as the other BB cleanser I&#x27;ve tried (the creamy one), but it is definitely pretty luscious.  </li>
            <li>skin felt refreshed and clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so good that i will buy it again later if the price is low</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser; leaves even old skin soft and moist</li>
            <li>It is a high quality item that displays the best results when used in conjunction with small microfiber facial pads.</li>
            <li>The superior things about the product, which made it so pleasing to use in the past, have disappeared.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of a waxy texture, it doesn&#x27;t bother me or affect my skin, it&#x27;s just slightly noticeable and goes away after a bit, it&#x27;s not a problem for me</li>
            <li>anyone else has skin that drys easily like mine in specific spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like a syrup, though not as sticky with a strong orange scent and left a film of oil on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few years, and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love the bright orange scent (also a perk in the cold of winter).  </li>
            <li>-it feels really oily to me, and sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t rinse off well/</li>
            <li>After reading the ingredients, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much lather</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I used to use Skincueticals Gentle Cleanser</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too gentle.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very greasy feel after using.</li>
            <li>which does both and is gentle also.</li>
            <li>I immediately washed it off with some &#x27;real&#x27; cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew it wouldn&#x27;t lather, but it was too gentle.</li>
            <li>Cleans my skin well but gently.</li>
            <li>Very oily cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I think this is definitely worth a try if you&#x27;d like to start using natural skin care products.  </li>
            <li>It is very slimy during use and I feel like it stays on your face even after you wash it off.</li>
            <li>I really did not like this face wash.</li>
            <li>and I probably won&#x27;t be finishing the whole thing.</li>
            <li>gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>The product is very greasy and leaves a waxy film on your face.</li>
            <li>THe old product of this same brand (yellow/Orange bottle) was way better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m assuming it doesn&#x27;t foam because it&#x27;s a much more of a natural facial cleanser than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li>Kind of disappointing, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Formerly, this cleanser had a lovely natural fragrance of citrus.</li>
            <li>i will say to make sure to remove all remnants of the cleanser with a wash cloth, because otherwise you will have a sticky film on your face, but when you use it properly, it leaves your skin glowing and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can feel a very thin \\&quot;film\\&quot; of the orange oil on your face afterward, so make sure to rinse well with warm water.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is still going strong for me and my skin is nicer than it&#x27;s been in a long while.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect facial cleanser for anyone prone to dry, tight or flaking skin - and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of supposedly &#x27;gentle&#x27; cleansers.</li>
            <li>Much better than other cleansers with abrasive chemicals.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees actually leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Add a small amount of water to emulsify and it is a very different product which is both very effective yet oddly gentle.</li>
            <li>it smells more like old marmalade rather than a fresh squeeze of orange, more stale than I prefer.  </li>
            <li>Without actually cleaning my face and causing me discomfort, this face wash doesn&#x27;t have anything special in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Previously, I&#x27;ve tried many other kinds, including mostly high-end products like Clinique.</li>
            <li>I now going to only purchase Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence Facial Cleanser because it not only does the job but also smells and feels so good.</li>
            <li>This is NOT what you want when you have combination skin and live in the Tropics!</li>
            <li>Fantastic for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>If your skin runs oily, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this very highly.&lt;br /&gt;There is oil in this, as it blatantly advertises, and it makes it smell great.</li>
            <li>It removed my mascara, cleaned my face, and left it feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I can no longer tell people they could frost a cake with it, as I could with the original formulation, but it smells the same and seems to work pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>This would be fantastic for dry, normal, or maybe combination skin.</li>
            <li>I forget what this rated, but I bought it, so it couldn&#x27;t have been too high.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser left my face feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I really liked the orange scent, however it not only reminded me a little too much of the Burt&#x27;s Bees orange toothpaste I bought for my granddaughters</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees for sensitive skin with cotton extract is much nicer.</li>
            <li>But if your face is just somewhat dry or you like a clean feeling when done washing your face, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.  </li>
            <li>I read long ago (when I worked for a well known brand of soaps and body washes) that oil dissolves oil, tried this and discovered it to be true.</li>
            <li>However, the scent is orange fresh from the grove terrific.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this I was subscribing to Proactiv but have opted for a facial routine that is more natural.</li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s probably not the right product for me (oil-based cleansers tend to break me out, although this hasn&#x27;t yet -- I actually need something that&#x27;s a bit drying, this time of year).  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and that it&#x27;s all natural, but it feels a little TOO oily.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for such product, however, I used it twice for my first face wash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a new cleanser ever since.</li>
            <li>I was leery of the new formula, but this is an acceptable substitute. .  </li>
            <li>If you tend to be super dry this might be helpful</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It feels very different and &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; at first because it has no lathering agents.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily because I like to mix it up when it comes to product because I often develop an allergic reaction when I consistently use products.</li>
            <li>but I found that it didn&#x27;t clean my skin deep enough</li>
            <li>but then I realized that it was probably a good indicator that this stuff isn&#x27;t as harsh on skin as some of the previous products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The sides of my nose get really dry pretty easily, and this seems to make the skin flaky in that area and I am not a huge fan of that.</li>
            <li>It washed off cleanly and once I patted my face dry, any extra oiliness was gone.</li>
            <li>Never tried the old recipe</li>
            <li>Old recipe</li>
            <li>I like it for being natural without chemicals</li>
            <li>is so soft.</li>
            <li>Also, it says not to use near your eyes so now I have to have two cleansers anyway.</li>
            <li>sort of the same effect I get after using the Cetaphil gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>After trying to find the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Poppy Facial scrub, and discovering that absolutely nobody carries it anymore</li>
            <li>action to speak of.</li>
            <li>, I know it&#x27;s natural and organic now because there&#x27;s mold forming near the cap.</li>
            <li>But if you have really sensitive skin, you might want to find another cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural made with citrus.</li>
            <li>I keep one in the shower, one near the bathtub, one at the sink.</li>
            <li>But has natural oils.</li>
            <li>Bought this for acne wanted something natural to help with post pregnancy acne.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s 100% natural</li>
            <li>This cleanser is natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and almost everything seems to irritate it.</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredients are all natural; you can see them in the product images if you zoom</li>
            <li>The orange oil in this product made my face extra greasy and felt very slimy.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It looks like a natural product in the hands, without chemical textures or synthetic appearance.  </li>
            <li>Again, my skin is very sensitive and dry, and after just using this cleanser for the first time, I barely need a moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I first use this on a dry face, than rinse off.</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes a few days to get used to, but it is worth the wait!    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It rinses cleanly, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dried out.</li>
            <li>Once you get past the weird texture, it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li>I even get compliments and a friend asked if I had done a facial peel because my skin looked so vibrant.</li>
            <li>This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much,</li>
            <li>It has all natural ingredients and does not dry out my sensitive skin for a fraction of the price of the Bobbi Balm.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have often had a hard time finding a facial cleanser that is sensitive enough and more natural.</li>
            <li>The back tells you that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin parched like other soapy cleansers and it&#x27;s absolutely true.</li>
            <li>When I first put this cleanser on my face, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li>This is my new daily cleanser.</li>
            <li>After using this product for a few weeks, my skin is much more naturally moisturized and breaks out much less frequently.</li>
            <li>My recommendation, put this on dry and rub in really well.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s oil-based, it removes all my makeup (even stubborn eye makeup) and leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry / stripped.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, so it is a shame that it causes my face to get dry around my nose, but it&#x27;s likely a problem with my skin and other people might not have this issue, but I found it worth mentioning anyhow in case</li>
            <li>Also because of the natural oils used in the product it leaves our skin clean w/o that tight , dry, stripped feeling you get from a lot of cleansers.</li>
            <li>I use the Citrus Facial Cleanser along with the Wild Lettuce Toner and Carrot Lotion, and I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li>I also chose this because it apparently does not contain alcohol.</li>
            <li>This is a perk to my 41 year old skin, especially this winter!  </li>
            <li>Natural doesn&#x27;t equal non-irritating.</li>
            <li>One of the few face washes worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>if you have oily or maybe even normal skin, this is not for you, but really dry skin</li>
            <li>A small downside is that it also probably won&#x27;t clean very deeply, so if your face is sweaty or has makeup on it, you&#x27;d probably need to pre-wash or wipe it off or something first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was heart broken when my favorite facial cleanser, Skinmilk, was discontinued.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since learned the foaming agents in most cleansers that we associate with &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; are actually making both wrinkles and blocked pores worse.</li>
            <li>When I first popped a little onto my face</li>
            <li>After about 10 seconds it smells more like burnt rubber, which is not ideal.</li>
            <li>The only one that I have found that reduces breakouts and does not dry out my skin.  </li>

            <li> Great cleanser</li>
            <li> Looks great, she loves it.  </li>
            <li> The peach-colored tube with attractive graphics has now become a peculiar off-white.</li>
            <li> : smells great and does improve skin smoothness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has a great smell and texture.</li>
            <li> That would be great if you&#x27;re also using an oil-based makeup</li>
            <li> of my skin has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell, and does the job.  </li>
            <li> This does the job and that is what I like the most about it and what you need with a cleanser is really excellent make-up removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells great (and it even tastes good, as I found when it got in my mouth -- not that I would suggest eating it).  </li>
            <li> The orange scent is pleasant but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> Works well and had good reviews from the Environmental Working Group for its ingredients.</li>
            <li> What I also loved was that I didn&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it smells good.</li>
            <li> While it feels tacky going on it does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Loved everything I&#x27;ve tried from Burts Bees</li>
            <li> The smell was good</li>
            <li> It smelled good, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good at removing eye make-up, even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprising given the way it feels in your hand, but it has never been a problem with my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel any freshness or cleanness followed not to mention I didn&#x27;t feel this product makes a good lather</li>
            <li> My face no longer feels &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; after I wash it, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Has good smell but dirt and make up stay still on my skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells good</li>
            <li> From the second I opened the tube and smelled the delicious orange scent, I knew I had found an excellent product.</li>
            <li> The review is surprising as most of the products from this line have been great.</li>
            <li> nice reliable face cleanser...even tastes good....</li>
            <li> I love this one!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  </li>
            <li> I love the orange fragrance!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not, it just also isn&#x27;t stripping all of the sebum from your skin, which is better for you!</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love anything by Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> The product smells very good, but probably is best for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but leaves my face greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t take my makeup off.  </li>
            <li> Gives kind of a waxy-feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> It did smell nice, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> The cleanser also leaves a sort of sticky or tacky kind of feel on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It keeps you skin moist and has a really nice orange scent.</li>
            <li> But it felt good :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save, I get a nice discount.</li>
            <li> However this does kind of leave a texture to my face</li>
            <li> The orange scent was nice</li>
            <li> I was worried that with its rather oily texture and that it doesn&#x27;t foam up, that my face wouldn&#x27;t get clean but it does and feels great.</li>
            <li> And I switched from Eucerin Sensitive Skin, which is one of the best cleansers on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible, really.    </li>
            <li> Honest, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Might be good for your skin but the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clean is it&#x27;s downfall.</li>
            <li> This cleanser also has a very pleasant natural orange scent.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> People are used to sodium lauryl sulfate in most \\&quot;soaps\\&quot;, which strips the skin and that is why this product feels \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; to them.</li>
            <li> i should have read the description better.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Burts products and love 90% of them.</li>
            <li> it does feel better after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several and this seems to work best for my skin.  </li>
            <li> And, like all BB products, almost entirely organic and cruelty free! WIN!</li>
            <li> It does seem a tad more drying.</li>
            <li> this is magic.</li>
            <li> and I normally love Burt&#x27;s Bee products</li>
            <li> wash MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I love burts bees products, they rock</li>
            <li> The smell is okay.</li>
            <li> I had just thought I&#x27;d try Burt&#x27;s Bees as I like most of their products.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate the environmentally safe ingredients which is why I&#x27;m giving this product 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I love the company because it&#x27;s eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> I like this better.</li>
            <li> is more oily</li>
            <li> If anything, my acne gets better when I use this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good, but not as good as the old formula.</li>
            <li> I will order it again as there is still nothing comparable that I have found, but I sure wish they had kept to the fantastic one I have been accustomed to for years!</li>
            <li> I would have to agree that it is not for the better.  </li>
            <li> Love the orange essence of this product.  </li>
            <li> and I really do love it.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a makeup remover before using it however because it does not contain ingredients that will cut through makeup.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite face wash for years.  </li>
            <li> If anything, I haven&#x27;t had more break outs.</li>
            <li> Being oil based, it&#x27;s basically a more convenient alternative to the OCM (oil cleansing method).</li>
            <li> (nothing&#x27;s perfect) but the overall quality (elasticity, texture, etc.)</li>
            <li> Love the smell but feel it leaves a coating after washing.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully with a warm, wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> Love the orange scent.</li>
            <li> I love citrus and this smells just like a juicy orange.</li>
            <li> This would probably be best for people with really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smells good, cleans gently :)</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then I&#x27;m sure this is fine...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very good price--better than what I just paid at Target earlier this week.</li>
            <li> Really does a good job at keeping your face moisturize but then also cleans it.</li>
            <li> It feels slightly warm when you are applying it and smells like a fresh orange.  </li>
            <li> Was it really worth it to disappoint long-time fans of the product, and to dishonor their own respected brand name?</li>
            <li> While I never used the older formula and so can&#x27;t compare the two, this new mix is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite lovely, but my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean at all.  </li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this for it&#x27;s awesome smell and make-up cleaning properties, but if you have sensitive or dry skin I would keep looking for a moisturizing product, or just not give a rip and use it anyway because it does do an awesome cleansing job.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin smooth and supple, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel really smooth and does not leave any oily residue or anything</li>
            <li> She uses it 3 days a week along with her regular cleanser and it has greatly improved her complexion.</li>
            <li> I do use a toner afterwards, which would remove any remaining residue from my skin (I find that oil-based cleansers often leave residue and this one is no exception, although it&#x27;s quite light compared to some competing products).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on this cleanser&#x27;s effectiveness at treating teen acne, but it has been great for mine as an adult!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a nutshell, this cleanser is all natural, smells wonderful, leaves skin soft and clean, and moisturizes as well.</li>
            <li> Only clean, smooth, radiant and happily moisturised skin remained.</li>
            <li> really what is the purpose of a cleanser that cannot clean the skin on its own.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fresh orange smell!</li>
            <li> It looks, smells and feels inferior to the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance alone is enough to make this a favorite of elmosnaturals, but the product is so much more!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I found out about this product.</li>
            <li> Did it clean my face?</li>
            <li> This clean my face well</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel that clean after using it.</li>
            <li> The cleanser has a nice smooth texture and feels soft.</li>
            <li> Too greasy and oily; my face did not feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> GREAT.. it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> My pores have never been so clean.</li>
            <li> Even though this cleanser is all natural (which I love!)</li>
            <li> Smells very tropical, citrusy and refreshing.</li>
            <li> it did such a good job unblocking my pores I recommended it to my acne-prone niece.</li>
            <li> However, this time I received an Orange Essence which was noticeably different, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> really wonder why people give more than 2 starts for this product.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s about the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li> Because I use this, I very rarely have to use moisturizer, my skin always feels soft and fresh and it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> smells good, makes my skin feel clean, so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin fresh, clean and glowing.</li>
            <li> An hour later, my skin seem more supple and more moist which was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel like it actually cleans my face, however it gets waterproof mascera off well and smells great (very orange).</li>
            <li> It seems like it will work great on all skin types and persons with mature or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Gonna give Burt&#x27;s one more chance with something more exfoliating, but I sure wish they&#x27;d just bring back my favorite: Lemon Poppy Facial Scrub.</li>
            <li> I regretted the purchase quickly.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees facial cleanser is the best facial wash I have used.  </li>
            <li> The initial smell of the facial cleanser is what you would expect - orangey &amp; delightful.</li>
            <li> My issue is mostly that this is oil-based, and although oil-based cleansers are popular these days, they don&#x27;t seem to be right for my skin (combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily T-zone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product cleans your face very nicely and leaves it soft and refreshed not dried out.</li>
            <li> I love this facewash, it keeps my face clear and clean.</li>
            <li> stuff is premo for removing make-up, it takes it right off and cleans up your face good, I love Lush&#x27;s Ultra Bland more for the moisturizing aspect, but it doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> , it is not a horrible cleanser, but it has some new ingredients and a longer list of them.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> I do feel like I have a film leftover, but if you do the full regiment, it comes right off.</li>
            <li> It smelled nice and felt warm on my face, but it didn&#x27;t foam or scrub or do any of the usual soapy behaviors I am used to.</li>
            <li> It cleansed your face and allowed you to feel fresh.</li>
            <li> The old recipe was much better.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about that.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling fresh and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li> But, wow, I fell in love with its&#x27; citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> do enjoy this product, but I am going to look for a more moisturizing and hydrating cleanser next,</li>
            <li> I can definitely see this working for some people, though, and it should fit in many people&#x27;s budgets.  </li>
            <li> Fresh orange scent;</li>
            <li> This cleanser pretty much doesn&#x27;t produce suds at all, which again, is great for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with that soapy &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; feeling, as many cleansers do, but my face didn&#x27;t feel totally clean afterwards either...</li>
            <li> This went right in trash after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being cheap and not wanting to toss TT$75 down the drain, I cautiously attempted a second use and found it to be quite good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the right cleanser for me, but it will definitely be great for some people.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleaners and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This left mY face feeling very clean, refreshed, and definitely smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Although it seems somewhat \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; in texture it amazingly manages to clear up our adult break outs.  </li>
            <li> I got this at the local pharmacy for $75 just because it was cheaper than the Radiance cleanser with the same great reviews.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the fact that it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip my skin dry and instead leaves a nice moisture after wash.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good, natural cleanser.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have less makeup coming off with my toner, which means this is doing a good job of getting rid of the makeup in my first cleansing step.  </li>
            <li> Orange Essense Facial Cleanser used to be not just my favorite cleanser by far, but my favorite of Burt&#x27;s Bees whole line.</li>
            <li> find this very gentle and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> My favorite facial cleanser</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more I could want from a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> My husband and i both love Burts Orange Facial Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Used to love this product but haven&#x27;t used it in several years.</li>
            <li> At first it smells like oranges</li>
            <li> skin is often pretty acne-prone and this hasn&#x27;t made it break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 and my skin looks as smooth and clear as it ever has.</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite facial products.</li>
            <li> that, it hasn&#x27;t ever made my skin break out, it seems to keep that under control pretty darn well</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Was super highly recommended on some online skin stores</li>
            <li> I find it not quite as effective as the other BB cleanser I&#x27;ve tried (the creamy one), but it is definitely pretty luscious.  </li>
            <li> skin felt refreshed and clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so good that i will buy it again later if the price is low</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser; leaves even old skin soft and moist</li>
            <li> It is a high quality item that displays the best results when used in conjunction with small microfiber facial pads.</li>
            <li> The superior things about the product, which made it so pleasing to use in the past, have disappeared.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of a waxy texture, it doesn&#x27;t bother me or affect my skin, it&#x27;s just slightly noticeable and goes away after a bit, it&#x27;s not a problem for me</li>
            <li> anyone else has skin that drys easily like mine in specific spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like a syrup, though not as sticky with a strong orange scent and left a film of oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few years, and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love the bright orange scent (also a perk in the cold of winter).  </li>
            <li> -it feels really oily to me, and sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t rinse off well/</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much lather</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I used to use Skincueticals Gentle Cleanser</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too gentle.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very greasy feel after using.</li>
            <li> which does both and is gentle also.</li>
            <li> I immediately washed it off with some &#x27;real&#x27; cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew it wouldn&#x27;t lather, but it was too gentle.</li>
            <li> Cleans my skin well but gently.</li>
            <li> Very oily cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I think this is definitely worth a try if you&#x27;d like to start using natural skin care products.  </li>
            <li> It is very slimy during use and I feel like it stays on your face even after you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I really did not like this face wash.</li>
            <li> and I probably won&#x27;t be finishing the whole thing.</li>
            <li> gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> The product is very greasy and leaves a waxy film on your face.</li>
            <li> THe old product of this same brand (yellow/Orange bottle) was way better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m assuming it doesn&#x27;t foam because it&#x27;s a much more of a natural facial cleanser than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointing, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Formerly, this cleanser had a lovely natural fragrance of citrus.</li>
            <li> i will say to make sure to remove all remnants of the cleanser with a wash cloth, because otherwise you will have a sticky film on your face, but when you use it properly, it leaves your skin glowing and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can feel a very thin \\&quot;film\\&quot; of the orange oil on your face afterward, so make sure to rinse well with warm water.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is still going strong for me and my skin is nicer than it&#x27;s been in a long while.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect facial cleanser for anyone prone to dry, tight or flaking skin - and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of supposedly &#x27;gentle&#x27; cleansers.</li>
            <li> Much better than other cleansers with abrasive chemicals.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees actually leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Add a small amount of water to emulsify and it is a very different product which is both very effective yet oddly gentle.</li>
            <li> it smells more like old marmalade rather than a fresh squeeze of orange, more stale than I prefer.  </li>
            <li> Without actually cleaning my face and causing me discomfort, this face wash doesn&#x27;t have anything special in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve tried many other kinds, including mostly high-end products like Clinique.</li>
            <li> I now going to only purchase Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence Facial Cleanser because it not only does the job but also smells and feels so good.</li>
            <li> This is NOT what you want when you have combination skin and live in the Tropics!</li>
            <li> Fantastic for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> If your skin runs oily, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this very highly.&lt;br /&gt;There is oil in this, as it blatantly advertises, and it makes it smell great.</li>
            <li> It removed my mascara, cleaned my face, and left it feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I can no longer tell people they could frost a cake with it, as I could with the original formulation, but it smells the same and seems to work pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> This would be fantastic for dry, normal, or maybe combination skin.</li>
            <li> I forget what this rated, but I bought it, so it couldn&#x27;t have been too high.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser left my face feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I really liked the orange scent, however it not only reminded me a little too much of the Burt&#x27;s Bees orange toothpaste I bought for my granddaughters</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees for sensitive skin with cotton extract is much nicer.</li>
            <li> But if your face is just somewhat dry or you like a clean feeling when done washing your face, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.  </li>
            <li> I read long ago (when I worked for a well known brand of soaps and body washes) that oil dissolves oil, tried this and discovered it to be true.</li>
            <li> However, the scent is orange fresh from the grove terrific.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this I was subscribing to Proactiv but have opted for a facial routine that is more natural.</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s probably not the right product for me (oil-based cleansers tend to break me out, although this hasn&#x27;t yet -- I actually need something that&#x27;s a bit drying, this time of year).  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and that it&#x27;s all natural, but it feels a little TOO oily.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for such product, however, I used it twice for my first face wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a new cleanser ever since.</li>
            <li> I was leery of the new formula, but this is an acceptable substitute. .  </li>
            <li> If you tend to be super dry this might be helpful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It feels very different and &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; at first because it has no lathering agents.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily because I like to mix it up when it comes to product because I often develop an allergic reaction when I consistently use products.</li>
            <li> but I found that it didn&#x27;t clean my skin deep enough</li>
            <li> but then I realized that it was probably a good indicator that this stuff isn&#x27;t as harsh on skin as some of the previous products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The sides of my nose get really dry pretty easily, and this seems to make the skin flaky in that area and I am not a huge fan of that.</li>
            <li> It washed off cleanly and once I patted my face dry, any extra oiliness was gone.</li>
            <li> Never tried the old recipe</li>
            <li> Old recipe</li>
            <li> I like it for being natural without chemicals</li>
            <li> is so soft.</li>
            <li> Also, it says not to use near your eyes so now I have to have two cleansers anyway.</li>
            <li> sort of the same effect I get after using the Cetaphil gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> After trying to find the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Poppy Facial scrub, and discovering that absolutely nobody carries it anymore</li>
            <li> action to speak of.</li>
            <li> , I know it&#x27;s natural and organic now because there&#x27;s mold forming near the cap.</li>
            <li> But if you have really sensitive skin, you might want to find another cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% natural made with citrus.</li>
            <li> I keep one in the shower, one near the bathtub, one at the sink.</li>
            <li> But has natural oils.</li>
            <li> Bought this for acne wanted something natural to help with post pregnancy acne.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s 100% natural</li>
            <li> This cleanser is natural.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and almost everything seems to irritate it.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are all natural; you can see them in the product images if you zoom</li>
            <li> The orange oil in this product made my face extra greasy and felt very slimy.</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It looks like a natural product in the hands, without chemical textures or synthetic appearance.  </li>
            <li> Again, my skin is very sensitive and dry, and after just using this cleanser for the first time, I barely need a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I first use this on a dry face, than rinse off.</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a few days to get used to, but it is worth the wait!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It rinses cleanly, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the weird texture, it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> I even get compliments and a friend asked if I had done a facial peel because my skin looked so vibrant.</li>
            <li> This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much,</li>
            <li> It has all natural ingredients and does not dry out my sensitive skin for a fraction of the price of the Bobbi Balm.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have often had a hard time finding a facial cleanser that is sensitive enough and more natural.</li>
            <li> The back tells you that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin parched like other soapy cleansers and it&#x27;s absolutely true.</li>
            <li> When I first put this cleanser on my face, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This is my new daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks, my skin is much more naturally moisturized and breaks out much less frequently.</li>
            <li> My recommendation, put this on dry and rub in really well.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s oil-based, it removes all my makeup (even stubborn eye makeup) and leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry / stripped.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, so it is a shame that it causes my face to get dry around my nose, but it&#x27;s likely a problem with my skin and other people might not have this issue, but I found it worth mentioning anyhow in case</li>
            <li> Also because of the natural oils used in the product it leaves our skin clean w/o that tight , dry, stripped feeling you get from a lot of cleansers.</li>
            <li> I use the Citrus Facial Cleanser along with the Wild Lettuce Toner and Carrot Lotion, and I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> I also chose this because it apparently does not contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> This is a perk to my 41 year old skin, especially this winter!  </li>
            <li> Natural doesn&#x27;t equal non-irritating.</li>
            <li> One of the few face washes worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> if you have oily or maybe even normal skin, this is not for you, but really dry skin</li>
            <li> A small downside is that it also probably won&#x27;t clean very deeply, so if your face is sweaty or has makeup on it, you&#x27;d probably need to pre-wash or wipe it off or something first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was heart broken when my favorite facial cleanser, Skinmilk, was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since learned the foaming agents in most cleansers that we associate with &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; are actually making both wrinkles and blocked pores worse.</li>
            <li> When I first popped a little onto my face</li>
            <li> After about 10 seconds it smells more like burnt rubber, which is not ideal.</li>
            <li> The only one that I have found that reduces breakouts and does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin that always feels dry, and this cleanser may just be my solution!!</li>
            <li> This stuff moisturizes the dry parts, degreases the oily parts, and I only get a couple zits during that hormonal time of the month.    </li>
            <li> -it smells terrific, like you just peeled an orange in your shower/ if my skin is feeling really dry</li>
            <li> I think I can only use this whenever my face feels like it&#x27;s getting dry, like in the winter time.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and supple, and if you forget to tone or moisturize, your skin doesn&#x27;t feel like tight leather.</li>
            <li> will* weird you out and feel like it&#x27;s leaving a &#x27;film&#x27; on your skin, as many other reviewers have commented.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks of use the blockages in the pores have completely dissolved away.</li>
            <li> Bobbi Brown&#x27;s EXTRA Balm Rinse, which is $59 per jar 7.3 ounces, which I love, but is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a more natural cleanser and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I used the product before, I mixed it with a little sea salt to make a facial scrub</li>
            <li> You can wash your face once a day or 10x a day, and it won&#x27;t dry out.     </li>
            <li> my is rinse and dry</li>
            <li> Maybe if your face is REALLY dry or your skin can&#x27;t handle soap, you could try this.</li>
            <li> my face used to get dry and flaky, and i used to have acne all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have never liked the feel or texture of this product directly from the tube or even when it is initially applied to the face.</li>
            <li> I only need a little dab of it, so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off my face easily also so it just feels awkward.</li>
            <li> This was an odd facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about past or current ingredients that people are mentioning, or whether/how they&#x27;re different, so don&#x27;t ask me.</li>
            <li> only difference between the two is this has a little grit in it.  </li>
            <li> smell like orange n a little greasey that I rinse off and wash off with a facial soap cleanser</li>
            <li> Still once emulsified it works as it always did and possibly even hydrates a little better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little water and a spot of facial cleanser does the job.</li>
            <li> MINUS</li>
            <li> Ordered and received it a lot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> and I adore that, I&#x27;ve used other harsh facial cleansers that make my skin freak out and hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overly drying your skin can induce sebum production overdrive, which is how some people end up with oily, acne-ridden skin that is somehow also dry, tight or flaky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that tight dry feeling on my face that I get when using other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I usually follow it up with another facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> but then you can smell the other as you start rubbing it around.</li>
            <li> Will reorder when needed but that may be a while since it takes only a small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> And, according to other reviewers, the formula for this cleanser has changed.  </li>
            <li> I use this weekly or every other week.</li>
            <li> but it may bother some other people.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I always had trouble with breakouts and had been using a drugstore acne cleanser which gave me extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my skin, similar to the sensation of rubbing a mixture of delicate oils and fruit on my face.  </li>
            <li> Also, an interesting phenomenon is that my skin has adjusted to the oil base of the cleanser</li>
            <li> hope it won&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> Usage is usually determined by how dry my skin is.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not a very strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which i wasn&#x27;t used to based on my previous burt&#x27;s bees</li>
            <li> After spending years buying expensive skin products from a French company at the mall, I sampled Burt&#x27;s Bees Citrus Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> It will feel odd if you&#x27;re not used to cleaning with an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; but it works.</li>
            <li> My skin feels rejuvenated after cleansing, rather than feeling stripped, tight, and beat-up.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I went in search of a new cleanser.  </li>
            <li> but I have notice a little pimples like two.....</li>
            <li> It feels a little sore when you apply the cleanser to the face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll agree, that the no-lathering bit was weird at first, although I&#x27;ve read articles that speak against buying skin or hair products that lather, since the lathering is not really a good thing.</li>
            <li> I use heavy makeup, and this product is said to remove make up and dirt</li>
            <li> I thought it was just the cleanser working, so I kept with it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Dont waste ur money.</li>
            <li> It does not clean at all!</li>
            <li> con with this is that at least for my skin is slightly drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, so when you squeeze it from the tube you&#x27;re looking at it</li>
            <li> A Commenter has mentioned that Clorox bought this product from Burt&#x27;s Bees and is responsible for the disastrous rebranding.  </li>
            <li> Reordered recently and it must have been reformulated because it has a weird plastic/oil/Vaseline type smell now.</li>
            <li> cause I&#x27;m not entirely sure if the liquid is suppose to foam with bubbles.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch up my facewash (I usually use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Chamomile).</li>
            <li> i have been using this product every day for the past week</li>
            <li> This was annoying at first</li>
            <li> It felt hard to rinse off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent loads of money on expensive anti-aging treatments, turns out</li>
            <li> , I was forced to try something else.  </li>
            <li> Its a really thick product, and its just like putting honey on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for the past 10 years or so rates a 7!  </li>
            <li> I mean not one bubble even.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, but perhaps I didn&#x27;t understand what it was supposed to do in the first place.  </li>
            <li> My skin is seriously dry, and every winter it is dry and flaky and looks terrible.</li>
            <li> One reviewer said they were harmful or irritating to skin, and I&#x27;d agree with that.  </li>
            <li> There is something irritating in this cleanser.</li>
            <li> and so the seeming &#x27;film&#x27; that it leaves behind has diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not great at all.</li>
            <li> This new one (white/yellow) bottle is horrible.</li>
            <li> Hard water is bad on the skin.</li>
            <li> the oil makes my skin feel weird...</li>
            <li> and this is scary thought for someone that has acne.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is the worst facial cleanser that i ever used!</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have; It triggered the worst breakout I have ever had in my entire life, and I have been dealing with the aftermath for months now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy.    </li>
            <li> I tried switching to Burt&#x27;s Bees Cream Cleanser (because oil based cleansers can cause make up to smear easier unless you use a primer) and broke out like crazy after just a couple days.</li>
            <li> I was hugely shocked at the consistency and disappointed with the feel.</li>
            <li> , I am so disappointed after I wash my face with this</li>
            <li> No bubbles and sting my eyes badly!</li>
            <li> Worst of all, the texture has changed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Uck, didn&#x27;t like this at all.  It smells just like orange cleaner I use to remove grease on my boat... only difference between the two is this has a little grit in it.  Did not lather or bubble, did not leave skin feeling any different, didn&#x27;t do anything.  1.5 stars only because it did not make me break out.  Never tried the old recipe so I cannot compare.  This went right in trash after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling very soft.  Much better than other cleansers with abrasive chemicals.</li>
            <li> did not like the oily feeling it left on my face</li>
            <li> My favorite facial cleanser</li>
            <li> Works well and had good reviews from the Environmental Working Group for its ingredients.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence is awesome.  Because I use this, I very rarely have to use moisturizer, my skin always feels soft and fresh and it smells amazing.  I never have breakouts.  This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> People are used to sodium lauryl sulfate in most \\&quot;soaps\\&quot;, which strips the skin and that is why this product feels \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; to them. SLS is also the ingredient that causes a lather, which is why this product has no lather. Yes, it takes a few days to get used to, but it is worth the wait!    It leaves the skin smooth and supple, not greasy. I don&#x27;t even use a moisturizer anymore. And I switched from Eucerin Sensitive Skin, which is one of the best cleansers on the market. I used to have to cover up my blemishes at night after washing my face, because I didn&#x27;t want my boyfriend to see my zits. After a month or two of using this product, I don&#x27;t need makeup anymore. Seriously. You can wash your face once a day or 10x a day, and it won&#x27;t dry out.     It&#x27;s incredible, really.    I&#x27;m 28 with combination skin. This stuff moisturizes the dry parts, degreases the oily parts, and I only get a couple zits during that hormonal time of the month.    People say my skin is glowing now. This stuff is crazy.    *** Tip: Wash with filtered water too. Hard water is bad on the skin. ***</li>
            <li> I was heart broken when my favorite facial cleanser, Skinmilk, was discontinued. I&#x27;d been looking for a new cleanser ever since. Even though this cleanser is all natural (which I love!), initially, I had my doubts about this cleanser. I have combination to oily skin, and from the reviews I read, this cleanser works well on normal-to-dry skin. While washing my face with my hands, the cleanser felt oily (it doesn&#x27;t lather), but once I used a wash cloth to wipe my face, I felt differently. The cleanser left my face feeling so soft and clean. And the orange scent is delicious. It doesn&#x27;t leave that tight dry feeling on my face that I get when using other cleansers. What I also loved was that I didn&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer. The cleanser was moisturizing enough. It leaves my face feeling great all day. In a nutshell, this cleanser is all natural, smells wonderful, leaves skin soft and clean, and moisturizes as well. There&#x27;s nothing more I could want from a facial cleanser. This is my new daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> i should have read the description better. i didn&#x27;t realize it was oil based. the oil makes my skin feel weird... like it doesn&#x27;t come off all the way. which i wasn&#x27;t used to based on my previous burt&#x27;s bees face cleanser but my skin looks great so i&#x27;m not complaining!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have often had a hard time finding a facial cleanser that is sensitive enough and more natural. I love this one!</li>
            <li> I love this facewash, it keeps my face clear and clean. Makes my skin feel really smooth and does not leave any oily residue or anything</li>
            <li> I just purchased this facial cleanser today. I have highly sensitive skin that always feels dry, and this cleanser may just be my solution!! I have been looking for a all-natural cleanser, and this one is it for me! Again, my skin is very sensitive and dry, and after just using this cleanser for the first time, I barely need a moisturizer! I&#x27;ll agree, that the no-lathering bit was weird at first, although I&#x27;ve read articles that speak against buying skin or hair products that lather, since the lathering is not really a good thing. To sum it up, this cleanser smells wonderful, and hydrates beautifully. My skin feels so supple!! I am definitely going to stick to this cleanser!!!</li>
            <li> I use heavy makeup, and this product is said to remove make up and dirt, I am so disappointed after I wash my face with this it feels clammy/oily and it takes two bouts of toner to finish take off the dirt really what is the purpose of a cleanser that cannot clean the skin on its own.</li>
            <li> This was an odd facial cleanser. It smelled nice and felt warm on my face, but it didn&#x27;t foam or scrub or do any of the usual soapy behaviors I am used to. Did it clean my face? I guess so, but I will not repurchase. Burt&#x27;s Bees for sensitive skin with cotton extract is much nicer.</li>
            <li> THe old product of this same brand (yellow/Orange bottle) was way better. It cleansed your face and allowed you to feel fresh. This new one (white/yellow) bottle is horrible. It leaves your face feeling greasy. The old recipe was much better. Old recipe 4/5 stars, this recipe 1/5 stars.</li>
            <li> This clean my face well but I have notice a little pimples like two.....well I buy again....nope&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have acne and I&#x27;m starting to think this is a product for it....smell like orange n a little greasey that I rinse off and wash off with a facial soap cleanser&lt;br /&gt;When my is rinse and dry I put lotion</li>
            <li> I like this product, but don&#x27;t love it. I use a lot of Burts products and love 90% of them. PLUS-it smells terrific, like you just peeled an orange in your shower/ if my skin is feeling really dry it does feel better after I use it. MINUS-it feels really oily to me, and sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t rinse off well/ it doesn&#x27;t lather at all...I personally like a lather. This would probably be best for people with really dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband and i both love Burts Orange Facial Cleanser.  Although it seems somewhat \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; in texture it amazingly manages to clear up our adult break outs.  Also because of the natural oils used in the product it leaves our skin clean w/o that tight , dry, stripped feeling you get from a lot of cleansers.</li>
            <li> This product does not rinse from the face- it is supposed to, but after about three minutes of working with water, it just wasn&#x27;t coming off. I gave up and wiped it off with kleenex- an orange greasiness came off onto the sheets. Maybe if your face is REALLY dry or your skin can&#x27;t handle soap, you could try this. But if your face is just somewhat dry or you like a clean feeling when done washing your face, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it smells good.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is awesome!  I have tried several and this seems to work best for my skin.  Not drying or oily.</li>
            <li> Another winner from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  The orange scent is absolutely delicious.  It&#x27;s a gel, with an exfoliating texture.  I find it not quite as effective as the other BB cleanser I&#x27;ve tried (the creamy one), but it is definitely pretty luscious.  And, like all BB products, almost entirely organic and cruelty free! WIN!</li>
            <li> It smells nice but leaves my face greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t take my makeup off.  I am using bar soap to take my make up off until I can get a replacement wash.</li>
            <li> I was leery of the new formula, but this is an acceptable substitute. .  I can no longer tell people they could frost a cake with it, as I could with the original formulation, but it smells the same and seems to work pretty much the same.  It does seem a tad more drying.</li>
            <li> My skin is seriously dry, and every winter it is dry and flaky and looks terrible. that is before i found this face wash. i have used it the last 3 or 4 winters and it has been a life saver. if you have oily or maybe even normal skin, this is not for you, but really dry skin this is magic.</li>
            <li> I have found that this is the one product that does help cleanse my skin without drying it out. I do feel like I have a film leftover, but if you do the full regiment, it comes right off. (The toner cleans it off for me). Great product and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> It is too oily to me. I like the orange smell and as everything from Burt&#x27;s Bee I see quality on it, but it leaves my face oily after I wash it, something I don&#x27;t quite appreciate. I prefer the Clary Sage cleaning product from them.</li>
            <li> Gotten this before. The Fragrance is wonderful. While it feels tacky going on it does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> nice reliable face cleanser...even tastes good....I like it for being natural without chemicals</li>
            <li> After spending years buying expensive skin products from a French company at the mall, I sampled Burt&#x27;s Bees Citrus Facial Cleanser. From the second I opened the tube and smelled the delicious orange scent, I knew I had found an excellent product. It leaves your skin soft and supple, and if you forget to tone or moisturize, your skin doesn&#x27;t feel like tight leather. I use the Citrus Facial Cleanser along with the Wild Lettuce Toner and Carrot Lotion, and I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> I was worried that with its rather oily texture and that it doesn&#x27;t foam up, that my face wouldn&#x27;t get clean but it does and feels great. It&#x27;s not drying at all and I&#x27;m assuming it doesn&#x27;t foam because it&#x27;s a much more of a natural facial cleanser than I&#x27;m used to. I follow this up with rosewater toner and my skin is so soft. It feels hydrated without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Loved everything I&#x27;ve tried from Burts Bees</li>
            <li> Just received this a couple of days ago. I was looking for a rehydrating facial cleanser and I normally love Burt&#x27;s Bee products so I thought I will give it a shot. It has a delightful citrus smell if you like that. After reading the ingredients, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much lather but there was none. In fact, it felt though I was smearing water+oil on my skin and this is scary thought for someone that has acne. After attempting to wash the cleanser off my skin, it left a oil residue that was noticeable on my facial towel. I am not crazy about that. An hour later, my skin seem more supple and more moist which was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will try to use it daily for a week to give another update on the results.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Gives kind of a waxy-feel to the skin. Ordered and received it a lot sooner than expected. (Within a week)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel like it actually cleans my face, however it gets waterproof mascera off well and smells great (very orange). I usually follow it up with another facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this cleanser. I used to use Skincueticals Gentle Cleanser but it is more expensive so I took a chance on this product. I actually look forward to washing my face now. Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> Really does a good job at keeping your face moisturize but then also cleans it. Not to mention it smells GREAT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too gentle. My face doesn&#x27;t feel that clean after using it. I like their Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile wash MUCH better.</li>
            <li> smells good, makes my skin feel clean, so far I really like it. I love burts bees products, they rock</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleaners and this is by far my favorite.  It feels slightly warm when you are applying it and smells like a fresh orange.  Leaves me feeling energized for the day or re-energized for a night out.  The cleanser has a nice smooth texture and feels soft.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful face wash for drier skin.  It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I do not like the consistency of the product. It leaves a very greasy feel after using. Also, I used a toner following washing with this cleanser and there was a lot of face makeup that had not been removed with this cleanser. The smell is okay. Also, it says not to use near your eyes so now I have to have two cleansers anyway. I think I will just stay with Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Purpose which does both and is gentle also. I had just thought I&#x27;d try Burt&#x27;s Bees as I like most of their products.</li>
            <li> Felt like I had a film over my skin after I was done washing. Definitely did not improve my skin, pores, acne, nothing. The smell was good and I appreciate the environmentally safe ingredients which is why I&#x27;m giving this product 2 stars. Will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I recently found out after perusing the EWG&#x27;s skin deep website that the facial cleanser I&#x27;ve been using for the past 10 years or so rates a 7!  Eeep!  Needless to say, I went in search of a new cleanser.  I forget what this rated, but I bought it, so it couldn&#x27;t have been too high.  Anyway, I&#x27;m still searching for a &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; cleanser...this one didn&#x27;t do it for me.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with that soapy &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; feeling, as many cleansers do, but my face didn&#x27;t feel totally clean afterwards either...sort of the same effect I get after using the Cetaphil gentle cleanser.  If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then I&#x27;m sure this is fine...it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so good that i will buy it again later if the price is low&lt;br /&gt;and my sister likes this cleanser</li>
            <li> I got this at the local pharmacy for $75 just because it was cheaper than the Radiance cleanser with the same great reviews. When I first popped a little onto my face I was hugely shocked at the consistency and disappointed with the feel. It feels like a syrup, though not as sticky with a strong orange scent and left a film of oil on my face. This is NOT what you want when you have combination skin and live in the Tropics! I immediately washed it off with some &#x27;real&#x27; cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being cheap and not wanting to toss TT$75 down the drain, I cautiously attempted a second use and found it to be quite good! It washed off cleanly and once I patted my face dry, any extra oiliness was gone. Only clean, smooth, radiant and happily moisturised skin remained. It seems like it will work great on all skin types and persons with mature or sensitive skin will especially like it&#x27;s moisturising and non-stinging effects. Once you get past the weird texture, it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> Too greasy and oily; my face did not feel clean afterwards. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t lather, but it was too gentle. It smelled good, though.</li>
            <li> Was super highly recommended on some online skin stores but I found that it didn&#x27;t clean my skin deep enough and I was left feeling bit oily. If you tend to be super dry this might be helpful but I don&#x27;t so I won&#x27;t be using this anymore.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product. I wish it were easier to lather on, though. I love the company because it&#x27;s eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> Smells very tropical, citrusy and refreshing. Cleans my skin well but gently. It will feel odd if you&#x27;re not used to cleaning with an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; but it works. I read long ago (when I worked for a well known brand of soaps and body washes) that oil dissolves oil, tried this and discovered it to be true.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough. This facial cleanser does not lather.  It left my skin feeling oily and didn&#x27;t remove my eye make-up.  I don&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t be using it again.  It did smell nice, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Used to love this product but haven&#x27;t used it in several years. Reordered recently and it must have been reformulated because it has a weird plastic/oil/Vaseline type smell now. At first it smells like oranges but then you can smell the other as you start rubbing it around. When I used the product before, I mixed it with a little sea salt to make a facial scrub and it was amazing. Using it as a shave balm now.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has a wonderful scent.  It also took off my makeup wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt refreshed and clean and soft.  The texture was perfect - not sticky or gooey or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt so good, I think I&#x27;ll wash my face again with it - and not wait until tomorrow when there will be more makeup to remove!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT.. it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this product on Amazon. It is a high quality item that displays the best results when used in conjunction with small microfiber facial pads.</li>
            <li> After trying to find the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Poppy Facial scrub, and discovering that absolutely nobody carries it anymore (I&#x27;m guessing they took it out of production), I was forced to try something else.  I figured this would be a close facsimile.  But no.  It&#x27;s quite lovely, but my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean at all.  There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; action to speak of. I feel like I&#x27;m just rubbing something yummy, like honey, all over my face.  Very disappointed, but perhaps I didn&#x27;t understand what it was supposed to do in the first place.  Gonna give Burt&#x27;s one more chance with something more exfoliating, but I sure wish they&#x27;d just bring back my favorite: Lemon Poppy Facial Scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few years, and LOVE IT! Previously, I&#x27;ve tried many other kinds, including mostly high-end products like Clinique. I like this better. I only need a little dab of it, so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinses cleanly, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dried out. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s. It&#x27;s good at removing eye make-up, even waterproof mascara. It&#x27;s surprising given the way it feels in your hand, but it has never been a problem with my contact lenses. Some cleansers and moisturizers end up in my eyes and cloud up my contacts. This one never has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good price--better than what I just paid at Target earlier this week. I&#x27;m ordering some from here to take advantage of this price.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for such product, however, I used it twice for my first face wash and I didn&#x27;t feel any freshness or cleanness followed not to mention I didn&#x27;t feel this product makes a good lather, I will get back and see another one .&lt;br /&gt;On the contrary I feel my face now is more oily like if I  smudged an orange peel into my face ! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wish I could get a refund .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about past or current ingredients that people are mentioning, or whether/how they&#x27;re different, so don&#x27;t ask me. But if it matters to you, I had the one in the orange tube, not the white one.&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great cleanser. The back tells you that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin parched like other soapy cleansers and it&#x27;s absolutely true. This would be fantastic for dry, normal, or maybe combination skin. If your skin runs oily, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this very highly.&lt;br /&gt;There is oil in this, as it blatantly advertises, and it makes it smell great. This cleanser pretty much doesn&#x27;t produce suds at all, which again, is great for people with dry skin. A small downside is that it also probably won&#x27;t clean very deeply, so if your face is sweaty or has makeup on it, you&#x27;d probably need to pre-wash or wipe it off or something first.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel a very thin \\&quot;film\\&quot; of the orange oil on your face afterward, so make sure to rinse well with warm water. If that doesn&#x27;t appeal to you, you might want to avoid this product. But for me, this eliminates the need for toner and moisturizer to an extent.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is often pretty acne-prone and this hasn&#x27;t made it break out. If anything, my acne gets better when I use this cleanser. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:&lt;br /&gt;Well, I know it&#x27;s natural and organic now because there&#x27;s mold forming near the cap. So, yeah, beware.</li>
            <li> This product cleans your face very nicely and leaves it soft and refreshed not dried out. The orange scent is pleasant but doesn&#x27;t linger. Will reorder when needed but that may be a while since it takes only a small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> Very oily cleanser.  Love the smell and that it&#x27;s all natural, but it feels a little TOO oily.  I think I can only use this whenever my face feels like it&#x27;s getting dry, like in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for years. They have changed the formula. It is good, but not as good as the old formula. I will order it again as there is still nothing comparable that I have found, but I sure wish they had kept to the fantastic one I have been accustomed to for years!</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product again, after a while.  And, according to other reviewers, the formula for this cleanser has changed.  I would have to agree that it is not for the better.  I&#x27;ll say this, it is not a horrible cleanser, but it has some new ingredients and a longer list of them.  One reviewer said they were harmful or irritating to skin, and I&#x27;d agree with that.  It feels a little sore when you apply the cleanser to the face.  But when it is washed away, the feeling also goes away.&lt;br /&gt;  The scent is very pleasant, tropical.  But if you have really sensitive skin, you might want to find another cleanser.  The cleanser also leaves a sort of sticky or tacky kind of feel on your skin.  Who knows what causes this.  The review is surprising as most of the products from this line have been great.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I always had trouble with breakouts and had been using a drugstore acne cleanser which gave me extremely dry skin. After using this product for a few weeks, my skin is much more naturally moisturized and breaks out much less frequently. My face no longer feels &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; after I wash it, and that&#x27;s a good thing. This cleanser also has a very pleasant natural orange scent.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of an orange residue on your face.</li>
            <li> My recommendation, put this on dry and rub in really well. Then rinse off or get in the shower. Comes off easier that way.</li>
            <li> Love the orange essence of this product.  Leaves my face feeling fresh and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My friend turned me on to this facial cleaner and I really do love it.  It keeps you skin moist and has a really nice orange scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great product by burts bees. It&#x27;s 100% natural made with citrus. It helps with my blemish problem. I use it with burts bees peach and willow bark facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars cause I&#x27;m not entirely sure if the liquid is suppose to foam with bubbles. But it felt good :)</li>
            <li> Burning effect after using this. Will never buy their facial product anymore!</li>
            <li> This is about the best cleanser ever! It feels very different and &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; at first because it has no lathering agents. Doesn&#x27;t feel like it could possibly be doing its job of cleansing. Give it a chance, though. My pores have never been so clean. I used to have tiny blackheads all over but after a few weeks of use the blockages in the pores have completely dissolved away. I&#x27;m 45 and my skin looks as smooth and clear as it ever has. I even get comments about &amp;#34;aging in reverse&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve since learned the foaming agents in most cleansers that we associate with &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; are actually making both wrinkles and blocked pores worse. I&#x27;ve spent loads of money on expensive anti-aging treatments, turns out just this cleanser and a simple anti-age moistrizer is all I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it did such a good job unblocking my pores I recommended it to my acne-prone niece. She uses it 3 days a week along with her regular cleanser and it has greatly improved her complexion.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite face wash. I keep one in the shower, one near the bathtub, one at the sink. It is affordable and my skin loves it. I will warn you that if you have oily skin, this is likely not for you as it a bit oily. But has natural oils. My skin apparently needed because it loves it - it sucks it up and has not broken out!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash. The orange scent is a perfect wake up in the morning and feels invigorating on my skin. The orange oil removes all my makeup including waterproof mascara and at the same time moisturizes my skin.  Burts Bees reliably has the safest ingredients for everyone&#x27;s skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save, I get a nice discount.</li>
            <li> This is the worst facial cleanser that i ever used! It does not clean at all! No bubbles and sting my eyes badly! Not recommended</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to build up any suds. Kind of disappointing, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this for acne wanted something natural to help with post pregnancy acne. This left mY face feeling very clean, refreshed, and definitely smells amazing. Great cleanser but didn&#x27;t help any with my acne battle</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser; leaves even old skin soft and moist</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and see a big difference in my skin. I even get compliments and a friend asked if I had done a facial peel because my skin looked so vibrant. Love the smell and the fact that it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Looks great, she loves it.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Orange Essense Facial Cleanser used to be not just my favorite cleanser by far, but my favorite of Burt&#x27;s Bees whole line. I&#x27;ve used this product, very happily, for years. However, this time I received an Orange Essence which was noticeably different, and not in a good way. Burt&#x27;s Bees seems to have rebranded the item without providing necessary information on the changes. Although some Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; suppliers have denied it, the formula is different. It looks, smells and feels inferior to the original. Formerly, this cleanser had a lovely natural fragrance of citrus. Now the smell is chemical. Even the container is not as pleasing. The peach-colored tube with attractive graphics has now become a peculiar off-white. Worst of all, the texture has changed. The cleanser itself is looser. Toward the end of the tube, it suddenly turned into this watery gush. Aesthetically, it was revolting.  The superior things about the product, which made it so pleasing to use in the past, have disappeared. P.S. A Commenter has mentioned that Clorox bought this product from Burt&#x27;s Bees and is responsible for the disastrous rebranding.  Burt&#x27;s Bees must have made these changes with a view to cheaper manufacturing costs. Was it really worth it to disappoint long-time fans of the product, and to dishonor their own respected brand name?</li>
            <li> Use it every day. Smells good, cleans gently :)</li>
            <li> Has good smell but dirt and make up stay still on my skin. really wonder why people give more than 2 starts for this product.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. Make sure you use a makeup remover before using it however because it does not contain ingredients that will cut through makeup. This was annoying at first but then I realized that it was probably a good indicator that this stuff isn&#x27;t as harsh on skin as some of the previous products I&#x27;ve used. I also chose this because it apparently does not contain alcohol. Alcohol in skin products contributes to breakdown of cell-structure and premature aging.  I&#x27;d recommend it, but maybe not for oily skin types. Although it&#x27;s cleared up the breakout I had on my forehead, so maybe it would work for all skin types.</li>
            <li> It is greasy and no make up get cleaned off face unless I use a washcloth vigorously. Might be good for your skin but the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clean is it&#x27;s downfall.</li>
            <li> This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much, hope it won&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite face wash for years.  The only one that I have found that reduces breakouts and does not dry out my skin.  Honest, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  Because it&#x27;s oil-based, it removes all my makeup (even stubborn eye makeup) and leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry / stripped.  This is a perk to my 41 year old skin, especially this winter!  I love the bright orange scent (also a perk in the cold of winter).  Because it&#x27;s 100% natural it does not foam like traditional facial cleansers; It simply melts into your hands and skin. I think this is definitely worth a try if you&#x27;d like to start using natural skin care products.  It&#x27;s also affordable.</li>
            <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t do anything. It is very slimy during use and I feel like it stays on your face even after you wash it off. I stopped using it after a couple of times and now it just sits in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son, he loves it. Every day he uses it, and he likes the orange smell. This cleanser is natural.</li>
            <li> I love the orange fragrance! It makes my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I have never liked the feel or texture of this product directly from the tube or even when it is initially applied to the face. It has sort of a greasy consistency despite the fact that that it has glycerine in it. However, the scent is orange fresh from the grove terrific. Add a small amount of water to emulsify and it is a very different product which is both very effective yet oddly gentle. It leaves the skin fresh, clean and glowing. It does not leave a greasy residue, but it does a wonderful job hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for years; definitely over a decade. I don&#x27;t use it daily because I like to mix it up when it comes to product because I often develop an allergic reaction when I consistently use products. I use this weekly or every other week. Usage is usually determined by how dry my skin is. The formula used was changed recently and I think it is a tad greasier now. Still once emulsified it works as it always did and possibly even hydrates a little better.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am a BB fan this is one of my favorite facial products.</li>
            <li> When I first put this cleanser on my face, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  It didn&#x27;t lather, and it felt greasy.  But, wow, I fell in love with its&#x27; citrus scent.  It removed my mascara, cleaned my face, and left it feeling smooth and soft.  Not greasy at all!  It&#x27;s fragrance alone is enough to make this a favorite of elmosnaturals, but the product is so much more!</li>
            <li> I really liked the orange scent, however it not only reminded me a little too much of the Burt&#x27;s Bees orange toothpaste I bought for my granddaughters BUT there was NO lather at all. I mean not one bubble even.  It&#x27;s a little thick, so when you squeeze it from the tube you&#x27;re looking at it wondering how this will work..I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> So I have used this for over a year now and have gone through the bottle, figured I might give my two cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is premo for removing make-up, it takes it right off and cleans up your face good, I love Lush&#x27;s Ultra Bland more for the moisturizing aspect, but it doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job with removing make-up. This does the job and that is what I like the most about it and what you need with a cleanser is really excellent make-up removal.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells awesome, it makes your face smell like delicious oranges and it smells so good and awesome and it&#x27;s a non-irritating fragrance too. However this does kind of leave a texture to my face, it&#x27;s kind of a waxy texture, it doesn&#x27;t bother me or affect my skin, it&#x27;s just slightly noticeable and goes away after a bit, it&#x27;s not a problem for me but it may bother some other people.&lt;br /&gt;With that, it hasn&#x27;t ever made my skin break out, it seems to keep that under control pretty darn well and I adore that, I&#x27;ve used other harsh facial cleansers that make my skin freak out and hurt.&lt;br /&gt;My con with this is that at least for my skin is slightly drying. The sides of my nose get really dry pretty easily, and this seems to make the skin flaky in that area and I am not a huge fan of that. I really like this product, so it is a shame that it causes my face to get dry around my nose, but it&#x27;s likely a problem with my skin and other people might not have this issue, but I found it worth mentioning anyhow in case anyone else has skin that drys easily like mine in specific spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy this product, but I am going to look for a more moisturizing and hydrating cleanser next, (maybe I&#x27;ll give Burt&#x27;s hydrating cleanser a shot). I would most definitely recommend this for it&#x27;s awesome smell and make-up cleaning properties, but if you have sensitive or dry skin I would keep looking for a moisturizing product, or just not give a rip and use it anyway because it does do an awesome cleansing job.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch up my facewash (I usually use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Chamomile). I regretted the purchase quickly. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it washes my face at all! It feels like it just moves it all around my face and then I have to rinse this gook off of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: smells great and does improve skin smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Wash with chamomile at night to remove makeup. Wash with orange cleanser in the am.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and almost everything seems to irritate it. This is the only face wash I have found that I can use daily without irritation. It also has a great smell and texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this cleanser that set me off, but when I started using it, it made both my hands and my face feel hot. I thought it was just the cleanser working, so I kept with it for a few days. I shouldn&#x27;t have; It triggered the worst breakout I have ever had in my entire life, and I have been dealing with the aftermath for months now. I&#x27;ve switched back to facedoctor soap, and am never going back. I don&#x27;t even have very sensitive skin. There is something irritating in this cleanser. Maybe too much essential oil. Natural doesn&#x27;t equal non-irritating. Proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> What can I say...when used properly...the cleanser works. A little water and a spot of facial cleanser does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the right cleanser for me, but it will definitely be great for some people.  My issue is mostly that this is oil-based, and although oil-based cleansers are popular these days, they don&#x27;t seem to be right for my skin (combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily T-zone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great (and it even tastes good, as I found when it got in my mouth -- not that I would suggest eating it).  I like that the ingredients are all natural; you can see them in the product images if you zoom in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing this is very good at is removing oil-based makeup.  I feel like I have less makeup coming off with my toner, which means this is doing a good job of getting rid of the makeup in my first cleansing step.  That would be great if you&#x27;re also using an oil-based makeup and/or want to reduce the number of products in your skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this very gentle and non-irritating.  I do use a toner afterwards, which would remove any remaining residue from my skin (I find that oil-based cleansers often leave residue and this one is no exception, although it&#x27;s quite light compared to some competing products).  This is detergent-free and will not foam or lather, so be prepared for that.  I find this moisturizing and non-drying, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I will use this until my current bottle runs out, although it&#x27;s probably not the right product for me (oil-based cleansers tend to break me out, although this hasn&#x27;t yet -- I actually need something that&#x27;s a bit drying, this time of year).  I can definitely see this working for some people, though, and it should fit in many people&#x27;s budgets.  3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees facial cleanser is the best facial wash I have used.  Burt&#x27;s Bees actually leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.  I now going to only purchase Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence Facial Cleanser because it not only does the job but also smells and feels so good.</li>
            <li> Bobbi Brown&#x27;s EXTRA Balm Rinse, which is $59 per jar 7.3 ounces, which I love, but is very expensive. I was really excited when I found out about this product. It has all natural ingredients and does not dry out my sensitive skin for a fraction of the price of the Bobbi Balm. It has alot of the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> The initial smell of the facial cleanser is what you would expect - orangey &amp; delightful. After about 10 seconds it smells more like burnt rubber, which is not ideal. However, it&#x27;s not a very strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the cleanser seems to be helping my skin. If anything, I haven&#x27;t had more break outs. Prior to using this I was subscribing to Proactiv but have opted for a facial routine that is more natural. Hoping that this cleanser will continue to fix my skin.</li>
            <li> I first use this on a dry face, than rinse off. I enjoy the fresh orange smell!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it cleans. It doesn&#x27;t come off my face easily also so it just feels awkward.</li>
            <li> While I never used the older formula and so can&#x27;t compare the two, this new mix is wonderful. This is the perfect facial cleanser for anyone prone to dry, tight or flaking skin - and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of supposedly &#x27;gentle&#x27; cleansers. If you&#x27;re used to cleansers stripping your skin, this one *will* weird you out and feel like it&#x27;s leaving a &#x27;film&#x27; on your skin, as many other reviewers have commented. It&#x27;s not, it just also isn&#x27;t stripping all of the sebum from your skin, which is better for you! Being oil based, it&#x27;s basically a more convenient alternative to the OCM (oil cleansing method). Overly drying your skin can induce sebum production overdrive, which is how some people end up with oily, acne-ridden skin that is somehow also dry, tight or flaky. I can&#x27;t comment on this cleanser&#x27;s effectiveness at treating teen acne, but it has been great for mine as an adult!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIX WEEK UPDATE:  This cleanser is still going strong for me and my skin is nicer than it&#x27;s been in a long while. I still get the occasional zit and some blackheads (nothing&#x27;s perfect) but the overall quality (elasticity, texture, etc.) of my skin has greatly improved. Also, an interesting phenomenon is that my skin has adjusted to the oil base of the cleanser and so the seeming &#x27;film&#x27; that it leaves behind has diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point I tried switching to Burt&#x27;s Bees Cream Cleanser (because oil based cleansers can cause make up to smear easier unless you use a primer) and broke out like crazy after just a couple days. I immediately switched *back* to the Orange Essence, and my skin cleared up after about a week. So Orange Essence for me is it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell but feel it leaves a coating after washing.</li>
            <li> i decided to give this a try because of the simplicity of the ingredients. i love it! my face used to get dry and flaky, and i used to have acne all over my forehead. i have been using this product every day for the past week and i can say that those problems have disappeared! i will say to make sure to remove all remnants of the cleanser with a wash cloth, because otherwise you will have a sticky film on your face, but when you use it properly, it leaves your skin glowing and soft.</li>
            <li> I really did not like this face wash. It didn&#x27;t take any of my make-up off and burned my eyes. Without actually cleaning my face and causing me discomfort, this face wash doesn&#x27;t have anything special in my opinion. The orange scent was nice but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a more natural cleanser and was disappointed. It is definitely not for oily or combination skin. The orange oil in this product made my face extra greasy and felt very slimy. It felt hard to rinse off and I probably won&#x27;t be finishing the whole thing. The product smells very good, but probably is best for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for my dry skin. Works wonderfully with a warm, wet washcloth. My skin feels rejuvenated after cleansing, rather than feeling stripped, tight, and beat-up. Love the orange scent.</li>
            <li> I love citrus and this smells just like a juicy orange. Love it!</li>
            <li> Its a really thick product, and its just like putting honey on your face.</li>
            <li> One of the few face washes worth purchasing. Fresh orange scent; gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells good but that&#x27;s about the only good thing about it. The product is very greasy and leaves a waxy film on your face. It also starts to develop mold around the edges of the cap after a day or two.</li>
            <li> I love anything by Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is my favorite.  It has a great smell, and does the job.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not great at all. Dont waste ur money.</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients.  It looks like a natural product in the hands, without chemical textures or synthetic appearance.  I like the way it feels on my skin, similar to the sensation of rubbing a mixture of delicate oils and fruit on my face.  It cleanses thoroughly removing makeup and sunblock lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t strip my skin dry and instead leaves a nice moisture after wash.  The only drawback is the scent-- it smells more like old marmalade rather than a fresh squeeze of orange, more stale than I prefer.  Overall a good, natural cleanser.</li>
