    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My son is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work great for whiteheads though.  </li>
            <li>Smells great too</li>
            <li>this product worked great for my pre-teen.</li>
            <li>All the products are amazing and do not break me out even the lotion!</li>
            <li>Smelled good, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>My make up seems to look good even after hours of being on the go.</li>
            <li>very very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love and will buy again!</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>and the product has a nice herbal smell.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m impressed so far.</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and good too.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This was one of many products we have tried.  </li>
            <li>Proactive works better</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.....</li>
            <li>which I never have been able to do before.</li>
            <li>I can even go make up free...</li>
            <li>At first, I was incredibly pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>For her it is probably good to use with the Dermalogica Oil Free Moisturizer or to use only when she has breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>be fair, I have tried Proactiv, Neutrogena, Acnefree, Clearasil, prescription topical antibiotics, and all sorts of over the shelf products to no avail.</li>
            <li>I ordered this 2 days ago, very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It was cleaner and fresh.</li>
            <li>it could just continue to work as it did for me at first</li>
            <li>and I thought they disappeared pretty fast.</li>
            <li>From the very first time she used it I noticed a marked difference in her skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably a great kit for typical acne prone teenage skin.</li>
            <li>It gives you step by step directions for all the treatments in it which is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Skin finally clear!!!</li>
            <li>I even had to ordered the full size product and now this line is in my daily face care routine !</li>
            <li>Her skin was vibrant and supple  not taut like the out products she had used before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really use each of the item in the kit or followed the instructions religiously since I only wanted to buy to clear the blackheads and more for hubby.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin oily t zone and normal everywhere else.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 to 3 weeks to clear me up but it worked!</li>
            <li>Helps at first but then actually made my face break out.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever try a product for my face and does what it made for in a short time !</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised by this product!</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be smaller according to most reviews, but this kit is plenty enough for about a month&#x27;s worth of use if you use small amounts.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t clear up my skin, but it makes me feel refreshed?</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since my freshman year</li>
            <li>I bought this kit for my 13 year old daughter because I like Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li>My son (11 yrs old)  is using this as an intro to learning how to take care of his skin.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 17 year old daughter who was having a lot of breakouts.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old son had been struggling with mild-moderate acne on his face and nothing seemed to help.  </li>
            <li>I think overall it is good, but it will dry out your skin (another reason why I didn&#x27;t use it everyday), so you really need to put more lotion than just use what came with the kit (at least for my dry skin).  </li>
            <li>was clear ( no new breakout) and</li>
    </ol>

            <li> After feeling like I have tried everything throughout my entire high school years, I finally found a system that works and isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin!</li>
            <li> The package was pretty late but the product made up for it.</li>
            <li> the pimples I had were flat and almost gone .</li>
            <li> I have moderate to heavy moderate acne, and after the first few days I had no new pimples!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to people who have had trouble clearing up their acne because it definitely works!</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently to different products, but for the price it&#x27;s not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> The product is a bit pricey and the starter, has the basic required products however they are very small and may only last a month of continued usage.</li>

            <li> After a few days of regular use she found that the products were too drying for her skin.  </li>
            <li> We will continue to use this through the next few years!</li>
            <li> Average to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another somewhat annoying thing is that the pieces are small, and there are many.</li>

            <li> Nothing spectacular. Average to me. Helps at first but then actually made my face break out. I have oily skin and this did not help me.</li>
            <li> My 10 year-old has been breaking out with an occasional pimple for a couple years already, but recently her breakouts have turned into full-on acne. It&#x27;s only been a week, but her face has cleared up dramatically! She was initially hesitant because of all the steps, but it&#x27;s become routine now.</li>
            <li> Ordered this kit for my younger sister who&#x27;s going through a bit of acne at the age of 13. I ordered this 2 days ago, very fast shipping! Everything got here in one piece, nothing broken nor faulty. I was expecting this to be smaller according to most reviews, but this kit is plenty enough for about a month&#x27;s worth of use if you use small amounts. It smells very fresh and good too. It also came with a sample of their cooling masque as well! I will update after a few weeks of use but I&#x27;m impressed so far. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my 13 year old daughter because I like Dermalogica products. Her skin is not oily but she does get a few breakouts here and there.  After a few days of regular use she found that the products were too drying for her skin.

            <li> The package was pretty late but the product made up for it. I saw results within just one use. It gives you step by step directions for all the treatments in it which is very helpful. I would definitely recommend this to people who have had trouble clearing up their acne because it definitely works!</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently to different products, but for the price it&#x27;s not worth the risk. Smelled good, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re faithful at using it as directed it will work! It took about 2 to 3 weeks to clear me up but it worked! I&#x27;m in love and will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever try a product for my face and does what it made for in a short time ! I even had to ordered the full size product and now this line is in my daily face care routine ! I love it</li>
            <li> My son (11 yrs old)  is using this as an intro to learning how to take care of his skin.  So far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 17 year old daughter who was having a lot of breakouts. From the very first time she used it I noticed a marked difference in her skin. It was cleaner and fresh. Her skin was vibrant and supple  not taut like the out products she had used before.&lt;br /&gt;There is one drawback; the price. The product is a bit pricey and the starter, has the basic required products however they are very small and may only last a month of continued usage.</li>
            <li> This was one of many products we have tried.  My 13 year old son had been struggling with mild-moderate acne on his face and nothing seemed to help.  This system DID!  We will continue to use this through the next few years!</li>
            <li> My son is very happy with this product. His acne is clearing without any of the redness and over-exfoliation caused by drug store and prescription products he has used in the past.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t clear up my skin, but it makes me feel refreshed? Proactive works better</li>
            <li> I took a chance and bought this kit. I have tried everything and always had breakouts no matter what the product promised. I don&#x27;t have crazy breakouts but always a pimple on my face no matter what. I was totally surprised by this product! First day and the two pimples I had were noticeably small the next morning and three days in I was clear ( no new breakout) and the pimples I had were flat and almost gone . the system is totally work a try. I have combination skin oily t zone and normal everywhere else. My make up seems to look good even after hours of being on the go. I love this stuff.....I feel like I finally have the skin I always wanted....I can even go make up free...which I never have been able to do before. All the products are amazing and do not break me out even the lotion! I say try it and hopefully it will work for you too</li>
            <li> I bought it based on Candace Johnson&#x27;s (the makeup artist from Youtube) recommendation.  I didn&#x27;t really use each of the item in the kit or followed the instructions religiously since I only wanted to buy to clear the blackheads and more for hubby.  I believe it works.  I think it also reduces the pores as well. Hubby did have lots of breakouts, but after a while it stopped.  He doesn&#x27;t really see a change with his skin, but again he has some crazy sensitive skin.  I think overall it is good, but it will dry out your skin (another reason why I didn&#x27;t use it everyday), so you really need to put more lotion than just use what came with the kit (at least for my dry skin).  It doesn&#x27;t work great for whiteheads though.  I used on a couple pimples and I thought they disappeared pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my face in just 3 days!!!!</li>
            <li> Skin finally clear!!! Smells great too</li>
            <li> this product worked great for my pre-teen. it cleared her skin without over drying it. and the product has a nice herbal smell. very very pleased.</li>
            <li> At first, I was incredibly pleased with this product. I have moderate to heavy moderate acne, and after the first few days I had no new pimples! But, it was not meant to be. By week 3 I was breaking out just as bad as I had been before this product (I was using a Neutrogena then).&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I have tried Proactiv, Neutrogena, Acnefree, Clearasil, prescription topical antibiotics, and all sorts of over the shelf products to no avail. The only thing that has ever seemed to work is a birth control pill, so maybe it would work for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;If it could just continue to work as it did for me at first I would give it 5 stars; I have been using it for about 7 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;Another somewhat annoying thing is that the pieces are small, and there are many. I lose them on my counter a lot.</li>
            <li> After feeling like I have tried everything throughout my entire high school years, I finally found a system that works and isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin! My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since my freshman year and I finally have a solution after 3 years!</li>
