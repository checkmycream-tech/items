            <li> Received the item yesterday, item arrived earlier than the ETA. Couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!  After using it last night, my skin feels great after, feels clean yet not dry. I also noticed that my makeup goes on a lot smoother this morning. Not sure if its because of the mask but definitely going to keep on using this product!</li>

            <li> With Prime I received this in two days.  Love the mask for the smell (heavenly bananas) and the feeling of doing something pampering for my skin, though I&#x27;m not sure it made a difference in my combination skin after just one use.... but I even MORE loved all the samples I received!!! I got a sample of facial scrub/wash that will last at least 20 uses... a HolikaHolika lip gloss (full size) and an Etude House lip balm (full size) and something else I&#x27;m blanking on right now... super happy with this shipper, will order again!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I already can feel a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Although Amazon totally shipped it VERY messily. The product was spilled all over the plastic wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;I still give it 5 stars! Awesome! Will buy again in future.</li>

            <li> This worked exactly as expected. I bought this along with the egg white mask. This one was for moisturizing, the egg white one is for pore refining . They both work great and exactly as specified. I also bought the DIY Compressed facial masks (paper masks) that expand when put in water. I just put one of those in water, then put this on the mask and throw the entire thing on my face. It works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my face feel so smooth and clean. It is my number one go to wash mask. I really love how my face feels after the mask. . . Great product and I 100% reccomend it to anyone.</li>

            <li> Save your money.  It didn&#x27;t even make my skin feel good.  Look for something out of your refrigerator or cupboard and don&#x27;t waste any money on this product.  The list of ingredients will knock your socks off.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feeling after using.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin is really softer after the wash off.&lt;br /&gt;The smell make you feel this is the natural product!</li>

            <li> This is great for adding moisture and hydration back into your skin. I use it twice a week and apply a sheer layer, which I leave on for  15-20 mins after massaging into my skin.  it definitely helps rejuvenate me and will be staple in my beauty routine for as long as it is available. It has a very faint banana scent that I adore and I accidentally discovered it also taste strangely like them as well? Haha. I will continue to try more SkinFood products in the future and encourage you to do the same.</li>
