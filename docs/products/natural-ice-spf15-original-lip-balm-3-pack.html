            <li>The shipping rates were very reasonable, the product was shipped quickly, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>The shipping was more than the product whish was lip balm,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find a vendor on Amazon that sells them.</li>
            <li>I love that this chapstick doesn&#x27;t have the sunblock flavor or smell that some do.</li>
            <li>Better to use Aquaphor it that case.</li>
            <li>Yea, it&#x27;s my wifes favorite</li>
            <li>I only use this chapstick its the best I have tried others</li>
            <li>So glad I</li>
            <li>love product and price</li>
            <li>I love the way it protects my lips as well as how it makes them look.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for the internet, Amazon and this supplier for making it available to me!</li>

            <li>The cherry one is ok, but I did want to try what I had originally ordered.</li>
            <li>quick shipping too!</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner in original packaging.</li>
            <li>it feels as if it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave a thick film, this is a great product!</li>
            <li>If I feel chapped lips coming on, I apply this stuff and it is healed super quick.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>my favorite lip dip, if you&#x27;ve never tried Natural Ice, I recommend trying.</li>
            <li>Natural Ice is absolutely my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it right before going in the store.  </li>
            <li>This product cannot be found in local drug stores but has been my favorite for years, making it worth the postage to order over the internet.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product but the shipping charge was so out of line that you should look to whom you contract with outside your organization.</li>
            <li>I would have returned it, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the original Natural Ice, but got the Medicated Cherry one instead.</li>
            <li>I really like this product so have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I tried it as a free sample at the age of 13 and never looked back.</li>
            <li>It feels cool as mint when you first apply it on your dry lips</li>
            <li>For me, the Natural Ice (mentholatum) is more healing than other lip balms.  </li>
            <li>When you know something works for you, it&#x27;s worth the postage if you can&#x27;t buy it locally.</li>
            <li>I wear it everyday &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>Once you have had lips in trouble and tried this, you will do anything to find more.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY lip balm that I have ever used that actually makes my lips not only feel better, but improves their texture without feeling like my lips are covered with wax.</li>
            <li>The only other place I&#x27;ve been able to find it is Walgreens, but with the SPF 15</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s almost completely made of petroleum, which does not absorb, but rather sits on your lips and holds in moisture (for me</li>
            <li>I was hoping this was better, but this lip balm was extremely thick and waxy and didnt absorb on my lips.</li>
            <li>Natural Ice is my favorite chapstick and they&#x27;re increasingly hard to find OTC at any local store.  </li>
            <li>It had completely liquefied and the entire tube spilled all over my clothes.</li>
            <li>I am a little lazy and don&#x27;t spend too much time on my appearance but my lips dry up pretty fast</li>
            <li>Hard to find but totally worth the search</li>

            <li> I have long used this product, but it has been increasingly difficult to find it in my local stores.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a simple minty lip balm with an SPF.</li>
            <li> It is medicated which gives it a soothing feel but not a strong scent.</li>
            <li> As chapped lip weather is coming at us like a freight train I&#x27;d been looking for it in our small town but couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li> When you apply it, your lips will be ice cold for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> Never had painful chapped lips ever since I started using this.</li>

            <li> my favorite lip dip, if you&#x27;ve never tried Natural Ice, I recommend trying.</li>

            <li> Good stuff!!! Good service and delivery time. Thanks!!</li>

As chapped lip weather is coming at us like a freight train I&#x27;d been looking for it in our small town but couldn&#x27;t find it.  When you know something works for you, it&#x27;s worth the postage if you can&#x27;t buy it locally. The shipping rates were very reasonable, the product was shipped quickly, so I&#x27;m happy. (Richard&#x27;s wife.)</li>

            <li> Natural Ice is my favorite chapstick and they&#x27;re increasingly hard to find OTC at any local store.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find a vendor on Amazon that sells them.</li>
            <li> This is really hard to find in local stores around me. I love that this chapstick doesn&#x27;t have the sunblock flavor or smell that some do. Nice,  tingling feeling from the menthol. Caution: If lips are already chapped, the menthol may lend to that &amp;#34;burning feeling&amp;#34; my children describe. Better to use Aquaphor it that case.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner in original packaging.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it in your car!  I tried to use it right before going in the store.  I was horrified when it poured all over my clothes.  I doubt it will wash out.  It had completely liquefied and the entire tube spilled all over my clothes.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years...highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Yea, it&#x27;s my wifes favorite</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm! It is one of the few that does not dry my lips out! I like the original and cherry!! It doesn&#x27;t leave a yucky taste either.</li>
            <li> Good quality. It feels cool as mint when you first apply it on your dry lips</li>
            <li> I only use this chapstick its the best I have tried others but there is no comparison.  Hard to find but totally worth the search</li>
            <li> Natural Ice is absolutely my favorite lip balm. The consistency of this is different from all the other ones that are sold in stores. This one is &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; if that makes any sense, so the balm lasts longer once put on your lips.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm! I am a little lazy and don&#x27;t spend too much time on my appearance but my lips dry up pretty fast and they hurt. However, this lip balm feels so good when applied, I feel motivated to keep applying it! lol. Seriously! And it works great. Never had painful chapped lips ever since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this lip balm forever .&lt;br /&gt;Love it! So glad I i googled it and you had it Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY lip balm that I have ever used that actually makes my lips not only feel better, but improves their texture without feeling like my lips are covered with wax. And I have tried every brand I could get my hands on.</li>
            <li> love product and price</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was better, but this lip balm was extremely thick and waxy and didnt absorb on my lips. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s almost completely made of petroleum, which does not absorb, but rather sits on your lips and holds in moisture (for me thats non-existant). Also the label is blurry and looks printed on so i wonder if this is legit or just a knock-off.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a simple minty lip balm with an SPF. I wear it everyday &amp; love it. Good price too.</li>
            <li> This product cannot be found in local drug stores but has been my favorite for years, making it worth the postage to order over the internet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 18 years. I tried it as a free sample at the age of 13 and never looked back. I love the way it protects my lips as well as how it makes them look. If I feel chapped lips coming on, I apply this stuff and it is healed super quick. I cannot find it in any stores however, so I was very happy to find them here. quick shipping too!</li>

            <li> Natural Ice is THE best chapstick around. The only other place I&#x27;ve been able to find it is Walgreens, but with the SPF 15 it is a must. Great in the winter too when you have severe chapped lips.</li>
