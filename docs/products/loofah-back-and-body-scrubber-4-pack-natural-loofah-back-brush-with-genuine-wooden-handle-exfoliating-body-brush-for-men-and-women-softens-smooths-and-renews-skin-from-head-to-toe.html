            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for for free or at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for exfoliating areas that normally get neglected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky to get to test these for a discount for my honest and unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>Which was surprising because I was fairly gentle with the product.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I couldn&#x27;t be more excited to purchase these because I had already purchased the body sponge and body mitt</li>
            <li>cheap product, sponge came off the stick in the 1st use (went through three in 3 days...</li>
            <li>Great for back...</li>
            <li>While I received this complimentary for my review, I reserve 5 start reviews for those products I truly love.  </li>
            <li>So if you need a great back brush this is it.</li>
            <li>finding this one, the back and body scrubber is just as amazing!</li>
            <li>But there is a significant flaw.</li>
            <li>I split the pack with my son&#x27;s grandma&#x27;s for mother&#x27;s day knowing the long handles will be great for them.  </li>
            <li>It would make a super cute gift to someone when gifted with a bottle of soft soap or lotion for example.  </li>
            <li>They can in a nice clear plastic bag with each of the four body scrubbers</li>
            <li>I loved my loofah body and loofah body mitt that I had to purchase the loofah back and body scrubber!</li>
            <li>I love the high quality of these along with the ease of usage for myself.</li>
            <li>It makes keep them fresh and smooth so much easier.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different back and body scrubbers and this is simply one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li>my own and no further compensation was received.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the handle and the ability to hang dry these</li>
            <li>You will love the Beverly Hills Beauty Supply Loofah Back and Body Scrubber!</li>
            <li>Your skin feels so silky soft and smooth after using.</li>
            <li>A dollar store product would last longer and be better.  </li>
            <li>fell off handle with first use not even one swipe.</li>
            <li>first one I used broke on the first use...just came apart in the shower..</li>
            <li>This was my first loofah</li>
            <li>skin looks better on my lower legs, I can reach all areas of my back</li>
            <li>Well, the handle fell off the first one on the first day.  </li>
            <li>I love using loofah to exfoliate my skin as I take my shower, but I can never seem to get my back.  </li>
            <li>That is no longer an issue, with the Loofah Back &amp; Body scrubber, you can now reach your back and make sure the skin is exfoliated and healthy.</li>
            <li>The loofah fell off of the stick midway through the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t easy and with the loofah back scrubber you get to reach it and get a fresh feeling..</li>
            <li>The loofah exfoliates the dead skin cells helping your tanning product glide on more evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love the long handles on these.  </li>
            <li>I was given a chance to test this product, and two other sponge/loofah products, and I&#x27;m loving all of them so much.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and I&#x27;ve found no trouble with odor.</li>
            <li>With modern spray lotion you are all set to have a smooth back all by yourself...</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it would be nice to have someone that is always able to wash your back in the shower, it&#x27;s not really something that&#x27;s completely possible.</li>
            <li>This loofah gives you the extra reach that you need to get all of the spots on your back that you have to normally struggle to reach on your own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I ever felt like my back was getting as clean as it could</li>
            <li>Cheap and broke after first time using;  Its from China not Beverley Hills and is not real  loofah.  </li>
            <li>and they dry so very quickly.</li>
            <li>Our complimentary pack really make getting your back, legs, and feet so much easier.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love how long the handle is on this loofah back and body scrubber.  </li>
            <li>i my shower one for my hard to reach body areas and one just for my feet and let me tell you my feet love me for using this scrubber.</li>
            <li>The Loofah is all natural, anti-bacterial, hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t be buying  anymore of these ..they are garbage,,threw the other 3 in the trash...not worth the money....</li>
            <li>It easily reaches my back, gently exfoliating areas that I had a hard time reaching before.  </li>

            <li> Within a week the loofah detached from the wooden handle, poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Work great, good quality.</li>
            <li> You will love the Beverly Hills Beauty Supply Loofah Back and Body Scrubber! Your skin feels so silky soft and smooth after using. You can use the Loofah Body Brush all over including your hard to reach back because of the long natural wood handle! Don&#x27;t rub too much or too hard with the Loofah as it can irritate your skin. A little scrubbing goes a long way. Men and woman alike can use the Loofah Body Brush. These Loofah Body Brushes are a must have if you use tanning products too! The loofah exfoliates the dead skin cells helping your tanning product glide on more evenly and smoothly. The Loofah is all natural, anti-bacterial, hypoallergenic. They come in a (4) pack to save you money! Enjoy bath/shower time even more with the Loofah Body Brush and your smoother skin! This product was provided to me for the purpose of my evaluation and honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> The loofah part loosened from the stick and broke within two weeks. Maybe that&#x27;s why they provide four of them.</li>
            <li> cheap product, sponge came off the stick in the 1st use (went through three in 3 days...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I love the brush, it does exfoliate wonderfully. It dries quickly and I&#x27;ve found no trouble with odor. And I like the wood construction overall, the handle is long enough to enable you to reach all parts of your back and shoulders.  But there is a significant flaw. The &amp;#34;loofah brush&amp;#34; became detached from the handle after a few uses. Which was surprising because I was fairly gentle with the product. Had to use superglue and that seemed to do the trick. I received this product at a discount for quality evaluation and review purposes. All opinions are based upon my own experiences with the product.</li>
            <li> Great for back... I don&#x27;t think I ever felt like my back was getting as clean as it could, it isn&#x27;t easy and with the loofah back scrubber you get to reach it and get a fresh feeling.. With modern spray lotion you are all set to have a smooth back all by yourself... I was lucky to get to test these for a discount for my honest and unbiased review.  I loved how I felt after using this... I loved that you get 4 of them and can share with your family not to mention hubby don&#x27;t have to use mine he has his own...</li>
            <li> Loofah is not soft and hurt my skin. Also fell off after 3rd use. Worse Amazon purchase ever :(</li>
            <li> Though loofa fell off by the third use, it still works well when the stick is put through the smallest hole.</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock, felt like my skin was being ripped off.</li>
            <li> Cheap and broke after first time using;  Its from China not Beverley Hills and is not real  loofah.  A dollar store product would last longer and be better.  Returned this garbage and got a refund.</li>
            <li> fell off handle with first use not even one swipe.</li>
            <li> I love how long the handle is on this loofah back and body scrubber.  It easily reaches my back, gently exfoliating areas that I had a hard time reaching before.  I received 4 body scrubbers in one package, with each one individually wrapped.  It would make a super cute gift to someone when gifted with a bottle of soft soap or lotion for example.  While I received this complimentary for my review, I reserve 5 start reviews for those products I truly love.  This falls in that category.</li>
            <li> I love the long handles on these.  They work great, my only issue is that I&#x27;m just not patient enough for them to soften with water before I use them.  I split the pack with my son&#x27;s grandma&#x27;s for mother&#x27;s day knowing the long handles will be great for them.  Our complimentary pack really make getting your back, legs, and feet so much easier.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time,,,that&#x27;s the one star I gave,,the first one I used broke on the first use...just came apart in the shower..won&#x27;t be buying  anymore of these ..they are garbage,,threw the other 3 in the trash...not worth the money....very disappointed. ...</li>
            <li> This was my first loofah and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks better on my lower legs, I can reach all areas of my back and my husband loves his too!!  Well made product- 4 came in package . Will buy some for Christmas presents !!</li>
            <li> Well, the handle fell off the first one on the first day.  Loofah itself is sturdy and does the job.</li>
            <li> used this the other night, wonderful.the only problem is they seem to be disappearing by other family members.</li>
            <li> Loofer came unglued from handle the second time I used one.  I am disappointed in this scrubber and would not recommend it to anyonel</li>
            <li> What a poorly made piece of crap this is. I didn&#x27;t even get past my shoulder before the loofah falls off the poorly glued stick. Save your money I truly wish I could get mine back after being robbed by this product.</li>
            <li> very good product and good quality</li>
            <li> Oh my is just the best back scrubber ever and let me tell you that is not all it can do. I suffer from spinal injuries and I have a hard time bending over and twisting every-which way. I also cannot hardly reach my feet in the shower and I am not able to sit in a tub bath . So I have two of these i my shower one for my hard to reach body areas and one just for my feet and let me tell you my feet love me for using this scrubber.It makes keep them fresh and smooth so much easier. Let me tell do not knock it till you try it. I have tried many different back and body scrubbers and this is simply one of the best I have used. They can in a nice clear plastic bag with each of the four body scrubbers had a clear plastic bag wrapped around the scrubber part with a little gold tie. So if you need a great back brush this is it. my scrubbers were delivered in a just a couple of days after I ordered. I received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I loved my loofah body and loofah body mitt that I had to purchase the loofah back and body scrubber! These are amazing! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I love the high quality of these along with the ease of usage for myself. I am very pleased with the handle and the ability to hang dry these and they dry so very quickly. I love the way these feel in the shower! Like I said, I couldn&#x27;t be more excited to purchase these because I had already purchased the body sponge and body mitt finding this one, the back and body scrubber is just as amazing! I love mine!</li>
            <li> I love using loofah to exfoliate my skin as I take my shower, but I can never seem to get my back.  That is no longer an issue, with the Loofah Back &amp; Body scrubber, you can now reach your back and make sure the skin is exfoliated and healthy. It comes with a sturdy handle and a rope on the end so you can hang it in the shower to dry for the next time you need it.  It also comes in a 4 pack which also makes this a great value as well. Highly recommend. I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> I was given a chance to test this product, and two other sponge/loofah products, and I&#x27;m loving all of them so much. Each product has it&#x27;s own separate, and awesome use, and I love that they come in four packs so that I can share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it would be nice to have someone that is always able to wash your back in the shower, it&#x27;s not really something that&#x27;s completely possible. This loofah gives you the extra reach that you need to get all of the spots on your back that you have to normally struggle to reach on your own. It&#x27;s also great for exfoliating areas that normally get neglected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for for free or at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own and no further compensation was received.</li>
            <li> The loofah fell off of the stick midway through the first time I used it.</li>
