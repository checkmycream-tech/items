    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>the three hairs are gone forever :D</li>
            <li>I was determined to give it the best chance I could.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the seller as they responded immediately and resolved the situation to my satisfaction (refund).</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful machine.</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve, but after that, it is an awesome machine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Excellent item--</li>
            <li>.. Blew a hole in my face..followed directions perfectly ...</li>
            <li>Works great !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best if you have someone doing it for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great that way!</li>
            <li>It is best to use this product during  growth.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll also need very good lighting.</li>
            <li>I recieve my item, and I was so happy</li>
            <li>people said it was junk and 1/3 said it worked and was great, and 1/3 said it worked but wasn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>It,s  a great tool for maintanance purpose.</li>
            <li>Works Great.</li>
            <li>So for the price, and once you get used to it, and if you have a way to hide the scabs for a week, then it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results, which for me is the bottom line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is nothing attractive about pubic hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you Great Product.</li>
            <li>The seller was great and the product is good.</li>
            <li>This is a great value for an honest electrolysis machine.  </li>
            <li>I am over forty and fair skinned.   </li>
            <li>It works good even on course hair.</li>
            <li>good luck getting rechargeable for it, to cut costs.</li>
            <li>Also, get good magnification.</li>
            <li>And you need good aim into the follicle to perform a treatment that can make the hair release.</li>
            <li>I had a hair on my face that I haven&#x27;t seen since I originally bought this almost 2 years ago.  :D  </li>
            <li>Laser hair removal is great for many areas, but it has limitations.  </li>
            <li>This company should not be allowed to keep making and selling products that do not work effectively but promises results.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find it that helpful or effective.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find it that helpful or effective.</li>
            <li>Take a good look at that spot, because they advise not to remove more than 1sq inch of hair at a time in one area.  </li>
            <li>and I now just use power level 10, since the lower level did not seem that effective.   </li>
            <li>This kind of depilation concerns specialists.</li>
            <li>You need to have excellent hand eye coordination and have the ability to hold the wand steady.</li>
            <li>The tweezers aren&#x27;t useable &amp; the probes break very easily.</li>
            <li>but I do like to think that it is more effective than just plucking the hairs out.</li>
            <li>I received the Clean + Easy Deluxe Electrolysis and have used it and works great.</li>
            <li>It works great, takes more time than going to see an Electrolysis, but cost ratio makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap and</li>
            <li>Actually I love the needle coz</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work if kept at it.  </li>
            <li>the fact that it could take forever to use this product and get results is ok for me, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li>(Do not cover the treated area for more than an hour or so with either a bandage or plastic)</li>
            <li>You may get discourage if more hair grows in a treated area, but remember that hair grows in cycles and has dormant stages.</li>
            <li>You may get discourage if more hair grows in a treated area, but remember that hair grows in cycles and has dormant stages.</li>
            <li>Ont thing that made it much more usable for me was I out tape over the metal band on the stylus</li>
            <li>I feel its more of the way I used it.</li>
            <li>As a result of all this hassle, I will revert to seeing my cosmetologist :).</li>
            <li>I wish it had been more up-front about how it works before I bought it.</li>
            <li>I replaced the stylist tip many times.  </li>
            <li>Professionals have better equipment and technique.  </li>
            <li>i will give it one more go before I do</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be sure it even works.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li>but how many times am i gonna have to do this.</li>
            <li>On top of that, every tip I got was bent to hell.</li>
            <li>Deluxe set really works good</li>
            <li>Had one of these years ago....and guess what, still love it.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting more from this</li>
            <li>I gave mine to my sister to see if she had better luck.</li>
            <li>you need a lot of love and patience but it does the job...</li>
            <li>I think it maybe better if I work on someone else.</li>
            <li>You go one hair at a time, and each one took me about 3-4 minutes, and the instructions say not to do more than a square inch of skin at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>It was rated the most reliable.</li>
            <li>and I can rewire them to get some more life out of them but always end up throwing them away in frustration.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I used it for an hour on each hair I would have better luck.</li>
            <li>How many hairs do you want to remove?</li>
            <li>how many times I changed the battery and experimented with the salt water solution after the stated formula did nothing.</li>
            <li>The remington hair removal machine works faster and covers more area...not one hair at  a time.  </li>
            <li>you have both, plus a reasonably high pain tolerance, this is a great product.. with an upgrade or two.</li>
            <li>but you need good light a magnifing glass and lots of time and start in a place that you don&#x27;t care about mild scarring because it takes some time to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty fair hand with a soldering gun</li>
            <li>It works but you need patience time positive atitude and good tweezer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easily replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be fair, maybe my skin is more sensitive now - I don&#x27;t remember this problem when I used it before.</li>
            <li>Tip retracts so easily</li>
            <li>It should glide out easily.</li>
            <li>The stylet tips break way to easily.</li>
            <li>I have good dexterity and patience and am still working with the original stylet, the spare remains ready.</li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>But this one works fine.</li>
            <li>For me it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Just dont use gorilla strength and you will be fine.  </li>
            <li>Just to use the tweezers to straighten out the needle when it bends the thing broke on me twice in less than one week!!!!!To cheaply constructed!!!!!</li>
            <li>I used the Tea Tree lotion they recommend on Amazon and it seemed to work fine.</li>
            <li>The hairs recovered quickly, in fact most of the follicles treated never lost their hair, but the blistered skin around them has not fared so well.  </li>
            <li>If you miss your follicle you creat a huge gash in the location at hand.</li>
            <li>so the circuit runs, then I started hearing the peep sound..</li>
            <li>The seller confirmed this is the case.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy unless it&#x27;s FREE.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, mickey mouse junk.  </li>
            <li>The beep of the machine is a bit loud but tolerable and it is nice that it pauses about every 5 seconds so that you can better gauge contact time.  </li>
            <li>Something else to bear in mind, make sure the probe is entering the follicle, you do not slide it against the hair, it has got to slide right into the follicle.  </li>
            <li>Worth buying!</li>
            <li>I found it to work best if I would grip the stylus in-front of the conductor band with my thumb and middle finger, dip my index finger in the saltwater solution, slide the needle into the targeted hair follicle and then after seating the needle I would put my moistened index finger on the conductor band to complete the circuit and start the electrolysis process.  </li>
            <li>it requires alot of patience, good light is needed and a proper magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>So, I bought this product and it arrived in good condition but it came with a user manual in French!</li>
            <li>If anyone wants advice or more info</li>
            <li>The unit didn&#x27;t work even with the power turned up full blast.  </li>
            <li>I was really worried based on the claims of so many that this device doesnt work.  </li>
            <li>but after it broke so quickly I felt compelled to revise my comments.</li>
            <li>So, in an hour, if you&#x27;re very focused, with a strong precise hand, working on a flat easy to access area, and super lucky, you might be able to treat 30 hairs.</li>
            <li>First of all, you have to use a salt water solution to enable the electric circuit, and this is a huge pain in the butt.</li>
            <li>It is easy, quick (on a per-hair basis),convenient, and a pretty fast learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It has a very high efficacy rate (99%+) as genuine electrolysis is supposed to have.</li>
            <li>You do need to keep your fingers wet with salt water - to get a good charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional lasering, twice, and at most it tickles.  </li>
            <li>If you want to know an approximate time that this product might take you try counting the hairs you want to remove, and times that by 15 secs, and divide that by 60 to get how many minutes or divide by 120 for hours (if your like me youll need hours lol).</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to conduct as well as the old one did.  </li>
            <li>Worth the effort.</li>
            <li>The description of the product should be more clear about that since those are problem-hair areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really excited that I could purchase the same product that I once owned and am confident that it will work because it did before.</li>
            <li>and it slides right out</li>
            <li>what do I expect but honestly this was a huge let down.</li>
            <li>For that hair alone it was worth it ;)  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cost very much, either</li>
            <li>It takes some experience, but overall it is very comfortable and works well.</li>
            <li>Only worked for one time, but the return process was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>First off all, when I got the device, I opened the battery cover with a coin, I removed the plastic cover off the battery put it in again..</li>
            <li>In my opinion the higher settings just make it easier to overcook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion the higher settings just make it easier to overcook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have removed many facial hairs with it.</li>
            <li>Initially I thought better of it</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the description said it would and it has saved me a lot of money.</li>
            <li>and hey, I had a day off, so I got it out yesterday and found that the beeps and electric current are now inconsistent and don&#x27;t work most of the time.  </li>
            <li>You might not spend much money, but you won&#x27;t have electrolysis done either!</li>
            <li>Read up first.</li>
            <li>No notification from vendor regarding status, but did receive all supporting items (ie stylus, antiseptic cream).  </li>
            <li>Go into self electrolysis fully aware, do research before you find out this proccess is not for you.</li>
            <li>After using scar fade cream, the area looks much better, but the hairs are still present.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I was pretty patient.</li>
            <li>and though I followed directions perfectly everything has grown back except for a small patch.</li>
            <li>It is a about pain to only be able to do one hair at a time,  but for the money I will deal with it.</li>
            <li>I gave this home kit 5 stars because, it is very powerful just like going to the professional to have it done.</li>
            <li>If you want significant results you can count on, see a professional and try to budget the treatments like I am going to do.</li>
            <li>As a result, my skin has been able to heal without interruption from hair regrowth and for the first time in a long time my skin color is returning.</li>
            <li>So this is not a right before date night kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>The more precise and steady your hand the less damage you do to the skin.</li>
            <li>Once you get your first hair out, gently, it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>There are SO MANY models and brands and reviews out there that I finally decided on one that was within my price range to try, but also had decent reviews.</li>
            <li>and i dont have anything else that i need that kind of battery for, so there was money/gas/time down the tubes.)</li>
            <li>(i use it in a low setting)&lt;br /&gt;Clean and easy????</li>
            <li>But for large areas with thicker skin</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very flexible and doesn&#x27;t pierce skin..</li>
            <li>Gently wash the antiseptic cream off and let it breath.</li>
            <li>I followed the \\&quot;test patch\\&quot; instructions, I used the very lowest setting, and I&#x27;m still waiting - after three weeks - for the discoloration to go away.  </li>
            <li>After it dries use some tweezers to remove the glue from the very tip of the stillet.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this product lets me get an electrolysis treatment without leaving home.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on the product before ordering, with much hope.  </li>
            <li>THE MAJORITY OF REVIEWS instead of hoping to not spend much money but have electrolysis done.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these 9 years ago that worked really well.  </li>
            <li>the tips are rounded way too much, so it wont grab the hairs very well.&lt;br /&gt;Also, uses 9volt battery, so</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>Really???</li>
            <li>it hurts too much to be using this thing.</li>
            <li>Just too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>This product really work, on my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Use a good makeup mirror and start slowly.</li>
            <li>The instructions are simple and easy to follow , but you will need a magnifying x20 or higher lighted mirror to see your pore opening clearly to insert the needle.</li>
            <li>but if you are too sensitive consider using a xylocaine gel) and very very time consuming to do large areas.</li>
            <li>Or Spend more on other products.  </li>
            <li>I only successful used it to remove two hairs (took 20 minutes), which eventually grew back the next month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two to three slowly decreasing regrowth it finally has cleared everything to a beautiful bikini...</li>
            <li>In the same way that it is quick on a per-hair basis, it takes forever to do a whole section of ones body.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for the fine hairs on my face, and it did not work on any single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s easier to just buy a whole new unit if you have to replace the tips.</li>
            <li>I have a steady hand.</li>
            <li>Toss the tweezers that come with it and buy decent ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you are following the instructions and moistening your fingers prior to use, and keeping them moist.  </li>
            <li>The process is time consuming and you need a steady hand and a magnifying mirror is extrememy helpful.</li>
            <li>So this electrolysis system is not for everyone, you need to have time, a steady hand, and do it every week, but it you keep it up</li>
            <li>It is intermittent instead of a steady pulse.  </li>
            <li>Guess this happens with hormone changes as we get older.  </li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s excruciating - the needle is probably not running beside the hair shaft to the root or you are trying to use it on too high a setting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s on the lowest setting, and I have an extremely high pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li>I can highly recommend</li>
            <li>recomend it highly to anyone needing hair removal places i removed 10 years ago still no hair</li>
            <li>PLEASE PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, AND SEE A PROFESSIONAL!!.</li>
            <li>but I use setting 1 for all types of hair - it is more than powerful enough to destroy the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I use setting 1 for all types of hair - it is more than powerful enough to destroy the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that loud, from the reviews I thought I would turn deaf after the sound, but it was really not loud at all.. just normal peeping..</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s normal,</li>
            <li>few more tips</li>
            <li>few more tips</li>
            <li>Honestly you could probably just attack the probe directly to a 9v and it&#x27;d work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li>At least this gives me the chance to do some of it on my own.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this device is not bad, can be improved but it diffidently works if you use it right</li>
            <li>had to send it back right away, would not turn on.</li>
            <li>If you can tell and plan to use it at the right time the hair doesn&#x27;t come back.  </li>
            <li>I first started using this little machine 20 or more years ago, and the hairs I removed back then are still gone.  </li>
            <li>Also buy replacement tips since it is easy to bend them when you put the device down incorrectly.</li>
            <li>So depending on how much of an area you want to do, and how dense the hair is it may take months and months to clear a significant area, and that&#x27;s if you do it every other day.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t had time to go get a new battery.</li>
            <li>It arrived but non-functional,now I have to pay to send it to the company it will be costly because I live in Canada</li>
            <li>new one</li>
            <li>I have removed a decent number of hairs with this device, about 3000 hairs so far.</li>
            <li>All over my body, there was not a single follicle it would fit in so long as there was hair in there.  </li>
            <li>Might try it again may be need just some more practice, but i&#x27;m not confident.</li>
            <li>I am ordering a second machine, as I have almost wore the first one out.</li>
            <li>I had tried it within the first month from buying, I would have definitely sought a refund.</li>
            <li>I bought it to get rid of some facial hair, and thank god I first tested it in my leg, otherwise</li>
            <li>And now that I&#x27;m too late to return it and the extra stylet tips I ordered (just in case) and a special mirror and special tweezers,</li>
            <li>Use (clear) nail polish to coat the stylette tip where the needle comes out -</li>
            <li>There is a pretty long learning curve to getting the hang of it....... which I never reached.  </li>
            <li>Afterward wash the area gently and apply a topical antiseptic.</li>
            <li>However, when the entire hair shaft came out with the tweezers I knew I had found a solution to what had been an absolute nightmare for me.</li>
            <li>I have had professional electrolysis over 10x</li>
            <li>so far this gadget works, up until you have to replace the tip.  </li>
            <li>That needle fell out of the tip completely.  </li>
            <li>Thought would eventually receive electrolysis but never did and got busy</li>
            <li>it gets old</li>
            <li>Tweezer is very flimsy recommend to get a different one.  </li>
            <li>it is clearly marked in instruction guide but that information should be listed in item description.</li>
            <li>cannot compare with professional treatment, but if you think you can handle it, go for it.</li>
            <li>So far I havent had any problems.  </li>
            <li>I plan on paying the fees to have a professional do it.</li>
            <li>Few sellers available at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a learning curve to using it for sure, and electrolysis is certainly a slow painstaking process to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes that I would at least be able to use it</li>
            <li>Before use take a hot shower and exfoliate - it will open your pores and reduce possible infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before use take a hot shower and exfoliate - it will open your pores and reduce possible infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a steady hand and am flexible enough to get my leg an inch in front of my face, but still couldn&#x27;t get it in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second, the burns, the chances of getting burnt are high in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>you can cover a little more area in the same amount of time and if necessary you can always go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you like pain or if you only have a few hairs that you want to get rid of, then it is just fine</li>
            <li>I ordered this &amp; it was shipped quickly enough, but it&#x27;s a cheap little battery operated thing that should of cost $10.00.  </li>
            <li>In the long run it will cost you less as these professionals do it in a way to make sure you always come back.</li>
            <li>I noticed that a whole bunch of white fluid bubbled out of the follicle when I did it, but it washes away.  </li>
            <li>Also it is really tedious, but if the hairs I zap dont come back or only do once more, it is totally worth the time investment.  </li>
            <li>Third, the amount of time it takes to clear an area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructions actually show the old model in the pictures.  </li>
            <li>45 minutes barely finished a 1 x 1 patch.  </li>
            <li>then what i expected to use so I cant really blame the product ..</li>
            <li>I think that it will likely take another 4-6 months to completely obliterate my pesky chin hairs.   </li>
            <li>This is really difficult to use on your own and time consuming.  </li>
            <li>Mine came with two needle, one already installed, tweezers that were useless, and a 9v battery so I didnt have to supply my own.</li>
            <li>but.......its not working, I call the hotline number because you do have a 1 year warranty, comes to find out the electrolysis doesnt have any current, so I have to ship it back to them, in return a new one that&#x27;ll be working.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very possible that you need to do that a few times, because there are timings of a hair growth and you should be lucky on that too.</li>
            <li>If there is too much salt, it shocks too hard and too fast.</li>
            <li>so needless to say, I got no results, tried to use it many times, spent a lot of saltwater, and now I&#x27;m going to look for a product that actually works if I spend a little more money for it.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have at this point is its hard to treat very fine hairs as the stylus is too large to fit into very small pores.</li>
            <li>Simply put, they&#x27;re cheap because they&#x27;re shoddily built.</li>
            <li>unless you move your foot or thigh - the needle is always live but with a little practice I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s easier to guide a live needle along the hair shaft by judging the pain level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re really supposed to do, then it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li>The stylet is not long enough to reach the root.  </li>

            <li> This is a wonderful machine.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve, but after that, it is an awesome machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Excellent item--</li>

            <li> Works great !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best if you have someone doing it for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great that way!</li>
            <li> It is best to use this product during  growth.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll also need very good lighting.</li>
            <li> I recieve my item, and I was so happy</li>
            <li> people said it was junk and 1/3 said it worked and was great, and 1/3 said it worked but wasn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> It,s  a great tool for maintanance purpose.</li>
            <li> Works Great.</li>
            <li> So for the price, and once you get used to it, and if you have a way to hide the scabs for a week, then it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results, which for me is the bottom line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is nothing attractive about pubic hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you Great Product.</li>
            <li> The seller was great and the product is good.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for an honest electrolysis machine.  </li>
            <li> I am over forty and fair skinned.   </li>
            <li> It works good even on course hair.</li>
            <li> good luck getting rechargeable for it, to cut costs.</li>
            <li> Also, get good magnification.</li>
            <li> And you need good aim into the follicle to perform a treatment that can make the hair release.</li>
            <li> I had a hair on my face that I haven&#x27;t seen since I originally bought this almost 2 years ago.  :D  </li>
            <li> Laser hair removal is great for many areas, but it has limitations.  </li>
            <li> This company should not be allowed to keep making and selling products that do not work effectively but promises results.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find it that helpful or effective.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find it that helpful or effective.</li>
            <li> Take a good look at that spot, because they advise not to remove more than 1sq inch of hair at a time in one area.  </li>
            <li> and I now just use power level 10, since the lower level did not seem that effective.   </li>
            <li> This kind of depilation concerns specialists.</li>
            <li> You need to have excellent hand eye coordination and have the ability to hold the wand steady.</li>
            <li> The tweezers aren&#x27;t useable &amp; the probes break very easily.</li>
            <li> but I do like to think that it is more effective than just plucking the hairs out.</li>
            <li> I received the Clean + Easy Deluxe Electrolysis and have used it and works great.</li>
            <li> It works great, takes more time than going to see an Electrolysis, but cost ratio makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheap and</li>
            <li> Actually I love the needle coz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work if kept at it.  </li>
            <li> the fact that it could take forever to use this product and get results is ok for me, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> (Do not cover the treated area for more than an hour or so with either a bandage or plastic)</li>
            <li> You may get discourage if more hair grows in a treated area, but remember that hair grows in cycles and has dormant stages.</li>
            <li> You may get discourage if more hair grows in a treated area, but remember that hair grows in cycles and has dormant stages.</li>
            <li> Ont thing that made it much more usable for me was I out tape over the metal band on the stylus</li>
            <li> I feel its more of the way I used it.</li>
            <li> As a result of all this hassle, I will revert to seeing my cosmetologist :).</li>
            <li> I wish it had been more up-front about how it works before I bought it.</li>
            <li> I replaced the stylist tip many times.  </li>
            <li> Professionals have better equipment and technique.  </li>
            <li> i will give it one more go before I do</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be sure it even works.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li> but how many times am i gonna have to do this.</li>
            <li> On top of that, every tip I got was bent to hell.</li>
            <li> Deluxe set really works good</li>
            <li> Had one of these years ago....and guess what, still love it.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this</li>
            <li> I gave mine to my sister to see if she had better luck.</li>
            <li> you need a lot of love and patience but it does the job...</li>
            <li> I think it maybe better if I work on someone else.</li>
            <li> You go one hair at a time, and each one took me about 3-4 minutes, and the instructions say not to do more than a square inch of skin at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It was rated the most reliable.</li>
            <li> and I can rewire them to get some more life out of them but always end up throwing them away in frustration.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I used it for an hour on each hair I would have better luck.</li>
            <li> How many hairs do you want to remove?</li>
            <li> how many times I changed the battery and experimented with the salt water solution after the stated formula did nothing.</li>
            <li> The remington hair removal machine works faster and covers more area...not one hair at  a time.  </li>
            <li> you have both, plus a reasonably high pain tolerance, this is a great product.. with an upgrade or two.</li>
            <li> but you need good light a magnifing glass and lots of time and start in a place that you don&#x27;t care about mild scarring because it takes some time to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty fair hand with a soldering gun</li>
            <li> It works but you need patience time positive atitude and good tweezer.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easily replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be fair, maybe my skin is more sensitive now - I don&#x27;t remember this problem when I used it before.</li>
            <li> Tip retracts so easily</li>
            <li> It should glide out easily.</li>
            <li> The stylet tips break way to easily.</li>
            <li> I have good dexterity and patience and am still working with the original stylet, the spare remains ready.</li>
            <li> it works fine.</li>
            <li> But this one works fine.</li>
            <li> For me it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Just dont use gorilla strength and you will be fine.  </li>
            <li> Just to use the tweezers to straighten out the needle when it bends the thing broke on me twice in less than one week!!!!!To cheaply constructed!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used the Tea Tree lotion they recommend on Amazon and it seemed to work fine.</li>
            <li> The hairs recovered quickly, in fact most of the follicles treated never lost their hair, but the blistered skin around them has not fared so well.  </li>
            <li> If you miss your follicle you creat a huge gash in the location at hand.</li>
            <li> so the circuit runs, then I started hearing the peep sound..</li>
            <li> The seller confirmed this is the case.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy unless it&#x27;s FREE.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, mickey mouse junk.  </li>
            <li> The beep of the machine is a bit loud but tolerable and it is nice that it pauses about every 5 seconds so that you can better gauge contact time.  </li>
            <li> Something else to bear in mind, make sure the probe is entering the follicle, you do not slide it against the hair, it has got to slide right into the follicle.  </li>
            <li> Worth buying!</li>
            <li> I found it to work best if I would grip the stylus in-front of the conductor band with my thumb and middle finger, dip my index finger in the saltwater solution, slide the needle into the targeted hair follicle and then after seating the needle I would put my moistened index finger on the conductor band to complete the circuit and start the electrolysis process.  </li>
            <li> it requires alot of patience, good light is needed and a proper magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this product and it arrived in good condition but it came with a user manual in French!</li>
            <li> If anyone wants advice or more info</li>
            <li> The unit didn&#x27;t work even with the power turned up full blast.  </li>
            <li> I was really worried based on the claims of so many that this device doesnt work.  </li>
            <li> but after it broke so quickly I felt compelled to revise my comments.</li>
            <li> So, in an hour, if you&#x27;re very focused, with a strong precise hand, working on a flat easy to access area, and super lucky, you might be able to treat 30 hairs.</li>
            <li> First of all, you have to use a salt water solution to enable the electric circuit, and this is a huge pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> It is easy, quick (on a per-hair basis),convenient, and a pretty fast learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It has a very high efficacy rate (99%+) as genuine electrolysis is supposed to have.</li>
            <li> You do need to keep your fingers wet with salt water - to get a good charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional lasering, twice, and at most it tickles.  </li>
            <li> If you want to know an approximate time that this product might take you try counting the hairs you want to remove, and times that by 15 secs, and divide that by 60 to get how many minutes or divide by 120 for hours (if your like me youll need hours lol).</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to conduct as well as the old one did.  </li>
            <li> Worth the effort.</li>
            <li> The description of the product should be more clear about that since those are problem-hair areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really excited that I could purchase the same product that I once owned and am confident that it will work because it did before.</li>
            <li> and it slides right out</li>
            <li> what do I expect but honestly this was a huge let down.</li>
            <li> For that hair alone it was worth it ;)  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cost very much, either</li>
            <li> It takes some experience, but overall it is very comfortable and works well.</li>
            <li> Only worked for one time, but the return process was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> First off all, when I got the device, I opened the battery cover with a coin, I removed the plastic cover off the battery put it in again..</li>
            <li> In my opinion the higher settings just make it easier to overcook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion the higher settings just make it easier to overcook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have removed many facial hairs with it.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought better of it</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the description said it would and it has saved me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> and hey, I had a day off, so I got it out yesterday and found that the beeps and electric current are now inconsistent and don&#x27;t work most of the time.  </li>
            <li> You might not spend much money, but you won&#x27;t have electrolysis done either!</li>
            <li> Read up first.</li>
            <li> No notification from vendor regarding status, but did receive all supporting items (ie stylus, antiseptic cream).  </li>
            <li> Go into self electrolysis fully aware, do research before you find out this proccess is not for you.</li>
            <li> After using scar fade cream, the area looks much better, but the hairs are still present.  </li>
            <li> I thought that I was pretty patient.</li>
            <li> and though I followed directions perfectly everything has grown back except for a small patch.</li>
            <li> It is a about pain to only be able to do one hair at a time,  but for the money I will deal with it.</li>
            <li> I gave this home kit 5 stars because, it is very powerful just like going to the professional to have it done.</li>
            <li> If you want significant results you can count on, see a professional and try to budget the treatments like I am going to do.</li>
            <li> As a result, my skin has been able to heal without interruption from hair regrowth and for the first time in a long time my skin color is returning.</li>
            <li> So this is not a right before date night kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> The more precise and steady your hand the less damage you do to the skin.</li>
            <li> Once you get your first hair out, gently, it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> There are SO MANY models and brands and reviews out there that I finally decided on one that was within my price range to try, but also had decent reviews.</li>
            <li> and i dont have anything else that i need that kind of battery for, so there was money/gas/time down the tubes.)</li>
            <li> (i use it in a low setting)&lt;br /&gt;Clean and easy????</li>
            <li> But for large areas with thicker skin</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very flexible and doesn&#x27;t pierce skin..</li>
            <li> Gently wash the antiseptic cream off and let it breath.</li>
            <li> I followed the \\&quot;test patch\\&quot; instructions, I used the very lowest setting, and I&#x27;m still waiting - after three weeks - for the discoloration to go away.  </li>
            <li> After it dries use some tweezers to remove the glue from the very tip of the stillet.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this product lets me get an electrolysis treatment without leaving home.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on the product before ordering, with much hope.  </li>
            <li> THE MAJORITY OF REVIEWS instead of hoping to not spend much money but have electrolysis done.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of these 9 years ago that worked really well.  </li>
            <li> the tips are rounded way too much, so it wont grab the hairs very well.&lt;br /&gt;Also, uses 9volt battery, so</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> Really???</li>
            <li> it hurts too much to be using this thing.</li>
            <li> Just too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> This product really work, on my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Use a good makeup mirror and start slowly.</li>
            <li> The instructions are simple and easy to follow , but you will need a magnifying x20 or higher lighted mirror to see your pore opening clearly to insert the needle.</li>
            <li> but if you are too sensitive consider using a xylocaine gel) and very very time consuming to do large areas.</li>
            <li> Or Spend more on other products.  </li>
            <li> I only successful used it to remove two hairs (took 20 minutes), which eventually grew back the next month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two to three slowly decreasing regrowth it finally has cleared everything to a beautiful bikini...</li>
            <li> In the same way that it is quick on a per-hair basis, it takes forever to do a whole section of ones body.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for the fine hairs on my face, and it did not work on any single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s easier to just buy a whole new unit if you have to replace the tips.</li>
            <li> I have a steady hand.</li>
            <li> Toss the tweezers that come with it and buy decent ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you are following the instructions and moistening your fingers prior to use, and keeping them moist.  </li>
            <li> The process is time consuming and you need a steady hand and a magnifying mirror is extrememy helpful.</li>
            <li> So this electrolysis system is not for everyone, you need to have time, a steady hand, and do it every week, but it you keep it up</li>
            <li> It is intermittent instead of a steady pulse.  </li>
            <li> Guess this happens with hormone changes as we get older.  </li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s excruciating - the needle is probably not running beside the hair shaft to the root or you are trying to use it on too high a setting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s on the lowest setting, and I have an extremely high pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li> I can highly recommend</li>
            <li> recomend it highly to anyone needing hair removal places i removed 10 years ago still no hair</li>
            <li> PLEASE PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, AND SEE A PROFESSIONAL!!.</li>
            <li> but I use setting 1 for all types of hair - it is more than powerful enough to destroy the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I use setting 1 for all types of hair - it is more than powerful enough to destroy the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that loud, from the reviews I thought I would turn deaf after the sound, but it was really not loud at all.. just normal peeping..</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s normal,</li>
            <li> few more tips</li>
            <li> few more tips</li>
            <li> Honestly you could probably just attack the probe directly to a 9v and it&#x27;d work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> At least this gives me the chance to do some of it on my own.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Overall, this device is not bad, can be improved but it diffidently works if you use it right</li>
            <li> had to send it back right away, would not turn on.</li>
            <li> If you can tell and plan to use it at the right time the hair doesn&#x27;t come back.  </li>
            <li> I first started using this little machine 20 or more years ago, and the hairs I removed back then are still gone.  </li>
            <li> Also buy replacement tips since it is easy to bend them when you put the device down incorrectly.</li>
            <li> So depending on how much of an area you want to do, and how dense the hair is it may take months and months to clear a significant area, and that&#x27;s if you do it every other day.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t had time to go get a new battery.</li>
            <li> It arrived but non-functional,now I have to pay to send it to the company it will be costly because I live in Canada</li>
            <li> new one</li>
            <li> I have removed a decent number of hairs with this device, about 3000 hairs so far.</li>
            <li> All over my body, there was not a single follicle it would fit in so long as there was hair in there.  </li>
            <li> Might try it again may be need just some more practice, but i&#x27;m not confident.</li>
            <li> I am ordering a second machine, as I have almost wore the first one out.</li>
            <li> I had tried it within the first month from buying, I would have definitely sought a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought it to get rid of some facial hair, and thank god I first tested it in my leg, otherwise</li>
            <li> And now that I&#x27;m too late to return it and the extra stylet tips I ordered (just in case) and a special mirror and special tweezers,</li>
            <li> Use (clear) nail polish to coat the stylette tip where the needle comes out -</li>
            <li> There is a pretty long learning curve to getting the hang of it....... which I never reached.  </li>
            <li> Afterward wash the area gently and apply a topical antiseptic.</li>
            <li> However, when the entire hair shaft came out with the tweezers I knew I had found a solution to what had been an absolute nightmare for me.</li>
            <li> I have had professional electrolysis over 10x</li>
            <li> so far this gadget works, up until you have to replace the tip.  </li>
            <li> That needle fell out of the tip completely.  </li>
            <li> Thought would eventually receive electrolysis but never did and got busy</li>
            <li> it gets old</li>
            <li> Tweezer is very flimsy recommend to get a different one.  </li>
            <li> it is clearly marked in instruction guide but that information should be listed in item description.</li>
            <li> cannot compare with professional treatment, but if you think you can handle it, go for it.</li>
            <li> So far I havent had any problems.  </li>
            <li> I plan on paying the fees to have a professional do it.</li>
            <li> Few sellers available at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve to using it for sure, and electrolysis is certainly a slow painstaking process to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes that I would at least be able to use it</li>
            <li> Before use take a hot shower and exfoliate - it will open your pores and reduce possible infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before use take a hot shower and exfoliate - it will open your pores and reduce possible infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a steady hand and am flexible enough to get my leg an inch in front of my face, but still couldn&#x27;t get it in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, the burns, the chances of getting burnt are high in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> you can cover a little more area in the same amount of time and if necessary you can always go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you like pain or if you only have a few hairs that you want to get rid of, then it is just fine</li>
            <li> I ordered this &amp; it was shipped quickly enough, but it&#x27;s a cheap little battery operated thing that should of cost $10.00.  </li>
            <li> In the long run it will cost you less as these professionals do it in a way to make sure you always come back.</li>
            <li> I noticed that a whole bunch of white fluid bubbled out of the follicle when I did it, but it washes away.  </li>
            <li> Also it is really tedious, but if the hairs I zap dont come back or only do once more, it is totally worth the time investment.  </li>
            <li> Third, the amount of time it takes to clear an area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions actually show the old model in the pictures.  </li>
            <li> 45 minutes barely finished a 1 x 1 patch.  </li>
            <li> then what i expected to use so I cant really blame the product ..</li>
            <li> I think that it will likely take another 4-6 months to completely obliterate my pesky chin hairs.   </li>
            <li> This is really difficult to use on your own and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> Mine came with two needle, one already installed, tweezers that were useless, and a 9v battery so I didnt have to supply my own.</li>
            <li> but.......its not working, I call the hotline number because you do have a 1 year warranty, comes to find out the electrolysis doesnt have any current, so I have to ship it back to them, in return a new one that&#x27;ll be working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very possible that you need to do that a few times, because there are timings of a hair growth and you should be lucky on that too.</li>
            <li> If there is too much salt, it shocks too hard and too fast.</li>
            <li> so needless to say, I got no results, tried to use it many times, spent a lot of saltwater, and now I&#x27;m going to look for a product that actually works if I spend a little more money for it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have at this point is its hard to treat very fine hairs as the stylus is too large to fit into very small pores.</li>
            <li> Simply put, they&#x27;re cheap because they&#x27;re shoddily built.</li>
            <li> unless you move your foot or thigh - the needle is always live but with a little practice I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s easier to guide a live needle along the hair shaft by judging the pain level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re really supposed to do, then it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> The stylet is not long enough to reach the root.  </li>
            <li> maybe i wasn&#x27;t doing it right because I hardly ever felt any of the laser shock that you are supposed to feel, even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> , I want to have a full two hours for those few little chin hairs</li>
            <li> These things are worth a little less than 1/3 what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tedious to use, it hurts, the tweezers that come with it are garbage, and the buzzer is loud (but luckily it can be removed from the circuit without breaking it).</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep the needle in long enough for it to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this product several tries and it is quite simple to use.</li>
            <li> Ok, I had used one of these in the past and thought I&#x27;d give it another try - I&#x27;m so tired of plucking chin hairs daily.</li>
            <li> Are you willing to make a salt/water solution to wet your fingures continuously, while you take a small needle (that is thinner than a sewing needle) carefully placing it at EACH ONE individual hair, hold it there for 15 seconds while it causes you some boderline pain discomfort, then twizzer it out, and do that for every hair that you want removed.  </li>
            <li> I only removed three hairs just as a trial, there were red bumps that turned black where the hair were removed.. and today it faded away totally after a week from using the machine...</li>
            <li> Inserting a dull needle into the hair follicle was just too much for me.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to do when the buzzing sound began.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been going to a professional once every 2-3 weeks for the past 4 months</li>
            <li> I got rid of it because it took a long time to treat each hair and opted for Laser Hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> (From wife) I spent weeks doing my legs with this last year</li>
            <li> It works but it takes too long .  </li>
            <li> For deeper hairs on thick skin areas not so much.  </li>
            <li> this product really works but not on all areas, it works good for me on my lower arm, prepare your self befor using it because this device is super tedious device, so it&#x27;s not for large areas or thin hair size, it do hurt a bit and it has an annoying sound and bad tweezer.</li>
            <li> I have permanently gotten rid of my middle chest hairs and unwanted hairs in other places.</li>
            <li> The other one lasted ten years.  </li>
            <li> After only a few years the hair grew back where I had the Lightsheer laser hair removal done.  </li>
            <li> I am just not skilled enough apparently to use this on myself.</li>
            <li> Tossing mine in the trash since this place&#x27;s customer service is worthless and they don&#x27;t even want their own garbage back.</li>
            <li> I bought this electrolysis system to work on some coarse white whiskers on my chin and some black hairs that my chin started to sprout!</li>
            <li> With all the more expensive products it came down to the reviews from other buyers.</li>
            <li> plus it takes forever just imaging trying to get every single hair</li>
            <li> Good looking product, however very poor quality, it removes the hair but takes on everage 2 hours to remove a single hair, so its impossible to work with very time consuming.</li>
            <li> You also have to repeat the process if the hair does not easily remove, and it could grow back later on.  </li>
            <li> I have zapped about 50 hairs over the past couple months and so far they seem to be staying gone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not powerful enough to kill it anyway...</li>
            <li> The hair you zap in a few months is not really the same one you zapped yesterday - it is probably growing from a different root.</li>
            <li> The hair you zap in a few months is not really the same one you zapped yesterday - it is probably growing from a different root.</li>
            <li> The next day, my face was covered with raw open sores in the spots I treated.</li>
            <li> not sure how i feel about his product,  i tried using the first day received, not sure if i am using it correctly</li>
            <li> Not sure it works, is a pain to use (need wet fingers with salt water), and left red bumps that took weeks to go away.</li>
            <li> At first, it seemed to be working and the discolorations it left on my skin weren&#x27;t too bad, but after a few months it became apparent that the only thing that was happening by using the machine was I was developing scars.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to jamb the needle into the skin - it should slip along the hair shaft and you should not really need to indent the skin.</li>
            <li> I went to a laser center and got laser hair removal.  </li>
            <li> This was a lot harder</li>
            <li> I was careful with the needle</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve got with this is a few blisters.</li>
            <li> Must follow directions carefully or you can create scarring.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to overtreat</li>
            <li> The picture in the manual made it look like the needle was a few millimeters under the skin, but I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s physically possible.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of spending $25-35/week for professional electrolysis that I had only started in May 2011.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re trying to remove a thick hair, likely longer - I tried on hairs on my finger, which is actually almost invisible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bum unit or what, but I&#x27;m immensely un-impressed with this little beast and will be returning it if at all possible.</li>
            <li> The lower settings may be slower but cause less pain and are less likely to cause scarring.</li>
            <li> The lower settings may be slower but cause less pain and are less likely to cause scarring.</li>
            <li> I have a few black coarse hairs around the chin area.</li>
            <li> A few suggestions from a long time user of this unit...</li>
            <li> Big waste of money!</li>
            <li> I only used this on a small patch on my leg.</li>
            <li> but i can tell this would be extremely time consuming,  i may return it.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> any other scab I&#x27;ve had has been on me - about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other reason is because I had to zap each follicle twice on the highest setting before it worked.</li>
            <li> I rated 4 instead of 5 due to time and lack of ease for use.</li>
            <li> The only weird note I have is that the picture in the instruction booklet is of the old style of Home Electrolysis, like the one I had where the cord wraps around the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Its tedious, and slow and does hurt a little bit in certain areas like under the nose and near the lips.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda hard to open..</li>
            <li> It definitely works but the salt water makes it hard to focus on the root of the hair.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> If they are healing properly, after a few days there will be small pin point scabs</li>
            <li> If they are healing properly, after a few days there will be small pin point scabs</li>
            <li> to me it was not worth it</li>
            <li> Just not worth my money.  </li>
            <li> This product is way to difficult to use and takes to much time.</li>
            <li> It is just not worth the money or time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slow going and leaves scabs, but once the scabs went away my hair has not come back at all.</li>
            <li> It is money down the drain and a risk for your skin.</li>
            <li> There are a few other hairs that are permanently MIA.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product has been modified slightly since the one I had over 15 years ago, but the instructions are identical.  </li>
            <li> I have a problem with black course hairs growing on my chin, which often grow under my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was a learning curve, and it was a bit awkward at first, but this thing works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will be slow to heal and needs to dry up so keeping it covered can lead to infections.</li>
            <li> You will notice less \\&quot;regrowth\\&quot; after a few treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will notice less \\&quot;regrowth\\&quot; after a few treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may have been using it wrong, I read the directions, but every time I used it it would leave red marks that take a long time to go away, and it didn&#x27;t seem to affect the hair at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for 4 months, used it 3 times as it was super inconvenient and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> and it came out with little resistance.</li>
            <li> I think my button got moved to a little between 0 and 1</li>
            <li> My roots are located a little deeper than that.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY,TIME &amp; ENERGY!.</li>
            <li> Process is very long and tedious and does work but design flaws are numerous.</li>
            <li> Its not easy to use, its loud, and its nearly impossible to see well enough into each follicle, much less hold it there still while you get zapped and it beeps at you.</li>
            <li> The needle is really not that hard to use, you just need to have some finesse.</li>
            <li> Both of our opinions is that this product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I felt it a few times but the hair didn&#x27;t come out effortlessly as it should when the hair follicle dies.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I will have a few scars from the figuring it out process</li>
            <li> I have learned a few tricks that make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  </li>
            <li> It has permanently removed a few unwanted hairs.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, i did everything as written in instructions but after treatment hairs didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;slide out easily&amp;#34; as supposed to, waste of money and time, will return</li>
            <li> and it killed my battery</li>
            <li> No light to let you know the unit is operational no noise to let you know it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> During the testing state is a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it was a waste</li>
            <li> At first I was feeling like it was impossible to use this device.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is not easy and it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy, and when something leaves you scabbed over, that doesn&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; to me.</li>
            <li> Used it a couple times (or attempted anyway) and maybe its just a little too complex for me, but I wasn&#x27;t getting any results except for a few uncomfortable red spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to insert the needle into the hair follicle, which I keep missing.</li>
            <li> I was so mad at this item, because first of all the needle was so weak and flimsy that it wouldn&#x27;t even penetrate the skin; then when it did, I felt nothing.  </li>
            <li> Not for me I guess :/</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll attempt it again.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for small areas.</li>
            <li> You have to insert a little plastic needle into the hair follicle which is near impossible.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work,its a terrible machine and the needle bends so easily .</li>
            <li> The stylus sometimes moves in and out of its opening, making it hard to insert it into the follicle at times.</li>
            <li> And the beeps didn&#x27;t bug me, but I&#x27;ve used this thing 3 times because it&#x27;s so hard to use</li>
            <li> if your hard up for hair removal Still don&#x27;t do it..</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon getting it, I realized I was with the 1/3 of the people that at least got a working machine, but I found it hard/impossible to use, and at a minimum, slower than molasses when used correctly.  </li>
            <li> they may not be as thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less irritating on my skin, there is little need for rewetting, and it&#x27;s much less awkward.</li>
            <li> it took me sometime to practice, by sometime I mean about 30 mins</li>
            <li> Ridiculous in this day and age.  </li>
            <li> It is impossible to do when you have to use that 2nd hand to activate the unit.  </li>
            <li> I only tried once, and it was so painful</li>
            <li> Endured the ugly red scabs hoping for a permanent payoff</li>
            <li> This thing was clearly designed by an idiot</li>
            <li> I tried multiple times its so hard to get the needle in the follicle and the salt water is really annoying</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible product and complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I found this product very hard to use.</li>
            <li> it can indeed get the job done- very slowly.</li>
            <li> Unit is poorly made.</li>
            <li> When I get it where I want it I touch the metal plate on the base unit with my left hand and</li>
            <li> nd resolder a lead inside that had either broken or was never connected.</li>
            <li> I WISH I WOULD HAVE LISTEN TO MY GUT, BUT I DIDN&#x27;T I&#x27;M A VICTIM OF THIS CRAP.</li>

            <li> You cannot use this thing on yourself.  Wish I had known that.  It also makes a terrifying noise that no one mentioned.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this product and it arrived in good condition but it came with a user manual in French! :S&lt;br /&gt;So I went online and looked for directions to use the device... First off all, when I got the device, I opened the battery cover with a coin, I removed the plastic cover off the battery put it in again.. you don&#x27;t have to close the cover coz it&#x27;s kinda hard to open.. it took me sometime to practice, by sometime I mean about 30 mins, then I figured there was no peeping.. turned out I should mix water and salt and moist my fingers that are in contact with the pen-like device so the circuit runs, then I started hearing the peep sound.. It&#x27;s not that loud, from the reviews I thought I would turn deaf after the sound, but it was really not loud at all.. just normal peeping..&lt;br /&gt;So, it hurts when the needle is inserted and the circuit is close, and you start to see a white foam coming out of the hair pore. I left it for 15 seconds then pulled out the hair and it came out with little resistance. I only removed three hairs just as a trial, there were red bumps that turned black where the hair were removed.. and today it faded away totally after a week from using the machine... the three hairs are gone forever :D&lt;br /&gt;The needle didn&#x27;t break coz I have a steady hand. Actually I love the needle coz it&#x27;s very flexible and doesn&#x27;t pierce skin..&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this device is not bad, can be improved but it diffidently works if you use it right</li>
            <li> The needle is so small not like it was previously… I can not see well when I insert it, grrrr</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work if kept at it.  There is a pretty long learning curve to getting the hang of it....... which I never reached.  Very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift and couldn&#x27;t wait to get started. Followed the instructions verbatum. Several times. Even had a friend of mine who does this at her job in a beauty sallon. Both of our opinions is that this product is a waste of money. Just save up and get treatments from a pro.</li>
            <li> the fact that it could take forever to use this product and get results is ok for me, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. First of all, you have to use a salt water solution to enable the electric circuit, and this is a huge pain in the butt. maybe i wasn&#x27;t doing it right because I hardly ever felt any of the laser shock that you are supposed to feel, even on the highest setting. I felt it a few times but the hair didn&#x27;t come out effortlessly as it should when the hair follicle dies. so needless to say, I got no results, tried to use it many times, spent a lot of saltwater, and now I&#x27;m going to look for a product that actually works if I spend a little more money for it.</li>
            <li> Never felt any tingling sensation the manual says you are to feel once the current has made contact with the hair follicle. Did not remove any hair. I&#x27;ve given this product several tries and it is quite simple to use. This company should not be allowed to keep making and selling products that do not work effectively but promises results. I thought i was saving money by purchasing this electrolysis home kit but ended up wasting $34.50. If you want significant results you can count on, see a professional and try to budget the treatments like I am going to do. Bottom line, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> A few suggestions from a long time user of this unit...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Toss the tweezers that come with it and buy decent ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I hated the constant corrosive effect of the salt on the unit and my fingers so I altered mine by drilling a hole in the units metal plate and installing a speaker plug. I attached a metallic plate to a speaker wire and plugged it in, put the salt water on the plate and placed the plate under my foot or thigh while I was sitting. It&#x27;s much less irritating on my skin, there is little need for rewetting, and it&#x27;s much less awkward. The plate will probably rust but it&#x27;s easily replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Treat several hairs with the needle before tweezing rather than zap,tweeze,zap, tweeze.... you can cover a little more area in the same amount of time and if necessary you can always go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Use (clear) nail polish to coat the stylette tip where the needle comes out - it can help to avoid burning of the surface of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Don&#x27;t try to jamb the needle into the skin - it should slip along the hair shaft and you should not really need to indent the skin. If it hurts- that&#x27;s normal, if it&#x27;s excruciating - the needle is probably not running beside the hair shaft to the root or you are trying to use it on too high a setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. With the modification I made there is no on or off unless you move your foot or thigh - the needle is always live but with a little practice I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s easier to guide a live needle along the hair shaft by judging the pain level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Use liberal amounts of alcohol before during and after on both the needle and skin. Afterward wash the area gently and apply a topical antiseptic. (Do not cover the treated area for more than an hour or so with either a bandage or plastic) Gently wash the antiseptic cream off and let it breath. It will be slow to heal and needs to dry up so keeping it covered can lead to infections. The entry points will likely be red for a day or two so keep using the alcohol. If they are healing properly, after a few days there will be small pin point scabs and they may itch - do not scratch unless you like scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Before use take a hot shower and exfoliate - it will open your pores and reduce possible infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you use it on your face at all - find a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Scarring is possible and likely. The lower settings may be slower but cause less pain and are less likely to cause scarring. In my opinion the higher settings just make it easier to overcook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. I&#x27;ve tried topical pain relief and I don&#x27;t find it that helpful or effective. Your choice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Yes, it does work. Yes, it&#x27;s tedious. Yes, it&#x27;s painfull. Yes, it&#x27;s permanent. Yes, it&#x27;s time consuming - Don&#x27;t start unless you are committed to spending a lot of time with this method... A lot of time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few more tips -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13.  You may get discourage if more hair grows in a treated area, but remember that hair grows in cycles and has dormant stages. The hair you zap in a few months is not really the same one you zapped yesterday - it is probably growing from a different root. You will notice less \\&quot;regrowth\\&quot; after a few treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14. It may take longer but I use setting 1 for all types of hair - it is more than powerful enough to destroy the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15. As someone else stated in their review - I go through a lot of tips. Once bent they can be straightened but it&#x27;s only a matter of time before they need to be replaced.two so keep using the alcohol.

            <li> Ok, I had used one of these in the past and thought I&#x27;d give it another try - I&#x27;m so tired of plucking chin hairs daily. You do need to keep your fingers wet with salt water - to get a good charge. My problem was that I had to repeat a couple times for the hair to loosen up enough to come out. The next day, my face was covered with raw open sores in the spots I treated. I had the sores for over a week, and then pock mark scars! I won&#x27;t be using it again. To be fair, maybe my skin is more sensitive now - I don&#x27;t remember this problem when I used it before. But just beware.</li>
            <li> This thing was clearly designed by an idiot but it works. It&#x27;s tedious to use, it hurts, the tweezers that come with it are garbage, and the buzzer is loud (but luckily it can be removed from the circuit without breaking it). Honestly you could probably just attack the probe directly to a 9v and it&#x27;d work just as well if not better. But I digress, the device does indeed work.</li>
            <li> Used it a couple times (or attempted anyway) and maybe its just a little too complex for me, but I wasn&#x27;t getting any results except for a few uncomfortable red spots. I&#x27;m intrigued by the technology but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> but you need good light a magnifing glass and lots of time and start in a place that you don&#x27;t care about mild scarring because it takes some time to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Zaps on the way in, keeps zapping,  and then the hair comes back.</li>
            <li> I followed the \\&quot;test patch\\&quot; instructions, I used the very lowest setting, and I&#x27;m still waiting - after three weeks - for the discoloration to go away.  The hairs recovered quickly, in fact most of the follicles treated never lost their hair, but the blistered skin around them has not fared so well.  In addition, the pain was so bad that it made me nauseous.  That&#x27;s on the lowest setting, and I have an extremely high pain tolerance.  I&#x27;ve had professional lasering, twice, and at most it tickles.  I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bum unit or what, but I&#x27;m immensely un-impressed with this little beast and will be returning it if at all possible.</li>
            <li> I recieve my item, and I was so happy but.......its not working, I call the hotline number because you do have a 1 year warranty, comes to find out the electrolysis doesnt have any current, so I have to ship it back to them, in return a new one that&#x27;ll be working.</li>
            <li> I purchased this electrolysis machine because it works.  I had the same one over 15 years ago.  I used it on my legs and face.  Where I used it the hair has never grown back.  I got rid of it because it took a long time to treat each hair and opted for Laser Hair removal.  After only a few years the hair grew back where I had the Lightsheer laser hair removal done.  Nothing has grown back where I had done the home elecrolysis with this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has been modified slightly since the one I had over 15 years ago, but the instructions are identical.  The instructions actually show the old model in the pictures.  Follow the instructions and it will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited that I could purchase the same product that I once owned and am confident that it will work because it did before.</li>
            <li> Did not perform to expectations.</li>
            <li> This did nothing.  The needles kept breaking and it didn&#x27;t even remove one hair, I returned it the next day.  It was impossible to use.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 of these over the years and I can attest they work as a charm. I have permanently gotten rid of my middle chest hairs and unwanted hairs in other places. It is also relatively unexpensive. The drawbacks are pain(no problem for me but if you are too sensitive consider using a xylocaine gel) and very very time consuming to do large areas. A trick I have found that helps lessen time needed and pain and scarring is take some instant glue and tip the tip of the stillet inside. After it dries use some tweezers to remove the glue from the very tip of the stillet. This way the currect will go only to the root and not the rest of the follicle.</li>
            <li> NEVER DARE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> I used to pay a lot of money for electrolysis.  Now I can do it when I want and at what strength I want.  I have removed many facial hairs with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it works to its desired level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It saves you about $200 an hour from seeing an actual electrolysis technician.  It is easy, quick (on a per-hair basis),convenient, and a pretty fast learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  In the same way that it is quick on a per-hair basis, it takes forever to do a whole section of ones body.  45 minutes barely finished a 1 x 1 patch.  Second, the burns, the chances of getting burnt are high in the beginning.  Third, the amount of time it takes to clear an area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:  Make sure you are following the instructions and moistening your fingers prior to use, and keeping them moist.  You know the hair is done when you tweeze it and it slides right out and you don&#x27;t feel a thing.  Something else to bear in mind, make sure the probe is entering the follicle, you do not slide it against the hair, it has got to slide right into the follicle.  Push it against the base of the hair, when it has penetrated the follicle two things should happen 1) the machine will emit a high-pitched tone, and 2)You will feel a tingle of varying intensity based upon the power setting you have chosen.  I noticed that a whole bunch of white fluid bubbled out of the follicle when I did it, but it washes away.  The thing is, is that it takes time and patience.  Ultimately I have decided to switch to a campaign of body waxing, simply because it is faster, but the electrolysis is still on standby for those few-rogue hairs.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use. Get scars and burn marks and hairs regrows. Might try it again may be need just some more practice, but i&#x27;m not confident. I think i prefer to have hair to shave than scars.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for an honest electrolysis machine.  There is a bit of a learning curve to using it for sure, and electrolysis is certainly a slow painstaking process to begin with.  The instructions are a bit lacking but an understanding of what you are trying to accomplish helps.  I found it to work best if I would grip the stylus in-front of the conductor band with my thumb and middle finger, dip my index finger in the saltwater solution, slide the needle into the targeted hair follicle and then after seating the needle I would put my moistened index finger on the conductor band to complete the circuit and start the electrolysis process.  The beep of the machine is a bit loud but tolerable and it is nice that it pauses about every 5 seconds so that you can better gauge contact time.  I have zapped about 50 hairs over the past couple months and so far they seem to be staying gone.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. Unit is poorly made. Mine broke after 4 months. Cord detached from needle. Process is very long and tedious and does work but design flaws are numerous. Waste of money. Initially I thought better of it but after it broke so quickly I felt compelled to revise my comments.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product look CLOSELY at whatever place you want to remove the hair.  Now consider this: Are you willing to make a salt/water solution to wet your fingures continuously, while you take a small needle (that is thinner than a sewing needle) carefully placing it at EACH ONE individual hair, hold it there for 15 seconds while it causes you some boderline pain discomfort, then twizzer it out, and do that for every hair that you want removed.  You also have to repeat the process if the hair does not easily remove, and it could grow back later on.  Take a good look at that spot, because they advise not to remove more than 1sq inch of hair at a time in one area.  Are you desperate?  Do you have hours of time to spare?  If you want to know an approximate time that this product might take you try counting the hairs you want to remove, and times that by 15 secs, and divide that by 60 to get how many minutes or divide by 120 for hours (if your like me youll need hours lol). If you can imagin yourself holding EACH hair for 15 seconds then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> At first I was feeling like it was impossible to use this device.I was determined to give it the best chance I could.I will have a few scars from the figuring it out process but after I got the hang of it I saw that it actually does work. Its tedious, and slow and does hurt a little bit in certain areas like under the nose and near the lips. I have learned a few tricks that make it easier to use. A lighted magnifying mirror is a must. Reading glasses help too. Ont thing that made it much more usable for me was I out tape over the metal band on the stylus and then I can out it in the follicle without it being energized. When I get it where I want it I touch the metal plate on the base unit with my left hand and it works fine. I will say this isn&#x27;t a toy and can burn your skin if your careless.The only complaint I have at this point is its hard to treat very fine hairs as the stylus is too large to fit into very small pores.If anyone wants advice or more info Ill be glad to help. I had been getting electrolysis treatments for a while now and its extremely painful and expensive. At least this gives me the chance to do some of it on my own. Anyone that says this device is worthless or didn&#x27;t work just didn&#x27;t take the time to figure it out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. If you turn the power up enough to actually kill the hair follicle, you can&#x27;t stand the jolt and it leaves scabbing and scarring.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this thing. Its not easy to use, its loud, and its nearly impossible to see well enough into each follicle, much less hold it there still while you get zapped and it beeps at you. Maybe if someone else was doing it for you....</li>
            <li> Worthless. Tip retracts so easily that tip doesn&#x27;t reach root, so just destroys skin and leaves root intact. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this product lets me get an electrolysis treatment without leaving home. It does exactly what the description said it would and it has saved me a lot of money. Worth buying!</li>
            <li> This thing is crap.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  Ridiculous in this day and age.  I went to a laser center and got laser hair removal.  Takes the nurse about 10 to 15 minutes to zap an entire area and it is done.  Doesn&#x27;t cost very much, either... Go with that and skip this nonsense!  Big waste of money!</li>
            <li> Bubbles and burns, does remove hair, but leaves a blister in its place. There&#x27;s a reason laser hair removal is expensive it&#x27;s because it WORKS. This DOESN&#x27;T.</li>
            <li> This was a lot harder then what i expected to use so I cant really blame the product .. I feel its more of the way I used it.</li>
            <li> It definitely works but the salt water makes it hard to focus on the root of the hair. If there is too much salt, it shocks too hard and too fast. The stylus sometimes moves in and out of its opening, making it hard to insert it into the follicle at times. If you miss your follicle you creat a huge gash in the location at hand. As a result of all this hassle, I will revert to seeing my cosmetologist :).</li>
            <li> Not for lots of hair.</li>
            <li> I only used this on a small patch on my leg. Not sure it works, is a pain to use (need wet fingers with salt water), and left red bumps that took weeks to go away. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product back in  August 2011 and have used it every week since then (it is Dec 2011 now).  I bought this electrolysis system to work on some coarse white whiskers on my chin and some black hairs that my chin started to sprout! I was tired of spending $25-35/week for professional electrolysis that I had only started in May 2011.  I am over forty and fair skinned.   So in 4 months I have seen a decrease in hairs and any returning hairs tend to be finer, so it appears to be working. I think that it will likely take another 4-6 months to completely obliterate my pesky chin hairs.   The process is time consuming and you need a steady hand and a magnifying mirror is extrememy helpful. Also buy replacement tips since it is easy to bend them when you put the device down incorrectly. I started using power level 4 and I now just use power level 10, since the lower level did not seem that effective.   So this electrolysis system is not for everyone, you need to have time, a steady hand, and do it every week, but it you keep it up it appears to work.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on the product before ordering, with much hope.  Looked like 1/3 of reviewing people said it was junk and 1/3 said it worked and was great, and 1/3 said it worked but wasn&#x27;t great.  I had crossed my fingers that I&#x27;d be in the 1/3 percent that raved about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon getting it, I realized I was with the 1/3 of the people that at least got a working machine, but I found it hard/impossible to use, and at a minimum, slower than molasses when used correctly.  But 1 hair every 10 minutes?  you&#x27;re kidding me!  And the beeps didn&#x27;t bug me, but I&#x27;ve used this thing 3 times because it&#x27;s so hard to use, I want to have a full two hours for those few little chin hairs and I just havdn&#x27;t dedicated the time.  But summer is coming up and hey, I had a day off, so I got it out yesterday and found that the beeps and electric current are now inconsistent and don&#x27;t work most of the time.  I got 1 hair in about 30 minutes, and the rest of the time it was beeping when i wasn&#x27;t using it, and not beeping when I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for 4 months, used it 3 times as it was super inconvenient and hard to manage.  And now that I&#x27;m too late to return it and the extra stylet tips I ordered (just in case) and a special mirror and special tweezers, yada yada, i&#x27;m tossing this in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had followed my gut instinct AND THE MAJORITY OF REVIEWS instead of hoping to not spend much money but have electrolysis done.  You might not spend much money, but you won&#x27;t have electrolysis done either!</li>
            <li> I ordered this &amp; it was shipped quickly enough, but it&#x27;s a cheap little battery operated thing that should of cost $10.00.  You have to insert a little plastic needle into the hair follicle which is near impossible.  The unit didn&#x27;t work even with the power turned up full blast.  I didn&#x27;t return it because I&#x27;d already tossed the box.  Don&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li> I would buy it again just to try it.  It has permanently removed a few unwanted hairs.  For deeper hairs on thick skin areas not so much.  I had a hair on my face that I haven&#x27;t seen since I originally bought this almost 2 years ago.  :D  For that hair alone it was worth it ;)  There are a few other hairs that are permanently MIA.  So for a hair here and a hair there this product works.  But for large areas with thicker skin your gonna just have to deal or go to the professionals.  Or Spend more on other products.  Yes this does cause a bee sting like welt.  The more precise and steady your hand the less damage you do to the skin.</li>
            <li> So painful and tedious. I was careful with the needle but it still bends.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve got with this is a few blisters. I&#x27;m angry. It is money down the drain and a risk for your skin. This kind of depilation concerns specialists.</li>
            <li> Note that the instructions are only in FRENCH!  The seller confirmed this is the case.  I was very impressed with the seller as they responded immediately and resolved the situation to my satisfaction (refund).</li>
            <li> This is very difficult to use on yourself.  I would still recommend it for purchase because it is well made and did work on the spots that I actually could zap.  I am just not skilled enough apparently to use this on myself.</li>
            <li> I thought when it said you go hair by hair, that it would be different. Inserting a dull needle into the hair follicle was just too much for me. I hate needles. I wish it had been more up-front about how it works before I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these 9 years ago that worked really well.  I replaced the stylist tip many times.  Eventually the salt water from my fingers corroded the metal conductor band and it would no longer work.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to conduct as well as the old one did.  It is intermittent instead of a steady pulse.  I am disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful machine. It works great, takes more time than going to see an Electrolysis, but cost ratio makes it worth it. There is a learning curve, but after that, it is an awesome machine. If you don&#x27;t like it, learn to use it, and problem solved. I am ordering a second machine, as I have almost wore the first one out.</li>
            <li> this product really works but not on all areas, it works good for me on my lower arm, prepare your self befor using it because this device is super tedious device, so it&#x27;s not for large areas or thin hair size, it do hurt a bit and it has an annoying sound and bad tweezer.</li>
            <li> This product actually works. You need to have excellent hand eye coordination and have the ability to hold the wand steady. I found it difficult to do when the buzzing sound began. It took 2-3 uses per hair for me, and the skin reaction took about a week to heal. However, when the entire hair shaft came out with the tweezers I knew I had found a solution to what had been an absolute nightmare for me.</li>
            <li> Worst product, worthless, waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is really difficult to use on your own and time consuming.  Professionals have better equipment and technique.  Your skin will thank you.  I&#x27;ve only been going to a professional once every 2-3 weeks for the past 4 months and it&#x27;s already changed my life.  I recommend Allard Studio of Electrolysis.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought this years ago when I saw it at Pharmore in KC. It takes some practice, but you can do this yourself. Use a good makeup mirror and start slowly. Read up first. Worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I gave this home kit 5 stars because, it is very powerful just like going to the professional to have it done. The instructions are simple and easy to follow , but you will need a magnifying x20 or higher lighted mirror to see your pore opening clearly to insert the needle. The effects last up to two -three weeks for me before I have to do it over again.  I would recommend this product to anyone with facial hair, which they would like to get rid of and don&#x27;t have the time to go and get treated. In the long run it will cost you less as these professionals do it in a way to make sure you always come back.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I found this product very hard to use. maybe you need someone else to do it for you. but despite the difficulty I didn&#x27;t see it getting rid of my unwanted hair. and I did try.</li>
            <li> This might work but there seems to be a problem with the one I received it won&#x27;t operate with the tip extended</li>
            <li> Did not work at ALL, and was incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> not sure how i feel about his product,  i tried using the first day received, not sure if i am using it correctly but i can tell this would be extremely time consuming,  i may return it.  i will give it one more go before I do</li>
            <li> Piece of crap didn&#x27;t even work. When I got it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, i did everything as written in instructions but after treatment hairs didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;slide out easily&amp;#34; as supposed to, waste of money and time, will return</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be sure it even works.  I have a few black coarse hairs around the chin area. Guess this happens with hormone changes as we get older.  The stylet is not long enough to reach the root.  I can feel the pinch when tweezing the treated hair out.  I have had professional electrolysis over 10x so I know what to expect.  Also sometimes a second hand is needed when trying to use it under the chin or side of the chin.  It is impossible to do when you have to use that 2nd hand to activate the unit.  Don&#x27;t buy unless it&#x27;s FREE.  It&#x27;s junk.  Remember you have been warned.</li>
            <li> This seems to work ok.  I&#x27;ve been doing electrolysis over the years, so far this gadget works, up until you have to replace the tip.  You can&#x27;t.  I replaced one, and upon threading the needle through the tip, it bent.  So that&#x27;s one tip gone.  Tried the second replacement needle.  That needle fell out of the tip completely.  So it&#x27;s easier to just buy a whole new unit if you have to replace the tips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  It takes some experience, but overall it is very comfortable and works well.</li>
            <li> It,s  a great tool for maintanance purpose.It works good even on course hair. The user should have understanding how to apply the needle towards the root, and to follow the instructions.  I can highly recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent item--this one actually does what it says.  Must follow directions carefully or you can create scarring.  This is my second of this type of unit.  The other one lasted ten years.  Laser hair removal is great for many areas, but it has limitations.  This fills that gap!</li>
            <li> Item never shipped.  No notification from vendor regarding status, but did receive all supporting items (ie stylus, antiseptic cream).  Thought would eventually receive electrolysis but never did and got busy so did not follow up.  Will never place an order for health and beauty items again.</li>
            <li> DIdn&#x27;t work and sometimes it didn&#x27;t even come on. I would like a refund.</li>
            <li> i can feel it burn but the hairs are still growing back. they may not be as thick but how many times am i gonna have to do this. it gets old</li>
            <li> While the thing does work, it is annoying to use.&lt;br /&gt;You have to keep contact with the metal plate on the base, as well as on the pen. On top of that, every tip I got was bent to hell. Because of that, it&#x27;s more difficult to get it going correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are completely useless. the tips are rounded way too much, so it wont grab the hairs very well.&lt;br /&gt;Also, uses 9volt battery, so good luck getting rechargeable for it, to cut costs. It&#x27;s still cheaper than going to a pro, but it takes a lot of time and patience.&lt;br /&gt;If you have both, plus a reasonably high pain tolerance, this is a great product.. with an upgrade or two.</li>
            <li> Horrible.. Blew a hole in my face..followed directions perfectly ...if you value skin don&#x27;t chance it.. Get laser or something .. It&#x27;s very cheap and if your hard up for hair removal Still don&#x27;t do it..it&#x27;s not powerful enough to kill it anyway...</li>
            <li> Works Great. Tweezer is very flimsy recommend to get a different one.  Deluxe set really works good it requires alot of patience, good light is needed and a proper magnifying mirror. I use up to level 7 is workable for me......also it got the job done to remove my unwanted hairs and there was no irritation.</li>
            <li> This product should not be labeled for home use. It is not easy and it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;To remove the hair, the needle has to be place in the follicle and that is very difficult to do.&lt;br /&gt;Even with a magnifying mirror, I could not place it correctly. As I was poking around, it made me bleed.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t return it because I felt it was not sanitary to do so; now I&#x27;m &#x27;stuck&#x27; with a product I paid for but will never use again.</li>
            <li> I hate that it leaves little scabs after using it but I do like to think that it is more effective than just plucking the hairs out.</li>
            <li> they should have noted up front that Diabetics risk scaring. never would  have purchased. it is clearly marked in instruction guide but that information should be listed in item description.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Don&#x27;t order this. The tweezers aren&#x27;t useable &amp; the probes break very easily. I&#x27;m Greek &amp; Italian; I know hair &amp; this product is useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one just like this, but I think a different brand for over 20 years.  It works well and the hair&#x27;s gone forever.  The only weird note I have is that the picture in the instruction booklet is of the old style of Home Electrolysis, like the one I had where the cord wraps around the bottom.  But this one works fine.</li>
            <li> Used a couple of times and it is a technic to do it correctly.  I think my button got moved to a little between 0 and 1 and it killed my battery so I haven&#x27;t had time to go get a new battery.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. There is no way of telling if it&#x27;s working. No light to let you know the unit is operational no noise to let you know it&#x27;s on. It&#x27;s a simple dial and you turn it but nothing happens. Really??? I know with the price ...what do I expect but honestly this was a huge let down. I had such high hopes that I would at least be able to use it but you can&#x27;t even tell if the unit is working or not. I felt nothing, no current, no tingling, nothing. Cheap, mickey mouse junk.  This is going back.</li>
            <li> Had one of these years ago....and guess what, still love it.  Works great !</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work,its a terrible machine and the needle bends so easily . I tried multiple times its so hard to get the needle in the follicle and the salt water is really annoying I was expecting more from this I want to refund this so if the seller can please contact me asap</li>
            <li> It works but you need patience time positive atitude and good tweezer. You ll need several days of practice. Once you get your first hair out, gently, it&#x27;s I did it... read the manual too</li>
            <li> Works in getting rid of unwanted hairs but comes with the price of pain.</li>
            <li> Look, this thing works. It&#x27;s actually the only at-home permanent hair removal system that does what it claims. HOWEVER, you MUST NEVER tweeze a hair out after you&#x27;ve treated it. It should glide out easily. Otherwise, you&#x27;re not performing electrolysis, and you won&#x27;t have permanent results. Also, get good magnification. Get magnification lenses, 10 diopter. Check the Texas electrolysis store online, and get the lenses they sell. You&#x27;ll also need very good lighting. And you need good aim into the follicle to perform a treatment that can make the hair release. Be careful not to overtreat or you have a chance of scarring yourself, although that is unlikely, even with horrible technique.&lt;br /&gt;This cannot compare with professional treatment, but if you think you can handle it, go for it.</li>
            <li> I may have been using it wrong, I read the directions, but every time I used it it would leave red marks that take a long time to go away, and it didn&#x27;t seem to affect the hair at all. I gave mine to my sister to see if she had better luck.</li>
            <li> you need a lot of love and patience but it does the job...&lt;br /&gt;After two to three slowly decreasing regrowth it finally has cleared everything to a beautiful bikini...</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible product and complete waste of money. I bought it for the fine hairs on my face, and it did not work on any single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had tried it within the first month from buying, I would have definitely sought a refund. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t able to try it until about three months after the fact.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the package say you can&#x27;t use this on moles.  The description of the product should be more clear about that since those are problem-hair areas.</li>
            <li> The needle don&#x27;t go inside the skin. It goes inside the product.</li>
            <li> this product works well had one befrore and lost it somewhere recomend it highly to anyone needing hair removal places i removed 10 years ago still no hair</li>
            <li> I was really worried based on the claims of so many that this device doesnt work.  For me it works fine.  The needle is really not that hard to use, you just need to have some finesse. If you read the directions is says to only put pressure inline with the needle and it wont bend.  So far I havent had any problems.  Just dont use gorilla strength and you will be fine.  For me I use a 4 on my legs and a 1 or 2 on my face for three beeps.  It leaves welts but they go away in about an hour or so.  So this is not a right before date night kind of thing.  Also it is really tedious, but if the hairs I zap dont come back or only do once more, it is totally worth the time investment.  Mine came with two needle, one already installed, tweezers that were useless, and a 9v battery so I didnt have to supply my own.</li>
            <li> This product arrived &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; in non-working condition. It is of very poor quality.</li>
            <li> It arrived but non-functional,now I have to pay to send it to the company it will be costly because I live in Canada</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone can use this device. I only tried once, and it was so painful I couldn&#x27;t keep the needle in long enough for it to work. Also, the instructions said the tip of the needle was supposed to be inserted inside the hair shaft underneath the skin. The picture in the manual made it look like the needle was a few millimeters under the skin, but I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s physically possible. The needle is thicker than the hair and there&#x27;s no room at the base of the hair to insert it. Maybe I misunderstood and I was actually supposed to stab myself in the leg. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re really supposed to do, then it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> The stylet tips break way to easily. Just to use the tweezers to straighten out the needle when it bends the thing broke on me twice in less than one week!!!!!To cheaply constructed!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have removed a decent number of hairs with this device, about 3000 hairs so far. It has a very high efficacy rate (99%+) as genuine electrolysis is supposed to have. I have good dexterity and patience and am still working with the original stylet, the spare remains ready. If this device meets your needs and capability it can indeed get the job done- very slowly. Go into self electrolysis fully aware, do research before you find out this proccess is not for you.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money! it hurts too much to be using this thing. plus it takes forever just imaging trying to get every single hair it is crazy slow and painful, it looked like it worked but I could only do three hairs on my chin, to me it was not worth it and it actually damages your skin so you have to wait a while for it to  heal.&lt;br /&gt;so if you like pain or if you only have a few hairs that you want to get rid of, then it is just fine and if you don&#x27;t mine to burn your skin. (i use it in a low setting)&lt;br /&gt;Clean and easy???? my aaaaa!</li>
            <li> Do not bother buying this! It doesn&#x27;t work! I followed the directions just as they said however it did not work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to insert the needle into the hair follicle, which I keep missing. I think it maybe better if I work on someone else.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would work on a handful of random hairs on my body, but it just didn&#x27;t.  At first, it seemed to be working and the discolorations it left on my skin weren&#x27;t too bad, but after a few months it became apparent that the only thing that was happening by using the machine was I was developing scars.  After using scar fade cream, the area looks much better, but the hairs are still present.  No change.  I&#x27;m throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Item is difficult to use. I plan on paying the fees to have a professional do it. It isn&#x27;t as pricey as I thought. The seller was great and the product is good. Just too much of a hassle. If you wanna save money and you are patient go for it!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about getting this. There are SO MANY models and brands and reviews out there that I finally decided on one that was within my price range to try, but also had decent reviews. I&#x27;ve had this now for about 4 months and have not had any re-growth of the hairs I&#x27;ve taken out. That&#x27;s what I was looking for - lasting results. That being said, it is tricky to get used to doing this. It&#x27;s best if you have someone doing it for you. There are a couple of things to keep in mind: 1. You go one hair at a time, and each one took me about 3-4 minutes, and the instructions say not to do more than a square inch of skin at a time. So depending on how much of an area you want to do, and how dense the hair is it may take months and months to clear a significant area, and that&#x27;s if you do it every other day. 2.) You will have unsightly sores. You are penetrating your epidermis and electrocuting the hair follicle, so you will get a scab on each pore you zap. I used the Tea Tree lotion they recommend on Amazon and it seemed to work fine. I don&#x27;t know if it would have been the same without the oil. My scabs were there the same amount of time any other scab I&#x27;ve had has been on me - about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s slow going and leaves scabs, but once the scabs went away my hair has not come back at all. It&#x27;s been great that way! I&#x27;m really glad I bought it. The reasons I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because it said, &amp;#34;Clean and Easy&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not easy, and when something leaves you scabbed over, that doesn&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; to me. The other reason is because I had to zap each follicle twice on the highest setting before it worked. But I gave it four stars because it did work! So for the price, and once you get used to it, and if you have a way to hide the scabs for a week, then it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m happy with the results, which for me is the bottom line.</li>
            <li> I was so mad at this item, because first of all the needle was so weak and flimsy that it wouldn&#x27;t even penetrate the skin; then when it did, I felt nothing.  Just not worth my money.  I wish I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> Made red spots and the hair grew back. I did what the instructions said. Not for me I guess :/</li>
            <li> I am a man who likes to keep well groomed for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing attractive about pubic hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a learning curve, and it was a bit awkward at first, but this thing works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend one hour a night blasting away hairs, knowing that I never have to shave and get shaving rash again!</li>
            <li> To anyone who can insert a wire smaller in diameter than a human hair, in a hair follicle, at the correct angle, kudos! To the rest of us, this thing&#x27;s totally worthless.</li>
            <li> This product is way to difficult to use and takes to much time. I only successful used it to remove two hairs (took 20 minutes), which eventually grew back the next month. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> With all the more expensive products it came down to the reviews from other buyers. I received the Clean + Easy Deluxe Electrolysis and have used it and works great. Yes it is time consuming but from all the research I did before buying. It was rated the most reliable. Thank you Great Product.</li>
            <li> These things are worth a little less than 1/3 what you pay for it. I&#x27;ve gone through three and they always quit after a month or so. I&#x27;m a pretty fair hand with a soldering gun and I can rewire them to get some more life out of them but always end up throwing them away in frustration. Simply put, they&#x27;re cheap because they&#x27;re shoddily built.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  I tried this electrolysis device and it did not work for me.  Perhaps if I used it for an hour on each hair I would have better luck.</li>
            <li> had to send it back right away, would not turn on. i thought it may have been a bad battery, so i replaced it with a brand new one (a 9volt battery is $6... and i dont have anything else that i need that kind of battery for, so there was money/gas/time down the tubes.)</li>
            <li> Try this. I thought that I was pretty patient. Not enough to use this. Considering the difficult of positioning and all those, a couple minute per one hair will be a luck - if you&#x27;re trying to remove a thick hair, likely longer - I tried on hairs on my finger, which is actually almost invisible. How many hairs do you want to remove? And one treatment does not guarantee removal. It&#x27;s very possible that you need to do that a few times, because there are timings of a hair growth and you should be lucky on that too. So, in an hour, if you&#x27;re very focused, with a strong precise hand, working on a flat easy to access area, and super lucky, you might be able to treat 30 hairs.</li>
            <li> It did not work. So I had to disassemble the case nd resolder a lead inside that had either broken or was never connected. It is working now and I like the product.</li>
            <li> Works for me, but it is painful to use.  I first started using this little machine 20 or more years ago, and the hairs I removed back then are still gone.  I use this machine now to take care of white hairs that my IPL misses.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it!!! If you ever tried electrolysis before, do not stop seeing your specialist, I will continue going to mine, she never ever left any marks in my skin!!! I bought it to get rid of some facial hair, and thank god I first tested it in my leg, otherwise today I would be showing off serious brownish burns in my face!!! I started with the lowest level as suggested, but after seeing what was happening to two different follicles in my leg, I decide to stop and wait till the next day. 10 minutes later, those follicles started to turn brown, and the skin around started to swell... 1 week later im still concerned about those burns, but hey, I got what I paid for...</li>
            <li> Only worked for one time, but the return process was quick and easy. I would try this one again in the future. While it worked, it worked well!</li>
            <li> The tip only goes about 1.5 mm deep.  My roots are located a little deeper than that.  Wouldn&#x27;t even touch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t get it into my follicle, anyway.  The gauge on these things is a lot bigger than I would&#x27;ve made them.  All over my body, there was not a single follicle it would fit in so long as there was hair in there.  Unless you can see the hair you want removed and it&#x27;s swimming around in a follicle not touching the sides of your pore, it&#x27;s impossible to get these things in.  I have a steady hand and am flexible enough to get my leg an inch in front of my face, but still couldn&#x27;t get it in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!  Tossing mine in the trash since this place&#x27;s customer service is worthless and they don&#x27;t even want their own garbage back.</li>
            <li> Good looking product, however very poor quality, it removes the hair but takes on everage 2 hours to remove a single hair, so its impossible to work with very time consuming.</li>
            <li> This product really work, on my ingrown hairs. I had on my face. I notice a difference, in a month time.</li>
            <li> (From wife) I spent weeks doing my legs with this last year and though I followed directions perfectly everything has grown back except for a small patch. Endured the ugly red scabs hoping for a permanent payoff but no. Not sure if I&#x27;ll attempt it again.</li>
            <li> Few sellers available at the time of purchase. Item arived open (hygiene?!)  and never worked no matter how many times I changed the battery and experimented with the salt water solution after the stated formula did nothing. I will repurchase at a later date but not from the same seller.</li>
            <li> It works,  but you need to know when to use it.  Your hair grows in 3 cycles.  It is best to use this product during  growth. If you can tell and plan to use it at the right time the hair doesn&#x27;t come back.  If you use during the nongrowth you will get 6/8 weeks of no hair.  During the testing state is a waste of time.  It won&#x27;t work. It is a about pain to only be able to do one hair at a time,  but for the money I will deal with it.</li>
            <li> I WISH I WOULD HAVE LISTEN TO MY GUT, BUT I DIDN&#x27;T I&#x27;M A VICTIM OF THIS CRAP. PLEASE PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, AND SEE A PROFESSIONAL!!. NOT WORTH THE MONEY,TIME &amp; ENERGY!.</li>
            <li> I started using in the summer and I thought it was a waste but then this winter I turned it to 9 FINALLY GOT RESULTS but I burned up my face, I heal well and the scabs came off but this is what I had to do to get results. Try it, see what you think...</li>
            <li> It works but it takes too long .  The remington hair removal machine works faster and covers more area...not one hair at  a time.  It is just not worth the money or time.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with black course hairs growing on my chin, which often grow under my skin. I would have to use the tweezers every day and still ended up with scars. This product was very tedious to use, but worked well. Its been a week and no hair has returned in the areas where the hair was treated correctly. As a result, my skin has been able to heal without interruption from hair regrowth and for the first time in a long time my skin color is returning. If you have time and patience I recommend this product for small areas. I rated 4 instead of 5 due to time and lack of ease for use. The item was received in a short period of time as described. I would order again from Larkin Supply.</li>
