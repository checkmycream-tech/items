    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>However, if you want the very best protection try the Neutrogena Helioplex SPF 55.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>No smell and probably the best sunblock on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found this sunblock!  </li>
            <li>Excellent sunscreen.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s perfect if you want a good feeling sunblock for your face!</li>
            <li>With or without make-up, it leaves your skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this stuff a try, and I&#x27;m so happy I did,  </li>
            <li>, this is a great product that isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Lightweight but very effective.  </li>
            <li>The product is excellent, goes on smooth, not greasy, and protects.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also a good product because it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.  </li>
            <li>great kind of sunblock</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for travellers who will travel by air because this item can be taken on your plane.</li>
            <li>I work as an airline pilot and have fair skin, which is a recipe for skin cancer disaster.</li>
            <li>I love its non-greasy feel and my skin takes it beautifully.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>magnificent product, however, actually gives my face a nice MATTE finish... and matte FEEL, too!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found another Neutrogena product that was a good replacement.</li>
            <li>For most people, I think it offers great protection, but not the best protection for people who need to be very conscious of sun exposure and the possibility of skin</li>
            <li>Furthermore, if applying to the face, there are many SPF 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure yours wouldn&#x27;t once they knew what was in it.</li>
            <li>&quot; (SPF 50, 70, 85, 100) is okay if you like lots of shine and a greasy feel, which I do not.  </li>
            <li>this reason, Neutrogena SPF 45 or 55 is better.  </li>
            <li>Most dermatologists that I know feel that this makes a difference in effectiveness and for some people this is going to be</li>
            <li>This will give you the most peace of mind.</li>
            <li>I love this product specifically for my face.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen</li>
            <li>[...] The review sounded good, so I went out and bought some right away.</li>
            <li>Helps prevent premature aging, wrinkles and most importantly skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it is so light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>This Sunblock is super stuff; easy to apply &amp; non-greasy; it does not wash or sweat off easily; there is no skin reaction and no sun burn!</li>
            <li>sunscreen also has a strong scent and leaves the skin a bit oily, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the face either, since it caused some pimples to grow after applying it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good product that is unlike many other sun blocks.  </li>
            <li>as far as suncreens go, this is the best I have tried for my skin, and I highly recommend it for people with combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li>And it was quickly delivered to my door at a better price than stores.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous -- moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
            <li>And it feels so light on the skin</li>
            <li>so it is important that block work during strenuous activity-</li>
            <li>Great sun protection without the shiny appearance of many of the other sunscreens with SPF 30.  </li>
            <li>Both of these products stay on a long time and are good for all day use, but my understanding is that the Helioplex formulation is even better.  </li>
            <li>The small tube size is perfect for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In practice, I have found BOTH adequate for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of sheer light feel of Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>On our 25th wedding anniversary in Hawaii, we used this product for mild exposure to the sun</li>
            <li>It has a smooth texture and works very well as a sun block.</li>
            <li>The most important was that it contains oxybenzone, which has been shown to be a potentially harmful chemical (can be absorbed through the skin,</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s better for sensitive skin (?).</li>
            <li>It dries fast and leaves your face feeling nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>This product goes right into the bin.</li>
            <li>It not thick or sticky and goes on pretty light.  </li>
            <li>It dries to a matte finish, and works very, very well under foundation, too.</li>
            <li>I made sure that none of the sunblock got within several inches from my eyes(as</li>
            <li>I thought I had done the first time).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both this product and the higher SPF Helioplex formulations.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is it&#x27;s a bit more</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Wish I had read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>I would prefer that it smelled more like a traditional moisturizer</li>
            <li>This is fine for the beach, but I have the rare profession where I need sunscreen and a tie at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I live in very hot and sunny climate with lots of humidity and it stands up well.</li>
            <li>As soon as I applied the product, I felt a strong burning sensation throughout my entire face.  </li>
            <li>They got it right in terms of providing a great sunblock that is not a thick white mess to apply.  </li>
            <li>I really like Neutragena products and this product is certainly very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this product to anyone who wants a matte finish and eye comfort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where this product really shines (or DOESN&#x27;T shine) is for people with combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li>very important.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this sunscreen to anyone who hates that sunscreen feeling on their face, but doesn&#x27;t want premature aging or skin cancer!</li>
            <li>My skin still burns every time I so much as touch it.</li>
            <li>I have also heard that sunscreens below SPF 50 are okay to use, presumably because they do not need chemicals like oxybenzone to increase the SPF rating, so it is a turn off for me to see Neutrogena continue to put oxybenzone in their sunscreen while other brands do not do</li>
            <li>Overall great protection, just doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite enough for my dry spots around my t-zone.</li>
            <li>In 30 seconds, there is no more greasy/creamy feeling, and in one minute, if you feel your skin, there&#x27;s a nice matte feel.</li>
            <li>I have tried variety of products, Cetaphil, Purpose, Alba, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clarines, Chanel, Clinique, and many over the counter products typically found in any drug store.  </li>
            <li>What I particularly like is that you don&#x27;t even know you have the product on.  </li>
            <li>But it does have the right ingredients that most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use, so it should be at least on par with them.</li>
            <li>At SPF 30, it&#x27;s easy to find other sunscreens that do not contain those chemicals.</li>
            <li>However, it is otherwise so great of a product that I can&#x27;t take off any stars for being expensive.</li>
            <li>Use it like your normal lotion.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure if you use it everywhere it wouldn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li>have even tried other NEUTROGENA sunscreens that are supposed to be OIL FREE and all that.</li>
            <li>And it hasn&#x27;t irritated, inflamed, or otherwise bothered my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is partly due to most people not using enough.  </li>
            <li>This is the first &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34; sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried that was ACTUALLY not greasy!</li>
            <li>if applied first thing out in the sun and then reapplied after several hours</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty thick cream when you first apply it (as opposed to other suncreens or other products that feel more like LOTION), but is almost immediately absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY sunscreens, and it&#x27;s so hard to find a sunscreen WITHOUT moisturizers (if you have oily skin, that&#x27;s already your natural moisturizers).</li>
            <li>It is Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion, SPF 30.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have searched for a sunscreen that both of us would like, and never found one that was completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product-</li>
            <li>It really does feel sheer.</li>
            <li>I have tried many \\&quot;non-oily\\&quot; sunscreens to use on my face, but I am always left with that heavy feeling on my skin and that sunscreen smell.  </li>
            <li>Further, it feels exactly the same on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I initially thought it was the retin-a or a new mositurizer I was using.</li>
            <li>As such, I am very knowledgeable about chemistry and the human body in general.  </li>
            <li>, you barely know it&#x27;s there!</li>
            <li>Lastly I am pretty active</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to my dermatologist, recent studies have shown that SPF 15-30 wipes off after a few hours and doesn&#x27;t offer adequate protection after that time.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say how well this product really compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection.</li>
            <li>In other words, they underestimate how much they need to apply to get that level of protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it, but it does leave a slightly greasy feel if you apply too much.  </li>
            <li>Initially I was pleasently surprised how dry it looked 5 minutes after being applied.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my whole body, because it is a little pricey for the size</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to use Neutrogena SPF 30, but stopped for several reasons. The most important was that it contains oxybenzone, which has been shown to be a potentially harmful chemical (can be absorbed through the skin, cause cell damage/skin cancer and disrupt your hormones). Since I walk to work, I use sunscreen frequently on my face, and after reading about oxybenzone and retinyl palminate (the other potentially toxic chemical in sunscreens), and immediately stopped using this product. I have also heard that sunscreens below SPF 50 are okay to use, presumably because they do not need chemicals like oxybenzone to increase the SPF rating, so it is a turn off for me to see Neutrogena continue to put oxybenzone in their sunscreen while other brands do not do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen also has a strong scent and leaves the skin a bit oily, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the face either, since it caused some pimples to grow after applying it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re worried about the potential health effects of sunscreen, I would recommend switching to another product and checking both the active and inactive ingredients list for the two chemicals listed above. At SPF 30, it&#x27;s easy to find other sunscreens that do not contain those chemicals. Furthermore, if applying to the face, there are many SPF 30&#x27;s that are specifically for the face as well (non-comedogenic). Every package of Neutrogena sunscreen seems to say \\&quot;Dermatologist Recommended Suncare\\&quot; or \\&quot;#1 Dermatologist Recommended\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m sure yours wouldn&#x27;t once they knew what was in it.</li>
            <li> Recently diagnosed with melasma, I was told that I must wear SPF 30 every day, regardless of my level of outdoor activity. I struggled to find a product that I could wear under foundation. Even the high-end department store cosmetic retailers couldn&#x27;t provide a product that didn&#x27;t leave that traditional greasy feel. This product is fabulous -- moisturizing but not greasy. With or without make-up, it leaves your skin looking and feeling great. And it hasn&#x27;t irritated, inflamed, or otherwise bothered my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth with this and clinique&#x27;s.  I like it, but it does leave a slightly greasy feel if you apply too much.  Overall great protection, just doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite enough for my dry spots around my t-zone.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena \\&quot;Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch\\&quot; (SPF 50, 70, 85, 100) is okay if you like lots of shine and a greasy feel, which I do not.  Also, if you apply it anywhere within an inch of your eyes, you&#x27;ll soon have the excitement of watering, burning eyes -- quite a distraction if you happen to be driving.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone who wants a matte finish and eye comfort.</li>
            <li> These are purchased for the Day shift Road Patrol Deputy Sheriff&#x27;s at the Palm Beach Sheriff&#x27;s Office south florida where the sun is relentless and the Deputies go on calls and are standing out in the sun for hours.  The product is excellent, goes on smooth, not greasy, and protects.</li>
            <li> I cannot say how well this product really compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection. But it does have the right ingredients that most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use, so it should be at least on par with them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Where this product really shines (or DOESN&#x27;T shine) is for people with combination/oily skin. I have tried MANY sunscreens, and it&#x27;s so hard to find a sunscreen WITHOUT moisturizers (if you have oily skin, that&#x27;s already your natural moisturizers). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have even tried other NEUTROGENA sunscreens that are supposed to be OIL FREE and all that. The result on my face? After applying it, I always SHINE (which is NOT what I want). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This magnificent product, however, actually gives my face a nice MATTE finish... and matte FEEL, too! It&#x27;s a pretty thick cream when you first apply it (as opposed to other suncreens or other products that feel more like LOTION), but is almost immediately absorbed by the skin. In 30 seconds, there is no more greasy/creamy feeling, and in one minute, if you feel your skin, there&#x27;s a nice matte feel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, and this is not the fault of the product, after about 3 hours (at least for me), then I feel like the matte effect has worn off, and my oily skin is again showing its oily nature. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Still, as far as suncreens go, this is the best I have tried for my skin, and I highly recommend it for people with combination/oily skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BTW, this review is for the actual product I got, which is SPF 30. As of the time I am writing this review, here in amazon they also offer an SPF 45 version, and cheaper, too! I don&#x27;t know the difference, but I always go for the LOWER one (in this case, SPF 30), because I theorize -- rightly or wrongly, I don&#x27;t know -- that the lesser the SPF, the lesser the strength of the ingredients, so maybe it&#x27;s better for sensitive skin (?).</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 30.  Initially I was pleasently surprised how dry it looked 5 minutes after being applied.  It was like I did not have any sunblock on.  However, within an hour my eyes started burning and watering.  This continued all the time the sunblock was on my face. My eyes continued burning and watering even two-three hours after I removed the sunblock from my face.   Thinking that perhaps some had gotten it my eyes, causing the burning sensation, the next day I tried the Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch SPF 30 again.  I made sure that none of the sunblock got within several inches from my eyes(as I thought I had done the first time).  Once again, my eyes started burning and watering even though none had gotten into my eyes.  Again, several hours after removing the sunblock my eyes still burned.  Some of the other sunblocks may look a little greasy, but at least it never caused burning and watering eyes.  Don&#x27;t buy Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock.</li>
            <li> I am a biochemist by education and was a teaching in physiology in a university.  As such, I am very knowledgeable about chemistry and the human body in general.  I really like Neutragena products and this product is certainly very high quality.  For most people, I think it offers great protection, but not the best protection for people who need to be very conscious of sun exposure and the possibility of skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my dermatologist, recent studies have shown that SPF 15-30 wipes off after a few hours and doesn&#x27;t offer adequate protection after that time.  This is partly due to most people not using enough.  In other words, they underestimate how much they need to apply to get that level of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this reason, Neutrogena SPF 45 or 55 is better.  Also, the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer products have been updated to include a technology called Helioplex.  Most dermatologists that I know feel that this makes a difference in effectiveness and for some people this is going to be very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both this product and the higher SPF Helioplex formulations.  In practice, I have found BOTH adequate for my needs.  What I particularly like is that you don&#x27;t even know you have the product on.  It has virtually no scent and it really is so sheer you can&#x27;t even notice it.  Both of these products stay on a long time and are good for all day use, but my understanding is that the Helioplex formulation is even better.  Further, it feels exactly the same on the skin.  The only drawback is it&#x27;s a bit more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a good product because it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.  Both are implicated in skin cancer and it&#x27;s important to protect yourself against both.  If you are looking for an everyday sunscreen this might be the one.  However, if you want the very best protection try the Neutrogena Helioplex SPF 55.  This will give you the most peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection without the shiny appearance of many of the other sunscreens with SPF 30.  Helps prevent premature aging, wrinkles and most importantly skin cancer.  the only downside is it can run into your eyes and cause irritation</li>
            <li> I hate traditional sunscreen that tends to be oily and heavy.  I liked the idea of sheer light feel of Neutrogena.  So I tried both Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 30 and 45.  As soon as I applied the product, I felt a strong burning sensation throughout my entire face.  Not some tingly sensation that is associated with some products.  It felt like my face was on fire.  I immediately washed it off.  It still hurt.  I had to cool it with cold water to numb the pain.  Next day, my face was pink throughout and my skin still hurt.  I have tried variety of products, Cetaphil, Purpose, Alba, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clarines, Chanel, Clinique, and many over the counter products typically found in any drug store.  I have never had such reaction.  Note, I don&#x27;t have a sensative skin.  My skin tends to be normal with a little shine to T zone.  My mom, who has dry skin, tried the products.  She also complained that it hurt to use either SPF 30 or 45.  I had to throw them away.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> great kind of sunblock</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have searched for a sunscreen that both of us would like, and never found one that was completely satisfactory. She has oily skin prone to breakouts, and mine is combination. Every one we tried always left a greasy feel and look to the face, even the ones that were supposed to be oil-free. &lt;br /&gt;Finally, I came across a review of this product on Paula Begoun&#x27;s website ([...] The review sounded good, so I went out and bought some right away. My daughter and I both LOVE this product! It&#x27;s the only sunscreen we have ever used that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel or look to the skin. It dries to a matte finish, and works very, very well under foundation, too. Without foundation, there is no need to use powder to kill the shine. And it feels so light on the skin, you barely know it&#x27;s there! &lt;br /&gt;  If you have oily or combination skin and have never found a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t look and feel greasy, try this one! It&#x27;s the best! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have tried many \\&quot;non-oily\\&quot; sunscreens to use on my face, but I am always left with that heavy feeling on my skin and that sunscreen smell.  I recently bought this one at my grocery store to use on vacation to Arizona &amp; California. I was pleasantly surprised by this product- it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or heavy when applied and once dry feels as though I am not wearing sunscreen on my face. I spent two weeks out west with plenty of sun time and never burned. I would highly recommend this sunscreen to anyone who hates that sunscreen feeling on their face, but doesn&#x27;t want premature aging or skin cancer! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is the first &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34; sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried that was ACTUALLY not greasy! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the price... However, it is otherwise so great of a product that I can&#x27;t take off any stars for being expensive.</li>
            <li> It is not oily and a little goes a long way. Use it like your normal lotion. No smell and probably the best sunblock on the market.</li>
            <li> This used to be my daily sunscreen, until Neutrogena changed the formula. After they changed the ingredients, I could no longer use this because it did not react well with my skin. Luckily, I found another Neutrogena product that was a good replacement. It is Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion, SPF 30. I hope they don&#x27;t eventually change that formula too...</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t sunblock it&#x27;s sunscreen. There&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li> Stay away from this product! I use retin-a and have an oily T-zone. I have used several over the counter products but never reacted to any like I did to this product.  I switched to using the SPF 60 since I use retin-a, and my skin immediately felt sunburnt - my eyes watered, my skin hurt, was tight, blotched and flaky. Large angry red blotches appeared on my neck area where I used the sunscreen. I initially thought it was the retin-a or a new mositurizer I was using. But I used both these over the weekend and stayed home with no sunscreen - no reaction - nada! My skin felt smooth and soft. Come Monday morning I put on the sunscreen and the burning started. Within an hour my skin looked horrendous. The last time around my skin took a week to recover, but now I have identified the culprit. This product goes right into the bin. Wish I had read the reviews first. My skin still burns every time I so much as touch it.</li>
            <li> My doctor told me to use this to prevent facial skin changes and it works! And it was quickly delivered to my door at a better price than stores.</li>
            <li> This sunblock I only use on my face. It not thick or sticky and goes on pretty light.  I live in very hot and sunny climate with lots of humidity and it stands up well.</li>
            <li> I love this product specifically for my face.  Lightweight but very effective.  No sunburning with this if applied first thing out in the sun and then reapplied after several hours</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for travellers who will travel by air because this item can be taken on your plane. Since it&#x27;s a litter bit expensive so I rated 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I chose the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch sunblock for a couple of reasons.  They got it right in terms of providing a great sunblock that is not a thick white mess to apply.  You don&#x27;t have to rub until you&#x27;ve basically friction shaved your arm hair off.  The SPF 30 also allows for you to get a little sun without burning.  Lastly I am pretty active so it is important that block work during strenuous activity- and it does.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday dor my face while at the beach. I absolutely love how it is so light and non greasy. The greasy sun screens give me zits but this one does not.</li>
            <li> This Sunblock is super stuff; easy to apply &amp; non-greasy; it does not wash or sweat off easily; there is no skin reaction and no sun burn!</li>
            <li> Very good product that is unlike many other sun blocks.  It has a smooth texture and works very well as a sun block.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this sunblock!  I hate putting sunblock on my face because it always feels so greasy and I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;ll make me break out.  I decided to give this stuff a try, and I&#x27;m so happy I did,  It dries fast and leaves your face feeling nice and soft.  I don&#x27;t use it on my whole body, because it is a little pricey for the size and I&#x27;m sure if you use it everywhere it wouldn&#x27;t last as long.  But it&#x27;s perfect if you want a good feeling sunblock for your face!</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen. My dermatologist recommended it. I love its non-greasy feel and my skin takes it beautifully.</li>
            <li> I work as an airline pilot and have fair skin, which is a recipe for skin cancer disaster. UVA and UVB rays are orders of magnitude stronger at altitude and the windows in my aircraft do not fully block all UV rays. This is my sunscreen of choice when on the job. I put it on every morning I&#x27;ll be flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It really does feel sheer. It feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. Some sunscreens (especially spray on) feel like a second skin. This is fine for the beach, but I have the rare profession where I need sunscreen and a tie at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;- The small tube size is perfect for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It still smells like sunscreen. I would prefer that it smelled more like a traditional moisturizer lotion.&lt;br /&gt;- Not waterproof. This is a day-to-day activity lotion. It&#x27;s not for the beach.&lt;br /&gt;- Much more expensive than other sunscreens. But you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> On our 25th wedding anniversary in Hawaii, we used this product for mild exposure to the sun and we both broke out with water blisters.  I applied it in areas with no or minimal sun exposure and also got a rash.  This is very similar to what I got when using &amp;#34;sea and ski&amp;#34; as a child.  At home I use a name brand sunscreen routinely with no adverse effect.  Stay away for this product if you don&#x27;t want it to ruin your vacation!</li>
            <li> Although the title for this product  says \\&quot;Sunblock,\\&quot; this is actually sunSCREEN as the label in the photo says. My daughter is allergic to sunscreen, so we were unable to use this. I hope the seller has corrected this mistake! That being said, I&#x27;m giving it three stars since for those of us without the allergy, this is a great product that isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
