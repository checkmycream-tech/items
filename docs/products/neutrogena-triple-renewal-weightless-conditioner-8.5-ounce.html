    <ol>

            <li>Really nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and has a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this conditioner</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner EVER, and is the only one I will use.</li>
            <li>I get comments all the time now on how wonderful my hair looks and am asked what I did different --</li>
            <li>and I suspect they are all valid and truthful, however in my case...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m switching to something else for a conditioner...not sure what yet..</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it, but I love having a full head of hair more!</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it here, not so easy to buy it at stores.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is light and makes your hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Oh and the fragrance of the conditioner is fantastic, even my husband noticed.</li>
            <li>My hair feels like it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s, silky, smooth and full.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great and my hair feels clean yet lightly moisturized, but I can&#x27;t help but notice my hair is falling out more quickly than normal since starting to use this product.</li>
            <li>I have thick/normal straight hair and this product takes the heavy out of my hair and the shine is incredible!</li>
            <li>lower price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena makes some of the finest conditioners out there, but this Triple Renewal Weightless Conditioner is my new favorite in their line.</li>
            <li>It looks great, but of course dried the ends out from bleaching the tips.</li>
            <li>I hope it becomes available very soon.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and absolutely love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>It provides good conditioning without weighting down my hair.</li>
            <li>And it has a really nice soft clean scent, not all sweet candy or fruit smelling like some of the other stuff out there.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I can no longer find it in stores so thank you, Amazon for providing this WONDERFUL product!</li>
            <li>This line keeps my hair shiny, soft, and mostly tangle-free, but this particular conditioner has a very strong chemical scent that lingered for a day or so and overwhelmed any other scents I put on.</li>
            <li>Since using it, my hair has not appeared weighed down at all, but instead has a nice volume and beachy wave to it.</li>
            <li>When you put this in your hair, it is immediately obvious that this product makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I normally use the regular triple renewal that&#x27;s easily found in stores (doesn&#x27;t have \\&quot;weightless\\&quot; on the label) and i grabbed this one because the price was cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have really long super fine hair, and recently ombre&#x27;d it.</li>
            <li>It the only conditioner that makes my hair feel soft and smooth, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy and does exactly what I expected a good conditioner to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can honestly say that until I used this conditioner, I&#x27;ve never found a conditioner that did what a conditioner is supposed to do without really greasing up or weighting down my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this is normal and does NOT mean you left too much product in your hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes the ends really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>leaves your hair light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and manageable without any weight.  </li>
            <li>I use it, almost daily, and it does not weigh my fine hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse curly fine hair and this conditioner doesnt weigh my hair down at all!</li>
            <li>Really does make hair shiny and less tangled.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of this conditioner is a thick, white paste that seems to be characteristic of most neutrogena products I&#x27;ve come across, if you&#x27;re curious.</li>

            <li> Neutrogena makes some of the finest conditioners out there, but this Triple Renewal Weightless Conditioner is my new favorite in their line. I find I like it much better than any fancy, expensive salon-only brand I&#x27;ve tried. I have really long super fine hair, and recently ombre&#x27;d it. It looks great, but of course dried the ends out from bleaching the tips. This conditioner makes the ends really soft and shiny. Since using it, my hair has not appeared weighed down at all, but instead has a nice volume and beachy wave to it. Also, my hair tangles noticibly less since using this product. A tiny little pea-sized amount goes such a long way. And it has a really nice soft clean scent, not all sweet candy or fruit smelling like some of the other stuff out there. I will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this conditioner but I can&#x27;t find it now.  I hope it becomes available very soon.  It the only conditioner that makes my hair feel soft and smooth, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Really nice product. My hair is long and absolutely love this conditioner! Also I like the same shampoo. I am glad I found it here, not so easy to buy it at stores.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner. Not too heavy and does exactly what I expected a good conditioner to do. I would prefer a pump bottle like the Nutrogena shampoo but the product inside the tube is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It provides good conditioning without weighting down my hair. It&#x27;s light and has a very nice fragrance. I like the shampoo also.</li>
            <li> leaves your hair light and fluffy. wish I could buy it in the store, but they don&#x27;t sell it there anymore.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is light and makes your hair silky smooth. I have thick/normal straight hair and this product takes the heavy out of my hair and the shine is incredible! Oh and the fragrance of the conditioner is fantastic, even my husband noticed.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this conditioner is a thick, white paste that seems to be characteristic of most neutrogena products I&#x27;ve come across, if you&#x27;re curious. When you put this in your hair, it is immediately obvious that this product makes a huge difference. Your hair will instantly become silky-smooth and slippery! When rinsing, it almost feels like you&#x27;re not getting it all out of your hair because of how slippery it is even after rinsing thoroughly under water. As far as I can tell, this is normal and does NOT mean you left too much product in your hair. You just end up with great, conditioned hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It works well for my type of hair but is difficult to find in my area</li>
            <li> not a huge fan of this conditioner.  think i actually threw it out after a few uses.  may be better for other hair types than mine....too bad.</li>
            <li> I wish they still made this product.  It&#x27;s the best for fine hair.  You put it on and rinse it off immediately!  It makes your hair soft and manageable without any weight.  I hope the re-issue it.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner EVER, and is the only one I will use. I seriously hope it is not being discontinued!!</li>
            <li> Really does make hair shiny and less tangled.  I use it, almost daily, and it does not weigh my fine hair down.  I have already bought a replacement tube so I don&#x27;t run out of this product.</li>
            <li> I normally use the regular triple renewal that&#x27;s easily found in stores (doesn&#x27;t have \\&quot;weightless\\&quot; on the label) and i grabbed this one because the price was cheaper. This line keeps my hair shiny, soft, and mostly tangle-free, but this particular conditioner has a very strong chemical scent that lingered for a day or so and overwhelmed any other scents I put on. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it now (I had gotten a 2-pack) but won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have gray textured hair that I color.  Before this product, I used Pantene.  NOT ANY MORE!  My hair feels like it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s, silky, smooth and full.  I get comments all the time now on how wonderful my hair looks and am asked what I did different -- Neutrogena Triple Renewal Volume Boosting Shampoo and Conditioner is my answer.  Unfortunately, I can no longer find it in stores so thank you, Amazon for providing this WONDERFUL product!</li>
            <li> did not like the product tossed it out looked too runny</li>
            <li> I have coarse curly fine hair and this conditioner doesnt weigh my hair down at all! Its perfect. I use it daily and it gives me volume and shine. I will never use a different conditioner again!&lt;br /&gt;Btw, this product is sold in ulta stores. Thats the only place i can find it in my city.</li>
            <li> This has been getting good reviews and I suspect they are all valid and truthful, however in my case... I have found that there is actually an increase in hair loss that I can see on the shower floor after a couple of uses of this product.  This same situation occured a couple years ago with the same product and i thought it might be something else and stopped using it...  tried it again and same pattern...  so I&#x27;m switching to something else for a conditioner...not sure what yet..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying thru Amazon however was great... lower price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> does good for the scalp and does not leave any residue and is good to give balance and shine for any hairdoo.</li>
            <li> I bought Neutrogena Triple Renewal Weightless Conditioner based on advise offered in Amazon reviews of Prograine Shampoo (which does work, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that until I used this conditioner, I&#x27;ve never found a conditioner that did what a conditioner is supposed to do without really greasing up or weighting down my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and my hair feels clean yet lightly moisturized, but I can&#x27;t help but notice my hair is falling out more quickly than normal since starting to use this product. It is possible it is a coincidence, but the problem seemed to lessen when I switched brands. I wanted to love it, but I love having a full head of hair more!</li>
    </ol>
