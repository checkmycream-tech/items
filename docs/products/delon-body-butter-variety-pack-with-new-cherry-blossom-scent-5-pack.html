            <li> excellant service!, I use these products and I decided to give as a Christmas gift to my daughter.</li>
            <li> product was as expected, have not tried the new cherry blossom scent yet i find the scents to be  very refreshing</li>
            <li> My skin stays moisturized all day. I love the variety of scents.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find I could order this in a 5 pack so I can change my scent now and then.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and does a great job of keeping my skin moist in the winter.</li>
            <li> It come very quickly. I love the product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this several times  great price  awesome product.  I live in the southwest so body butter is a necessity for dry skin</li>
            <li> The products are good to my skin and the smell of the body butter are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Everything was just a s promised - fast service and a quality product that works great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this body butter. My sister turned me on to it. I can&#x27;t say enough. The lotion goes a long way, has great smell and I&#x27;ve even used it on my face w/ no irritation (I don&#x27;t use this on my face on a regular basis, it was a one time thing.)</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizing cream. Creamy but doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> i HAE USED THIS BODY BUTTER FOR MANY YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS LONG AS IT IS AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li> I love how large the containers are! This lotion is so thick and not greasy. You can put it on your legs after shaving without the burning feeling of most lotions. You can also buy this and give as 5 individual gifts. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Bought this via groupon and I am using the Cherry one, it&#x27;s very smooth and quite hydrating. The hydrating power is not quite as strong as the ones from the Body Shop but it still does a decent job. The scent is decent and not too strong.</li>
            <li> Each sent is devine, and the moister leaves your skin silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> Out of all Olive body butter was not upto the expectation. rest all of them are good</li>
            <li> The photo shows one vanilla, one olive, one cherry and TWO coconuts. I received one vanilla, one olive, ONE coconut and TWO cherry!!!!!!!!!! The reason I ordered the package was to get the two coconuts. If you had a package that had five coconuts, I would order that. You should ship what a customer orders.</li>
            <li> They where a gift but I&#x27;ve been told she loved them</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Hope you will continue to carry it. And it was reasonably priced. First found it at Costco&#x27;s in Australia and when I got back looked for the Co. on line and found you carried it. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love how this product soaks into the skin to moisturize and soften. I  was hooked on the Olive scent but decided to try this 5-scent pack to sample the coconut oil, vanilla, and cherry blossom scents in addition to the olive. Of all these scents in this variety pack, I did not care for the coconut oil as it has a chemical odor to it vs. coconut oil scent. Cherry blossom and vanilla are pleasant, but olive is still my favorite!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick with the Olive body butter.  The other fragrants are not that great.  I will never buy anything again that is packaged this way.  Very hard to open.</li>
