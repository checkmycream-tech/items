            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>This combo of razor and gel is truly the best a man can get.</li>
            <li>very good razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its companion Fusion ProGlide Gel is another great and wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This is an incredible shave - I hesitate to say that because I do NOT want the price to go up.</li>
            <li>I brought this one for my artist to use and he thought it was incredible.</li>
            <li>Either way still a great product and the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li>Great Razor and a great price!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 4 weeks now and the shave is incredible.  </li>
            <li>But this razor is so good, I probably don&#x27;t have to use electronic shavers!  </li>
            <li>Now, if I can keep this away from my wife I will be good!</li>
            <li>oh that beautiful Flexball.  </li>
            <li>So when I was offered to try it again but with the shave gel I was  very pleased to do so!</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;ve used my Gillette M3 Power for years now and have been quite happy.</li>
            <li>The razor is great</li>
            <li>What a great combination.</li>

            <li>awesome razor  rec&#x27;d as part of promotion and will defenitely buying more</li>
            <li>There is a reason for that; their products work great and are a good value.</li>
            <li>Even more impressive was the cooling sensation that I felt immediately upon application.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave and great blades at a great price!</li>
            <li>for the product it&#x27;s amazing the shaving cream applies nice and smells awesome as for the Flexball razor</li>
            <li>Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is easily the best shave that money can buy.  </li>
            <li>It easily glided along the contours of my face, and provided a shave that was nearly perfect.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I have never been more impressed with a razor.  </li>
            <li>Adds some good weight that feels good in my hands.</li>
            <li>Good rubberized grips keep it from shifting or sliding.  </li>
            <li>Probably a good 9 out of 10.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always laughed at the increasing number of blades in razors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good indication to me that my skin wasn&#x27;t raked raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But it takes time and a good number of passes to achieve the results.  </li>
            <li>When I got the Flexball razor and tried it out, I really loved how it contoured and how maneuverable it was compared to the Styler.</li>
            <li>The razor is balanced and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also provided was the Fusion ProGlide Gel which seemed to work good with this razor.  </li>
            <li>The gel strip, a good indicator of when it&#x27;s time to change cartridges.</li>
            <li>My shave with this razor has been superior in every way.</li>
            <li>It has changed my morning routine for good.</li>
            <li>If you like a good close shave with a superior product, give the Fusion Proglide a try.</li>
            <li>Already use a fusion razor and fusion blades so this \\&quot;flex handle technology\\&quot; provided a good comparison.  </li>
            <li>This razor is good.</li>
            <li>I was extremely impressed with how smooth the shave is with this razor.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t give the razor a 5 star because it just was not as good as the Gillette Power razor.  </li>
            <li>I have always been a user of an electric razor because I could never find that manual razor that works good for me</li>
            <li>So good news, I&#x27;ve always used their razors</li>
            <li>Delighted with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The razor body just felt good in my hand.</li>
            <li>flexball head rotates perfectly and smoothly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She stole it from me and she loved it too.</li>
            <li>If you are in need of a go-to razor, this is a good bet.</li>
            <li>It may feel really good while I&#x27;m using it...</li>
            <li>I loved the weight and feel of the razor.</li>
            <li>It does provide a good shave and seems to be as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is a good razor .</li>
            <li>The razor is just as good as the mach 3</li>
            <li>and it gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>The really good thing is that the package of replacement heads</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>I got this excellent razor from Gilette for free.</li>
            <li>Good question.</li>
            <li>All 5-6 times I got a good shave and did not notice bleeding once.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good there,</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li>Blades perform well and give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor from Gillette to review and I was delighted by the look and feel of the razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of razors, and nothing has worked nearly as good as the ProGlide.</li>
            <li>I really loved the product it gave me the closest shave with no razor</li>
            <li>Really good razor</li>
            <li>This is a superb quality razor, that gives you the closest, smoothest comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>handle is sturdy and has a good balance to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sharp blades are what make or break good shaves, and the Fusion ProGlide&#x27;s five blades don&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>Shaving Club - Good blades (I&#x27;m comparing to the 4 blades).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Harry&#x27;s - Good blades (between the DSC and Gillette)</li>
            <li>Good razor</li>
            <li>but Gellette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide with Flexball does a good job minimizing the burning and breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is the best , most comfortable shave I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion this is the best product to ensure that you get the best shave possible.</li>
            <li>This latest incarnation of Gillette&#x27;s five-bladed Fusion razor is advertised to have a flexible joint between the head and handle, thus more perfectly adjusting to the contour of one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>but it is for those who want an exceptional product that will get the job done well, and get it done quickly.blades are evenly distributed on the cartridge</li>
            <li>The ProGlide razor has quickly become the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Skin Care shaving gel compliments this razor exceptionally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Gillette razors for quite some time now, and honestly believe they are about the best available.</li>
            <li>The result is an exceptionally close and pain-free shave.  </li>
            <li>The best shaves I get are still from a barber but the next best thing is the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology razor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette, for letting my try this awesome product for free!!!</li>
            <li>Great razor, it shaves very smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice clean look and an awesome shave!</li>
            <li>On top of all this you get the Gillette quality that you expect with the great name.</li>
            <li>LOL :)</li>
            <li>I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and this is their best so far.</li>
            <li>Im happy to say that love this razor.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide handle with Flexball technology is great, but the blades are even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very, very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li>Believe me he will be Happy :-)</li>
            <li>I have seen people complaining about the price, but you can get the razor refills in bulk quantities which makes it fairly cost effective.</li>
            <li>handle itself is perfect and is tapered at the right places and quite ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>The razor is supposed to follow the curves of my face for a perfect shave right?</li>
            <li>in all this really is a great razor that I would recommend to anybody seeking a more ergonomic and better functioning razor!</li>
            <li>flexball didn&#x27;t add anything for me in my shaving experience but again very impressed with the blades, the most important part.</li>
            <li>Great clean shave of course!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice already, and it&#x27;s a pretty awesome experience.</li>
            <li>I love the Flex Ball and the way it rotates around my face!</li>
            <li>I love this razor!</li>
            <li>many people over look this I bet!</li>
            <li>Unlike most plastic casings, no scissors required!</li>
            <li>After a month of shaves, I have not had any cuts and I haven&#x27;t had to run the razor over my face more then once!</li>
            <li>I love this razor!</li>
            <li>I love this product, but I think it&#x27;s over priced!  </li>
            <li>First off the Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>

            <li>and I have to say, I love this razor!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice already, and it&#x27;s a pretty awesome experience.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Gel is really easy on my face&lt;br /&gt;Gel smells great</li>
            <li>As usual and once again Gillette has done its best job on bringing out yet again one of their best and superior quality of razor which is the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor.</li>

            <li>And it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The 5 blades are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Ocean breeze shave gel is great formula to leave your skin feeling smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li>Every blade that Gillette has come out with is always amazing.  </li>
            <li>The razor is smooth, gets every area, even great on the chin, part of my neck and around my mouth.</li>
            <li>The proglide technology is amazing.  </li>

            <li>The flexball technology is amazing at cornering all of the bumps and contours of your face and neck.</li>
            <li>Well the ball on this is amazing.</li>
            <li>it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I received this razor free through Bzzagent in a promotion and I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li>and I have not gotten one nick or cut and for me that&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>The rotation is great also and lets me move smoothly around my face.</li>
            <li>This thing was amazing</li>
            <li>its really amazing.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to warm up to it, but I think the shave is smoother</li>
            <li>It allows the razor to perfectly contour to the curves on my face and the five blades allow for a very close shave without gouging the skin.</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because it really is the best shave I have had in a while.</li>
            <li>, it lathers well, foams up nice and works great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(she has her own fellas).  </li>
            <li>I has a nice feel to it</li>
            <li>The 5 blades provide a nice, close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>This was perhaps the most surprising thing.</li>
            <li>My own kids didn&#x27;t recognize me because of how &amp;#34;handsome&amp;#34; my face looked after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving shaving again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one I have to say it is one of kind.  </li>
            <li>Quite honestly before using it</li>
            <li>and I have really liked them.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.)</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for providing me with this great product!</li>
            <li>I had been using one with a battery that created vibrations to reduce friction and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Without a battery or vibration of any kind</li>
            <li>/&gt;The flexball is nice, though.</li>
            <li>My son (16yrs) was thrilled to receive this Razor, so thrilled that I thought I should&#x27;ve kept it for myself.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re just not as nice as a reusable one.</li>
            <li>This razor is really great; better than most razors I have used.</li>
            <li>So fast and reliable perfect for the novice or the pro.</li>
            <li>The Flex Ball is a nice addition to the razor.  </li>
            <li>Nice piece of equipment&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave gel honestly was the highlight for me.</li>
            <li>After using this razor, I can honestly say I would not use any other.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love the weight of this razor, it feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>Lots of blades got the shave nice and close and minimized the frequency of shaving.</li>
            <li>found the flexball to be effective in responding to the contours of my face while staying close to the skin.</li>
            <li>My honest opinion-all are overpriced.  </li>
            <li>It was a thing of beauty, and in addition it had these really nice rubberized grips.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion ProGlide stands out of the crowd with how effectively it works.</li>
            <li>The trimmer blade does an excellent job getting straight lines on my sideburns, and trimming close under my nose.  </li>
            <li>honestly thought I&#x27;d never use it again.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Gillette products and they just continue to get better.</li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I honestly felt like the blades did not get as close as my schick and</li>
            <li>The razor is smooth and comfortable and of course, gives a great shave!</li>
            <li>but what I&#x27;m really loving is the engineering of the heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 5 blades do provide a nice, close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>The razor has a flex ball that allows it to move freely and smoothly over your face helping to deliver that wonderful shave.</li>
            <li>this is absolutely the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Below is a breakdown of what I liked and disliked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the flexball handle - honestly I can leave it.</li>
            <li>, my wife has actullay token over my razor because she liked the close shave it gave her.</li>
            <li>That way the head flexes around the curves of your face is definitely a nice chance.</li>
            <li>The shaving gel was really nice</li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>The handle also has a nice feel.  </li>
            <li>First thoughts, the weight of the razor, in combination with good technique, feels great against the skin.</li>
            <li>The main feature and the best is the flexball.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this razor for an awesome shave while it creates a baby-smooth texture!</li>
            <li>I thank amazon for allowing me to try this amazing new design, which is with no doubt the newer and best in the lineup.</li>
            <li>foamed up perfectly and the scent that I ordered was fresh and strong.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the FlexBall technology, it contours really nicely to my face and has helped me get a cleaner and smoother shave!</li>
            <li>smooth nice shave!</li>
            <li>First - the design of the flexball is incredible.</li>
            <li>I got mine free to test &amp; had my best most comfortable shave ever.</li>
            <li>Gillette has a new user thats for sure!!!!</li>
            <li>I have found the combination of the gel and razor provide me with a truly smooth shave, a cool, refreshed sensation on my face and an added benefit - a very pleasant residual scent of an ocean breeze.  </li>
            <li>The competitive pricing of this razor, in combination with the soft supple skin in provides is a win win situation.</li>
            <li>It does a really great job of giving a close, comfortable shave, and the FlexBall makes it that much more maneuverable, but I do miss the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; function.</li>
            <li>good one, easy to shave</li>
            <li>But let me tell you I am very happy that I tried it, I love how the flexball contours to your face making it much easier to get a close shave in all the &amp;#34;awkward&amp;#34; areas of your face.  </li>
            <li>It really is perfect and has me ready to run to the store for more blades.</li>
            <li>It stays close to the skin for good coverage and leaves my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>but the flexball makes it very easy.</li>
            <li>and I get razor burn very easily.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the ocean breeze scent because it was very strong.</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best razor available out their right now and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m being very honest and fair in this review, much like all of my reviews.  </li>
            <li>Very good shave, very close, no irritation.</li>
            <li>this does a much better job of giving a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly defined jawline and the Flexball makes a huge difference navigating the contours of my face and neck by pivoting side to side while staying close to my skin without any added pressure.</li>
            <li>I did receive this razor as a free sample from Gillette, but please don&#x27;t think that is the reason for the good review.</li>
            <li>By far the best shave of my life.  </li>
            <li>Gel + Skin Care has a nice refreshing smell and helped with any razor burn.</li>
            <li>He liked it, but didn&#x27;t really love it.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I like the Gillette Fusion even better than the Hydro.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best shave money can buy.</li>
            <li>Well many artists use their own razor.</li>
            <li>My trial box came with the 2 in 1 shave gel also that smells great and leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>This product provides the best shave experience as far as manual razors go.</li>
            <li>as far as razors go the proglide is one of the best, I have been a fan of gilletes since the beggining of time.</li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
            <li>The Pro Glide has by far been the best shave I have gotten....</li>
            <li>I got this razor and I am very happy with the results thus far.  </li>
            <li>The gel strip ensures a smooth shave and is always a good indicator of wear and tear on the blades and lets me know when it&#x27;s time to change cartridges.</li>
            <li>First of all, I am impressed by the smooth sensation while I am shaving.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the smooth close shave from the first use of this product.  </li>
            <li>While the my first use of the ProGlide Flexible was incredible, the friction levels increased after more uses.</li>
            <li>First of all, I am impressed by the smooth sensation while I am shaving.</li>
            <li>love this gives a good shave and is easy to use</li>
            <li>The blades glide easily across the contours of my face, no nicks, no cuts!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, a world of a difference!  </li>
            <li>Once a person learns to use the unique razor design, it could provide for a superior shaving experience.</li>
            <li>But it is perfect for a clean and easy full shave.</li>
            <li>However, if money is no object, this is easily the fastest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Felt like a good, clean shave.    </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product that I would be happy to recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I don’t know how effective the Flexball is, but my overall impression of the shave is superb.  </li>
            <li>Now this is probably the best razor I have ever used, I am trying the product free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>I had found that combined with a good shaving gel, my electric shave was quick, effective, and satisfying.</li>
            <li>That being said, this gives a good clean, close shave</li>
            <li>(you know the saying, happy wife, happy life!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying different razors hoping to find one that worked well, but hadn&#x27;t found the \\&quot;right\\&quot; one yet.  </li>
            <li>The most prominent feature, the Flexball, allows the razor to pivot along the contours of your face nicely, ensures that no hair is missed while providing one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Its nice and close and leaves a nice smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>As part of the preview group, I received this razor and I can say that the results are amazing, only have to shave once a day and no irritation, incredible!</li>
            <li>Also, the greatest thing about this razor is I got it free; all thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>great razor great shave look no further</li>
            <li>First of all the product itself looks great.</li>
            <li>very pleased with the razor and the way it fit in my hand.</li>
            <li>After my first shave I was incredibly happy with it.</li>
            <li>It give the perfect smooth, clean, quick shave that it claims.</li>
            <li>I received this razor from BzzAgent to test out and it is a great all-around product!</li>
            <li>very comfortable shave</li>
            <li>The razor moved across my face very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The shave is very smooth and prevents ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>it moves to the contour of your face and is very comfortable shaving.</li>
            <li>It gives a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>The gel made the shave very smooth</li>
            <li>It does glide very smooth and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It gives a very smooth shave and the flexball technology</li>
            <li>very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>very comfortable feel while using.</li>
            <li>Very smooth</li>
            <li>but it did leave my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 9 hours since I shaved and my face still feels very smooth and with</li>
            <li>This razor produces a very smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>great product trim awesome no mess no hair left after a good shave</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m happy to say that for the first time, I think I found a razor I like better - The Gillette Fusion Proglide FlexBall.</li>
            <li>A great razor that will not fail to deliver you a close and comfortable shave every time!    </li>
            <li>Not all that thrilled with refill cartridge prices, but all the good ones are pretty pricey, not just these.</li>
            <li>I also liked how it was easy to glide across my face and into creases without leaving marks.</li>
            <li>The blades on the razor glided nicely and cut stubble easily, without tugging and pulling, as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I received  this product to try out for free and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>The thing I like the best about Gillette&#x27;s new razor was how smooth my shave was after running the razor over my face once.  </li>
            <li>: Best shave - the Fusion Proglide gets it right the first time around -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super smooth and works great.</li>
            <li>The razor has a good grip on it, smooth on my skin, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t proclaim to be the best shaver if you can&#x27;t adequately shave your whole face.</li>
            <li>The razor is fine, does its job but isn&#x27;t astounding by itself.</li>
            <li>Like I said, HUGE improvement in shaving experience!</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found another one that performs better.</li>
            <li>And this one touting the twist to lock top, I figured that&#x27;s about where it ended.</li>
            <li>More on that in a bit.</li>
            <li>Could probably shoot it across the room at someone, if I really wanted! :p  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was very impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li>They would probably see more benefit from the pivot than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably more the blade&#x27;s fault than it was the pivot feature, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it</li>
            <li>I just love this razor and the fact I can use the fusion blades I already have is just an added plus.</li>
            <li>Again, I felt that I was getting a better deal.</li>
            <li>To compare - With Gillette&#x27;s latest razor, the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology, you can expect to spend $4 or more per replacement cartridge.</li>
            <li>And the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology produces top notch results.</li>
            <li>The blade pivots front to back and side to side to respond to contours for the best shave you can get.</li>
            <li>; Well, you probably don&#x27;t have a team whose job it is to come up with better shaving products.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with the latest from Gillette  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Wow, what a smooth shave!  </li>
            <li>I found the HQ8 blades to be better than the HQ177</li>
            <li>Many reviewers contend otherwise</li>
            <li>ProGlide razor isn&#x27;t perfect and here is its one flaw: the razor head is big.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I would prefer to shave more often just</li>
            <li>Still love it over the Excel razor I used before.  </li>
            <li>more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really gives me a great, close shave</li>
            <li>as a summary i would say that i have used Fusion ProGlide razors before and this one is definitely better -</li>
            <li>I love the Gillette line of Fusion products, and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology is no exception.</li>
            <li>No nicks and best of all, no ingrown hairs the next couple of days after.</li>
            <li>With the awesome razor you don&#x27;t have to go over the same spots on your face</li>
            <li>more than once, one swipe and done.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really nice and smooth, no irritation.</li>
            <li>;. I don&#x27;t believe their slogan could be any more</li>
            <li>This was able to glide over my face and give me an almost barber ship type result.</li>
            <li>but more of a three-way pivot.</li>
            <li>I do not however think that the 5 blades shave any better than 3</li>
            <li>I love the closeness of the shave from this razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get as many bumps and nicks with this razor either.</li>
            <li>I dread shaving most days,  I can keep talking about technology, design and fancy marketing words…</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it was a great product, that gave me a really close shave</li>
            <li>I received the razor from bzz agent to try and must say The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with Flex Ball is simply the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free, thank you Gillette for sending it out to me!</li>
            <li>My favorite aspect was the moisturizing aspect.</li>
            <li>The shaving gel helped make the shave seem as smooth as silk!  </li>
            <li>A nice way to start the morning off with a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>totally love it.</li>
            <li>Gel + Skin Care to my fingers that I was going to be enjoying a premium product.</li>
            <li>And, most importantly, the post-shave face-wash revealed neither a millimeter of hair nor a microliter of blood!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start with the prominent feature: the FlexBall.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a great price on the razor blade, sometimes much cheaper the retail stores.</li>
            <li>The Razor works better than most that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t knock any stars off of the review, as I&#x27;m sure without the oil, it would be a non-issue.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d have to say that this is the best razor that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say my relationship with shaving has turned into love/love, as opposed to love</li>
            <li>I received this razor as part of a promotion, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>For the most part it seemed to make shaving quicker-</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using it and have continued to buy refills.</li>
            <li>so I figured what better time than now.</li>
            <li>I use this razor and love it.</li>
            <li>It holds to the contours of your face and leaves you baby smooth!  </li>
            <li>I just love how the Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball technology contoured every curve of my face.  </li>
            <li>Together with the fusion gel you couldn&#x27;t get a better shaving duo.</li>
            <li>love the ball</li>
            <li>The first time I used it on my legs, I was pretty impressed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>The trimmer on back is perfect for edging as well!</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>So, when offered a shot to try the latest Proglide, I had to take</li>
            <li>have discovered that in my case, that the best possible approach to shaving with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology and its blades, is to combine it with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>I love Gillette  </li>
            <li>Much better than the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; version (http://amzn.com/B00J3MPS4E )&lt;</li>
            <li>I can feel more pressure on my skin rather than the razor just making the turns with me.</li>
            <li>do I love this razor?  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think another razor would unseat the Gillette Fusion Power as my favorite, but this has.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is all I could ask for in a razor and more.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>The gillette Fusion Proglide is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I love the ergonomic design of this product.</li>
            <li>I love the vibration effect that the power razor has</li>
            <li>I have used manual razors for most of my life, and using electronic razors sometimes.  </li>
            <li>I love the close shave I get, and</li>
            <li>A nice smooth and shadow ridden shave.</li>
            <li>but that all many have just changed.  </li>
            <li>After i received a Fusion ProGlide Razor to try it a couple of months ago, i fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love the Gillette products.</li>
            <li>I love the blades that are on this razor.</li>
            <li>Love this razor how well it shaves my face so close to the skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhat inclined to request more items use the term, &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; in their names, but I suspect it&#x27;s been copywritten by</li>
            <li>My husband used it to shave his face, as most men do, and he found it to be, &amp;#34;pretty good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>That Adds Up To More Efficiency,</li>
            <li>In Theory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette claims two improvements by making a more flexible razor.</li>
            <li>And it makes sense; if you’re able to shave more efficiently, of course you’ll get that hair that keeps growing between your nose and your cheek.</li>
            <li>▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY razors and can never seem to get a close, even shave.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend also used it to shave her legs and said it was much better than her Venus razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a better shave.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this razor, after all I love the one I have been using.  </li>
            <li>but I do think that the ability to angle the head is helping to get a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why use 5 blades when just one will do the job better and faster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>acquainted myself with the razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective and precise.</li>
            <li>but it is for those who want an exceptional product that will get the job done well, and get it done quickly.</li>
            <li>From looks alone I was glad to give up the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok it works.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a superior razor and a great value.</li>
            <li>fusion proglide gets better and better.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and has a very premium build.</li>
            <li>If wasn&#x27;t for Gillete Fusion doing this promotion, I wouldn&#x27;t of been able to see how great their product really is.</li>
            <li>Gillette rebuilt shaving with the launch of the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology, and now it&#x27;s taken the best shave one step further by rebuilding the shave gel.</li>
            <li>I would use them over disposable bic razors that you find in bulk packs for sure.</li>
            <li>but I must say that this is a better product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie and say that this razor makes me look forward to shaving every day, but I will tell you that it leaves my face smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation!</li>
            <li>Gillette sent me one to try and I am so glad they did.  </li>
            <li>The Flexball technology is pivotal in getting a better shave(pun intended).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going in my travel bag for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably why I wear a beard most of the time.  </li>
            <li>What more can a man ask for.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Skin Care has also been enjoyable to use.  </li>
            <li>they just cost more for the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>YI used it many times before it dulled.</li>
            <li>(I do not use a power handle) because I swear I get a better shave from the micro-comb the power heads have.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The ball technology helps the blade move across the contours of your face with a more even stroke that seems to get just about every hair.  </li>
            <li>This razor is awesome, and it is the next step in razor technology.  </li>
            <li>and that was mostly my neck area.</li>
            <li>I received this a a free promo from Gillette!</li>
            <li>Face feels smooth as silk after!</li>
            <li>Also the top of the gel locks.</li>
            <li>and I love the way his face feels after.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but im glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>but like I said the difference is in the Flexball for sure.</li>
            <li>With the Gillette shave gel + skin care, the experience became a lot better.</li>
            <li>It hugged my face and stayed in contact more closely.</li>
            <li>As a BzzAgent, I was able to test this product.  </li>
            <li>After receiving this razor as part of an advanced preview, I can honestly say that this is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve used, and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li>The most noticeable feature is of course the Flex Ball.</li>
            <li>I always enjoyed the blades</li>
            <li>I recently received the product on promotion from Gillette and was impressed.</li>
            <li>I love love this brand of razor.</li>
            <li>I have used this razor before and found after using it many times I have grown to like this razor.  </li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>The flexball makes for more maneuverability.  </li>
            <li>you can find the cartridges cheap, buy in bulk!</li>
            <li>This was better than my Schick.  </li>
            <li>I like the razor and i like the shave, but i honestly haven&#x27;t noticed that the ball makes a HUGE impact on my shave.</li>
            <li>It seems like most guys hold on to their ole trusty razor for years without considering replacing it.</li>
            <li>smooth shave that is nice and close.</li>
            <li>I love Gillette and all of there products</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed this razr.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It contours to your face for a better shave.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that is so innovative and works</li>
            <li>I used to use Gillette razors, but stopped buying them when the price was more than $1.00 per blade.  </li>
            <li>While I love the razor, the blade, and all the features, the cost of each blade is still an issue for me.  </li>
            <li>though what is so much better with this razor then</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure it was a product that I would want to invest money in</li>
            <li>and I love Gillette.  </li>
            <li>love the weight of the metallic handle in my hand as well</li>
            <li>This razor stays on all the contours of my face and minimizes the number of times I need to go over places more than once.  </li>
            <li>I love gillette products.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>have used most of the Gillette razor varieties through the years, and this has the newest feature you never knew you needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Mach 3 blades to much better for me and don’t clog as</li>
            <li>I received this from bzzagent for review and was extremely pleased with this razor, I have been using gillette razors for years, just didn&#x27;t see the need to upgrade to the flexball technology.</li>
            <li>genius at Gillette thought this would be appropriate to shave beneath the nose, around the mouth, and evening out sideburns?</li>
            <li>This seems to be more of a marketing item to get people to spend money on upgrading their razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the flexball...makes it easier to reach parts</li>
            <li>FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.</li>
            <li>All this should translate into not only the best shave ever, but smoothest as well,</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of heft to it, which allows for a confident, close shave.</li>
            <li>The flexball tecnology allows me to confidently traverse the countours of my face.</li>
            <li>Now like most of you</li>
            <li>I have seen this before many times and I thought maybe it would work</li>
            <li>The joint rotates more than I have ever needed but it makes a difference for me while shaving my jaw line and on to my neck.</li>
            <li>Many of the advertisements seem to say you can use a blade for two weeks.</li>
            <li>and I think I will try one more, then check the blade for changing.</li>
            <li>If you shave a lot, you will love this razor.</li>
            <li>I enjoying this razor.</li>
            <li>I always knew Gillette is one of the top makers for men&#x27;s grooming products in the market, so I was already optimistic about this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, the ProGlide is an awesome razor.  </li>
            <li>The packaging has been redesigned so you can&#x27;t cut yourself on the blister pack...and the razor itself is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the shave and the shave gel had been outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the ball makes it contour my face to give me a close shave.</li>
            <li>Gillette has been a household brand for many years now.</li>
            <li>The gel is much better.</li>
            <li>Together they are a winning combination.</li>
            <li>I love putting the shave gel on in the morning after a shower and feeling the cooling sensation hit my face.</li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology free from Gillette and in exchange I would give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>if he does, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Gillette for years and have always enjoyed them as they work as desired.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and no issues here!</li>
            <li>And to put it simply, this razor is one of the best ones I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I also liked how comfortable the handle felt and sat in my hand when using it.</li>
            <li>andI think they provide a much better shave than any manual razor.</li>
            <li>So while I like this razor, I think it would be that much better if it was battery</li>
            <li>This razor was generously provided to me by the lovely people at Gillette to try.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I tried this gel.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>Definitely good and worth the money, but didn&#x27;t go &amp;#34;above and beyond&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li>I Love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Technology and</li>
            <li>I have tried others but nothing else gives me a closer or better shave than a Gillette Razor.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>All in all this set is really nice and any man would enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love how the rubber grip handle doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>I almost always get a cut or knick and have patches that no razor seems to be able to cut.  </li>
            <li>A must try for all shavers including ones who think that their&#x27;s is better.</li>
            <li>but it really does feel great in your hand.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s start with the prominent feature: the FlexBall.</li>
            <li>It costs much more, but if you&#x27;re in a hurry, it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li>So all in all im glad o was finally able to add it to my collection.</li>
            <li>Now if they could make a blade that lasts longer here, I&#x27;d be in love.  </li>
            <li>I love Gillette razors because I am susceptible to razor bumps and have been able to avoid them since I switched.  </li>
            <li>Right when I picked up this razor, I loved the feel of it ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a good razor… just not the right one for my face, but I will admit I am picky.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth and leaves a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Very quick and easy way to shave!</li>
            <li>Very unique.</li>
            <li>Make sure to get the shave gel as well for that close shave and the new close top gels makes me happy because it stops the loss of gel even after I am done using it.  </li>
            <li>The razor gave me a really nice clean shave .</li>
            <li>The razor has a cool design and a nice handle for gripping and control.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor is a quality razor and gives a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>I really have to say this razor was pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>, I got a great shave from my older Fusion.  </li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion Proglide, which I received without charge through the Amazon Vine Program, promises much (“Responds to contours for our best shave,” “Less tug and pull for incredible comfort”).</li>
            <li>After using this I can say that it delivers a smooth, even shave every time, and is very easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The handle is very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The Flexball makes it very easy to maneuver for smooth curves for any design.</li>
            <li>The gel quickly produces a rich lather and imparts a pleasant cooling sensation on application.</li>
            <li>happy with this razor - highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more than happy with this new FlexBall addition to the razor.</li>
            <li>The shave gel was easy to apply, smelled great and aided in the fast shave.  </li>
            <li>with the 2-1 shaving cream (which has an extremely pleasant scent), the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Razor and shaving cream are absolutely a recommendation I can gladly make.</li>
            <li>It provides a very clean shave, and I did not experience any nicks or cuts on my face while using the product.</li>
            <li>When manually moving the head, it does move very smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try this great product for free.</li>
            <li>This has given the best shave that he has had in a long time.</li>
            <li>The handle is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The gel is pretty good.</li>
            <li>it’s a pretty good idea.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this razor to absolutely anyone looking for a nice shave!</li>
            <li>handle and flexball felt pretty good</li>
            <li>However my review is honest and true.</li>
            <li>for the shaving that this blade provides, it is what you would (and should) expect, a good consistent shave that does not slice your face off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good shave</li>
            <li>This is a great new razor from Gillette.</li>
            <li>I love the flexball handle, even on my legs it makes it easy to work over the tougher areas, like my knees and the backs of my ankles.</li>
            <li>I love how it can easily get around the curves of my face and can&#x27;t wait to keep using it.</li>
            <li>I love how easily this glides across my skin without any pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li>I love this razor as I have used it three times already and still going strong.</li>
            <li>I received Ocean Breeze and it had a nice mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is wonderful, it really does rotate and adapt to your face to make shaving a much easier task without all the worry.</li>
            <li>, Awesome not only did the gel smooth my skin</li>
            <li>I was naturally intrigues by this one, and the great guys at Bzzagent made sure I got one.</li>
            <li>They also clean out very easily and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>However, I do remember my first impression of the razor, and I have to say, &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; This razor has a great metal design, and, in my opinion, very eye catching.</li>
            <li>however this is by far the best Razor on the market right now.</li>
            <li>Compared to many other brands Gillette just is the best.</li>
            <li>It is great with all new technology it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it gives me a nice, smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li>Gave me a nice smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li>It gave a nice smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li>would rate it very good and will use it as my daily razor.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very good razor and shaving gel</li>
            <li>This led to a quicker, cleaner, and more accurate shave.</li>
            <li>As part of the latest BzzAgent campaign, I was given the opportunity to try this product free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>I love my Norelco because it provides a smooth, close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the ProGlide for its smooth, non-irritating shave.  </li>
            <li>Replacement cartridges are pricey, but my masochistic love affair with the cheap razors is over.  </li>
            <li>I love how this razor hugs the contours of my face to give me a close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Well i got to try this product for free and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>After reaching up and feeling scruff for months on end, it was refreshing to feel incredibly smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Either way, I am very happy with the product, as I mentioned before, have been using it for a long time for it is the more convenient and effective method to shave without taking too much time to do it.</li>
            <li>BzzAgent provided me with a free Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball (manual), and I love it.  </li>
            <li>so I jumped at the chance to be able to try their newest Flexball razor for free through Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the most important thing for</li>
            <li>I love this razor, it is smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the way the handle is design and the way the razor glides so smoothly over my face.</li>
            <li>and I was even able to shave comfortably WITHOUT shaving cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had better results getting a smooth shave using the manual razors rather than the electic razors.  </li>
            <li>I take free samples - LOVE</li>
            <li>Glad I got it from Bzzagent for free.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free promotion from Gillette, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>I received this razor as part of a free promotion from Gillette, but I must say its one of the better manual razors that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This razor allows me to shave a lot quicker since i am able to move smoothly around edges.</li>
            <li>I have consistently used Gillette razors because the build quality is superb - the handle is sturdy and solid and the gel strip ensures a smooth shave and provides a nice indicator of when it is time to change cartridge.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li>From the Gillette Company, I was able to get and test this product for free.  </li>
            <li>I have found using an electric razor to be an easier more comfortable shave</li>
            <li>It made shaving so much more smooth, and easier than ever.</li>
            <li>It my experience that added feature makes the shave even more smooth.</li>
            <li>So far I have to say its a great blade</li>
            <li>The FlexBall technology helps when shaving under your neck leading up to your chin for a more precise shave.</li>
            <li>Skin Care was not messy or gooey which was great for not cleaning my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I was able to try their Fusion Proglide Manual Razor with Flexball Technology for free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care so much about the flex ball since I seem to get good</li>
            <li>It really makes my face feel good when shaving.  </li>
            <li>Besides for that, it is basically a good manual razor that keeps your skin taught and blades moving without much tugging.</li>
            <li>It gives a very clean shave, very smooth, works great on coarse hair like mine, and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>This razor really does live up to the hype, and I&#x27;m very happy with the decision to get it.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with this new razor.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, this razor is still treating me right, and is as great a shave as the first time.</li>
            <li>So I tried it right out of the box and let me tell you; the flex ball technology is nice.</li>
            <li>But the razor is great on its own because not only does it flex in the right way, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold while shaving because of the rubber grips, size and shape of the handle.</li>
            <li>This was free as a promotion and it is the best shave I have had in a long time!!</li>
            <li>It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>time I was more excited to try this product than ever before.</li>
            <li>… Is the Fusion ProGlide any better than the original Gillette Fusion???  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they kept it working with original handle.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and the flexball is a unique and interesting idea for a razor.  </li>
            <li>My face has a lot of sharp edges and this razor does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been true to my brands over the years (hats off to you my trusty disposable dollar razor!)</li>
            <li>the Fusion ProGlide any better than the original Gillette Fusion???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me it did not offer a measurably better shave than the original ProGlide.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a unique twisting top that blocks the opening</li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially compared to the DSC, I don&#x27;t have to shave several times to get a very good, smooth feel.</li>
            <li>I would recommend that if you get razor burn easily.</li>
            <li>I have yet to cut my face with this blade and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truth is that it helps with shave but don&#x27;t expect any breakthrough or more clean shave because of FlexBall</li>
            <li>and it worked its magic to get me clean shaven in under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>The razor easily contours itself to your face as you use it.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily clean it out though.</li>
            <li>Easily cuts my beard in one stroke.  </li>
            <li>The easy flexing of this  handle does not provide any benefit.</li>
            <li>Its easy on my face.</li>
            <li>It just really easy to shave around the bumps and contours of your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The precision trimmer is noticeable better at trimming hairs, including semi-long ones, and also washes clean easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold &amp; contoured well in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I started shaving using my father’s razor, an old-fashioned one blade model that was easy to load (just spin the handle and the top opened up) and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The shave is easy and effortless.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll make it easy for you-</li>
            <li>Not an easy task.  </li>
            <li>Its basically a more comfortable, efficient and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This feature makes shaving easy, the Flex Ball moves to the shape of your face and will take the hurtle of cheek to under your chin like a pro.</li>
            <li>I found out very quickly that it was not the case.</li>
            <li>The ergonomic design of the handle made it easy to grip.</li>
            <li>It glides to every curve on my face, and the grip of the handles makes it so easy to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>razor is lightweight and easy to transport wherever you need to go.</li>
            <li>It seems to fit my hand much more comfortably.</li>
            <li>Clogs easily if I don&#x27;t shave for a day or</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can easily say that this product meets both of these requirements.  </li>
            <li>I like the blades and how easy it is to rinse out.</li>
            <li>The heft and feel of the handle make it easy to maintain contact without digging in.  </li>
            <li>The ball joint allows the head to swivel easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering how many shaves you get per blade, this will certainly be more economical than my Quatro blades.</li>
            <li>more shave swipes before you have to clean it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and handles like a charm.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to use and glides well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to hold, even in the shower.</li>
            <li>the sample that I received came in “Active Sport” scent, which is an awesome aroma.  </li>
            <li>But not too strong to irritate while shaving.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - This is a strong four star shave.</li>
            <li>The proglide gel is also strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I strongly suggest that you give him the Flexball razor and 2 in 1 shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I have to admit its the coolest lookin razor, very easy to use, fun.</li>
            <li>it smelled great very fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li>Overall an amazing product for an amazing price to give you the most convenient, easy and smooth shave right from your home for an amazing cost.</li>
            <li>I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>The Razor has great grip and fits comfortably into my hand,i like the design it is simple yet appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever I can shave and it&#x27;s looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the razor, it is a smooth shave and is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was kind of leery at first</li>
            <li>flexibility of the moving head is the main difference and while it had a good feel and seemed smooth and easy to handle</li>
            <li>Plus the lubrastrip basically melts away in the presence of warm water during the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but more than</li>
            <li>I have always used Gillettes razors because I feel like they have always been the superior product on the market and have always been available at a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love the handle of this particular razor for the amazing grip it provides with the rubber like handle.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best manual razor i ever used.</li>
            <li>In particular, it was more effective below my nose and along my jawline, which is area where I often have missed hairs.</li>
            <li>Gillette is hands down the best razor in the market today.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Flexball because it really does fulfill what it is advertised to do and offers a comfortable shave, primarily because of the flexball technology and ergonomic design.</li>
            <li>The razor cartridges are just as good as I&#x27;ve come to expect, nothing new there.  </li>
            <li>I was tentative to try something new, but wanted to give it a fair shake.  </li>

            <li>Fusion ProGlide razor with flexball technology is an excellent over previous razor.</li>

            <li>Wow, was I pleasantly</li>
            <li>The lubricating strip delivers a quick, refreshing application of moisturizer that helps ward off pesky razor burn.  </li>

            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with Gillette and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase their products.</li>
            <li>Side note: i did get this for free, so I cant complain.</li>
            <li>When shaving I would sometimes get it smooth and some times not.</li>
            <li>I must say with the ProGlide Silver it is smooth every time.</li>
            <li>The blades glide effortlessly over any contour of the face and leaves a smooth finish in one pass.</li>
            <li>I got to try this razor #free through a BZZagent campaign.</li>
            <li>I have never had a shave this close and smooth and no razer burn.  </li>
            <li>I was using the Fusion ProGlide Styler, but I found it rather bulky to shave with, though the razor cartridges give a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying this fro free thanks  to Gillette, and I really think is a great product that definetely will buy again</li>
            <li>Honestly, compared to the amount it can swivel, I didn&#x27;t see it swivel much.</li>
            <li>As with all Fusion products, the shave is smooth and painless.</li>

            <li>the swivel works great, however if you have a chubby face such as myself...</li>
            <li>I liked that you can flip up the top portion to use the top blade as a straight-edge, but have found the moisturizing strip to not work as well as it did several years back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>is really important.  </li>
            <li>For someone like me who wants to look his best at all times it&#x27;s important to me to be properly lined up , the fusion proglide accomplishes this with its edging blade.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really enjoy that.</li>
            <li>I got one of these free from Gillette to review.</li>
            <li>I own many different razors but the Fusion model is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>Let me start with I got this product for free through bzzagent.</li>
            <li>But then I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor free as part of a promotion from Gillette and now shaving is a breeze.</li>
            <li>I received this razor as a promotion as a BzzAgent and this is a fantastic razor.  </li>
            <li>and I think the Fusion before that and this Flexball model gives you the same GREAT shave.  </li>
            <li>NO, my opinion is that I don&#x27;t see the advantage of the Flexball as of my 2nd shave, did I get a great close shave?</li>
            <li>the Razor Gillette included a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor for free as part of a promotion run by Gillette through BzzAgent to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for all the reasons I noted above, this is a great razor, battery-powered or not.</li>
            <li>story short, its great.  </li>
            <li>It just felt so good and natural that I couldn&#x27;t resist to share it with my coworkers.</li>
            <li>The front and aft tilt is more than enough for a good shave.</li>
            <li>I have had the chance to use it twice thus far and in both time after thinking I had a good close shave, upon washing off, it&#x27;s not quite done.  </li>
            <li>So for me the razor is good but not quite near perfection yet.</li>
            <li>Ok so i don&#x27;t really do that many reviews on products.</li>
            <li>so I tend to just uses and good old fashion 3 blade</li>
            <li>: The most notable and important feature that separates this razor from the rest is the FlexBall Technology, so it comes as no surprise that this innovation really stands out.</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised at how good it was.</li>
            <li>You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting.</li>
            <li>This new flex ball technology is pretty great too.  </li>
            <li>I just used this new one for the first time today and it worked great.</li>
            <li>did receive this as a special promotion but the price for the blade and gel is easily within my price range</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overal, the Gillette Fusion Proglide is a very good razor - sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li>believe the two most important things when it comes to shaving is a great lubricating cream/gel/soap and an incredibly sharp blade.  </li>
            <li>The pivoting head makes sure just the right amount of pressure is applied and the weight of the handle allows for the razor to do the work for you.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying this razor, top notch!</li>
            <li>I feel like i have a baby face and received many positive comments from females!</li>
            <li>The foam is thicker and stickier than most, leaving strings as you pull away and dropping some while applying but other then that, great performance.</li>
            <li>The first was/is a Norelco electric shaver, which is fine and does a good job and is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>The razor overall is very nice</li>
            <li>The shaving gel was easy to use and I really liked the new structure that didn&#x27;t require a cap.  </li>
            <li>The razor is a good shave but not really any better but definitely not worse than the older one, so a good buy if you need a new razor, and the shaving gel is great from container to scent and providing a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It contours perfectly to your face which not only makes it possible to easily get to every hair, but it also shaves them more evenly and closer.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that this razor is worth changing out from the original Fusion Proglide!</li>
            <li>I have a clean smooth shave like never before.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a really smooth clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I bleed super easy and even after using this four times no blood.</li>
            <li>I also went 7 days without shaving and it still was a quick easy shave without the tugging and pulling of the longer whiskers.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this razor free thanks for Gillette!</li>
            <li>I love how this leaves my skin baby smooth virtually on the first pass and the way the head of the razor moves with the contours of my face</li>
            <li>The overall shave was very smooth and the way the razor glides around the corners of my face makes it an impressive improvement over the traditional razors.</li>
            <li>Best shave I have ever had made blade slid with very little effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved how easy it was to open the plastic casing.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the process is smooth and pleasant.</li>
            <li>really helps the razor to glide more easily around the face.</li>
            <li>I seem to be able to get about 5 good shaves out of a single razor cartridge.  </li>
            <li>Initial impression on these items, definitely impressed and know that I&#x27;ll most likely look for these shaving gels for replace..</li>
            <li>so far i am very pleased and will continue using this</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Gillette gave me this razor to review and honestly, I am not disappointed in the slightest.</li>
            <li>I found a small amout of the gel went along way and provided some of the best protection I have every received from shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Sent is cool smooth and makes the Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology glide over face and skin with no razor burn,</li>
            <li>I love them both, but I give the flexball the higher rating.</li>
            <li>But the blade of the proglide razor is definitely friendly towards your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Schick Hydro 5 for the past couple of years and thought that it was the best shave out there.  </li>
            <li>Replacement blades are a bit pricey, but well worth the cost for a repeatably close shave every time!  </li>
            <li>I got to try this shaver free thanks to gillette and in my opinion its the best shaver i used it glides smoothly across my skin and dont sutter on my beard like other shavers</li>
            <li>, I was enlightened by switching to double edge safety razors and my eyes were opened to how pleasurable, smooth, relaxing, and comfortable a good shave can be.  </li>
            <li>My husband was excited when I showed him what came from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>The FlexBall technology does make a significant difference and the difference is felt shave after shave.  </li>
            <li>The fact is that this is the first razor, and I have tried many, that has provided me a close shave with no burn.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s better, is that you really cannot beat the price Amazon is offering!</li>
            <li>give this two thumbs up and for the price this is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>The Gillete Fusion ProGlide is definitely worth checking out!</li>
            <li>He was excited to switch to another model for variety.  </li>
            <li>First off, Gillette sent me this razor FREE to test it out for them!</li>
            <li>I received the Fusion ProGlide manual razor through bzz agent courtesy of Gillette and of course was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure, I received the product free from Gillette as part of a promotional offer, but I still believe in the razor and its blades.&lt;br /&gt;#sponsored.</li>
            <li>and I was really excited when I was offered to try out this product.</li>
            <li>Loved that the Fusion ProGlide was smooth and provided a comfortable shave especially when I used it with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>For me, it is ok and can fill a slot in my razor arsenal for a quick, mild shave, but it simply doesn&#x27;t compare to a good safety razor.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor has a very good blade that delivers a smooth shave even after two weeks of heavy use.  </li>
            <li>However it has a nice design and new features as the cap lock and the level indicator.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Weight and grip of the razor felt solid and good, not plasticky or cheap.  </li>
            <li>When all is said and done, I have a clean shaven face with no cuts or nicks.</li>
            <li>I received this free as part of a promotion and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it is.</li>
            <li>today, I work as a Firefighter and we have to be clean shaven since I had to work in the morning</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin feeling clean but not irritated.</li>
            <li>but Gillette is my go to brand for close and clean shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is great and definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lately, I&#x27;ve just been using the Proglides for a &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; shave, or to clean up after an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone that wants a rash free most comfy shave of any part of the body.</li>
            <li>I used the sensitive shave gel and was more than pleased.</li>
            <li>also used the Flexball (!) razor with somewhat more enthusiastic results.</li>
            <li>As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have never used a razor with more than three blades, the last being a Gilette Mach 3 Turbo, which I still own and use on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>so I could clean up my face when the Proglide razor failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>today, I work as a Salesman and we have to be clean shaven since I had to work in the morning</li>
            <li>I am enjoying it for free Thanks for Gillette.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate that the nozzle stays clean and the canister doesn&#x27;t rust.  </li>
            <li>, I got a clean close shave with no bleeding or nics.  </li>
            <li>With the Fusion Proglide, the area would be clean with one to two passes of the razor.</li>
            <li>Sure, the lubricating strip is gone after the first head shave, but the razor blades themselves lasted a full 5 head shaves before I had to change the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>The flex ball helps get you a closer shave and the blades cut cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>shave was quick, close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Mach 3, for whatever reason, is also easier to clean between swipes</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Through BzzAgent and Gillette, I tried Gillette&#x27;s Alpine Clean 2-in-1 Gel and Flexball Razor and found both to make shaving a lot easier.</li>
            <li>I give my razor a quick rinse before each pass and that helps keep the blades free of hair and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I am not sold that the swivel head really made much of a difference, but the razor was a good one...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a single person, at work, cared at all that my wife was happy with the results from this razor, at all.</li>
            <li>The new Gillette shave gel allows for a very cool and refreshing shave as well.</li>
            <li>At first the steep angle of the blades threw me off, but overall its a great razor and results in a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Gillette, I can safely say, offers the best blades, offering little to non existent tugging and pulling you would experience from cheap, disposable razors.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this new razor is that it has a good weight to it.  </li>
            <li>My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li>My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor I have ever used thanks to its new flex-ball technology.</li>
            <li>have a full beard and mustache, but I keep my neck and cheekbones clean cut, so I don&#x27;t have any experience with the razor on my cheeks/chin/etc.</li>
            <li>I got this razor from the fine folks at Gillette and got to say it&#x27;s worth the fuss.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very fresh and exactly what I would imagine based on the name, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>have found the RIGHT razor for me!  </li>
            <li>Was I right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap but this shouldn&#x27;t discourage those of you who are willing to make the investment!  </li>
            <li>The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling clean in soft with a nice scent</li>
            <li>This razor is especially good going around contours and getting hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li>The piveting head is awesome for getting around those hard areas.</li>
            <li>Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is a very good razor, I love the textured handle, the grip feels great in your hands and allows you to get a really close shave in hard to reach areas such as your neck, chin and around the lips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also trying the product for free thanks to Gillette which is very cool</li>
            <li>I did not see that the swivel feature made a great deal of difference in comfort, and in some cases, it made it harder to reach beard hair in dimpled areas of the lower chin.</li>
            <li>As expected, this newest razor continues the trend of great shaving products.</li>
            <li>I have been using mostly Gillette products for the better of a decade and more, and so far I have grown accustomed to using this particular shaver, which I guess makes me loyal to the brand.</li>
            <li>But to me, a smooth shave that does not hurt my skin is worth the price premium.</li>
            <li>I had a full caveman beard going on for a while</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave often and when I do I really want it to be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>Is it really that much better than the razor I have been using?</li>
            <li>The gliding action on your face is really nice.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love that its much cheaper than the razor geared toward women.</li>
            <li>I switch full time from my Mach Three?</li>
            <li>It looks really cool.</li>
            <li>I love how the razor feels in my hands, its very lightweight and the flexball allows the razor to bend around my neck and chin areas.  </li>
            <li>It really knows how to contour to my face, which by the way has many ups and downs.  </li>
            <li>Overall both the razor and gel is a good product.</li>
            <li>I like this version much better, the vibrations really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Despite receiving it for free, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>What is incontrovertible is that this razor provides the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever encountered, even better than Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3, which was my former reference</li>
            <li>but it feels a lot better and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; as much when I shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this razor to anyone who doesn&#x27;t use a full featured electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Loved it, never went back!  </li>
            <li>The razor has a good weight and the comfortable handle stays secure even when wet.  </li>
            <li>I like my safety razors more just because they get much closer and are cheaper, but these are satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li>It also leaves a cool feeling on your skin after use.</li>
            <li>If you have a more chizzled face this would work really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for sending me this razor to try for free!</li>
            <li>Full Disclosure</li>
            <li>True test will be the longevity of the blades and the cost of refills.  </li>
            <li>I like this razor much better because it makes cleaning out the blades much easier.</li>
            <li>Dollar Shave Club blades will be good enough -  until I decide I want the luxurious shave provided by the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor.</li>
            <li>However, upon using it, I found it to be the most versatile razor I had ever used in my whole life.</li>
            <li>so that was cool.</li>
            <li>I say so far I&#x27;m loving the blade.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette, I got to try this product for free!</li>
            <li>I was absolutely 100% pleased with this Gillette Fusion Proglide razor.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>These replaceable razors usually last a good six weeks before you have to change them, sometimes longer.</li>
            <li>The flexball technology was really cool and allowed for the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Simply because that version exists and is superior in every way to this razor, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor will never get five stars in my book.</li>
            <li>And the prize is not bad for this razor either.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>Sure it looks cool, but I couldn&#x27;t feel a difference and can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s superior to any of the previous Gillette proglide razors.</li>
            <li>I got a free trial of the new razor and love it.</li>
            <li>I was recently able to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall technology free from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I have thoroughly enjoyed my new ProGlide razor that Gillette provided to me free of charge for my opinion.</li>
            <li>so I continue to get a closer, more comfortable shave with each new product.</li>
            <li>It was seamless and gentle and pleasant, even.</li>
            <li>Gillette&#x27;s latest razor is a good upgrade to their previous razors.</li>
            <li>The results were impressive, although I still believe a straight razor is much less time consuming and the shave is closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The absolutely no mess at this point is nice as well.</li>
            <li>This razor is great, that rolling ball really helps with getting in there better than other razors do.</li>
            <li>I love this shave its clean, smooth, and pretty much gets every area of my face.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive neck area that always gives me problems, but I have had great luck with the ProGLide so far.</li>
            <li>I was able to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide after Gillette sent me a free one to try and I will say I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Very smooth, highly recommend</li>
            <li>Sure, they won&#x27;t give you the same shave as a safety razor or straight razor, but this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>My skin on my face tends to be very sensitive and for years I have searched for the perfect razor that will assist me with getting a great barbershop shave but also caressing my skin enough that I will not break out or have a raw experience after shaving.  </li>
            <li>but there were other great features about the ProGlide razor.  </li>
            <li>Bzzagent was kind enough to grant me my very first for this review, and I thank them wholeheartedly for that!</li>
            <li>I really like the new football technology, it allows for a nice smooth shave that moves with the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>The improvements are subtle, but impressive.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty fine razor in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This razor has always caught my attention every time I passed by the mens care section at the super market.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I don&#x27;t think I was quite able to take advantage of the pivoting feature of this particular handle.  </li>
            <li>If I am able to shave more often, then I can be content with a close enough shave rather than needing that super close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used many razors in my life but this is the first to not leave any cuts after the first 3 uses.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t replaced the head yet, which I&#x27;ve used over a dozen times and it should be good for a few more shaves.</li>
            <li>I am now a loyal Gillette consumer for life.</li>
            <li>If and when they combine the two into one super razor, I would give that product 6 stars.  </li>
            <li>My shave was so quick and efficient</li>
            <li>When I was in the mood for a quick shave I used the Norelco, when I was looking for a closer cut I would use the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I need a razor that works well and quickly gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>So naturally when I tried this product, I was expecting a good shave, but really because of the pricey razor blades</li>
            <li>The razor have 5 blades that help with the quick shave that is sometimes needed in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>The bending head, the heavy handle, and the trimming blade are all wonderful aspects that are still in place and should be appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Instead of going over an area several times form several different directions trying to get an even cut, I was able to just go over the top of my head once and things were perfect.</li>
            <li>A quick summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky to get it.</li>
            <li>it was a quick shave.</li>
            <li>Then the razor just makes quick work of whatever growth I have going on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the powered razors for sometime and found this transition very easy and can see myself replacing my old Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li>I rate it right there with the original Fusion.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a top of the line razor but not at gold prices.</li>
            <li>It works smoothly, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>As usual the presentation was very good.</li>
            <li>The best part is I don&#x27;t have to make multiple passes across my face as its cut down my total time for shaving while still giving me great results.</li>
            <li>It provides an amazingly close shave without the nicks or redness generally associated with close shaves.</li>
            <li>I received this for free as a promotion from Gillette, thanks!</li>
            <li>I got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette!</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just my skin, but I still get a tad of razor burn afterwards - although better than normal razors.  </li>
            <li>I really liked both the Shave gel and the razor, the shave gel had a nice smell and left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>After all, those faces are pretty important.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how incredibly smooth my face felt after using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>The first is that you’ll miss 20% fewer hairs on your face, which for the hirsute is something fairly important.</li>
            <li>The mobile head allowing the razor to turn more laterally at different angles is nice, but again isn&#x27;t something that you absolutely have to have either.</li>
            <li>First, the handle is a bit too light for my taste.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product as a free sample from Gillette, and it was not the first Gillette razor I had used.  </li>
            <li>I first want to disclose that I received this razor free through a promotion from Gillette and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I normally use an electric razor and I get much better results with my electric razor.</li>
            <li>I received this for free as a promotion from Gillette - Thanks!</li>
            <li>The handle is sturdy and has rubber grooves that prevent the razor from slipping out of your hand when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by how the razor was able to shave my beard with minimal tugging and afterwards, I felt no irritation on my face.</li>
            <li>This newer development on the trustworthy Proglide series, is without a doubt a step on the right direction, without trying to say that is way much better to the previous model, it is slightly better, feels more manageable and somehow, even sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The razor produced a pretty good shave and left my skin feeling clean and fresh without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I credit the lubrication strip included on the cartridges as well as the new shave gel which goes on smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks  for keeping it clean + comfortable.</li>
            <li>so this razor does very well, leaving me a smooth and clean looking.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that I am razor burn free and enjoying a smooth face for the first time in a long long time.</li>
            <li>I would like to give a special thanks to buzz agent which i am a member of and allowing me to try this product, and also thanks to gillette for creating a fine product!</li>
            <li>This can be attributed to the very sharp razors and the flexball the allows the razor to keep great contact to the contours on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was able to try the product for free due to a campaign by Gillette, and I am thoroughly satisfied with the razor.</li>
            <li>Every new &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; they come up with they change the connector of the blade, so if you are thinking you are going to use your favorite (and cheaper)</li>
            <li>so I can go stock up on blades for what appears to be her new favorite razor.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite razor from Gillette, and I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them over the years.  </li>
            <li>This Gillette razor is my new favorite choice</li>
            <li>This new Proglide is the latest incarnation of this marketing campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the new Fusion Razor.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try the sensitive gel and the Fusion Pro Glide Razor to see if I could finally get a nice close shave, irritation free....</li>
            <li>And again, the weight and look of the new razor is so amazing that I&#x27;m more than willing to let go of my old one</li>
            <li>Easy to hold thanks to the  matte</li>
            <li>Rinsing the razor was pleasant as well, as I noticed not the slightest clogging as I&#x27;d expected with the 4 blades, and longer stubble.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best disposable shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>I got the same results which is exactly what I am looking for in a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin most razor</li>
            <li>The fact that this was free is not the reason for my positive review.</li>
            <li>first comments were &amp;#34;Wow!  </li>
            <li>You keep saying to yourself, &amp;#34; Coleman this can&#x27;t possibly get more awesome!&amp;#34; BUT IT CAN!</li>
            <li>For the first time ever, I don&#x27;t mind shaving!  </li>
            <li>These two as a tag team makes my life of shaving a whole lot beter!!</li>
            <li>It is such an easy, smooth, close shave!</li>
            <li>Flexball handle is really a nice upgrade from the previous version allowing the razor to swivel and flex even more than before.</li>
            <li>However, the upgraded blades were amazing, and I made sure to bounce back and forth between new blades of the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor.  </li>
            <li>Paired with pre-shaving oil and the shaving gel, it&#x27;s a pretty clean shave.</li>
            <li>This was to be expected, but a bit more impressive as I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days, as I&#x27;d previously noted.</li>
            <li>Great razor, gives a very close shave and there was not very much irritation.</li>
            <li>At first I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but after first try I quickly changed my mind.  </li>
            <li>The fusion proglide razor was easy to use with the cool new pivot head leaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, nice idea and pretty design but not any better than other razors on the market.</li>
            <li>I put in the new HQ8 replacement blades since the original HQ177 blades are no longer available.  </li>
            <li>While using the safety razor took a little more time, I was enjoying the process and felt comfortable with the savings I had found.</li>

            <li>: I am trying this product free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>If it were not for the very close shave and smooth skin after shaving I would not be as generous with my stars.  </li>

            <li>It is amazing what all you can get used to when it becomes part of your daily routine.  </li>
            <li>*Received product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>

            <li>I am trying the product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>I am a Bzzagent and tried this product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette and Bzz Agent, I was given one of these for free to try.</li>
            <li>I am a BzzAgent and was offered to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>After getting my Fusion ProGlide Razor from Gillette, for free thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent&#x27;s partnership, I have not stopped using it.</li>
            <li>It gives you a really close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this razor as much as I do any Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>I got to try it free thanks to BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave gel that goes with this razor is pretty sweet as well.</li>
            <li>I can say now that it isn&#x27;t useful for me.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li>I received this razor and a can of alpine fresh shave gel free thanks to a promotion from Gillette and Amazon.</li>
            <li>razor is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The Proglide handle feels great in my hand and has a nice weight to it, not too heavy but enough</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice if you have to rush through a shave to know that a once over will be enough.</li>
            <li>As a point of comparison I did switch between my old razor, and this was notably faster and</li>
            <li>Its worth the money and the experience</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice start in the fusion line but not something that I would switch to from my regular fusion razor.</li>
            <li>By doing it this way I take most of the larger part of the job, and I finish the job with this highly competent newer version of a very reliable method of shaving.</li>
            <li>It still wasn&#x27;t worth the time an effort to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Now after trying I can tell that it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent for this razor and it&#x27;s replacement blades.</li>
            <li>I must say, Gillette is never a disappointment.</li>
            <li>The razor itself gets close enough to leave me shadow free through most of the day.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced.</li>
            <li>It does a MUCH better job than an electric razor ever could, but because of the multiple blades it does it much more quickly than a disposable razor or an older single-blade razor could ever do.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out, this upgrade is worth the buzz - but not just because of the &#x27;Flexball&#x27; business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>applied a healthy amount of Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Skin gel to my beard.</li>
            <li>same smooth results but more comfort because of the flex ball.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the ProGlide works per what it is supposed to do, and if you are a cartridge razor user, it is definitely worth giving a shot.  </li>
            <li>Way better than my old MACH 3.</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised about how different and great this razor is.  </li>
            <li>Gillette was kind enough to send me this as a promotion.</li>
            <li>and I love the results so far.</li>
            <li>The way that the razor conformed to my face made this one of the most comfortable shaves ever, not to mention each subsequent shave.</li>
            <li>I received the product complimentary to try from Gillette.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money to buy.  </li>
            <li>Gillette says that this razor has the thinnest blades they have ever used, and that FlexBall technology is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I had three days worth of stubble</li>
            <li>I kept waiting for the newness and cool factor of the flex ball to wear off, and three weeks in, for the first time since I can remember, I don&#x27;t look at shaving as a chore.</li>
            <li>, I LOVE the Proglide--but don&#x27;t see that the Flexball Handle works really any better than the regular model.</li>
            <li>As far as the flexball goes, for me it was okay.</li>
            <li>liked the tingling, cooling, fresh feeling left by the Gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>ProGlide Razor was fun to use and flowed with every bump and turn on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this product for free thanks to Gillette, and since I&#x27;ve started using it, I have gotten the best shave I have had in a long, long time.</li>
            <li>However, I received a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall in the mail to try from Fusion and so far, this is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lo and behold, I received a Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball Technology as part of a promotion from Gillette and I thought that it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I was not afraid of hurting my face.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the five blades provided a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>I am more of an old school razor type person.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more of cartridge refills and will hold on to the Fusion ProGlide as my primary razor.</li>
            <li>This will be the last razor I ever own</li>
            <li>Gillette was kind enough to include me in a promotion where I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor.  </li>
            <li>The flex ball is useful since I shave my face and and my head.  </li>
            <li>The blades are what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Gillette - high quality and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>One swipe of the blades gives a very good cut resulting in me being able to get a smooth shave in a lot less time than with previous razors.</li>
            <li>For me personally, this comes in handy, because being right handed</li>
            <li>I did figure out pretty quick how to hold it to disable the swivel feature though</li>
            <li>This particular razor was sent to me for free to try for my Gillette BzzAgent Campaign &amp; I must say, it is worth every penny that you pay in stores or online.</li>
            <li>I got a clean shave with minimal razor burn, which honestly, could have been avoided if I had a shorter beard.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, I have to go over areas multiple times to clean it up even if it&#x27;s just stubble.</li>
            <li>The reason why the shave is so good is that the blades are placed closer together than other razor blade</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide products for a while now (3 in 1 ProGlide Styler, the Original ProGlide Manual and ProGlide Power Razor) and just got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide FlexBall Manual razor as a promotional item and really like it.    </li>
            <li>I think that the idea of this type of razor was a good one, maybe it worked for other people.</li>
            <li>i have used all the major brands but Gillette fusion proglide razors are by far superior.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be able to try this product free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I love that in the trial pack you get a coupon for refills it helps keep the cost down on such a great product.</li>
            <li>After all, our vacuums have them, right?  </li>
            <li>It follows the contours of my face just right because of the flexball technology.</li>
            <li>Who in their right mind will use this razor and try to shave sideways to make the ball pivot?</li>
            <li>Maybe the blades aren&#x27;t at the right angle?</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>I received a sample razor from Gillette and figured I&#x27;d put it to the test right away.</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s even a &amp;#34;subscription plan&amp;#34; that delivers blade refills right to your doorstep (via &amp;#34;dollarshaveclub.com&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic shave this new razor with the FlexBall is!  </li>
            <li>Sure, the Proglide Razors may be slightly higher in price than other razors, but they are worth the price as you get so much more use per blade.</li>
            <li>I get the same great long-lasting shave and long-lasting razor blade with the new flex ball technology which I thought might just be a gimmick but turns out it really does help with the contours of my face.</li>
            <li>Overall I’m very satisfied, I can now shave in a straight line and get every hair.</li>
            <li>I tried Fusion in the past and I honestly thought it was too many blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it provides a decent and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I really like the Gillette razors as they give a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>I got everything I&#x27;ve come to expect from a Gillette razor - baby smooth shave, no cuts, no snagging or discomfort, and fairly decent life of the blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an older power razor but got the chance to use this one for free through Buzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to maneuver against the facial contours.</li>
            <li>I sometimes have a tough beard, and this razor glided through easily with great results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve banned by husband from touching it for no other reason</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of razors marketed towards men, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the fact that men are usually offered a million more blades than we ladies are.</li>
            <li>In my case, I do not have the requirement to let a beard grow because I start to develop a serious rash, so I must keep a very smooth shaved surface and apply and after shave touch of aveeno, which I discovered is the best for dry skin and vanishes any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Enter</li>
            <li>I had only a wonderful clean shave, rather than small cuts or missed spots.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette I got to try their new Proglide Razor with Flexball Technology for free!  </li>
            <li>The flexibility of the razor and 5 blades really gets the job done right!</li>
            <li>The shave was incredibly close, and somehow my old razor just felt to be of less quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It clogged up pretty quickly and needed to be rinsed out a lot if I didn&#x27;t trim up first.  </li>
            <li>The razor is simple, elegant, modern, and rolls across your skin like a glove (not my best analogy but you get what I mean)  </li>
            <li>it left me with a nice close shave and smooth soft skin.</li>
            <li>(For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have yet to test them further, as shaving with the ProGlide is not as exciting as the great shaves that one can get with double edge safety razors.  </li>
            <li>I received a Gillete Fusion Proglide Razor to try out for free thanks to Gillette, for many years I have used electric razors and have been looking to maybe switch back to manuel razor.  </li>
            <li>The first time that I used this razor I have about 4 days worth of stubble</li>
            <li>Yeah i didnt think that this blade would be so efective since all razor are all electric specialized for sentive skin like the ones of gillete that tried that past , but i see that i dont need all that technology for a great shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice now and even though I got a great shave both times I&#x27;m not sold yet on the usefullness of the Flexball, maybe after a few more shaves</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the gillette fusion razor for a long time and this one is really nice w/the pivot head.</li>
            <li>I normally use an electric razor and beard trimmer but needed to do a rare clean shave</li>
            <li>nice subtle sent refreshing highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I tried this new razor free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>enjoy using the new Pro Glide 2-in-1 Gel.</li>
            <li>The most amazing thing to me is how cheap these razors are, there is no excuse to be buying the little disposables.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly everyday after that it seemed to get better and better.</li>
            <li>Received this as a trial from Gillette, so far I have only good things about this product.</li>
            <li>first used the razor with about 1 day&#x27;s worth of growth, and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Quick and very serviceable close shave in record time.</li>
            <li>my skin now feels very soft and smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I am usually an electric kind of guy, I use the Fusion for special occasions when I need a really close shave--usually I can get by fine with my rotary electric, but I&#x27;ll admit it:</li>
            <li>The blades cut very close and the 2-in-1 Gel which is marked for sensitive skin, made it very comfortable, so comfortable in fact that I didn&#x27;t even have to moisturize my face afterwards.</li>
            <li>and it is still very sharp and is shaving as good as the first day although the moisturizing strip has worn quite a bit</li>
            <li>My face was smooth, minus the hair I purposely left in place, and the precision razor on the backside helped shape that up nicely!</li>
            <li>And while my previous critcism still holds true, I am loving the results this razor produces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is very comfortable and feels solid in your hands.</li>
            <li>It provides very precise and very lasting shave.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth to use especially when combined with the Gillette fusion gel.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t feel that it moved very much while shaving.</li>
            <li>I found that I had a very smooth shave after only one pass.  </li>
            <li>I would use this razor if I shaved more frequently because it is good for very short facial hair.</li>
            <li>Also, given that I already own a Gillette Fusion razor, I do not feel it is worth upgrading to the new ProGlide razor as I found they both produced just about the same shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Since the Mach 3, meaning every blade after that generation, they have all been so good that little can be said about the differences between them.  </li>
            <li>I was definitely not disappointed once I tried it and now consider it my new go-to razor.</li>
            <li>As usual, a new razor has a new technological advance that is promoted as the best thing since sliced bread.  </li>
            <li>It was a painless shave with no sting caused by a hair being pulled but not cut by the blade, and it left my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Since it got more stubble per pass, I made less passes and was done very quickly but still with a quality shave.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quick and easy shave, definitely go for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 5 bladed face with a 6th detailing blade design is really nice, and cleanly removes the harsh stubble off my face without giving me razor burn or leaving scruffy patches.  </li>
            <li>After seeing the reviews of this ProGlide, and those cool in-store motorized displays, I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Its flexball technology works great on the curvy areas of my face getting a close shave in all the hard to reach areas of my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the older Fusion blade for a long time now and have been happy with it, so naturally I was interested in any improvements.</li>
            <li>So I just received my Gillette ProGlide and shaving cream yesterday as a bzzagent client, to try out and review, and got my first chance to use it today.</li>
            <li>First of all, the razor.  </li>
            <li>But, I am willing to overlook this for the sake of the review.  </li>
            <li>Probably could have trimmed it first.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was in applying the gel.</li>
            <li>This most likely will make a difference in the razor</li>
            <li>if nothing more than simply the window on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It has two pivots (most disposable razors only have one, if at all)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved several more times with the ProGlide and can tell the razor blades dulling after about 3 shaves.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I won&#x27;t be going back to the Excel.  </li>
            <li>I still use the Styler for trimming, but the Flexball is my regular razor now and just works better.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li>First thing that caught my attention with this razor was the packaging.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed after my first &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; with the razor was the feeling of the &amp;#34;thinnest and finest&amp;#34; blades.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Gillette!</li>
            <li>This morning was the first time using this razor</li>
            <li>The first time i used it, it glided over my face like there was nothing there.</li>
            <li>First, I took the product out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>After 7 years of not shaving, I finally decided to get rid of my beard, and what better way than with a Gillette product.</li>
            <li>I feel like I actually got a much better and closer shave as compared to my electric razor.  </li>
            <li>More on this later.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I drew the blades across my face I knew that it was going to be a winner.  </li>
            <li>In fairness though, I didn&#x27;t have to pay for my first one.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean out and lasts for a long time without having to change blades.</li>
            <li>but I really like the feeling I have after shaving with this razor!</li>
            <li>It feels like you have more control, and I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;d be any different on a man&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure next time</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s remarkably better than the regular fusion.  </li>
            <li>I get to use the same blades for about 10 uses with no problem, sometimes a day or two more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for two weeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks BzzAgent and Gillette!</li>
            <li>It does a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li>The refills are pretty costly too.</li>
            <li>It worked well and my skin felt soft and smooth after my shave.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball technology does exactly what it states it would.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, to address the first concern, no, you will not have to throw out your Gillette Fusion five-bladed razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Essentially, the key point here is that it swivels more.</li>
            <li>The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging.</li>
            <li>I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften.</li>
            <li>The second is my grandfather&#x27;s razor, a Superspeed  II from the 1940&#x27;s that does a great job, albeit a lot more slowly than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Also, the handle is smaller and heavier and is not a plastic tube like the Schick which feels better and sturdier.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li>did drop the thing and the head popped off, but with a bit of work it went back together and remains to this day, my favorite razor ever.</li>
            <li>I only shave 1-2 times a week, and some of my blades I use well over a year as I&#x27;m just that cheap!  </li>
            <li>(If I&#x27;d known they were the same, I would have surely kept one for mom&#x27;s shower!)&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go back to spending more time cleaning the cartridge than I did</li>
            <li>First, let&#x27;s talk the unboxing.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have to LOOK pretty...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been my personal finding that men&#x27;s razors work on my leg&#x27;s better than womens.  </li>
            <li>However, from the first stroke, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t anticipate it lasting more than 1.5-2 months.</li>
            <li>Overall I was pleased with the shave that I got with this razor.  </li>
            <li>and thats only because I cant give more.</li>
            <li>The Flexball Technology didn&#x27;t do much for me but the shave I got still makes it worth it for me.</li>
            <li>you only need one pass with the grain, and one against, and you&#x27;ll feel confident that you got it all.  </li>
            <li>The rollerball technology on this razor makes shaving so much easier!  </li>
            <li>I love how you only have to change the cartridge once a month!</li>
            <li>He says he tried it for the first time after 2 days without shaving.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first how this is would work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for years and have tried out many different cartridge style razors that they offer.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when using the razor was the weight and feel of the handle.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine how it might better for that.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and smooth with every shave.</li>
            <li>I finally settled on Gillette products a few years ago and this razor is just the latest improvement  in an already good product line.</li>
            <li>The first time that I used the Flexball out of the box, my shave was so effortless that I was in awe.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li>I used it on both my head and face and it works much better than a traditional style razor.</li>
            <li>My first impression of the razor was quality, it was made of metal and had been polished.</li>
            <li>The simple fact is; it is better than the competition.</li>
            <li>i really like the 2 in 1 gel!</li>
            <li>My second shave went much better.</li>
            <li>The razor has two pivots (most disposable razors only have one, if anyl)</li>
            <li>When I first unpackaged the razor</li>
            <li>I received this razor along with the Gillette Sensitive Skin Ocean Breeze shave gel as a promotional offer to try the product for free</li>
            <li>I have to pull out my one-blade razor to get around these areas first before using this shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette razors forever, and I&#x27;ve been using the Fusion for a bit now, and I&#x27;m a fan of the most recent upgrade.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more replacement razors for this one.</li>
            <li>After receiving this product to try from BzzAgent, I&#x27;m overall extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Overall though, this razor is fantastic and I look forward to continuing to use it!</li>
            <li>this going to be better than what I currently have&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another great feature is that you do not have to change razors that often as it is long lasting.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t seem to shave the exact places I wanted to, like on the side and below my chin.</li>
            <li>This razor has my face feeling smooth and soft with no razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an okay razor.</li>
            <li>I do not feel that the flex ball lives up to any hype that Gillette has try to craft, because it may move more than a traditional razor</li>
            <li>the Flex Ball also gets around my chin close the first time and every time with no worries about cuts.  </li>
            <li>The first few uses were good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally got my son to try it, you can witness his first &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; on youtube at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t leave the dreaded leaking shaving cream behind!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors for years, but now that I&#x27;ve tried this, I doubt I&#x27;ll be able to go back.  </li>
            <li>With five blades packed up top in the cartridge, you&#x27;ve gotta have a solid grip on things.</li>
            <li>I had changed to higher end shaving creams and a beaver brush over some time ago</li>
            <li>When I first seen this razor</li>
            <li>Great, long lasting razor.</li>
            <li>I have to shave everyday for being in the army so having a good razor</li>
            <li>Regarding the razor, I found it very good and similar to my previous Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not entirely certain to be honest.</li>
            <li>I have always used Gillette manual razors and have never found a new model to be any better than the old ones.....</li>
            <li>The one thing that I would say that sets it apart from my current razor is the amount of times I need to shave over a certain area for it to feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was lucky enough to get a free sample from Gilette via BZZAGENT and if it wasnt because I already use Gillette&#x27;s brand I would throw ANY razor out the window and use this one 5&amp;#34;stars</li>
            <li>However i was lucky enough to get to try it for free as part of a promotion through BZZAGENT</li>
            <li>The multiple sharp blades give a smooth and close shave and the strip on the razor acts as a good indicator of the life of the razor.  </li>
            <li>If you think that statement is true, you must be using the new Fusion ProGlide men&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li>The flexball worked really well with the shape of my face and when I thought I needed to pick up the razor and change direction, I didn&#x27;t have to, because the flexball moved it in the right direction for</li>
            <li>you think “Right is he really telling the truth”.  </li>
            <li>it comes out at a pretty high pressure and really sprays a nice solid stream into my hand.</li>
            <li>However, if I were to use a cartridge razor as my primary, everyday razor, I would definitely use the Gillette Brand of razor as there are many options to choose from and you are able to get a pretty close shave in using them.  </li>
            <li>When using this product with Gillette&#x27;s ProFusion Gel for Sensitive skin, my skin is left feeling so smooth and soft, and smelling nice as well.</li>
            <li>I am able to get a fairly close shave with this razor after several passes, in various directions, over my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>But after the first shave with this razor, I&#x27;m positively making the switch.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even notice the little blade on the back for precision trims until the second time I used it, but it was very effective and came in handy for getting edges.  </li>
            <li>The flexball technology is amazing, and gets every hair with absolutely no nicks!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve read any of my other reviews; then you know I always give my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>When I first recieved the blade, I honestly thought is was just going to be a regular old blade and is going to suck.</li>
            <li>I did not see anything overly spectacular about it versus other Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li>Sure, we understand Gillette wants to make money with cartridge sales, but they used to make stellar safety razors that are treasured in families and last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>It has a chilling tingle that makes the shaving experience much more enjoyable—the best part is that it lingers after rinsing off the gel providing comfort and moisture long after the shave is done.  </li>
            <li>It really does provide a very smooth shave, remaining in constant contact with the skin over subtle curves and provides a great shave.</li>
            <li>which I LOVE feels very high end and solid in your hand.  </li>
            <li>so my beard was good and tough with three days worth of stubble and the blade performed very well giving me a close clean shave.</li>
            <li>Men&#x27;s, more importantly, give a much closer and less damaging shave to the bikini area.</li>
            <li>I have stubble much faster afterwards, and it leaves my skin bumpy and kind of rough afterwards, I can see some of the hairs just at the level of skin if I look close.  </li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide  Flexball razor in the mail from Gillette and wow, it really was a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li>convenience the electric razor wins when you don’t need a particularly close shave</li>
            <li>Others who have a much friendlier set of facial hair will find this product enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I received this Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor as a promotion for my true review,  Overall not bad.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to get a nick and cut free shave for one of the few times ever.  </li>
            <li>The ProGlide&#x27;s five super-thin blades provided a clean, smooth, and comfortable shave with very little friction and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t bother my skin very much and the Flexball razor really did get around all the angles without nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>As for the Flexball part, I dont really know if it adds very much value.</li>
            <li>The gel lubricates tremendously and the the shave you get get from the razor rivals a professional shave from a barbershop!</li>
            <li>The bottle is very cool because it has an indicator to tell you how much is left in the can.</li>
            <li>This is a simple, but great addition that I wish that other manufacturers to pick up on.</li>
            <li>With the higher pressure, I hadn&#x27;t realized just how much I had expelled, so after applying to my face I had quite a bit of leftover.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Gillette Fusion razor for a long time and didn&#x27;t think this would be better.  </li>
            <li>Great Razor, I&#x27;ve used dozens of different models both Gillette and other brands</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty much sold on this item.</li>
            <li>handle is solidly built too, it is not some cheap plastic, but rather, this handle is bound to last many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited about trying Gillette&#x27;s latest blade and handle, just to see what I was missing.  </li>
            <li>First of all it the Flexball Technology seems to work, it really moves around my jaw line a lot smoother.  </li>
            <li>It dose glide over surfaces very well, all in all this razor does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>The ProGlide shave gel also offers a cool sensation while shaving.</li>
            <li>The way the 5 blade head runs down your face makes the shave so smooth and comfortable not to mention it get a majority on the first pass.</li>
            <li>The quality difference between cheaper and more expensive certainly is noticed and undeniably Gillette has an edge in quality, but the type of shaving cream/gel used seems to be the most important factor for me.</li>
            <li>It caught so many more of the hairs on the contours of my neck especially that other razors could not catch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As expected, the gel felt cool and smooth going on.</li>
            <li>The contours of my face such as chin and jawline, were easy to handle with this razor.  </li>
            <li>the moisture strip provides enough movement to allow the razor to easily pivot around my face.  </li>
            <li>I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it he says it&#x27;s a really nice razor that doesn&#x27;t have the typical pull he feels with the cheaper razors.</li>
            <li>This was expected since the first shave demanded much more effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue to try to get this razor into the rotation, but it will take a lot more practice before I feel comfortable with this one compared to the Mach 3 I usually use.</li>
            <li>At the same time the FlexBall technology allows for easy maneuvering around the curves.</li>
            <li>The rubber grips make it easy to maneuver the razor in different angles</li>
            <li>Not the case with this razor, I am on my 3rd shave and it is just as smooth as can be with no pulling or razor burn on my neck which some razors will do on the first use.  </li>
            <li>One word, smart.</li>
            <li>The added bonus of the Flexball is pure genius.</li>
            <li>But you don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to shave because the less you use, the better your shave will be since just a little will give you a good lather.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how quick the shave was, and I didn&#x27;t really need any cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised how quick the shave was, and I didn&#x27;t really need to go over any missed areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Gel smells good and has a nice texture, but is too thick and needs to be watered down a bit.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very smoothly, but not very close.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used single &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; shaving blade on the top around my nose, didn&#x27;t get cut, and my shave looks really</li>
            <li>It reminds of the ball feature in most new vacuum cleaners today that enhance maneuverability.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, if I got it at a decent price, I&#x27;d be interested in continuing to use this razor and its blades.</li>
            <li>Does a pretty decent job.</li>
            <li>multiple times made it an incredibly quick shave as well!</li>
            <li>I had very high expectations on the razor but also with the gel.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>the razor is great and cuts better than the disposable ones but at the same time it seems to me that these razors dont last as long which they should last longer considering how much they cost</li>
            <li>I was so impressed how it easily adjusts and glides over my jawline, chin and neck gently with low cutting blades</li>
            <li>razor makes quick work of facial hair, and floats seamlessly across my face as I shave, leaving a very close and smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave with little to no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp but gentle, as usual, and always give me a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It makes shaving a little bit enjoyable, but it&#x27;s still shaving and shaving isn&#x27;t fun at all.</li>
            <li>Its also good under my nose in that hard to reach area.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say that problem is completely gone, but with this new fusion blade, I have to admit that the irritation is significantly less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gently glides around on a pivot and makes going over my chin and neck much easier, and on short hair it shaves cleanly the first time around.</li>
            <li>The single blade on the reverse side is perfectly angled to get a sharp line on my Goatee, when I have one, and gets all the hair around my ears, whereas before I would need a separate straight razor for the area above my</li>
            <li>This thing is the only one I am going to use from now on, trying the product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>The shave is close and accurate and the ball actually does work.  </li>
            <li>Prior to this, my everyday razor was a refillable competitive brand razor, which I thought did a great job - that is, up until I received this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The design of the bottle is very sleek.</li>
            <li>As I began to shave, I was trying to make note of the swivel head, to see if it was really doing anything as I shaved.</li>
            <li>One simple light pass</li>
            <li>so not only does it glide well on smooth surfaces, it also pivots from side to side</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lately, I&#x27;d started learning how to use a straight edge because disposable razors just don&#x27;t give you that close of a shave.</li>
            <li>It takes longer with a straight edge, but my wife loves the result.</li>
            <li>and there where it was absolute smoothness in the beginning</li>
            <li>I really like Gillette Fusion products, they give me a very close shave and the blades</li>
            <li>I was actually using it for a while before I got the free one, but I have to say,</li>
            <li>The blades from all Fusion razors will fit and work, though Gillette markets different models for power and non-power models.</li>
            <li>This begs the question: Why are you pulling your razor with so much straight line force?</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I got this product free as part of a promotion from Gillette and they&#x27;ve definitely made a permanent customer out of me!</li>
            <li>The razor has 5 blades which give a much closer shave than the 3 blade razor i&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>But this is the real life</li>
            <li>I really do recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would it bend too much?</li>
            <li>It didn’t flex too much.</li>
            <li>As someone with thick, coarse hair, a comfortable shave is the most important aspect of my experience.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really look at what&#x27;s going on with razors, but the Fusion ProGlide caught my eye because of the flexball.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li>It really did not matter as to the length of my beard.  </li>
            <li>I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and wasn&#x27;t expecting much, really; I&#x27;ve already been using the fusion razor.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>I recently got this for free from Gilette and I was not optimistic.</li>
            <li>It really hugs the curves of your face</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This razor is very durable, as I have dropped it on the ground a couple times, and everything stays in place, including the razor head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of a hefty razor, and I thoroughly enjoy the weight of this one in my hand.</li>
            <li>I would say that the head really did contour for maximum contact.</li>
            <li>like it so much I&#x27;ll be buying a blade refill.</li>
            <li>In the end, I much prefer a more simple razor without so many gimmicky features.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and does not give you {much} razor burns.</li>
            <li>This made shaving my head so much easier.</li>
            <li>It was really invigorating.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again to Gillette for sending me</li>
            <li>it really helped it move with my skin from any direction.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this is really a fault of the FlexBall, so much as my inexperience with it.</li>
            <li>I was recently offered the chance to try out for free the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Technology as part of a promotion.  </li>
            <li>the flexibility doesn&#x27;t look very permanent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very hairy guy.</li>
            <li>I actually received this razor free to try as a promotion from gillette.</li>
            <li>The flex ball really does help the blades follow the contour of your face.</li>
            <li>Combined with the blade design this makes the shaving experience really smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is now smooth and I actually look forward to shaving each morning instead of viewing it as a chore.</li>
            <li>This razor gives the closest shave without leaving cuts/nicks from applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I do not notice it contouring to my face much if any.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to be part of a test panel where I was given a sample Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor to test.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think I would like this one nearly as much.</li>
            <li>My face feels just as smooth with this razor as it did while using my prior model.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>but thanks to Gillette I have chance to try it.</li>
            <li>It really takes the thought out of shaving, and allowed me to just trust my my shaver handle.</li>
            <li>I have been using Gillette razors my whole life</li>
            <li>The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale.</li>
            <li>&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it.</li>
            <li>This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a razor on my neck and cheeks just leaving a trace of beard and this was twice as fast as using my Schick.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because of the flex ball which really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The problem is that I can&#x27;t figure out how much it contributes to the shave.  </li>
            <li>This blade is another in a list of blades that do the job very well.  </li>
            <li>razor shaves very close when in a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which doesn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The feature really helps when your soapy hand holds a razor in the shower.</li>
            <li>I really do.  </li>
            <li>This time the shave went much smoother (no pun intended).</li>
            <li>Because it costs me $5 for 100 disposable razor blades for my $10 straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>Because it costs me $5 for 100 disposable razor blades for my $10 straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very please with the smoothness of this razor...</li>
            <li>Even when using the manual razor, it would still take several strokes to get all of the hair for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The razor has 5 blades which give a much closer shave than the 3 blade razor i&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this razor in the store because I&#x27;m THAT much of a stickler.</li>
            <li>this cleaned out so much</li>
            <li>easier!&lt;br /&gt;Can be used really well for body hair as well.</li>
            <li>I know this because I had to shave my chest (very hairy chest) for a tattoo I was getting.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t help nor hinder.</li>
            <li>I really like the FlexBall that&#x27;s been added</li>
            <li>I recently received a Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology along with the shave gel to test for free from Gillette through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>The Proglide seemed to be much smoother.</li>
            <li>I found the contouring feature of the product to be very beneficial when attempting the jaw-line.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave without having to put out much effort and risk cuts.</li>
            <li>He is not a real hairy faced guy and he thought this was a turbo charged version of a razor and just too many blades for him.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend signed me up for Bzzagent and thanks to their company and Gillette</li>
            <li>1 nick or razor burn area then to give a real test I waited a couple days and used the Gillette proglide gel with it</li>
            <li>Thanks buzz agent and thank you Gillette</li>
            <li>I do however really like</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li>It makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li>my hair grows fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this product - it gives me the closest shave I ever had.</li>
            <li>so not only does it glide well on smooth surfaces, it also pivots from side to side</li>
            <li>, it really gives me confidence during my shave.</li>
            <li>The flex-ball allows the blades to really hug your skin.</li>
            <li>I have to drag a razor across my face the better.  </li>
            <li>They work very well for me.</li>
            <li>The handle is also comfortable for my larger hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks BzzAgent for this opportunity.</li>
            <li>The head moves horizontally along with the strokes, which can really help when shaving my neck.  </li>
            <li>As a BZZAgent reviewer, I recently received a free sample of a Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology, and gave it a whirl.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>You get a much closer shave</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s part of my morning routine thanks to this razor.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette and Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li>but it does really add to the shaving comfort.</li>
            <li>it worked smoothly, did not irritate my skin, and I finally had a close shave.  </li>
            <li>it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really have a need for that</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>skin feels much so much smoother and improved.</li>
            <li>The pivot of the ball really does force the razor to contour to every angle of your face and head.</li>
            <li>Being a bearded gentleman, I really don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on some fancy razor.  </li>
            <li>Something else that I noticed is that I didn&#x27;t need to apply as much pressure to get just as close of a shave up there.  </li>
            <li>But if you are looking for something to shave the entire head area, I have yet to find a razor as comfortable and productive as this one.e blade, but either way, I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for something to shave the entire head area, I have yet to find a razor as comfortable and productive as this one.</li>
            <li>Overall a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I did side by side tests and though the razor performs very well, it just doesn&#x27;t beat my mach 3.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been much of a razor user in some time (just the electric)</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this opportunity.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think the blade pivoting 4 ways would do much for me.</li>
            <li>The flex ball really just seems like a novelty to me that doesn&#x27;t appear to make any difference while shaving.</li>
            <li>my wife has been using this razor as well and really doesn&#x27;t see much of a difference (or any) either.</li>
            <li>But I recently received a Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology to test for free from Gillette through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t grow a real immaculate or rugged beard.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Any extra gel is easy to clean off by twisting the cap to the locked position and back.</li>
            <li>It left my face and neck smooth and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>The Flexball razor that goes along with it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if I would want to replace the whole razor all the time</li>
            <li>Very close shave by it</li>
            <li>It does provide a very close shave and contours to your face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in quality of shave.</li>
            <li>this is where this product really shines.  </li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t 100% say it was do to the Flexball</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m docking it a star because I really miss the vibrating handle</li>
            <li>But I am optimistic enough with the ProGlide experience that I will try shaving more frequently.  </li>
            <li>Since she was currently using a Schick, and Gillette was kind enough to send me a trial kit</li>
            <li>So after shaving a few times with this razor I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>Gillette is GILLETTE what more can you say about a product you&#x27;ve been using your entire adult life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a shave with my old razors that left my face this virtually irritation free!</li>
            <li>I like how soft my skin feels immediately after shaving (that&#x27;s most likely</li>
            <li>First i felt that the Flexball was kind of pointless feature</li>
            <li>I didn’t think smaller blades would be as effective, but it actually helps decrease pull &amp; tug.  </li>
            <li>so it is worth it to spend the few extra bucks for a good shave.  </li>
            <li>The first couple shaves were actually really good, but if you have thicker facial hair, like myself, then you will start to notice that the blades start to dull rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly not your cheap, plastic disposable razor handle!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to try a new razor since my face is very jagged</li>
            <li>but since I have used it OH WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>was surprised at how the majority of the hairs fell right out of the cartridge without much of a fuss.</li>
            <li>Other key features are how comfortable the handle fits in the hand, even for various hand positions - I use this as a body razor and have no problem getting a good hold on it.</li>
            <li>, let me be clear: I still LOVE the Proglide, and firmly believe that if I have the choice of using the Gillette versus pretty much every model of personal shaver available, I&#x27;ll go with the Gillette pretty much every time (unless of course I cannot afford one, in which case I have 3 different and much cheaper models which I believe work easily 98% as good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First day using the new razor.</li>
            <li>I was pretty pumped about trying the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with the flexball handle.  </li>
            <li>The new Flexball handle seems to fit existing Fusion blades, so you can use your old stash of blades with this new handle.</li>
            <li>My first shave with the new blades required just one pass over each area of my face and</li>
            <li>I noticed I didn&#x27;t really change hand positions much, I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same areas multiple times, mostly I was just able to do long strokes from my neck all the way up my face...</li>
            <li>I noticed I didn&#x27;t really change hand positions much, I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same areas multiple times, mostly I was just able to do long strokes from my neck all the way up my face...</li>
            <li>As far as the Fusion line of razors go it fits right in.</li>
            <li>They were amazed at how smooth it had left my skin and by the end of the day they left curious and interested in getting their own.</li>
            <li>Though I do love the blades and would recommend to anyone I will not be purchasing any refills due to the high cost of these blades!</li>
            <li>My other knock isn&#x27;t really a dislike, but more of a preference.</li>
            <li>The gel dispenser stays clean and has a gauge on the side of it that lets you know how much you have left.</li>
            <li>The flex ball allows for a smooth and seamless transition across your jawline and makes it easy to get in those tight areas around the ears etc.  </li>
            <li>This is a completely new and better shave over the dollar store, single blade razors I have been using before I got the battery powered unit and now this manual unit.</li>
            <li>The shave was smooth and clean, and took less passes than my normal razor.  </li>
            <li>Other persons who apply more pressure when they shave may find the FlexBall</li>
            <li>Is the razor better than any other?</li>
            <li>and it does not irritate my face like most other razors.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about trying this product not only for my face but my head as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor, I have used it 7 times and the blades seem to still be sharp, I like</li>
            <li>But he was so excited, talking about how the quality was supposed to be, so I decided I wouldn&#x27;t take it back</li>
            <li>The shave is close, safe, and lasts longer than any other product on the market.  </li>
            <li>The price of replacements is a little daunting but given the way it performs its necessary to get the best shave possible without seeing a professional!</li>
            <li>I assumed it was like any other razor, and that I would not be able to feel the FlexBall Technology.</li>
            <li>I personally do not notice a significant difference with the flexball technology</li>
            <li>Better than other razor out there.</li>
            <li>With my other razors I would even consider more than 4 shaves before changing the blade.(coarse</li>
            <li>It has more nooks and crannies then other blades</li>
            <li>Not any more close of a shave than the other razors I use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for years, especially the original Fusion.</li>
            <li>I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide w/Flex ball from BzzAgent &amp; Gillette and let me say that I have always used Gillette&#x27;s for as long as I can remember and before this free sample I had the last Gillette Fusion Powerglide</li>
            <li>By the time I finished shaving, the wear strip was nearly completely worn down, which is a huge bummer considering the cartridges aren&#x27;t exactly cheap.</li>
            <li>BTW, I love the Active Sport scent and cooling sensation...</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a long winter and growing a full beard throughout, I was not looking forward to my first shave of the spring.</li>
            <li>Normally, because of a &amp;#34;cowlick&amp;#34; quality to my beard, I have to come at it from four different directions to achieve a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The razor definitely provided a clean and easier shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same areas to get a clean shave</li>
            <li>Being a safety razor user, I was skeptical of the ProGlide and at first thought it was a great marketing gimmick.</li>
            <li>Clean shave continue after multiple uses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The gel and the razor left me with a clean close shave.</li>
            <li>I normally use a double edge safety razor and shave using shave soap and brush but received this item for free to review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a short while now and have to say that I get really clean, close shaves.</li>
            <li>Razor burn hasn&#x27;t really ever been an issue for me, but I&#x27;m sure this would cut down on that too.</li>
            <li>and the single cartridge is still going strong -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any guy who wants a closer shave without the hassle.</li>
            <li>The shave itself seemed fine, for an average man&#x27;s beard, but no better than a good disposable blade, in his opinion.</li>
            <li>I bring this up because this has been a huge pain point for me with other blades getting clogged quickly, always right in the middle of the length of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts my shaving time about in half because it takes so many fewer &amp;#34;swipes&amp;#34; to get my whole face done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this razor previously and it is my absolute favorite razor of all time.</li>
            <li>I would easily recommend it to those looking to step their shaving game up to the top tier.</li>
            <li>I tried it first as a true test dry shaving not</li>
            <li>felt that it was more power than he needed to do what his other razor normally does for him.  </li>
            <li>So after recieving my free sample Gillette Fusion Pro-glide razor with the flexball, I had relatively long stubble to be removed.</li>
            <li>The razors seem to last a longer time than my normal disposables so to me that is worth it!</li>
            <li>Love the dark chrome and metal</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I noticed the slick packaging was eye catching.  </li>
            <li>My neck is pretty sensitive when it comes to shaving, but I had no issues here.</li>
            <li>In general the razor met what he&#x27;d read in the advertisements and he felt it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s logical for me to spend nearly $30 on 8 cartridges for the ProGlide if each cartridge lasts me two to three</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s logical for me to spend nearly $30 on 8 cartridges for the ProGlide if each cartridge lasts me two to three</li>
            <li>I have used other Gillette razors in the past and have had pretty good success with them.  </li>
            <li>but when I do the skin on my neck is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have used the Fusion for years, and Gillette has made a believer out of a most skeptical critic, as I was sure the product couldn&#x27;t be that much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>When I got this campaign on buzz agent I couldn&#x27;t wait to catch it in the mail, simply a dream come true.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After trying this I am confident I can go back to a razor or at least be able to use it once in awhile.</li>
            <li>I found cleanup of the blades went quickly and easily under the faucet, but I’m not sure if this was a result of the blade, or the gel.  </li>
            <li>but I still would go out and buyone if you need a new razor!</li>
            <li>The benefits I have seen are that the handle of the new Flexball model seems a bit more comfortable, the razor seems to last a little longer (I shave 3-4 times a week</li>
            <li>I normally use a single blade safety razor old school style well not any more</li>
            <li>It feels very smooth and doesn&#x27;t catch on my thick hair when I first start shaving which most other razors do.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t go wrong with a Gillette Fusion for their great shave, sharp (pun intended) looking product and willingness to build a better razor.  </li>
            <li>I think Gillette has a winner again with this new Proglide Flexball razor, very dependable product and company.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from the new Proglide.  </li>
            <li>The Fusion ProGlide Power with the new FlexBall Handle really allows this razor to adjust to the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>and I really like the feel of this new Fusion,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like a slightly heavier feel, perhaps with a bit more metal than plastic.  </li>
            <li>but I got a close, smooth, non cut shave and skin did not feel dry, so</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m probably just not the target user for this particular style of handle / razor.</li>
            <li>Word of advice, don&#x27;t press too hard and let the blades work their magic!  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product as part of a promotion from Bzzz Agent!</li>
            <li>I have both an older version of the ProGlide without the FlexBall and a Schick Hydra.</li>
            <li>Some blades stick with the 1 blade on top for edging system, some gave it up and left the 4-5 regular blades.  </li>
            <li>I have a decent amount of irritation when using this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am already a reluctantly loyal Gillette Fusion user, and the only thing that can keep me from championing the brand is the cost of replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>The main reason to get this is for the Flexball handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and painless and have yet to have a nick (which was constant with my safety razors_.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if the Flexball is more expensive, I cannot endorse paying more.</li>
            <li>so you really have to be diligent keeping it clean and dry after use to get maximum usage from the blade.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying it if you can find replacement cartridges at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive a sample from Gillette and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a close shave with less effort than with my older Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>For a while I decided to stop shaving all together and just go with a scruffy face and beard trimmer because it was far too difficult to get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>I have been using various 5 blade razors and most function about the same.  </li>
            <li>the razor made shaving my neck very easy though, as long as the hair wasn&#x27;t too long it shaved very well.</li>
            <li>By far the nicest razor i&#x27;ve used, such smooth strokes really made my skin feel soft when I finished my shave!</li>
            <li>What I found most fascinating was the innovative design of the container—it’s plastic with a viewing window which means no more rust rings on the counter or running out of shave gel at the wrong moment!  </li>
            <li>Ok so yet another Razor to spend your hard on money on right?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit more expensive than some of the competition, but it&#x27;s a price I&#x27;ll gladly pay to avoid the discomfort that I&#x27;ve experienced from every other razor on the market.</li>
            <li>I received this razor with a single blade to try for free from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>they are well made with formidable materials that are comfy to hold, don&#x27;t slip out of ur hand, the blades are sharp leaving you clean and smooth, and the unique flexball technology adjusts to the uneven contours of ur face for that close shave.</li>
            <li>I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel.</li>
            <li>I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance.</li>
            <li>The razors have tilted backward &amp; forward to follow the contour of your face for literally at least a decade or more, right?</li>

            <li>Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This combination with leave you with a nice close shave with very soft skin without the burn found in the usual razors and creams.</li>
            <li>the razor, I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li>The precision razor on the back is the same as I&#x27;ve experienced with previous Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>Way better than the old razor.&amp;#34;  Now, we don&#x27;t use amazeballs to describe anything other than an 11 on a scale of 1 - 10, so that was quite the compliment.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a slight difference in handling while shaving but not something worth significantly more money depending on how its priced compared to the regular Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a member of BzzAgent and was lucky enough to be part of the group selected to receive a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor, along with their new Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>So the first, and most obvious change in this razor over other razors I&#x27;ve used is the swivel head.</li>
            <li>so this isn&#x27;t a major issue, just an issue for my first time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, I prefer the old-fashioned razor that I shaved with when my beard was little more than peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Blades stay sharp after multiple shaves, so it lasts long, making it a great value.  </li>
            <li>I prefer something with a little more heft in my hand.</li>
            <li>I really do like this razor and keep it as a backup to my main, an old Gillette ball tech.</li>
            <li>so you get a good clean, quality shave, but the real game changer is the flexball.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide with its 5 blades cuts cleanly and smoothly, whether I went with the grain or against (I usually do with first, then against on a second pass--</li>
            <li>It cut right through with ease, but once again, was less smooth and less comfortable than my Fusion</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re ready to get busy with this sleek looking razor.  </li>
            <li>The blades provide a close shave with absolutely no tug or pull in my case for a heavenly comfortable experience.</li>
            <li>, it really is an improvement above the old razors and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I recommend people with sensitive skin or doen&#x27;t like spending much time shaving to use this product.  </li>
            <li>so far, i really like this razor.</li>
            <li>The next think I noticed was the ball that gave the head flexibility while huge didn&#x27;t really seem to add anything to the actual shave experience.</li>
            <li>Expensive but a great shave.</li>
            <li>It was definitely a smooth guide and works very well on my coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li>I put this razor to the test a bit more, as I haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days and so stubble has gotten a bit longer.</li>
            <li>After Shave Balm post shave, I did not feel any burn like I normally do.  </li>
            <li>normally shave once a week, even with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Paired with the ProGlide 2-in-1 shave gel, my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth and soft in a long time.</li>
            <li>The handle feels sturdy and heavy, leading me to feel like it is a better quality product.</li>
            <li>and I have a job to go to, five days a week, like a normal person.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure how well the razor would work at first because I had a thick beard.</li>
            <li>This combination handily wins my contract for future shaving needs!</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t officially switched in a long time because there really haven&#x27;t been any advancements worth abandoning my cartridges.</li>
            <li>First of all, I wanted to say that I received this product a few weeks ago for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>This is exciting for me, as normally my skin gets irritated with multiple passes</li>
            <li>I received one of these from Gillette to review as the normally do.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that will appear over a few uses.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant about that ball, but at the end of the day, it does actually serve a useful function.  </li>
            <li>&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard.</li>
            <li>Ribbed handles are not common in women&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li>My face feels alot smoother than normal too since when the blade contours it literally doesnt miss hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had ingrown hair trouble much more since I&#x27;ve started using this razor.  </li>
            <li>This is actually worth spending the extra for the newer model.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Mach 3, so I am used to a &amp;#34;straighter&amp;#34; razor when I shave.  </li>
            <li>Second time I used the razor, I had about 4 day&#x27;s worth of growth.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t expect more than another few shaves out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  normally get caught up on my chin</li>
            <li>To begin with, my baseline for comparison was what I normally used, a schick hydro 5.</li>
            <li>I normally use a Mach 3 or an electric razor.</li>
            <li>The blades glide easily and so far I haven&#x27;t had a single cut!</li>
            <li>but my face is not that contoured so that was not a hard feat.</li>
            <li>New feature is the angle-bending action so that the blade can now both tilt AND swivel, if you pull it in s straight line and apply a lot of force.</li>
            <li>I find that a shave with a straight razor is the closest I can get to a baby&#x27;s-bottom soft face without growing a new layer of skin.</li>
            <li>back feature of the Hydro 5 which would make for easy cleaning/drying of the razor, the key to longevity.  </li>
            <li>It contours to your face making one stoke shaving easy, and it gets all those hairs you usually miss the first time around.  </li>
            <li>The handle makes it very easy to hold and glide over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: An enlarged Lubristrip lubricates skin, allowing for a smoother shave, however, sometimes I felt it left a little too much residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried using single, double, triple, quadruple, and five blade razors and prefer the ones with more blades.  </li>
            <li>The final bit of advertising on the bottle, I&#x27;ll state right off that I like.</li>
            <li>As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction.</li>
            <li>It looks like they have the razor backing right next to the blades</li>
            <li>My neck was too long under my beard, so I quickly turned to my BzzKit.  </li>
            <li>Like almost everyone, I hate shaving, yet when i have a Gillette product in my hand, invariably I am more confident of my ability to get a clean, close shave without nicks and cuts and this shaver delivers on all levels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve long been loyal to Gilette for my shaving needs</li>
            <li>I was a little let down that I received the Non-powered razor as I&#x27;ve been using a powered razor for years, and love how smooth of a shave I get from them.</li>
            <li>Gillette is one smart cookie for making an easier razor for a busy busy guy like me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li>The razor provided a comfortable shave, and it did not leave the &amp;#34;itchy residue&amp;#34; my other razors provided.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts, including battery-powered, and this gives you as close, comfortable shave as any other.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel the ball move as much as I expected, but could tell a significant difference in the results of my shave.  </li>
            <li>The shave head is as smooth as any other Gillette razor</li>
            <li>While I like the lubricating strip razor manufacturers have added to blades in the past few years, features like rotating heads, more than 2 blades, and &amp;#34;FlexBall&amp;#34; technology always seemed like gimmicks to get you to spend more on your razor.  </li>
            <li>The razor is smooth and sharp and it doesn&#x27;t get clogged like my Schick Quatro does during a shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>can shaving creams and gels but after trying this free sample seems Gillette has come along way, It doesn&#x27;t foam up my face like my other product with a brush</li>
            <li>I had high hopes at first, but for me, it turned out to be about the same as any other razor, except for the really cheap no-frills type brands.</li>
            <li>My first razor back in high school was a Gillette</li>
            <li>Compared to the stick I&#x27;ve been using, it was a smooth, painless shave, and I am now ending up with little or no cuts--a step better than what I typically experience.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li>However, this new razor was a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>I participated in a Bzz campaign to try the new Fusion Proglide.  </li>
            <li>Plus the new ball technology helped the razor glide with ease around the curvy parts of my face.  </li>
            <li>Got the chance to try the flexball with the new gel as well.</li>
            <li>I will be switching to this new razor and using it from now on.</li>
            <li>I will be switching to this new razor and using it from now on.</li>
            <li>Received the NEW Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care and Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology from Gillette for testing.</li>
            <li>Testing the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology and the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>Let me tell you this one thing about this new Proglide Razor.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I like to try new razors.</li>
            <li>This is a problem with all new 5 blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>Partnered with their new shaving gel you get the closest and cleanest shave on the planet.</li>
            <li>This razor blade comes off as new age technology.</li>
            <li>I need new blades, it will be for this one.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor has continued to live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve told a couple of friends about this new razor.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s new 2-in-1 shave gel</li>
            <li>I received this new razor and shaving gel as a test and review from Gillette and man, the 5 blades in it makes it seem like you are shaving on glass.</li>
            <li>You Will Not Have To Buy New Blades</li>
            <li>Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new razor has 5 blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would I buy a new pack of blades for the Gillette Fusion Proglide?&lt;br /&gt;No.</li>
            <li>have since passed on the ProGlide razor to my father, along with a brand new 6 pack of cartridges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would I buy a new pack of blades for the Gillette Fusion Proglide?&lt;br /&gt;No.</li>
            <li>have since passed on the ProGlide razor to my father, along with a brand new 6 pack of cartridges.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it with the new razor.  </li>
            <li>which I was amazed about, the new razor head along with the flexball technology is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for everything else, this is my new go-to razor.  </li>
            <li>after trying the new flexball technology on the fusion proglide razor</li>
            <li>I recommend it to any one who is looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li>The new Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology</li>
            <li>would still recommend this product to someone who is new to manual razors, but for me it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I was part of a promotion where Gillette sent me a new Fusion ProGlide razor to test and review.</li>
            <li>I like this new razor and can recommend it to discerning shavers everywhere.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades don’t seem to be anything new to me from the Gillette line.</li>
            <li>If I were buying a new razor I would probably get it, but I don&#x27;t know that i would trade in what I had for it.</li>
            <li>Gillette has a customer for live with these products.</li>
            <li>It has a new design with the bottom made out of plastic which will not leave any rust stain on your counter.</li>
            <li>The new FlexBall solves that problem because it allows the razor to bob, weave and adjust to the contours of my jaw line.</li>
            <li>Replacement blades should be cheaper than the razor itself, otherwise, why not just buy a new razor every time.</li>
            <li>They claim that the FlexBall razor paired with their new shave gel provides maximum contact and a closer shave in each stroke.  </li>
            <li>Would I go out and buy this razor if I needed a new razor?</li>
            <li>The handle is slim and easy to use, the blade is very sharp and got all the hair in one pass.</li>
            <li>and i do get a smooth shave, but the price is a tad high, bring the price down a tad</li>
            <li>Gillette claims you no longer have to do that, and that you can fit their Flexballs into all those hard to reach little crevasses on your face as it rotates left and right as well as up and down.&lt;br /&gt;Still, honestly,</li>
            <li>Whenever I&#x27;d tried to move to a 4-blade system, they&#x27;ve always clogged up or been harder to clean, so there I&#x27;ve stayed.  </li>
            <li>Got this free as a product promotion along with some \\&quot;Active</li>
            <li>Although Gillette razors are not cheap but the Fusion Proglide razor is amazing and I will not go back to another razor again.  </li>
            <li>However, when I received a free Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology and a can of their Active Sport Shave Gel, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>harder to clean out the hair with each swipe.  </li>
            <li>So in comparison to the Norelco, the ProGlide was equally smooth and close without the multiple passes and extra time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As such I also received a free trial not only of the razor but of Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mostly used electric shavers in the past because the normal razors would leave my neck area irritated and bumpy.</li>
            <li>and never even thought to drop the extra dough on &amp;#34;new razor technology.&amp;#34; Gillette sent me their razor a while back to try risk free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mostly used electric shavers in the past because the normal razors would leave my neck area irritated and bumpy.</li>
            <li>Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I dont have very course facial hair, but this thing works really well.  </li>
            <li>This is a better razor but they are better at cutting hair.</li>
            <li>They all have close shaves, especially with repeated swipes, very much including this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very surprised at the close shave I got from this razor.</li>
            <li>With my very sensitive skin i was a bit hesitant on using the Fusion ProGlide razor.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and always break out after shaving.</li>
            <li>I usually shave in the shower, and without a mirror, so this is a key factor and demonstrates how quick and easy the shave is.</li>
            <li>If you are on the fence or are willing to try out a new razor definitely give this one a try.</li>
            <li>He find it got as close as his regular go-to razor (which I can&#x27;t give you the name of because I&#x27;ve been told to stay away from it), but he was a little vexed by the motion created by the Flexball (I really can&#x27;t tell you how much I love that name).</li>
            <li>The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change.</li>
            <li>and I think they are a little expensive, but hey I get a pretty good shave, so I think its worth it!</li>
            <li>On the limited evidence provided by one shave, it pretty much delivers.</li>
            <li>I cannot currently see any negatives, outside of the fact that I think that if I continue using this razor, I shall be sure to pick up the Powered option however that&#x27;s probably just personal preference.</li>
            <li>I surprised!</li>
            <li>I have used many razors in the past but</li>
            <li>It would probably result in a long and drawn out process with steep court fees and hours of my time, but for a razor that combines the power and flexball technologies, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>I am not sure though if this is more attributable to the razor itself or that I was also using the Gillette</li>
            <li>After all, what have you to lose other than more facial hair!</li>
            <li>but it actually gets pretty close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty similar to my hydro5</li>
            <li>I had my doubts about the razor being any better than the other manual razors on the market, but I will never be going back after using this product.</li>
            <li>Ever tried shaving while doing all sorts of funny stuff just to get the shave you want, you know, using all your facial muscles so your face will conform to the shaver&#x27;s blade?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been fascinated to watch all the latest technology in shaving over the past decade</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the shave this razor gave me, it left nothing behind but my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if that is more the handle or the blade, but either way, I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually would get rashes and bumps with most creams and gels</li>
            <li>so I know when it&#x27;s time to pick up another bottle and just to see how much I go through, in general.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t actually the first time I&#x27;ve recieved this paticular brand of razor.</li>
            <li>It does look cool and space aged, but that is all I got out of it.</li>
            <li>It did give me a rather clean shave and it was nice having the single razor on the reverse to touch-up those sideburns that sometimes are difficult to get straight with the normal razor head.  </li>
            <li>I have previously owned this new line of Gillette razors, and all I can say is that they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I always thought of it as another gimmicky product like the rest of the 3-4-5 razors promising to produce a clean shave (which they never did).</li>
            <li>The results of the Fusion ProGlide razor with 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care (Active Sport to be precise) really surprised me.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a perfect razor due to having a little trouble around the neck area, but otherwise I found it to be fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I like the close and smooth shave provided by this razor, and the Flexball is functional, but I am not completely satisfied with the large size of the blade head.  </li>
            <li>I use other razors and just don&#x27;t get the close clean shave Gillette gives me.</li>
            <li>All the blades are sharp and clean, and have not cut me yet.  </li>
            <li>The other gillette brand I used was a lot easier to clean out.  </li>
            <li>The new flexball technology  has pivot action to help with curves (on your face or around your knees and ankles).</li>
            <li>I get upset when compmanies don&#x27;t make new models compatible with old.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to participate in a campaign through BzzAgent to review The new Fusion ProGlide Sensitive 2-in-1 Shave Gel and the Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball technology.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the folks at Gillette, I recently had the opportunity to try the new Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall handle technology in combination with the new Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 shave gel.  </li>
            <li>Considering that I&#x27;ve always been very careful to shave straight however, I was still a bit unsure how much of a difference this would really make.</li>
            <li>The flexibility and the track ball leave you with a smooth shave using less effort on your part.</li>
            <li>I must also say that it left me extremely smooth and gave me one of the closest shaves I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>This razor gives as smooth a shave as the previous versions of the razor, but</li>
            <li>If I was using my old razor, I would have to shave over the same area multiple times to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>While this razor provided the BEST shave I ever had it might be expensive for the average consumer.</li>
            <li>The gel is nice as well, very faint scent so not overpowering and provides good coverage of your face with just a little amount.</li>
            <li>The new Fusion ProGlide Sensitive 2-in-1 Shave Gel Plus Skin Care creates a shave experience with no mess, no rust and no guessing!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see it in action much on my face and in the end it really took no shorter time than with my other razors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the cost, for all that it does, this blade is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of razors and spent some serious money on the expensive models so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be impressed with the Proglide or not.</li>
            <li>pricing on razors is what always send me to the dollar store however this razor is lasting a long time with its 5 blades and will most likely surpass the value I thought I was getting with the cheapest ones</li>
            <li>The gel has a very smooth lotion like consistency which allowed this crazy sharp razor to glide smoothly over my face cleanly taking all of the hair in one pass with no pulling or hesitation.</li>
            <li>I recently had the opportunity to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide and the ProGlide razor with FlexBall thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>I found I could live with cheaper alternatives, even if the shave was not perfectly smooth and totally comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t say that I really noticed any swivel on the razor, and kept shaving straight as I usually do, I can say that it felt very smooth on my face and no areas of extra pressure I may notice with my regular razor.</li>
            <li>The razor itself hugs your face like a magnet and the moisture strip provides just enough moisture to allow the razor to easily pivot around each curve, nook and cranny with careful precision.</li>
            <li>You can instantly feel a smoother, gliding cut that is even more effortless than the previous generation.</li>
            <li>It is fairly quick to shave with, so if you are in a hurry, it can be a solid choice to get a decent-enough shave to last you a business day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shaver especially for people who do designs or any type of artistic stuff with their facial hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried other major cartridge based razors and found I received more irritation and a shave that left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>I originally chose electric both because I would cut myself every single time with a manual razor and because electric doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much.</li>
            <li>Same high quality I&#x27;ve come to enjoy from other Gillette razors, but</li>
            <li>The razor itself is pretty much just like any other mulit-blade razor on the market</li>
            <li>The gel is nice and thick, the shave is close (with both the Fusion razor and my previous razor, gave both a try) and my face feels fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>The Flexball Handle essentially now allows it to curve not only up &amp; down, but now left &amp; right as well, giving your new razor unprecedented facial comfort and coverage.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s because the regular Proglide works so well, that the difference is purely subjective to each user</li>
            <li>Finally, I have found one that I can live with!!</li>
            <li>When I used the original shaving cream the results were fine, but nothing I hadn&#x27;t received from other manual razors in the past.</li>
            <li>The handle itself is significantly thinner and sleeker than the previous model I owned.</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthy upgrade over other models.  </li>
            <li>After your shave feel free to go cut down a tree while fighting a bear!</li>
            <li>to say, since I usually buy my razors at the dollar store, that it is a very cool shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have had not cuts or nicks with this blade.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different razors, and Gillette is honestly the best shave I can find, the least irritating to my skin, and I can get almost a month out of the blades before they get dull.</li>
            <li>I had the 1st generation handle and really like the sleek new handle and really like the new black color of the handle itself.</li>
            <li>This ProGlide razor somehow managed to get most of the hairs on my cleft chin; any missed hairs were cleaned up using the single razor &amp;#34;Precision Trimmer&amp;#34;, which is just as sharp as the five blades on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also participated in a previous Gillette promotion where they were offering a battery-powered version of the same razor; it came with a button that you would press to turn on vibration--while it did feel kind of cool, it seemed all in all a little gimmicky to me; this is the same razor with just as good a shave for a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using the razor for a few shaves now, still on the original cartridge, and still only has positive things to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my skin feels great all day, even after working out or a crazy day at work.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor if you have problems with cutting yourself while shaving.</li>
            <li>The Fusion Proglide gives my straight edge a run for it&#x27;s money as far as closeness and takes only a fraction of the time to shave.</li>
            <li>The ProGlide mastered a smooth shave every time, without me having to drag the razor over the same patch of skin over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You might use it for more precise cutting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Gillette user my whole adult life and was recently using the Power ProGlide before getting this one with the FlexBall.</li>
            <li>Plus since it doesn&#x27;t get clogged, so there a fewer instances of tapping it to clear it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for minimal face shaving, I can&#x27;t say that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball technology is a huge improvement over prior Fusion versions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for minimal face shaving, I can&#x27;t say that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball technology is a huge improvement over prior Fusion versions.  </li>
            <li>(I have incredibly sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I traditionally use a safety razor to shave, which means I take my time and am very deliberate with my movements, angle of blade / handle, and I shave twice (once with and once against the grain).  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a razor for sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t believe we are there quite yet.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaving kit, especially the gel in the dispenser thing</li>
            <li>So much in fact that I have given up my electric razor and gone back to these disposable blade razors.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and it never leaves razor burn.</li>
            <li>Gel + Skin Care also thanks to Gillette with the Proglide Razor for the ultimate shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin prone to neck razor burn.</li>
            <li>Sensitive shave gel in Alpine scent.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;ve had no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li>I received this razor and the Fusion for sensitive skin gel as part of a promotion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;1)The blades really glide along your skin, and they appear to last for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten any cuts so far</li>
            <li>mdue to the flex action of the razor.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how well this razor performed on my face.  </li>
            <li>but because he&#x27;s so adamant I stay away from his.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel.</li>
            <li>Hurts too much to shave with this monster (physically, not emotionally).</li>
            <li>I wanted to break it, even if it meant that I&#x27;d put my sensitive skin through hell just to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>three week old beard measured nearly a quarter inch at its longest, and the shortest hair would have been about 2-3 mm closer to where I would trim hairs to shape my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nicer $80 straight edge razor that does not require disposable blades has been a solid friend for over two years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My nicer $80 straight edge razor that does not require disposable blades has been a solid friend for over two years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Do you remember being a young kid and &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; alongside your dad using a spoon?  </li>
            <li>It did take a few strokes to get a completely smooth shave around my chin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a long-time cartridge razor user up until the last calendar year, I dealt with irritated skin, shaves that weren&#x27;t very close, and the cost of cartridge refills.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Heavy, in my eyes this is a pro, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap</li>
            <li>I used the sensitive skin gel from Gillette that came with, which I feel helped.</li>
            <li>A couple years back I started using a Schick Hydro and found it gave me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said all that, if you have problems with your shave - closeness, sensitive skin, etc.  </li>
            <li>It contours to the natural curves in my face and is truly a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin as well and did not have any problems with cuts or razor burn afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the smoothest, easiest, and quickest shave</li>
            <li>so far I like it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have been through about every razor,cream,gel, and after shave on the market.</li>
            <li>It passed all three tests seamlessly.</li>
            <li>I think I will return to using my old Trac II which has worked well for years and years, and let my wife have this razor for her legs.</li>
            <li>It hugged every curve of my face, not missing a spot.  </li>
            <li>Overall I really like this blade and handle.  </li>
            <li>was genuinely surprised with my results when I coupled this razor with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have fairly sensitive skin and find that shaving with cartridge razors, including this one, irritates my skin and does not leave me with as close a shave as my safety razor does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It catches all the stubble that my old razor could not.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does this razor cut very close, but the flexball allows it to contour to your face and remove hair evenly across all planes of your face (cheek bones, chin, etc.).</li>
            <li>This is really the next generation of razor technology.</li>
            <li>I was surprised-</li>
            <li>I use it along with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2in1 gel for sensitive skin and man</li>
            <li>I received the Fusion Proglide from Gillette about two weeks ago and have used it so far about 5-6 times.</li>
            <li>This is an area that has always been a been sensitive to razors causing bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>The Pro-Glide has really surprised me...</li>
            <li>I have been using it with Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel +</li>
            <li>But with the Gillette 2 in 1 sensitive shaving cream combined with the Flexball razor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the least enjoyable morning tasks imaginable</li>
            <li>I would hope that I would be able to get at least four or five shaves out of each razor.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but so far has held up.  </li>
            <li>so  far.  </li>
            <li>Cost of blades could pay for a Country Club membership, but if you really want the closest shave and easiest, this is likely it.</li>
            <li>I started to shave my head few years ago and have tried many different brands of razors found in markets or wholesale stores</li>
            <li>Also, they rarely have that weird lotion strip that seems to be the hallmark of most women&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li>Most of the hair was gone in one stroke, only a few times did I have to go over an area again</li>
            <li>The razor is professionally engineered to perform effortlessly in even the most stubborn of stubbles or delicate skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off to give you an idea of what kind of shaver I am, I maintain a beard while using the razor to keep the thick brush that constantly grows on my neck at bay.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t remember the last time i cut myself and these blades are fine and sharp.</li>
            <li>That sometimes happens to me when razors dull quickly after first 3 uses, but thankfully was not the case</li>
            <li>The combination easily handles a few millimeters of whiskers and, if past experience with the razor is an accurate guide, can clear a full-ish beard with a minimum of effort without needing the assistance of power tools.</li>
            <li>Now, this sounds like straight out of a paid advertisement where I&#x27;m pushing Gillette products, but I&#x27;m usually an automatic razor guy and don&#x27;t use manuals that much, but the combo of the razor and gel did make a big difference in getting a quick, painless and close shave.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am very happy and have found myself a new razor, definitely check it out you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are a bit more expensive, but they also last a pretty long time without significant deterioration in shave quality.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and soft, which is not easy for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it got the job done and was not bad per se, just not as good as the razor I previously used.</li>
            <li>With this new Proglide that i received for free from Gillette, the flex-ball allows the razor head to actuate correctly and hug the contours of my face to shave the areas I was struggling to reach in the past.</li>
            <li>Having very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve only been able to shave every 2 or 3 days in the past.</li>
            <li>Though I am an Asian male, so at most I shave once every other day.</li>
            <li>The razor is a little heavier than my old one, but I&#x27;ll take the better shave over this minor detail any day.</li>
            <li>while it did do a little better as far as following my face, I have been doing this long enough to where I already knew how to use my old razor to follow my face lines pretty well.</li>
            <li>This may mean that the product is really more geared towards those who shave rather quickly and with less care / precision than myself.  </li>
            <li>A great benefit since replacement blades are so expensive!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of this cream, I like that there is no mess</li>
            <li>so perhaps the flexball is useful if you&#x27;re using it on other parts of your body.</li>
            <li>The Gillete Fusion Proglide Manual razor offers little in terms of a true upgrade.</li>
            <li>the Flexball handle allows me to shave tough spots (chin/neck) very easily, with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you have sensitive skin such as myself.  </li>
            <li>After 3 days of use, it definitely shaves better than the previous ProGlide Power Razor I have been using for the last year or two.</li>
            <li>The only downside I saw was when I&#x27;d let my facial hair get out of control and didn&#x27;t trim first.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did give a decent shave, but overall it was only decent.</li>
            <li>But all in all a decent enough shave.</li>
            <li>do and that little convenient blade on the back of the shaver makes it easy to get the hairs under my nose</li>
            <li>the downside, I feel the lubricating strips don&#x27;t seem to last as long as my other razors, but I also tend to use a blade longer than most people would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found it was cool on my face and gave a little tingle.</li>
            <li>only other downside to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide is the ability to keep the razor head clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost effortless compared to other razors as it just slides right over the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li>If you are a daily shaver like me, you&#x27;ll appreciate the necessity of a high quality razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially for head shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely well constructed and screams high quality.</li>
            <li>Gillette in my opinion has always produced high quality razors, this one is not different.</li>
            <li>This new model had a orange power LED, while the previous &amp;#34;silver tone&amp;#34; model had a cool blue LED.</li>
            <li>Since it has a five bladed head that is mounted on a handle, it is capable of lateral movement of about 20 degrees, so it is not limited to only face!</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s worth the little bit extra that Gillette wants for it.</li>
            <li>but I thought the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; piece to the razor I had been to be a little gimmicky and wasn&#x27;t sure how much it did.  </li>
            <li>The FlexBall makes it extremely comfortable wet or dry as I used it in the shower and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes considerably less strokes to get the hair on the back of my head and neck off completely smooth.</li>
            <li>This razor left my face very smooth and hardly any irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li>I also love the double sided razor the single blade helps me get those pesky areas that the 5 other blades just can&#x27;t reach.  </li>
            <li>The nozzle truly is mess free, and there was not the slightest bit of gel left on the nozzle after applying to my hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always leery of switching razors in general because I know my old ones work.</li>
            <li>The final shave was actually smoother than my old vibrating razor ever accomplished.  </li>
            <li>My only negative is the trim blade on the back of the razor does not give an effective close up shave for sideburns and under the nose.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it is any different than what I normally use, but I am a brand person</li>
            <li>Now, I have used other Fusion blades in the past, so I kind of knew what I was getting there.  </li>
            <li>I have since found several razors that work pretty much just as well--all for cheaper (sometimes quite a bit cheaper) than what a typical Proglide razor will cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a deal breaker but the electric model is a little bit more ergonomic and doesn&#x27;t slip out of wet hands.</li>
            <li>For this reason I have been a long time user of Gillette razors because they seem to minimize my razor burn, I definitely could never use a cheap disposable single blade razor, it would leave cuts on my face for a week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used safety razors in the past, and when using a safety razor, you want a light touch and loose grip so as not to put much pressure on the skin, which results in nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a new razor definitely try this one out</li>
            <li>I grew a beard for 4 months and decided to finally shave it off for spring using the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>and I plan on buying it the next time I need a new shaved.</li>
            <li>Even with a brand new razor I don&#x27;t get the same ease of</li>
            <li>The new thinner blades last longer and the shave gel works well</li>
            <li>ProGlide Flexball has features similar to my ProGlide Power except for one new feature – FlexBall Technology.</li>
            <li>Truth be told I prefer the traditional razor to this new fangled one.  </li>
            <li>I recently got a chance to audition the new Gillette Fusion Proglide razor, but with &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, a manual razor I can live with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a really big fan of this new generation of the Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology.</li>
            <li>The Excel has always provided a clean, close shave but with the downside of raw, reddish, irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The simple vibrating seems to really help with the overall experience of the shave, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Gillette did a fantastic job of keeping the blades thin, thinner than the Excel blades, but they do still command a bit of real estate.  </li>
            <li>My fiance absolutely loves the fact that I shaved my entire face, and that there is no razor burns, or bumps, or any hair left over.</li>
            <li>The 5-blades and microcomb allow for a smooth shave and remain resilient after repeated uses, but because the lubristrip wears out after only a few uses, the cartridge needs to be replaced sooner than I would like.</li>
            <li>I typically look for coupons and rare discounts and then buy the cartridges in bulk (2 year supply), because they are so expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>years, I gave up the closeness of a blade shave and used an electric razor because most of the blades were too irritating to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The only negative to this is the claim of “post shave goo” on the top of the container.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive but flexball makes shaving much easier and quicker in the morning.</li>
            <li>downside though is that it took a while, at least 20 minutes just for one side of my face, so maybe not so great for thick beards, or if you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just need a few quick swipes of the neck and cheeks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for daily use especially for people with sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li>Despite this small setback, I didn&#x27;t find it to be too much of a hassle due to how easily the Fusion Proglide moves over the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With my old Fusion handles, certain areas of my neck would require multiple passes from multiple different angles to get every stray whisker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for a long time, and they finally added something to the razor that is worth trading up from their traditional razor!</li>
            <li>have used several of the Gillette family of cartridge razors in the past and have found most of them to be very similar from my shaving experiences with them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette sending me a Fusion proglide with flexball technology, I can finally stop buying the cheap razors that only last for half a shave and/or cut me several times.</li>
            <li>It has that single blade on the back which worked a little, but i didn&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I have a cleft chin, and with razors in the past, it has been a mission to clean up hairs in the cleft.</li>
            <li>The Proglide works so well, that it only takes a few quick strokes to complete my shave.</li>
            <li>Now I normally use the Gillette Fusion Power and this was a non-power version of the flexball, so I was a little scared at first to go back (to a non-powered).</li>
            <li>The razor gently and effortlessly removed tough facial hair leaving my face perfectly smooth and without razor burn.</li>
            <li>The razor cuts all the hair on the first stroke, even in hard to reach places thanks to the flex ball.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got those places on my face and neck that are hard to get a close shave for, and I usually have to go over and over those places just to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>and I was sure that have to trim it down a little with my electric razor before using the manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shaving is not something I generally look forward to.</li>
            <li>it has enough blades to perfectly clear a path in</li>
            <li>The flexball looks very durable and long lasting</li>
            <li>I would advise trimming excessive long hair as is needed prior to using most razors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the blades that come with the razor last longer than my old razor&#x27;s as well.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised to find that it definitely was.  </li>
            <li>: The handle is sturdy and the rubber grips are very helpful when shaving in the shower or just have wet hands.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Men&#x27;s Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology has replaced my electric razor completely and blade cartridges last for about a month.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m used to it, I do notice a difference in comfort if I have to go back to a fixed handle.</li>
            <li>Never have i used a razor that left my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>will recommend buying and will buy in the near future</li>
            <li>Not really a fan of 5-blade razors, however the flex ball really does the job well.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to my old razor.</li>
            <li>The flexball did take some getting used to, but afterwards it was a very neat idea that allowed you to get those harder areas around the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mineral oil from the lubristrips also left my skin feeling soft and irritation-free.</li>
            <li>I would prefer if they left it off completely, and I have never heard anyone say they buy Gillette blades because of their lubricating</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan to go back to my old razor or shaving gel again.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old son is the person who has never shaved but has the beginnings of &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; above his lip so I have been trying to get him to try it out.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been in the shave game for many years</li>
            <li>I had seen this product before , but never tried because I thought it was kind of expensive for a razor</li>
            <li>However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it leaves behind more trouble than it feels worth it.  </li>
            <li>but it did not seem to do any better or worse that my non-flexball razor.  </li>
            <li>It usually takes me a couple months to grow something that resembles anything close to a full beard.</li>
            <li>There is no significant drag on my skin, and the blades glides easily across all parts of my face.</li>
            <li>There is no significant drag on my skin, and the blades glides easily across all parts of my face.</li>
            <li>but they have solved the problem by placing additional super tiny little gap fillers between each razor so that 1.</li>
            <li>But the first time I used this razor, I did so with about a month of growth on my face and didn&#x27;t trim it down at all before shaving.</li>
            <li>I strongly encourage you to give it a try, especially for those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>It gets so close with no little stubble left over.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t hesitate to give a low rating to a product that doesn&#x27;t live up to the claims made regarding it, or if it falls short of my expectations.</li>
            <li>I have been a Gillette fan for sometime, and will never go back to a different razor since this new Proglide Flexball as came into my life.</li>
            <li>The scent was certainly evocative of an ocean breeze and plays well with those of the other similarly-themed products I use.</li>
            <li>The new FlexBall allows for long shaving strokes that match the contour of your face.</li>
            <li>The razor hugs every curve of my face and gently glides over every bump and crook in my next without a single slice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so stiff and I am not afraid that I am going to cut myself because like I self it moves with the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>I tend to grow my facial hair out and shave once a week and by doing so, I notice that the lubricating strip begins to fade right after the first shave and typically wears down in about four shaves.  </li>
            <li>IT HAS MADE WHAT WAS A CHORE, INTO A VERY SIMPLE TASK AND TAKES ABOUT HALF THE TIME TO DO A BETTER JOB THAN MY PREVIOUS RAZOR, WHICH IS NOW IN THE TRASH.</li>
            <li>The appearance of the razor is sleek and sexy but nothing out of the ordinary compared to other Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many razors in the past including other gillette models</li>
            <li>What stands out is the FlexBall handle which swivels slightly when you push the razor head to the left or right.  </li>
            <li>, If you have problems with irritation due to razors that make you constantly pass over the same areas to get a clean shave I would highly suggest that you give this one a shot, and as previously mentioned the Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>I dry my razor after every use and the strip right above the razors looks all dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>I have thick stubble around my chin mainly, and the grain of the hair on the right of my neck goes up, leading to constant razor burn.  </li>
            <li>One of the things I like about this razor is that I don&#x27;t get cut even when I shave fast, that is not the case with other brands.</li>
            <li>Other three blade cartridges seem to be much easier to rinse out, extending the life of the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades are made very well and give an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference form other Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>one pet peeve is it can be hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I have been using his razor for quite some time but really don&#x27;t find any difference between it and other razors, the blades are what make the difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as sharp and does not hug your face, but it&#x27;s much cheaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you could only figure out how to make that blue strip not get all dry and cracked so fast, this could get 5 stars.</li>
            <li>For those times I have traditionally relied on  the triple blade disposable that nearly always left me nicked and bleeding.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure if there is a single negative to report back.</li>
            <li>The major difference is the ball, it does help with getting closer in same areas.  </li>
            <li>But my experience was a less than positive one.</li>
            <li>handle is a bit on the heavy size, but that is actually a benefit as it seems to impart a little more control.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer the Power to this unit (ever so slightly) and this is the first and last thing I grab when the batteries run out!</li>
            <li>I recently received this as part of a promotional package and was very skeptical because I haven&#x27;t had a pleasant shave in over a decade.</li>
            <li>Makes my face smoother with less strokes, with other razors I have to go over and over my face to get a clean close shave.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor and i recommend you give it a try you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li>This razor is great and will not leave you disappointed.</li>
            <li>Whether you are shaving your face or other areas, you really just have to guide the razor and no longer need to worry about proper angle.  </li>
            <li>The can is cool, not a kind of material that will rust or leave the goo all over.</li>
            <li>As a man who shaves everyday, buying razors can be pretty costly.  </li>
            <li>And the shave was consistent regardless of whether I was shaving a few days of growth or over a week.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly like the power version sans the gimmicky oscillations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first think I noted was how heavy the product is.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone as it is worth the price as one blade usually lasts 2 weeks if you shave every 2 days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad at all but its not amazing.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that with my old razor having a battery in it that it would be as heavy, if not a little heavier.  </li>
            <li>Decent price for the actual razor (which is roughly $10).</li>
            <li>I was getting the same shave with the flexball razor that I do with other razors with the only difference being that it took less strokes to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That is plain simple evolution of your everyday razor :)</li>
            <li>The ball does help a little in molding to my face, but if I let my beard grow out more than usual</li>
            <li>This particular shaver has kept it&#x27;s edge longer than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have never had an issue with the blade going dull quickly.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and have never really liked shaving very much.  </li>
            <li>I also like the button for releasing the blades which makes for easy, convenient shaving, especially when I am running late for work!</li>
            <li>The price of the cartridges are very high and, in my opinion, not worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>, the bottle can&#x27;t rust (which is always gross with other bottles), the guage to tell you what is left is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Also the blue strip stays clean and soft longer than with other razors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Gillette has made me a new lifelong customer.  </li>
            <li>Just a FYI, I apply a little bit of mineral oil to the blades after shaving to keep it clean, sharp, and rust-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly doubt I will be using any other razors in my house after my experience with this one.</li>
            <li>This razor is so easy to use that it&#x27;s hard to miss a single hair!</li>
            <li>Disposable razors, or even a real razor with less flexibility just can&#x27;t rival the agility of this razor head that manages to pick every hair up.</li>
            <li>This feels much sturdier than a typical razor, and you can tell that they wanted to put this in another class.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The less advertised improvements are where the real beauty is.</li>
            <li>In reality, I noticed absolutely ZERO difference in how close the razor shaved than my previous Proglide without the</li>
            <li>I am also surprised how long the blades last.</li>
            <li>If you have one of the 3 Blade razors like a Mach3 or earlier (or that other brand I never liked), it&#x27;s definitely worth the upgrade to go straight to the ProGlide Power Razor with FlexBall.</li>
            <li>Long story short, my dollar razors continue to collect dust in my cabinet while my 15 year old brother buys me 5 extra Gillette razor heads for Christmas.</li>
            <li>a little easier to get certain places that i usually am turning the razor all different direction to get just right.</li>
            <li>The shaving experience is much smoother than with my previous razor, especially on the rougher parts of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I typically have trouble getting a close smooth around my chin.  </li>
            <li>Try to invent a razor that will not get dull within the first 2 uses!</li>
            <li>No more trying to wrap my left hand over the back right side of my head while facing downwards trying to get that spot at the part of my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually rushed, so I use a pretty high end electric, but my fiance on the other hand uses a cartridge razor for her legs/etc.  </li>
            <li>The FlexBall is unique but not sure why they call it FlexBall when it really is not a ball</li>
            <li>5 blades is a little too much for me.</li>
            <li>it felt a little too much.  </li>
            <li>Gillette has put a lot of marketing power into this new &#x27;Flexball&#x27; razor - from endless ads to even sending me this sample to review.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that the new flexball razor would help get me a smoother shave quicker than the other razors.  </li>
            <li>The head is shared with other Gillette razors so no need for buying new heads if you already are a Gillette Fusion user.</li>
            <li>A little of the gel goes a long way which helps to negate the higher price for this product.</li>
            <li>Really, I try to shave as little as possible.  </li>
            <li>Yes they may be a little more expensive but really, you are shaving</li>

            <li> And I have to say that it is an incredible duo!</li>
            <li> Closest shave and best cut</li>

            <li> Awesome Stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The best part of the razor is how close a shave you can get with it.  </li>
            <li> It is the smoothest, best shave i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>

            <li> This combo of razor and gel is truly the best a man can get.</li>
            <li> very good razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its companion Fusion ProGlide Gel is another great and wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible shave - I hesitate to say that because I do NOT want the price to go up.</li>
            <li> I brought this one for my artist to use and he thought it was incredible.</li>
            <li> Either way still a great product and the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li> Great Razor and a great price!  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 4 weeks now and the shave is incredible.  </li>
            <li> But this razor is so good, I probably don&#x27;t have to use electronic shavers!  </li>
            <li> Now, if I can keep this away from my wife I will be good!</li>
            <li> oh that beautiful Flexball.  </li>
            <li> So when I was offered to try it again but with the shave gel I was  very pleased to do so!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;ve used my Gillette M3 Power for years now and have been quite happy.</li>
            <li> The razor is great</li>
            <li> What a great combination.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a great value price on this Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> it feels great in your hand.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy I was chosen for this test.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this razor works.</li>
            <li> It felt great.</li>
            <li> but it is a welcome addition.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have a great shave every time.</li>
            <li> Gillette did a great job with the marketing department to get you to notice the product.  </li>

            <li> Thank you BzzAgent for the great opportunity.</li>
            <li> The precision trimmer is great for my sideburns.</li>

            <li> it is smoother and gives me a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Great razor for men or women.</li>
            <li> Works great for shaving my legs, doesn&#x27;t razor burn like chintzy razors.</li>
            <li> Definitely, a great deal.</li>
            <li> So, to make her happy, I shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like holding the weight of a quality pen, where you feel proud to display it as your write.  </li>

            <li> it was great.  </li>
            <li> The shave is great and paired with their shave gel, provides a great,smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li> Gillette is a brand name synonymous with a great shave.</li>
            <li> It gives a great shave and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It did a great job and would no doubt buy and use again.</li>
            <li> than I should lol.</li>
            <li> I received a sample version from Gillette and I&#x27;m happy to report that it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> However, to my wife&#x27;s delight I&#x27;ve been shaving every day with great results...</li>
            <li> Blade stabilization was great for the contours of my face.  </li>
            <li> It was a great, close shave and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I got the Razor from BzzAgent, and I am fairly happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am happy to receive this sample for a review.</li>
            <li> This razor did a great job of cleaning up my face after months of neglect.  </li>
            <li> If you are a man that needs a product that will offer protection for you face and one that has a great scent, well you have to give it a try and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Microcomb does a great job channeling hair&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she said it did a great job on her legs</li>

            <li> Great Razor, great for the price.</li>

            <li> I cannot tell you how happy this makes me.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.</li>
            <li> I am now a happy man.</li>
            <li> I will happily admit that I am a Gillette man.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that i received it as a promotional gift and that helped with my decision to continue purchasing.</li>
            <li> What I like about the ProGlide is that it gets all the hairs, and the flexball technology is really great which allows for closer shaves.</li>
            <li> It is a great razor</li>
            <li> The gel gauge is a great feature</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t experienced any nicks or irritation from this razor, which is not something I can always say.</li>
            <li> Great product by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Adjusts to face contours for a great shave.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who likes to look great without the pain.</li>
            <li> The Gillette 2 in1 shaving gel goes great with it as well</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.</li>
            <li> And I always have been happy with their product.</li>
            <li> But I do have to say the flexball is great.</li>
            <li> This is probably a gimmick, but the razor itself is great.  </li>
            <li> YES, as I said gives a great shave</li>
            <li> Shaves great</li>
            <li> A great innovative design!!</li>

            <li> smooth save without damaging my skin!!!</li>
            <li> ▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used.</li>
            <li> The flexing head also contours very nicely around the face and chin area.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is very nice.</li>
            <li> Gel + Skin Care shaveing gel and tell you what it feels very nice on my skin.  </li>

            <li> Great shave and amazing scent!</li>
            <li> Great razor, the roller ball is amazing!</li>
            <li> I received a sample Proglide razor from Gillette and I must say, it is amazing!  </li>
            <li> but this razor is amazing!  </li>
            <li> This shaver is amazing!</li>
            <li> is amazing!  </li>
            <li> It feels wonderful &amp; leaves you razor burn free!</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re great, you pay more, but they have the best razors, they do a lot of good RnD with the blades and how they&#x27;re designed that give you a quality</li>
            <li> I would honestly cut my face up!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, the most impressive bit about this razor?</li>
            <li> and I am highly impressed and satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I found most impressive about the razor: it handled my cleft chin with ease.  </li>
            <li> Make the investment, get this for yourself or ladies for your favorite guy and experience the best shave you&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> but it also made for a 1 pass shave no retracing steps to make sure I got all the hairs Excellent job</li>
            <li> this razor is one of the best i have used i mostly use clippers to trim or shave my beard but this while be my go to razor from now on</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how pleased I am with this razor; it is perfect and for the price you cannot beat it!</li>
            <li> awesome razor  rec&#x27;d as part of promotion and will defenitely buying more</li>
            <li> There is a reason for that; their products work great and are a good value.</li>
            <li> Even more impressive was the cooling sensation that I felt immediately upon application.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave and great blades at a great price!</li>
            <li> for the product it&#x27;s amazing the shaving cream applies nice and smells awesome as for the Flexball razor</li>
            <li> Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is easily the best shave that money can buy.  </li>
            <li> It easily glided along the contours of my face, and provided a shave that was nearly perfect.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I have never been more impressed with a razor.  </li>
            <li> Adds some good weight that feels good in my hands.</li>
            <li> Good rubberized grips keep it from shifting or sliding.  </li>
            <li> Probably a good 9 out of 10.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always laughed at the increasing number of blades in razors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good indication to me that my skin wasn&#x27;t raked raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But it takes time and a good number of passes to achieve the results.  </li>
            <li> When I got the Flexball razor and tried it out, I really loved how it contoured and how maneuverable it was compared to the Styler.</li>
            <li> The razor is balanced and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also provided was the Fusion ProGlide Gel which seemed to work good with this razor.  </li>
            <li> The gel strip, a good indicator of when it&#x27;s time to change cartridges.</li>
            <li> My shave with this razor has been superior in every way.</li>
            <li> It has changed my morning routine for good.</li>
            <li> If you like a good close shave with a superior product, give the Fusion Proglide a try.</li>
            <li> Already use a fusion razor and fusion blades so this \\&quot;flex handle technology\\&quot; provided a good comparison.  </li>
            <li> This razor is good.</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with how smooth the shave is with this razor.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give the razor a 5 star because it just was not as good as the Gillette Power razor.  </li>
            <li> I have always been a user of an electric razor because I could never find that manual razor that works good for me</li>
            <li> So good news, I&#x27;ve always used their razors</li>
            <li> Delighted with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> The razor body just felt good in my hand.</li>
            <li> flexball head rotates perfectly and smoothly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She stole it from me and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> If you are in need of a go-to razor, this is a good bet.</li>
            <li> It may feel really good while I&#x27;m using it...</li>
            <li> I loved the weight and feel of the razor.</li>
            <li> It does provide a good shave and seems to be as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is a good razor .</li>
            <li> The razor is just as good as the mach 3</li>
            <li> and it gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> The really good thing is that the package of replacement heads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I got this excellent razor from Gilette for free.</li>
            <li> Good question.</li>
            <li> All 5-6 times I got a good shave and did not notice bleeding once.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good there,</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li> Blades perform well and give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor from Gillette to review and I was delighted by the look and feel of the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of razors, and nothing has worked nearly as good as the ProGlide.</li>
            <li> I really loved the product it gave me the closest shave with no razor</li>
            <li> Really good razor</li>
            <li> This is a superb quality razor, that gives you the closest, smoothest comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> handle is sturdy and has a good balance to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sharp blades are what make or break good shaves, and the Fusion ProGlide&#x27;s five blades don&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Shaving Club - Good blades (I&#x27;m comparing to the 4 blades).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Harry&#x27;s - Good blades (between the DSC and Gillette)</li>
            <li> Good razor</li>
            <li> but Gellette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide with Flexball does a good job minimizing the burning and breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is the best , most comfortable shave I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best product to ensure that you get the best shave possible.</li>
            <li> This latest incarnation of Gillette&#x27;s five-bladed Fusion razor is advertised to have a flexible joint between the head and handle, thus more perfectly adjusting to the contour of one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> but it is for those who want an exceptional product that will get the job done well, and get it done quickly.blades are evenly distributed on the cartridge</li>
            <li> The ProGlide razor has quickly become the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Skin Care shaving gel compliments this razor exceptionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Gillette razors for quite some time now, and honestly believe they are about the best available.</li>
            <li> The result is an exceptionally close and pain-free shave.  </li>
            <li> The best shaves I get are still from a barber but the next best thing is the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology razor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette, for letting my try this awesome product for free!!!</li>
            <li> Great razor, it shaves very smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice clean look and an awesome shave!</li>
            <li> On top of all this you get the Gillette quality that you expect with the great name.</li>
            <li> LOL :)</li>
            <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and this is their best so far.</li>
            <li> Im happy to say that love this razor.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide handle with Flexball technology is great, but the blades are even better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very, very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li> Believe me he will be Happy :-)</li>
            <li> I have seen people complaining about the price, but you can get the razor refills in bulk quantities which makes it fairly cost effective.</li>
            <li> handle itself is perfect and is tapered at the right places and quite ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> The razor is supposed to follow the curves of my face for a perfect shave right?</li>
            <li> in all this really is a great razor that I would recommend to anybody seeking a more ergonomic and better functioning razor!</li>
            <li> flexball didn&#x27;t add anything for me in my shaving experience but again very impressed with the blades, the most important part.</li>

            <li> and I have to say, I love this razor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice already, and it&#x27;s a pretty awesome experience.</li>

            <li> Let me start off by saying, I have not used a better razor, period!</li>
            <li> What more do you want!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> The shave gel is great, and it provides an easy shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gel is really easy on my face&lt;br /&gt;Gel smells great</li>
            <li> As usual and once again Gillette has done its best job on bringing out yet again one of their best and superior quality of razor which is the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor.</li>
            <li> Show it who&#x27;s boss with five blades of pure awesome.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Ocean breeze shave gel is great formula to leave your skin feeling smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li> Every blade that Gillette has come out with is always amazing.  </li>
            <li> The razor is smooth, gets every area, even great on the chin, part of my neck and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> The proglide technology is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job with a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> The flexball technology is amazing at cornering all of the bumps and contours of your face and neck.</li>
            <li> Well the ball on this is amazing.</li>
            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free through Bzzagent in a promotion and I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li> and I have not gotten one nick or cut and for me that&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> The rotation is great also and lets me move smoothly around my face.</li>
            <li> This thing was amazing</li>
            <li> its really amazing.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to warm up to it, but I think the shave is smoother</li>
            <li> It allows the razor to perfectly contour to the curves on my face and the five blades allow for a very close shave without gouging the skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because it really is the best shave I have had in a while.</li>
            <li> , it lathers well, foams up nice and works great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (she has her own fellas).  </li>
            <li> I has a nice feel to it</li>
            <li> The 5 blades provide a nice, close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> This was perhaps the most surprising thing.</li>
            <li> My own kids didn&#x27;t recognize me because of how &amp;#34;handsome&amp;#34; my face looked after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving shaving again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one I have to say it is one of kind.  </li>
            <li> Quite honestly before using it</li>
            <li> and I have really liked them.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.)</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for providing me with this great product!</li>
            <li> I had been using one with a battery that created vibrations to reduce friction and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Without a battery or vibration of any kind</li>
            <li> /&gt;The flexball is nice, though.</li>
            <li> My son (16yrs) was thrilled to receive this Razor, so thrilled that I thought I should&#x27;ve kept it for myself.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re just not as nice as a reusable one.</li>
            <li> This razor is really great; better than most razors I have used.</li>
            <li> So fast and reliable perfect for the novice or the pro.</li>
            <li> The Flex Ball is a nice addition to the razor.  </li>
            <li> Nice piece of equipment&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave gel honestly was the highlight for me.</li>
            <li> After using this razor, I can honestly say I would not use any other.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love the weight of this razor, it feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> Lots of blades got the shave nice and close and minimized the frequency of shaving.</li>
            <li> found the flexball to be effective in responding to the contours of my face while staying close to the skin.</li>
            <li> My honest opinion-all are overpriced.  </li>
            <li> It was a thing of beauty, and in addition it had these really nice rubberized grips.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide stands out of the crowd with how effectively it works.</li>
            <li> The trimmer blade does an excellent job getting straight lines on my sideburns, and trimming close under my nose.  </li>
            <li> honestly thought I&#x27;d never use it again.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Gillette products and they just continue to get better.</li>
            <li> I liked it.  </li>
            <li> I honestly felt like the blades did not get as close as my schick and</li>
            <li> The razor is smooth and comfortable and of course, gives a great shave!</li>
            <li> but what I&#x27;m really loving is the engineering of the heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 5 blades do provide a nice, close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The razor has a flex ball that allows it to move freely and smoothly over your face helping to deliver that wonderful shave.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Below is a breakdown of what I liked and disliked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the flexball handle - honestly I can leave it.</li>
            <li> , my wife has actullay token over my razor because she liked the close shave it gave her.</li>
            <li> That way the head flexes around the curves of your face is definitely a nice chance.</li>
            <li> The shaving gel was really nice</li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> The handle also has a nice feel.  </li>
            <li> First thoughts, the weight of the razor, in combination with good technique, feels great against the skin.</li>
            <li> The main feature and the best is the flexball.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this razor for an awesome shave while it creates a baby-smooth texture!</li>
            <li> I thank amazon for allowing me to try this amazing new design, which is with no doubt the newer and best in the lineup.</li>
            <li> foamed up perfectly and the scent that I ordered was fresh and strong.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the FlexBall technology, it contours really nicely to my face and has helped me get a cleaner and smoother shave!</li>
            <li> smooth nice shave!</li>
            <li> First - the design of the flexball is incredible.</li>
            <li> I got mine free to test &amp; had my best most comfortable shave ever.</li>
            <li> Gillette has a new user thats for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> I have found the combination of the gel and razor provide me with a truly smooth shave, a cool, refreshed sensation on my face and an added benefit - a very pleasant residual scent of an ocean breeze.  </li>
            <li> The competitive pricing of this razor, in combination with the soft supple skin in provides is a win win situation.</li>
            <li> It does a really great job of giving a close, comfortable shave, and the FlexBall makes it that much more maneuverable, but I do miss the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; function.</li>
            <li> good one, easy to shave</li>
            <li> But let me tell you I am very happy that I tried it, I love how the flexball contours to your face making it much easier to get a close shave in all the &amp;#34;awkward&amp;#34; areas of your face.  </li>
            <li> It really is perfect and has me ready to run to the store for more blades.</li>
            <li> It stays close to the skin for good coverage and leaves my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> but the flexball makes it very easy.</li>
            <li> and I get razor burn very easily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the ocean breeze scent because it was very strong.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best razor available out their right now and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m being very honest and fair in this review, much like all of my reviews.  </li>
            <li> Very good shave, very close, no irritation.</li>
            <li> this does a much better job of giving a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly defined jawline and the Flexball makes a huge difference navigating the contours of my face and neck by pivoting side to side while staying close to my skin without any added pressure.</li>
            <li> I did receive this razor as a free sample from Gillette, but please don&#x27;t think that is the reason for the good review.</li>
            <li> By far the best shave of my life.  </li>
            <li> Gel + Skin Care has a nice refreshing smell and helped with any razor burn.</li>
            <li> He liked it, but didn&#x27;t really love it.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I like the Gillette Fusion even better than the Hydro.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best shave money can buy.</li>
            <li> Well many artists use their own razor.</li>
            <li> My trial box came with the 2 in 1 shave gel also that smells great and leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> This product provides the best shave experience as far as manual razors go.</li>
            <li> as far as razors go the proglide is one of the best, I have been a fan of gilletes since the beggining of time.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
            <li> The Pro Glide has by far been the best shave I have gotten....</li>
            <li> I got this razor and I am very happy with the results thus far.  </li>
            <li> The gel strip ensures a smooth shave and is always a good indicator of wear and tear on the blades and lets me know when it&#x27;s time to change cartridges.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am impressed by the smooth sensation while I am shaving.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the smooth close shave from the first use of this product.  </li>
            <li> While the my first use of the ProGlide Flexible was incredible, the friction levels increased after more uses.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am impressed by the smooth sensation while I am shaving.</li>
            <li> love this gives a good shave and is easy to use</li>
            <li> The blades glide easily across the contours of my face, no nicks, no cuts!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, a world of a difference!  </li>
            <li> Once a person learns to use the unique razor design, it could provide for a superior shaving experience.</li>
            <li> But it is perfect for a clean and easy full shave.</li>
            <li> However, if money is no object, this is easily the fastest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Felt like a good, clean shave.    </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product that I would be happy to recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don’t know how effective the Flexball is, but my overall impression of the shave is superb.  </li>
            <li> Now this is probably the best razor I have ever used, I am trying the product free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I had found that combined with a good shaving gel, my electric shave was quick, effective, and satisfying.</li>
            <li> That being said, this gives a good clean, close shave</li>
            <li> (you know the saying, happy wife, happy life!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying different razors hoping to find one that worked well, but hadn&#x27;t found the \\&quot;right\\&quot; one yet.  </li>
            <li> The most prominent feature, the Flexball, allows the razor to pivot along the contours of your face nicely, ensures that no hair is missed while providing one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Its nice and close and leaves a nice smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> As part of the preview group, I received this razor and I can say that the results are amazing, only have to shave once a day and no irritation, incredible!</li>
            <li> Also, the greatest thing about this razor is I got it free; all thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> great razor great shave look no further</li>
            <li> First of all the product itself looks great.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the razor and the way it fit in my hand.</li>
            <li> After my first shave I was incredibly happy with it.</li>
            <li> It give the perfect smooth, clean, quick shave that it claims.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from BzzAgent to test out and it is a great all-around product!</li>
            <li> very comfortable shave</li>
            <li> The razor moved across my face very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The shave is very smooth and prevents ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> it moves to the contour of your face and is very comfortable shaving.</li>
            <li> It gives a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> The gel made the shave very smooth</li>
            <li> It does glide very smooth and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It gives a very smooth shave and the flexball technology</li>
            <li> very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> very comfortable feel while using.</li>
            <li> Very smooth</li>
            <li> but it did leave my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 9 hours since I shaved and my face still feels very smooth and with</li>
            <li> This razor produces a very smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> great product trim awesome no mess no hair left after a good shave</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m happy to say that for the first time, I think I found a razor I like better - The Gillette Fusion Proglide FlexBall.</li>
            <li> A great razor that will not fail to deliver you a close and comfortable shave every time!    </li>
            <li> Not all that thrilled with refill cartridge prices, but all the good ones are pretty pricey, not just these.</li>
            <li> I also liked how it was easy to glide across my face and into creases without leaving marks.</li>
            <li> The blades on the razor glided nicely and cut stubble easily, without tugging and pulling, as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I received  this product to try out for free and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The thing I like the best about Gillette&#x27;s new razor was how smooth my shave was after running the razor over my face once.  </li>
            <li> : Best shave - the Fusion Proglide gets it right the first time around -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super smooth and works great.</li>
            <li> The razor has a good grip on it, smooth on my skin, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t proclaim to be the best shaver if you can&#x27;t adequately shave your whole face.</li>
            <li> The razor is fine, does its job but isn&#x27;t astounding by itself.</li>
            <li> Like I said, HUGE improvement in shaving experience!</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found another one that performs better.</li>
            <li> And this one touting the twist to lock top, I figured that&#x27;s about where it ended.</li>
            <li> More on that in a bit.</li>
            <li> Could probably shoot it across the room at someone, if I really wanted! :p  </li>
            <li> Overall, I was very impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li> They would probably see more benefit from the pivot than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably more the blade&#x27;s fault than it was the pivot feature, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it</li>
            <li> I just love this razor and the fact I can use the fusion blades I already have is just an added plus.</li>
            <li> Again, I felt that I was getting a better deal.</li>
            <li> To compare - With Gillette&#x27;s latest razor, the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology, you can expect to spend $4 or more per replacement cartridge.</li>
            <li> And the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology produces top notch results.</li>
            <li> The blade pivots front to back and side to side to respond to contours for the best shave you can get.</li>
            <li> ; Well, you probably don&#x27;t have a team whose job it is to come up with better shaving products.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with the latest from Gillette  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Wow, what a smooth shave!  </li>
            <li> I found the HQ8 blades to be better than the HQ177</li>
            <li> Many reviewers contend otherwise</li>
            <li> ProGlide razor isn&#x27;t perfect and here is its one flaw: the razor head is big.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I would prefer to shave more often just</li>
            <li> Still love it over the Excel razor I used before.  </li>
            <li> more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really gives me a great, close shave</li>
            <li> as a summary i would say that i have used Fusion ProGlide razors before and this one is definitely better -</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette line of Fusion products, and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology is no exception.</li>
            <li> No nicks and best of all, no ingrown hairs the next couple of days after.</li>
            <li> With the awesome razor you don&#x27;t have to go over the same spots on your face</li>
            <li> more than once, one swipe and done.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really nice and smooth, no irritation.</li>
            <li> ;. I don&#x27;t believe their slogan could be any more</li>
            <li> This was able to glide over my face and give me an almost barber ship type result.</li>
            <li> but more of a three-way pivot.</li>
            <li> I do not however think that the 5 blades shave any better than 3</li>
            <li> I love the closeness of the shave from this razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get as many bumps and nicks with this razor either.</li>
            <li> I dread shaving most days,  I can keep talking about technology, design and fancy marketing words…</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it was a great product, that gave me a really close shave</li>
            <li> I received the razor from bzz agent to try and must say The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with Flex Ball is simply the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free, thank you Gillette for sending it out to me!</li>
            <li> My favorite aspect was the moisturizing aspect.</li>
            <li> The shaving gel helped make the shave seem as smooth as silk!  </li>
            <li> A nice way to start the morning off with a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> totally love it.</li>
            <li> Gel + Skin Care to my fingers that I was going to be enjoying a premium product.</li>
            <li> And, most importantly, the post-shave face-wash revealed neither a millimeter of hair nor a microliter of blood!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the prominent feature: the FlexBall.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a great price on the razor blade, sometimes much cheaper the retail stores.</li>
            <li> The Razor works better than most that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t knock any stars off of the review, as I&#x27;m sure without the oil, it would be a non-issue.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d have to say that this is the best razor that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my relationship with shaving has turned into love/love, as opposed to love</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> For the most part it seemed to make shaving quicker-</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using it and have continued to buy refills.</li>
            <li> so I figured what better time than now.</li>
            <li> I use this razor and love it.</li>
            <li> It holds to the contours of your face and leaves you baby smooth!  </li>
            <li> I just love how the Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball technology contoured every curve of my face.  </li>
            <li> Together with the fusion gel you couldn&#x27;t get a better shaving duo.</li>
            <li> love the ball</li>
            <li> The first time I used it on my legs, I was pretty impressed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on back is perfect for edging as well!</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> So, when offered a shot to try the latest Proglide, I had to take</li>
            <li> have discovered that in my case, that the best possible approach to shaving with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology and its blades, is to combine it with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> I love Gillette  </li>
            <li> Much better than the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; version (http://amzn.com/B00J3MPS4E )&lt;</li>
            <li> I can feel more pressure on my skin rather than the razor just making the turns with me.</li>
            <li> do I love this razor?  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think another razor would unseat the Gillette Fusion Power as my favorite, but this has.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is all I could ask for in a razor and more.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> The gillette Fusion Proglide is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I love the ergonomic design of this product.</li>
            <li> I love the vibration effect that the power razor has</li>
            <li> I have used manual razors for most of my life, and using electronic razors sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I love the close shave I get, and</li>
            <li> A nice smooth and shadow ridden shave.</li>
            <li> but that all many have just changed.  </li>
            <li> After i received a Fusion ProGlide Razor to try it a couple of months ago, i fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette products.</li>
            <li> I love the blades that are on this razor.</li>
            <li> Love this razor how well it shaves my face so close to the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat inclined to request more items use the term, &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; in their names, but I suspect it&#x27;s been copywritten by</li>
            <li> My husband used it to shave his face, as most men do, and he found it to be, &amp;#34;pretty good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> That Adds Up To More Efficiency,</li>
            <li> In Theory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette claims two improvements by making a more flexible razor.</li>
            <li> And it makes sense; if you’re able to shave more efficiently, of course you’ll get that hair that keeps growing between your nose and your cheek.</li>
            <li> ▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY razors and can never seem to get a close, even shave.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend also used it to shave her legs and said it was much better than her Venus razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a better shave.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this razor, after all I love the one I have been using.  </li>
            <li> but I do think that the ability to angle the head is helping to get a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why use 5 blades when just one will do the job better and faster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> acquainted myself with the razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective and precise.</li>
            <li> but it is for those who want an exceptional product that will get the job done well, and get it done quickly.</li>
            <li> From looks alone I was glad to give up the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok it works.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a superior razor and a great value.</li>
            <li> fusion proglide gets better and better.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and has a very premium build.</li>
            <li> If wasn&#x27;t for Gillete Fusion doing this promotion, I wouldn&#x27;t of been able to see how great their product really is.</li>
            <li> Gillette rebuilt shaving with the launch of the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology, and now it&#x27;s taken the best shave one step further by rebuilding the shave gel.</li>
            <li> I would use them over disposable bic razors that you find in bulk packs for sure.</li>
            <li> but I must say that this is a better product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie and say that this razor makes me look forward to shaving every day, but I will tell you that it leaves my face smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation!</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me one to try and I am so glad they did.  </li>
            <li> The Flexball technology is pivotal in getting a better shave(pun intended).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going in my travel bag for sure.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably why I wear a beard most of the time.  </li>
            <li> What more can a man ask for.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Skin Care has also been enjoyable to use.  </li>
            <li> they just cost more for the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> YI used it many times before it dulled.</li>
            <li> (I do not use a power handle) because I swear I get a better shave from the micro-comb the power heads have.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> The ball technology helps the blade move across the contours of your face with a more even stroke that seems to get just about every hair.  </li>
            <li> This razor is awesome, and it is the next step in razor technology.  </li>
            <li> and that was mostly my neck area.</li>
            <li> I received this a a free promo from Gillette!</li>
            <li> Face feels smooth as silk after!</li>
            <li> Also the top of the gel locks.</li>
            <li> and I love the way his face feels after.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but im glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> but like I said the difference is in the Flexball for sure.</li>
            <li> With the Gillette shave gel + skin care, the experience became a lot better.</li>
            <li> It hugged my face and stayed in contact more closely.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I was able to test this product.  </li>
            <li> After receiving this razor as part of an advanced preview, I can honestly say that this is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve used, and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> The most noticeable feature is of course the Flex Ball.</li>
            <li> I always enjoyed the blades</li>
            <li> I recently received the product on promotion from Gillette and was impressed.</li>
            <li> I love love this brand of razor.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor before and found after using it many times I have grown to like this razor.  </li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> The flexball makes for more maneuverability.  </li>
            <li> you can find the cartridges cheap, buy in bulk!</li>
            <li> This was better than my Schick.  </li>
            <li> I like the razor and i like the shave, but i honestly haven&#x27;t noticed that the ball makes a HUGE impact on my shave.</li>
            <li> It seems like most guys hold on to their ole trusty razor for years without considering replacing it.</li>
            <li> smooth shave that is nice and close.</li>
            <li> I love Gillette and all of there products</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this razr.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It contours to your face for a better shave.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that is so innovative and works</li>
            <li> I used to use Gillette razors, but stopped buying them when the price was more than $1.00 per blade.  </li>
            <li> While I love the razor, the blade, and all the features, the cost of each blade is still an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> though what is so much better with this razor then</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure it was a product that I would want to invest money in</li>
            <li> and I love Gillette.  </li>
            <li> love the weight of the metallic handle in my hand as well</li>
            <li> This razor stays on all the contours of my face and minimizes the number of times I need to go over places more than once.  </li>
            <li> I love gillette products.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> have used most of the Gillette razor varieties through the years, and this has the newest feature you never knew you needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 blades to much better for me and don’t clog as</li>
            <li> I received this from bzzagent for review and was extremely pleased with this razor, I have been using gillette razors for years, just didn&#x27;t see the need to upgrade to the flexball technology.</li>
            <li> genius at Gillette thought this would be appropriate to shave beneath the nose, around the mouth, and evening out sideburns?</li>
            <li> This seems to be more of a marketing item to get people to spend money on upgrading their razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the flexball...makes it easier to reach parts</li>
            <li> FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.</li>
            <li> All this should translate into not only the best shave ever, but smoothest as well,</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of heft to it, which allows for a confident, close shave.</li>
            <li> The flexball tecnology allows me to confidently traverse the countours of my face.</li>
            <li> Now like most of you</li>
            <li> I have seen this before many times and I thought maybe it would work</li>
            <li> The joint rotates more than I have ever needed but it makes a difference for me while shaving my jaw line and on to my neck.</li>
            <li> Many of the advertisements seem to say you can use a blade for two weeks.</li>
            <li> and I think I will try one more, then check the blade for changing.</li>
            <li> If you shave a lot, you will love this razor.</li>
            <li> I enjoying this razor.</li>
            <li> I always knew Gillette is one of the top makers for men&#x27;s grooming products in the market, so I was already optimistic about this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, the ProGlide is an awesome razor.  </li>
            <li> The packaging has been redesigned so you can&#x27;t cut yourself on the blister pack...and the razor itself is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the shave and the shave gel had been outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the ball makes it contour my face to give me a close shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette has been a household brand for many years now.</li>
            <li> The gel is much better.</li>
            <li> Together they are a winning combination.</li>
            <li> I love putting the shave gel on in the morning after a shower and feeling the cooling sensation hit my face.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology free from Gillette and in exchange I would give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> if he does, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette for years and have always enjoyed them as they work as desired.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and no issues here!</li>
            <li> And to put it simply, this razor is one of the best ones I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I also liked how comfortable the handle felt and sat in my hand when using it.</li>
            <li> andI think they provide a much better shave than any manual razor.</li>
            <li> So while I like this razor, I think it would be that much better if it was battery</li>
            <li> This razor was generously provided to me by the lovely people at Gillette to try.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I tried this gel.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Definitely good and worth the money, but didn&#x27;t go &amp;#34;above and beyond&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I Love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Technology and</li>
            <li> I have tried others but nothing else gives me a closer or better shave than a Gillette Razor.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> All in all this set is really nice and any man would enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love how the rubber grip handle doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> I almost always get a cut or knick and have patches that no razor seems to be able to cut.  </li>
            <li> A must try for all shavers including ones who think that their&#x27;s is better.</li>
            <li> but it really does feel great in your hand.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s start with the prominent feature: the FlexBall.</li>
            <li> It costs much more, but if you&#x27;re in a hurry, it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> So all in all im glad o was finally able to add it to my collection.</li>
            <li> Now if they could make a blade that lasts longer here, I&#x27;d be in love.  </li>
            <li> I love Gillette razors because I am susceptible to razor bumps and have been able to avoid them since I switched.  </li>
            <li> Right when I picked up this razor, I loved the feel of it ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a good razor… just not the right one for my face, but I will admit I am picky.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth and leaves a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Very quick and easy way to shave!</li>
            <li> Very unique.</li>
            <li> Make sure to get the shave gel as well for that close shave and the new close top gels makes me happy because it stops the loss of gel even after I am done using it.  </li>
            <li> The razor gave me a really nice clean shave .</li>
            <li> The razor has a cool design and a nice handle for gripping and control.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor is a quality razor and gives a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> I really have to say this razor was pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> , I got a great shave from my older Fusion.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide, which I received without charge through the Amazon Vine Program, promises much (“Responds to contours for our best shave,” “Less tug and pull for incredible comfort”).</li>
            <li> After using this I can say that it delivers a smooth, even shave every time, and is very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The handle is very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The Flexball makes it very easy to maneuver for smooth curves for any design.</li>
            <li> The gel quickly produces a rich lather and imparts a pleasant cooling sensation on application.</li>
            <li> happy with this razor - highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more than happy with this new FlexBall addition to the razor.</li>
            <li> The shave gel was easy to apply, smelled great and aided in the fast shave.  </li>
            <li> with the 2-1 shaving cream (which has an extremely pleasant scent), the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Razor and shaving cream are absolutely a recommendation I can gladly make.</li>
            <li> It provides a very clean shave, and I did not experience any nicks or cuts on my face while using the product.</li>
            <li> When manually moving the head, it does move very smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try this great product for free.</li>
            <li> This has given the best shave that he has had in a long time.</li>
            <li> The handle is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The gel is pretty good.</li>
            <li> it’s a pretty good idea.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this razor to absolutely anyone looking for a nice shave!</li>
            <li> handle and flexball felt pretty good</li>
            <li> However my review is honest and true.</li>
            <li> for the shaving that this blade provides, it is what you would (and should) expect, a good consistent shave that does not slice your face off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good shave</li>
            <li> This is a great new razor from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I love the flexball handle, even on my legs it makes it easy to work over the tougher areas, like my knees and the backs of my ankles.</li>
            <li> I love how it can easily get around the curves of my face and can&#x27;t wait to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I love how easily this glides across my skin without any pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li> I love this razor as I have used it three times already and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I received Ocean Breeze and it had a nice mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful, it really does rotate and adapt to your face to make shaving a much easier task without all the worry.</li>
            <li> , Awesome not only did the gel smooth my skin</li>
            <li> I was naturally intrigues by this one, and the great guys at Bzzagent made sure I got one.</li>
            <li> They also clean out very easily and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> However, I do remember my first impression of the razor, and I have to say, &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; This razor has a great metal design, and, in my opinion, very eye catching.</li>
            <li> however this is by far the best Razor on the market right now.</li>
            <li> Compared to many other brands Gillette just is the best.</li>
            <li> It is great with all new technology it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and it gives me a nice, smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li> Gave me a nice smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li> It gave a nice smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li> would rate it very good and will use it as my daily razor.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very good razor and shaving gel</li>
            <li> This led to a quicker, cleaner, and more accurate shave.</li>
            <li> As part of the latest BzzAgent campaign, I was given the opportunity to try this product free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I love my Norelco because it provides a smooth, close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love the ProGlide for its smooth, non-irritating shave.  </li>
            <li> Replacement cartridges are pricey, but my masochistic love affair with the cheap razors is over.  </li>
            <li> I love how this razor hugs the contours of my face to give me a close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Well i got to try this product for free and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> After reaching up and feeling scruff for months on end, it was refreshing to feel incredibly smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Either way, I am very happy with the product, as I mentioned before, have been using it for a long time for it is the more convenient and effective method to shave without taking too much time to do it.</li>
            <li> BzzAgent provided me with a free Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball (manual), and I love it.  </li>
            <li> so I jumped at the chance to be able to try their newest Flexball razor for free through Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the most important thing for</li>
            <li> I love this razor, it is smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the way the handle is design and the way the razor glides so smoothly over my face.</li>
            <li> and I was even able to shave comfortably WITHOUT shaving cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had better results getting a smooth shave using the manual razors rather than the electic razors.  </li>
            <li> I take free samples - LOVE</li>
            <li> Glad I got it from Bzzagent for free.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free promotion from Gillette, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a free promotion from Gillette, but I must say its one of the better manual razors that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This razor allows me to shave a lot quicker since i am able to move smoothly around edges.</li>
            <li> I have consistently used Gillette razors because the build quality is superb - the handle is sturdy and solid and the gel strip ensures a smooth shave and provides a nice indicator of when it is time to change cartridge.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> From the Gillette Company, I was able to get and test this product for free.  </li>
            <li> I have found using an electric razor to be an easier more comfortable shave</li>
            <li> It made shaving so much more smooth, and easier than ever.</li>
            <li> It my experience that added feature makes the shave even more smooth.</li>
            <li> So far I have to say its a great blade</li>
            <li> The FlexBall technology helps when shaving under your neck leading up to your chin for a more precise shave.</li>
            <li> Skin Care was not messy or gooey which was great for not cleaning my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was able to try their Fusion Proglide Manual Razor with Flexball Technology for free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care so much about the flex ball since I seem to get good</li>
            <li> It really makes my face feel good when shaving.  </li>
            <li> Besides for that, it is basically a good manual razor that keeps your skin taught and blades moving without much tugging.</li>
            <li> It gives a very clean shave, very smooth, works great on coarse hair like mine, and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> This razor really does live up to the hype, and I&#x27;m very happy with the decision to get it.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with this new razor.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, this razor is still treating me right, and is as great a shave as the first time.</li>
            <li> So I tried it right out of the box and let me tell you; the flex ball technology is nice.</li>
            <li> But the razor is great on its own because not only does it flex in the right way, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold while shaving because of the rubber grips, size and shape of the handle.</li>
            <li> This was free as a promotion and it is the best shave I have had in a long time!!</li>
            <li> It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> time I was more excited to try this product than ever before.</li>
            <li> … Is the Fusion ProGlide any better than the original Gillette Fusion???  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they kept it working with original handle.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and the flexball is a unique and interesting idea for a razor.  </li>
            <li> My face has a lot of sharp edges and this razor does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been true to my brands over the years (hats off to you my trusty disposable dollar razor!)</li>
            <li> the Fusion ProGlide any better than the original Gillette Fusion???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me it did not offer a measurably better shave than the original ProGlide.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a unique twisting top that blocks the opening</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially compared to the DSC, I don&#x27;t have to shave several times to get a very good, smooth feel.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that if you get razor burn easily.</li>
            <li> I have yet to cut my face with this blade and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truth is that it helps with shave but don&#x27;t expect any breakthrough or more clean shave because of FlexBall</li>
            <li> and it worked its magic to get me clean shaven in under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The razor easily contours itself to your face as you use it.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily clean it out though.</li>
            <li> Easily cuts my beard in one stroke.  </li>
            <li> The easy flexing of this  handle does not provide any benefit.</li>
            <li> Its easy on my face.</li>
            <li> It just really easy to shave around the bumps and contours of your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The precision trimmer is noticeable better at trimming hairs, including semi-long ones, and also washes clean easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold &amp; contoured well in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I started shaving using my father’s razor, an old-fashioned one blade model that was easy to load (just spin the handle and the top opened up) and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The shave is easy and effortless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll make it easy for you-</li>
            <li> Not an easy task.  </li>
            <li> Its basically a more comfortable, efficient and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This feature makes shaving easy, the Flex Ball moves to the shape of your face and will take the hurtle of cheek to under your chin like a pro.</li>
            <li> I found out very quickly that it was not the case.</li>
            <li> The ergonomic design of the handle made it easy to grip.</li>
            <li> It glides to every curve on my face, and the grip of the handles makes it so easy to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> razor is lightweight and easy to transport wherever you need to go.</li>
            <li> It seems to fit my hand much more comfortably.</li>
            <li> Clogs easily if I don&#x27;t shave for a day or</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can easily say that this product meets both of these requirements.  </li>
            <li> I like the blades and how easy it is to rinse out.</li>
            <li> The heft and feel of the handle make it easy to maintain contact without digging in.  </li>
            <li> The ball joint allows the head to swivel easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering how many shaves you get per blade, this will certainly be more economical than my Quatro blades.</li>
            <li> more shave swipes before you have to clean it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and handles like a charm.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to use and glides well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to hold, even in the shower.</li>
            <li> the sample that I received came in “Active Sport” scent, which is an awesome aroma.  </li>
            <li> But not too strong to irritate while shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - This is a strong four star shave.</li>
            <li> The proglide gel is also strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I strongly suggest that you give him the Flexball razor and 2 in 1 shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I have to admit its the coolest lookin razor, very easy to use, fun.</li>
            <li> it smelled great very fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li> Overall an amazing product for an amazing price to give you the most convenient, easy and smooth shave right from your home for an amazing cost.</li>
            <li> I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> The Razor has great grip and fits comfortably into my hand,i like the design it is simple yet appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever I can shave and it&#x27;s looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the razor, it is a smooth shave and is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was kind of leery at first</li>
            <li> flexibility of the moving head is the main difference and while it had a good feel and seemed smooth and easy to handle</li>
            <li> Plus the lubrastrip basically melts away in the presence of warm water during the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but more than</li>
            <li> I have always used Gillettes razors because I feel like they have always been the superior product on the market and have always been available at a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I love the handle of this particular razor for the amazing grip it provides with the rubber like handle.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best manual razor i ever used.</li>
            <li> In particular, it was more effective below my nose and along my jawline, which is area where I often have missed hairs.</li>
            <li> Gillette is hands down the best razor in the market today.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Flexball because it really does fulfill what it is advertised to do and offers a comfortable shave, primarily because of the flexball technology and ergonomic design.</li>
            <li> The razor cartridges are just as good as I&#x27;ve come to expect, nothing new there.  </li>
            <li> I was tentative to try something new, but wanted to give it a fair shake.  </li>

            <li> Fusion ProGlide razor with flexball technology is an excellent over previous razor.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, Gillette included a coupon for $5 off replacement cartridges (4 or more)</li>

            <li> The shave is smooth to the point where I was in disbelief that hair was being removed from my face until I looked in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth in one stroke.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really smooth.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball is an extraordinarily smooth razor.  </li>

            <li> Love this razor really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to mention that the razor was given to me free by an ad marketing campaign (bzzagent.com).</li>
            <li> I had been using the one without the Flex Ball, until Gillette sent me this one for free to try out.  </li>
            <li> The shave was smooth, not after burn or rashes.</li>
            <li> the swivel works great, however if you have a chubby face such as myself...</li>
            <li> I liked that you can flip up the top portion to use the top blade as a straight-edge, but have found the moisturizing strip to not work as well as it did several years back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me this and their 2in1 Shave Gel to try out for free.</li>
            <li> I received this in a kit from BzzAgent for free so that I could review it and spread the word on the product&#x27;s qualities.  </li>
            <li> I have been free of sensitivity and razor burn since I started using this razor.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, and it FEELS close-</li>
            <li> By itself it doesn&#x27;t a LOT, but it does add just enough to the experience to give you a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I did receive the product free from Gillette and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great shave, especially around my adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li> together they leave your face feeling smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how companies like Gillette and their competition started adding more blades, extra gizmos and gimmicks, and more all trying to set themselves apart.</li>
            <li> The shave itself is smooth and close as you would hope it would be with a million blades.</li>
            <li> I now have a beard and only shave my neck, and this razor&#x27;s great for just that.  </li>

            <li> I am trying this product free from Gillette.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one was smooth and did not pull hairs as it went.</li>
            <li> is really important.  </li>
            <li> For someone like me who wants to look his best at all times it&#x27;s important to me to be properly lined up , the fusion proglide accomplishes this with its edging blade.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really enjoy that.</li>
            <li> I got one of these free from Gillette to review.</li>
            <li> I own many different razors but the Fusion model is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> Let me start with I got this product for free through bzzagent.</li>
            <li> But then I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor free as part of a promotion from Gillette and now shaving is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a promotion as a BzzAgent and this is a fantastic razor.  </li>
            <li> and I think the Fusion before that and this Flexball model gives you the same GREAT shave.  </li>
            <li> NO, my opinion is that I don&#x27;t see the advantage of the Flexball as of my 2nd shave, did I get a great close shave?</li>
            <li> the Razor Gillette included a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor for free as part of a promotion run by Gillette through BzzAgent to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for all the reasons I noted above, this is a great razor, battery-powered or not.</li>
            <li> story short, its great.  </li>
            <li> It just felt so good and natural that I couldn&#x27;t resist to share it with my coworkers.</li>
            <li> The front and aft tilt is more than enough for a good shave.</li>
            <li> I have had the chance to use it twice thus far and in both time after thinking I had a good close shave, upon washing off, it&#x27;s not quite done.  </li>
            <li> So for me the razor is good but not quite near perfection yet.</li>
            <li> Ok so i don&#x27;t really do that many reviews on products.</li>
            <li> so I tend to just uses and good old fashion 3 blade</li>
            <li> : The most notable and important feature that separates this razor from the rest is the FlexBall Technology, so it comes as no surprise that this innovation really stands out.</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised at how good it was.</li>
            <li> You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting.</li>
            <li> This new flex ball technology is pretty great too.  </li>
            <li> I just used this new one for the first time today and it worked great.</li>
            <li> did receive this as a special promotion but the price for the blade and gel is easily within my price range</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overal, the Gillette Fusion Proglide is a very good razor - sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li> believe the two most important things when it comes to shaving is a great lubricating cream/gel/soap and an incredibly sharp blade.  </li>
            <li> The pivoting head makes sure just the right amount of pressure is applied and the weight of the handle allows for the razor to do the work for you.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this razor, top notch!</li>
            <li> I feel like i have a baby face and received many positive comments from females!</li>
            <li> The foam is thicker and stickier than most, leaving strings as you pull away and dropping some while applying but other then that, great performance.</li>
            <li> The first was/is a Norelco electric shaver, which is fine and does a good job and is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> The razor overall is very nice</li>
            <li> The shaving gel was easy to use and I really liked the new structure that didn&#x27;t require a cap.  </li>
            <li> The razor is a good shave but not really any better but definitely not worse than the older one, so a good buy if you need a new razor, and the shaving gel is great from container to scent and providing a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It contours perfectly to your face which not only makes it possible to easily get to every hair, but it also shaves them more evenly and closer.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that this razor is worth changing out from the original Fusion Proglide!</li>
            <li> I have a clean smooth shave like never before.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a really smooth clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I bleed super easy and even after using this four times no blood.</li>
            <li> I also went 7 days without shaving and it still was a quick easy shave without the tugging and pulling of the longer whiskers.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor free thanks for Gillette!</li>
            <li> I love how this leaves my skin baby smooth virtually on the first pass and the way the head of the razor moves with the contours of my face</li>
            <li> The overall shave was very smooth and the way the razor glides around the corners of my face makes it an impressive improvement over the traditional razors.</li>
            <li> Best shave I have ever had made blade slid with very little effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved how easy it was to open the plastic casing.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the process is smooth and pleasant.</li>
            <li> really helps the razor to glide more easily around the face.</li>
            <li> I seem to be able to get about 5 good shaves out of a single razor cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Initial impression on these items, definitely impressed and know that I&#x27;ll most likely look for these shaving gels for replace..</li>
            <li> so far i am very pleased and will continue using this</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me this razor to review and honestly, I am not disappointed in the slightest.</li>
            <li> I found a small amout of the gel went along way and provided some of the best protection I have every received from shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Sent is cool smooth and makes the Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology glide over face and skin with no razor burn,</li>
            <li> I love them both, but I give the flexball the higher rating.</li>
            <li> But the blade of the proglide razor is definitely friendly towards your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Schick Hydro 5 for the past couple of years and thought that it was the best shave out there.  </li>
            <li> Replacement blades are a bit pricey, but well worth the cost for a repeatably close shave every time!  </li>
            <li> I got to try this shaver free thanks to gillette and in my opinion its the best shaver i used it glides smoothly across my skin and dont sutter on my beard like other shavers</li>
            <li> , I was enlightened by switching to double edge safety razors and my eyes were opened to how pleasurable, smooth, relaxing, and comfortable a good shave can be.  </li>
            <li> My husband was excited when I showed him what came from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> The FlexBall technology does make a significant difference and the difference is felt shave after shave.  </li>
            <li> The fact is that this is the first razor, and I have tried many, that has provided me a close shave with no burn.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s better, is that you really cannot beat the price Amazon is offering!</li>
            <li> give this two thumbs up and for the price this is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> The Gillete Fusion ProGlide is definitely worth checking out!</li>
            <li> He was excited to switch to another model for variety.  </li>
            <li> First off, Gillette sent me this razor FREE to test it out for them!</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide manual razor through bzz agent courtesy of Gillette and of course was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure, I received the product free from Gillette as part of a promotional offer, but I still believe in the razor and its blades.&lt;br /&gt;#sponsored.</li>
            <li> and I was really excited when I was offered to try out this product.</li>
            <li> Loved that the Fusion ProGlide was smooth and provided a comfortable shave especially when I used it with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> For me, it is ok and can fill a slot in my razor arsenal for a quick, mild shave, but it simply doesn&#x27;t compare to a good safety razor.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor has a very good blade that delivers a smooth shave even after two weeks of heavy use.  </li>
            <li> However it has a nice design and new features as the cap lock and the level indicator.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Weight and grip of the razor felt solid and good, not plasticky or cheap.  </li>
            <li> When all is said and done, I have a clean shaven face with no cuts or nicks.</li>
            <li> I received this free as part of a promotion and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it is.</li>
            <li> today, I work as a Firefighter and we have to be clean shaven since I had to work in the morning</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin feeling clean but not irritated.</li>
            <li> but Gillette is my go to brand for close and clean shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is great and definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lately, I&#x27;ve just been using the Proglides for a &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; shave, or to clean up after an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone that wants a rash free most comfy shave of any part of the body.</li>
            <li> I used the sensitive shave gel and was more than pleased.</li>
            <li> also used the Flexball (!) razor with somewhat more enthusiastic results.</li>
            <li> As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have never used a razor with more than three blades, the last being a Gilette Mach 3 Turbo, which I still own and use on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> so I could clean up my face when the Proglide razor failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> today, I work as a Salesman and we have to be clean shaven since I had to work in the morning</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it for free Thanks for Gillette.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate that the nozzle stays clean and the canister doesn&#x27;t rust.  </li>
            <li> , I got a clean close shave with no bleeding or nics.  </li>
            <li> With the Fusion Proglide, the area would be clean with one to two passes of the razor.</li>
            <li> Sure, the lubricating strip is gone after the first head shave, but the razor blades themselves lasted a full 5 head shaves before I had to change the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> The flex ball helps get you a closer shave and the blades cut cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li> shave was quick, close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Mach 3, for whatever reason, is also easier to clean between swipes</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Through BzzAgent and Gillette, I tried Gillette&#x27;s Alpine Clean 2-in-1 Gel and Flexball Razor and found both to make shaving a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I give my razor a quick rinse before each pass and that helps keep the blades free of hair and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I am not sold that the swivel head really made much of a difference, but the razor was a good one...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think a single person, at work, cared at all that my wife was happy with the results from this razor, at all.</li>
            <li> The new Gillette shave gel allows for a very cool and refreshing shave as well.</li>
            <li> At first the steep angle of the blades threw me off, but overall its a great razor and results in a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette, I can safely say, offers the best blades, offering little to non existent tugging and pulling you would experience from cheap, disposable razors.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this new razor is that it has a good weight to it.  </li>
            <li> My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li> My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever used thanks to its new flex-ball technology.</li>
            <li> have a full beard and mustache, but I keep my neck and cheekbones clean cut, so I don&#x27;t have any experience with the razor on my cheeks/chin/etc.</li>
            <li> I got this razor from the fine folks at Gillette and got to say it&#x27;s worth the fuss.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very fresh and exactly what I would imagine based on the name, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> have found the RIGHT razor for me!  </li>
            <li> Was I right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap but this shouldn&#x27;t discourage those of you who are willing to make the investment!  </li>
            <li> The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling clean in soft with a nice scent</li>
            <li> This razor is especially good going around contours and getting hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> The piveting head is awesome for getting around those hard areas.</li>
            <li> Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is a very good razor, I love the textured handle, the grip feels great in your hands and allows you to get a really close shave in hard to reach areas such as your neck, chin and around the lips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also trying the product for free thanks to Gillette which is very cool</li>
            <li> I did not see that the swivel feature made a great deal of difference in comfort, and in some cases, it made it harder to reach beard hair in dimpled areas of the lower chin.</li>
            <li> As expected, this newest razor continues the trend of great shaving products.</li>
            <li> I have been using mostly Gillette products for the better of a decade and more, and so far I have grown accustomed to using this particular shaver, which I guess makes me loyal to the brand.</li>
            <li> But to me, a smooth shave that does not hurt my skin is worth the price premium.</li>
            <li> I had a full caveman beard going on for a while</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave often and when I do I really want it to be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> Is it really that much better than the razor I have been using?</li>
            <li> The gliding action on your face is really nice.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love that its much cheaper than the razor geared toward women.</li>
            <li> I switch full time from my Mach Three?</li>
            <li> It looks really cool.</li>
            <li> I love how the razor feels in my hands, its very lightweight and the flexball allows the razor to bend around my neck and chin areas.  </li>
            <li> It really knows how to contour to my face, which by the way has many ups and downs.  </li>
            <li> Overall both the razor and gel is a good product.</li>
            <li> I like this version much better, the vibrations really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Despite receiving it for free, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> What is incontrovertible is that this razor provides the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever encountered, even better than Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3, which was my former reference</li>
            <li> but it feels a lot better and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; as much when I shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this razor to anyone who doesn&#x27;t use a full featured electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Loved it, never went back!  </li>
            <li> The razor has a good weight and the comfortable handle stays secure even when wet.  </li>
            <li> I like my safety razors more just because they get much closer and are cheaper, but these are satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li> It also leaves a cool feeling on your skin after use.</li>
            <li> If you have a more chizzled face this would work really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for sending me this razor to try for free!</li>
            <li> Full Disclosure</li>
            <li> True test will be the longevity of the blades and the cost of refills.  </li>
            <li> I like this razor much better because it makes cleaning out the blades much easier.</li>
            <li> Dollar Shave Club blades will be good enough -  until I decide I want the luxurious shave provided by the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor.</li>
            <li> However, upon using it, I found it to be the most versatile razor I had ever used in my whole life.</li>
            <li> so that was cool.</li>
            <li> I say so far I&#x27;m loving the blade.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette, I got to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> I was absolutely 100% pleased with this Gillette Fusion Proglide razor.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> These replaceable razors usually last a good six weeks before you have to change them, sometimes longer.</li>
            <li> The flexball technology was really cool and allowed for the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Simply because that version exists and is superior in every way to this razor, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor will never get five stars in my book.</li>
            <li> And the prize is not bad for this razor either.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> Sure it looks cool, but I couldn&#x27;t feel a difference and can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s superior to any of the previous Gillette proglide razors.</li>
            <li> I got a free trial of the new razor and love it.</li>
            <li> I was recently able to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall technology free from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed my new ProGlide razor that Gillette provided to me free of charge for my opinion.</li>
            <li> so I continue to get a closer, more comfortable shave with each new product.</li>
            <li> It was seamless and gentle and pleasant, even.</li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s latest razor is a good upgrade to their previous razors.</li>
            <li> The results were impressive, although I still believe a straight razor is much less time consuming and the shave is closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The absolutely no mess at this point is nice as well.</li>
            <li> This razor is great, that rolling ball really helps with getting in there better than other razors do.</li>
            <li> I love this shave its clean, smooth, and pretty much gets every area of my face.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive neck area that always gives me problems, but I have had great luck with the ProGLide so far.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide after Gillette sent me a free one to try and I will say I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Very smooth, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Sure, they won&#x27;t give you the same shave as a safety razor or straight razor, but this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> My skin on my face tends to be very sensitive and for years I have searched for the perfect razor that will assist me with getting a great barbershop shave but also caressing my skin enough that I will not break out or have a raw experience after shaving.  </li>
            <li> but there were other great features about the ProGlide razor.  </li>
            <li> Bzzagent was kind enough to grant me my very first for this review, and I thank them wholeheartedly for that!</li>
            <li> I really like the new football technology, it allows for a nice smooth shave that moves with the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> The improvements are subtle, but impressive.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty fine razor in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This razor has always caught my attention every time I passed by the mens care section at the super market.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I don&#x27;t think I was quite able to take advantage of the pivoting feature of this particular handle.  </li>
            <li> If I am able to shave more often, then I can be content with a close enough shave rather than needing that super close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used many razors in my life but this is the first to not leave any cuts after the first 3 uses.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t replaced the head yet, which I&#x27;ve used over a dozen times and it should be good for a few more shaves.</li>
            <li> I am now a loyal Gillette consumer for life.</li>
            <li> If and when they combine the two into one super razor, I would give that product 6 stars.  </li>
            <li> My shave was so quick and efficient</li>
            <li> When I was in the mood for a quick shave I used the Norelco, when I was looking for a closer cut I would use the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I need a razor that works well and quickly gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> So naturally when I tried this product, I was expecting a good shave, but really because of the pricey razor blades</li>
            <li> The razor have 5 blades that help with the quick shave that is sometimes needed in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> The bending head, the heavy handle, and the trimming blade are all wonderful aspects that are still in place and should be appreciated.  </li>
            <li> Instead of going over an area several times form several different directions trying to get an even cut, I was able to just go over the top of my head once and things were perfect.</li>
            <li> A quick summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was lucky to get it.</li>
            <li> it was a quick shave.</li>
            <li> Then the razor just makes quick work of whatever growth I have going on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the powered razors for sometime and found this transition very easy and can see myself replacing my old Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li> I rate it right there with the original Fusion.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a top of the line razor but not at gold prices.</li>
            <li> It works smoothly, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> As usual the presentation was very good.</li>
            <li> The best part is I don&#x27;t have to make multiple passes across my face as its cut down my total time for shaving while still giving me great results.</li>
            <li> It provides an amazingly close shave without the nicks or redness generally associated with close shaves.</li>
            <li> I received this for free as a promotion from Gillette, thanks!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just my skin, but I still get a tad of razor burn afterwards - although better than normal razors.  </li>
            <li> I really liked both the Shave gel and the razor, the shave gel had a nice smell and left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> After all, those faces are pretty important.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how incredibly smooth my face felt after using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> The first is that you’ll miss 20% fewer hairs on your face, which for the hirsute is something fairly important.</li>
            <li> The mobile head allowing the razor to turn more laterally at different angles is nice, but again isn&#x27;t something that you absolutely have to have either.</li>
            <li> First, the handle is a bit too light for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product as a free sample from Gillette, and it was not the first Gillette razor I had used.  </li>
            <li> I first want to disclose that I received this razor free through a promotion from Gillette and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I normally use an electric razor and I get much better results with my electric razor.</li>
            <li> I received this for free as a promotion from Gillette - Thanks!</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy and has rubber grooves that prevent the razor from slipping out of your hand when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by how the razor was able to shave my beard with minimal tugging and afterwards, I felt no irritation on my face.</li>
            <li> This newer development on the trustworthy Proglide series, is without a doubt a step on the right direction, without trying to say that is way much better to the previous model, it is slightly better, feels more manageable and somehow, even sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The razor produced a pretty good shave and left my skin feeling clean and fresh without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I credit the lubrication strip included on the cartridges as well as the new shave gel which goes on smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks  for keeping it clean + comfortable.</li>
            <li> so this razor does very well, leaving me a smooth and clean looking.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that I am razor burn free and enjoying a smooth face for the first time in a long long time.</li>
            <li> I would like to give a special thanks to buzz agent which i am a member of and allowing me to try this product, and also thanks to gillette for creating a fine product!</li>
            <li> This can be attributed to the very sharp razors and the flexball the allows the razor to keep great contact to the contours on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was able to try the product for free due to a campaign by Gillette, and I am thoroughly satisfied with the razor.</li>
            <li> Every new &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; they come up with they change the connector of the blade, so if you are thinking you are going to use your favorite (and cheaper)</li>
            <li> so I can go stock up on blades for what appears to be her new favorite razor.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite razor from Gillette, and I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them over the years.  </li>
            <li> This Gillette razor is my new favorite choice</li>
            <li> This new Proglide is the latest incarnation of this marketing campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the new Fusion Razor.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try the sensitive gel and the Fusion Pro Glide Razor to see if I could finally get a nice close shave, irritation free....</li>
            <li> And again, the weight and look of the new razor is so amazing that I&#x27;m more than willing to let go of my old one</li>
            <li> Easy to hold thanks to the  matte</li>
            <li> Rinsing the razor was pleasant as well, as I noticed not the slightest clogging as I&#x27;d expected with the 4 blades, and longer stubble.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best disposable shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I got the same results which is exactly what I am looking for in a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin most razor</li>
            <li> The fact that this was free is not the reason for my positive review.</li>
            <li> first comments were &amp;#34;Wow!  </li>
            <li> You keep saying to yourself, &amp;#34; Coleman this can&#x27;t possibly get more awesome!&amp;#34; BUT IT CAN!</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, I don&#x27;t mind shaving!  </li>
            <li> These two as a tag team makes my life of shaving a whole lot beter!!</li>
            <li> It is such an easy, smooth, close shave!</li>
            <li> Flexball handle is really a nice upgrade from the previous version allowing the razor to swivel and flex even more than before.</li>
            <li> However, the upgraded blades were amazing, and I made sure to bounce back and forth between new blades of the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor.  </li>
            <li> Paired with pre-shaving oil and the shaving gel, it&#x27;s a pretty clean shave.</li>
            <li> This was to be expected, but a bit more impressive as I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days, as I&#x27;d previously noted.</li>
            <li> Great razor, gives a very close shave and there was not very much irritation.</li>
            <li> At first I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but after first try I quickly changed my mind.  </li>
            <li> The fusion proglide razor was easy to use with the cool new pivot head leaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, nice idea and pretty design but not any better than other razors on the market.</li>
            <li> I put in the new HQ8 replacement blades since the original HQ177 blades are no longer available.  </li>
            <li> While using the safety razor took a little more time, I was enjoying the process and felt comfortable with the savings I had found.</li>
            <li> im trying the product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I did receive the product free as a trial thanks to Gillette.</li>

            <li> Afterwards your face will be baby smooth and smell like a real man.</li>
            <li> Really liking the Flexball as it provides a smooth, and effortless shave and glides across my skin without any hassle.</li>
            <li> This swivel motion really allows all of the blades to squarely cut all whiskers and leave a remarkably smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge advocate for using straight edge razors when shaving.</li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>

            <li> : I am trying this product free thanks to Gillette.</li>

            <li> Got to try this free from BzzAgent thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> It is amazing what all you can get used to when it becomes part of your daily routine.  </li>
            <li> *Received product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> It moves from my cheek to my throat in one smooth stroke and takes absolutely all of the hair on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I am trying the product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I am a Bzzagent and tried this product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette and Bzz Agent, I was given one of these for free to try.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and was offered to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li> After getting my Fusion ProGlide Razor from Gillette, for free thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent&#x27;s partnership, I have not stopped using it.</li>
            <li> It gives you a really close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this razor as much as I do any Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> I got to try it free thanks to BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave gel that goes with this razor is pretty sweet as well.</li>
            <li> I can say now that it isn&#x27;t useful for me.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li> I received this razor and a can of alpine fresh shave gel free thanks to a promotion from Gillette and Amazon.</li>
            <li> razor is well worth it.</li>
            <li> The Proglide handle feels great in my hand and has a nice weight to it, not too heavy but enough</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice if you have to rush through a shave to know that a once over will be enough.</li>
            <li> As a point of comparison I did switch between my old razor, and this was notably faster and</li>
            <li> Its worth the money and the experience</li>
            <li> and this is by far my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice start in the fusion line but not something that I would switch to from my regular fusion razor.</li>
            <li> By doing it this way I take most of the larger part of the job, and I finish the job with this highly competent newer version of a very reliable method of shaving.</li>
            <li> It still wasn&#x27;t worth the time an effort to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Now after trying I can tell that it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is worth every cent for this razor and it&#x27;s replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I must say, Gillette is never a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The razor itself gets close enough to leave me shadow free through most of the day.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced.</li>
            <li> It does a MUCH better job than an electric razor ever could, but because of the multiple blades it does it much more quickly than a disposable razor or an older single-blade razor could ever do.  </li>
            <li> As it turns out, this upgrade is worth the buzz - but not just because of the &#x27;Flexball&#x27; business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> applied a healthy amount of Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Skin gel to my beard.</li>
            <li> same smooth results but more comfort because of the flex ball.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the ProGlide works per what it is supposed to do, and if you are a cartridge razor user, it is definitely worth giving a shot.  </li>
            <li> Way better than my old MACH 3.</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised about how different and great this razor is.  </li>
            <li> Gillette was kind enough to send me this as a promotion.</li>
            <li> and I love the results so far.</li>
            <li> The way that the razor conformed to my face made this one of the most comfortable shaves ever, not to mention each subsequent shave.</li>
            <li> I received the product complimentary to try from Gillette.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money to buy.  </li>
            <li> Gillette says that this razor has the thinnest blades they have ever used, and that FlexBall technology is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I had three days worth of stubble</li>
            <li> I kept waiting for the newness and cool factor of the flex ball to wear off, and three weeks in, for the first time since I can remember, I don&#x27;t look at shaving as a chore.</li>
            <li> , I LOVE the Proglide--but don&#x27;t see that the Flexball Handle works really any better than the regular model.</li>
            <li> As far as the flexball goes, for me it was okay.</li>
            <li> liked the tingling, cooling, fresh feeling left by the Gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ProGlide Razor was fun to use and flowed with every bump and turn on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this product for free thanks to Gillette, and since I&#x27;ve started using it, I have gotten the best shave I have had in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> However, I received a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall in the mail to try from Fusion and so far, this is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lo and behold, I received a Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball Technology as part of a promotion from Gillette and I thought that it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I was not afraid of hurting my face.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the five blades provided a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> I am more of an old school razor type person.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more of cartridge refills and will hold on to the Fusion ProGlide as my primary razor.</li>
            <li> This will be the last razor I ever own</li>
            <li> Gillette was kind enough to include me in a promotion where I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor.  </li>
            <li> The flex ball is useful since I shave my face and and my head.  </li>
            <li> The blades are what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Gillette - high quality and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> One swipe of the blades gives a very good cut resulting in me being able to get a smooth shave in a lot less time than with previous razors.</li>
            <li> For me personally, this comes in handy, because being right handed</li>
            <li> I did figure out pretty quick how to hold it to disable the swivel feature though</li>
            <li> This particular razor was sent to me for free to try for my Gillette BzzAgent Campaign &amp; I must say, it is worth every penny that you pay in stores or online.</li>
            <li> I got a clean shave with minimal razor burn, which honestly, could have been avoided if I had a shorter beard.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, I have to go over areas multiple times to clean it up even if it&#x27;s just stubble.</li>
            <li> The reason why the shave is so good is that the blades are placed closer together than other razor blade</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide products for a while now (3 in 1 ProGlide Styler, the Original ProGlide Manual and ProGlide Power Razor) and just got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide FlexBall Manual razor as a promotional item and really like it.    </li>
            <li> I think that the idea of this type of razor was a good one, maybe it worked for other people.</li>
            <li> i have used all the major brands but Gillette fusion proglide razors are by far superior.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to try this product free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I love that in the trial pack you get a coupon for refills it helps keep the cost down on such a great product.</li>
            <li> After all, our vacuums have them, right?  </li>
            <li> It follows the contours of my face just right because of the flexball technology.</li>
            <li> Who in their right mind will use this razor and try to shave sideways to make the ball pivot?</li>
            <li> Maybe the blades aren&#x27;t at the right angle?</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> I received a sample razor from Gillette and figured I&#x27;d put it to the test right away.</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s even a &amp;#34;subscription plan&amp;#34; that delivers blade refills right to your doorstep (via &amp;#34;dollarshaveclub.com&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic shave this new razor with the FlexBall is!  </li>
            <li> Sure, the Proglide Razors may be slightly higher in price than other razors, but they are worth the price as you get so much more use per blade.</li>
            <li> I get the same great long-lasting shave and long-lasting razor blade with the new flex ball technology which I thought might just be a gimmick but turns out it really does help with the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> Overall I’m very satisfied, I can now shave in a straight line and get every hair.</li>
            <li> I tried Fusion in the past and I honestly thought it was too many blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it provides a decent and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I really like the Gillette razors as they give a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> I got everything I&#x27;ve come to expect from a Gillette razor - baby smooth shave, no cuts, no snagging or discomfort, and fairly decent life of the blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older power razor but got the chance to use this one for free through Buzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to maneuver against the facial contours.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have a tough beard, and this razor glided through easily with great results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve banned by husband from touching it for no other reason</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of razors marketed towards men, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the fact that men are usually offered a million more blades than we ladies are.</li>
            <li> In my case, I do not have the requirement to let a beard grow because I start to develop a serious rash, so I must keep a very smooth shaved surface and apply and after shave touch of aveeno, which I discovered is the best for dry skin and vanishes any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Enter</li>
            <li> I had only a wonderful clean shave, rather than small cuts or missed spots.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette I got to try their new Proglide Razor with Flexball Technology for free!  </li>
            <li> The flexibility of the razor and 5 blades really gets the job done right!</li>
            <li> The shave was incredibly close, and somehow my old razor just felt to be of less quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It clogged up pretty quickly and needed to be rinsed out a lot if I didn&#x27;t trim up first.  </li>
            <li> The razor is simple, elegant, modern, and rolls across your skin like a glove (not my best analogy but you get what I mean)  </li>
            <li> it left me with a nice close shave and smooth soft skin.</li>
            <li> (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have yet to test them further, as shaving with the ProGlide is not as exciting as the great shaves that one can get with double edge safety razors.  </li>
            <li> I received a Gillete Fusion Proglide Razor to try out for free thanks to Gillette, for many years I have used electric razors and have been looking to maybe switch back to manuel razor.  </li>
            <li> The first time that I used this razor I have about 4 days worth of stubble</li>
            <li> Yeah i didnt think that this blade would be so efective since all razor are all electric specialized for sentive skin like the ones of gillete that tried that past , but i see that i dont need all that technology for a great shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice now and even though I got a great shave both times I&#x27;m not sold yet on the usefullness of the Flexball, maybe after a few more shaves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the gillette fusion razor for a long time and this one is really nice w/the pivot head.</li>
            <li> I normally use an electric razor and beard trimmer but needed to do a rare clean shave</li>
            <li> nice subtle sent refreshing highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this new razor free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> enjoy using the new Pro Glide 2-in-1 Gel.</li>
            <li> The most amazing thing to me is how cheap these razors are, there is no excuse to be buying the little disposables.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly everyday after that it seemed to get better and better.</li>
            <li> Received this as a trial from Gillette, so far I have only good things about this product.</li>
            <li> first used the razor with about 1 day&#x27;s worth of growth, and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Quick and very serviceable close shave in record time.</li>
            <li> my skin now feels very soft and smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am usually an electric kind of guy, I use the Fusion for special occasions when I need a really close shave--usually I can get by fine with my rotary electric, but I&#x27;ll admit it:</li>
            <li> The blades cut very close and the 2-in-1 Gel which is marked for sensitive skin, made it very comfortable, so comfortable in fact that I didn&#x27;t even have to moisturize my face afterwards.</li>
            <li> and it is still very sharp and is shaving as good as the first day although the moisturizing strip has worn quite a bit</li>
            <li> My face was smooth, minus the hair I purposely left in place, and the precision razor on the backside helped shape that up nicely!</li>
            <li> And while my previous critcism still holds true, I am loving the results this razor produces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is very comfortable and feels solid in your hands.</li>
            <li> It provides very precise and very lasting shave.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth to use especially when combined with the Gillette fusion gel.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t feel that it moved very much while shaving.</li>
            <li> I found that I had a very smooth shave after only one pass.  </li>
            <li> I would use this razor if I shaved more frequently because it is good for very short facial hair.</li>
            <li> Also, given that I already own a Gillette Fusion razor, I do not feel it is worth upgrading to the new ProGlide razor as I found they both produced just about the same shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Since the Mach 3, meaning every blade after that generation, they have all been so good that little can be said about the differences between them.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely not disappointed once I tried it and now consider it my new go-to razor.</li>
            <li> As usual, a new razor has a new technological advance that is promoted as the best thing since sliced bread.  </li>
            <li> It was a painless shave with no sting caused by a hair being pulled but not cut by the blade, and it left my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Since it got more stubble per pass, I made less passes and was done very quickly but still with a quality shave.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quick and easy shave, definitely go for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 5 bladed face with a 6th detailing blade design is really nice, and cleanly removes the harsh stubble off my face without giving me razor burn or leaving scruffy patches.  </li>
            <li> After seeing the reviews of this ProGlide, and those cool in-store motorized displays, I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> Its flexball technology works great on the curvy areas of my face getting a close shave in all the hard to reach areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the older Fusion blade for a long time now and have been happy with it, so naturally I was interested in any improvements.</li>
            <li> So I just received my Gillette ProGlide and shaving cream yesterday as a bzzagent client, to try out and review, and got my first chance to use it today.</li>
            <li> First of all, the razor.  </li>
            <li> But, I am willing to overlook this for the sake of the review.  </li>
            <li> Probably could have trimmed it first.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was in applying the gel.</li>
            <li> This most likely will make a difference in the razor</li>
            <li> if nothing more than simply the window on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It has two pivots (most disposable razors only have one, if at all)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved several more times with the ProGlide and can tell the razor blades dulling after about 3 shaves.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I won&#x27;t be going back to the Excel.  </li>
            <li> I still use the Styler for trimming, but the Flexball is my regular razor now and just works better.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> First thing that caught my attention with this razor was the packaging.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed after my first &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; with the razor was the feeling of the &amp;#34;thinnest and finest&amp;#34; blades.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Gillette!</li>
            <li> This morning was the first time using this razor</li>
            <li> The first time i used it, it glided over my face like there was nothing there.</li>
            <li> First, I took the product out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> After 7 years of not shaving, I finally decided to get rid of my beard, and what better way than with a Gillette product.</li>
            <li> I feel like I actually got a much better and closer shave as compared to my electric razor.  </li>
            <li> More on this later.  </li>
            <li> From the first time I drew the blades across my face I knew that it was going to be a winner.  </li>
            <li> In fairness though, I didn&#x27;t have to pay for my first one.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean out and lasts for a long time without having to change blades.</li>
            <li> but I really like the feeling I have after shaving with this razor!</li>
            <li> It feels like you have more control, and I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;d be any different on a man&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure next time</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s remarkably better than the regular fusion.  </li>
            <li> I get to use the same blades for about 10 uses with no problem, sometimes a day or two more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for two weeks.</li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent and Gillette!</li>
            <li> It does a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> The refills are pretty costly too.</li>
            <li> It worked well and my skin felt soft and smooth after my shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball technology does exactly what it states it would.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, to address the first concern, no, you will not have to throw out your Gillette Fusion five-bladed razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Essentially, the key point here is that it swivels more.</li>
            <li> The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging.</li>
            <li> I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften.</li>
            <li> The second is my grandfather&#x27;s razor, a Superspeed  II from the 1940&#x27;s that does a great job, albeit a lot more slowly than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Also, the handle is smaller and heavier and is not a plastic tube like the Schick which feels better and sturdier.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> did drop the thing and the head popped off, but with a bit of work it went back together and remains to this day, my favorite razor ever.</li>
            <li> I only shave 1-2 times a week, and some of my blades I use well over a year as I&#x27;m just that cheap!  </li>
            <li> (If I&#x27;d known they were the same, I would have surely kept one for mom&#x27;s shower!)&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go back to spending more time cleaning the cartridge than I did</li>
            <li> First, let&#x27;s talk the unboxing.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have to LOOK pretty...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been my personal finding that men&#x27;s razors work on my leg&#x27;s better than womens.  </li>
            <li> However, from the first stroke, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t anticipate it lasting more than 1.5-2 months.</li>
            <li> Overall I was pleased with the shave that I got with this razor.  </li>
            <li> and thats only because I cant give more.</li>
            <li> The Flexball Technology didn&#x27;t do much for me but the shave I got still makes it worth it for me.</li>
            <li> you only need one pass with the grain, and one against, and you&#x27;ll feel confident that you got it all.  </li>
            <li> The rollerball technology on this razor makes shaving so much easier!  </li>
            <li> I love how you only have to change the cartridge once a month!</li>
            <li> He says he tried it for the first time after 2 days without shaving.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first how this is would work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for years and have tried out many different cartridge style razors that they offer.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when using the razor was the weight and feel of the handle.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how it might better for that.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and smooth with every shave.</li>
            <li> I finally settled on Gillette products a few years ago and this razor is just the latest improvement  in an already good product line.</li>
            <li> The first time that I used the Flexball out of the box, my shave was so effortless that I was in awe.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> I used it on both my head and face and it works much better than a traditional style razor.</li>
            <li> My first impression of the razor was quality, it was made of metal and had been polished.</li>
            <li> The simple fact is; it is better than the competition.</li>
            <li> i really like the 2 in 1 gel!</li>
            <li> My second shave went much better.</li>
            <li> The razor has two pivots (most disposable razors only have one, if anyl)</li>
            <li> When I first unpackaged the razor</li>
            <li> I received this razor along with the Gillette Sensitive Skin Ocean Breeze shave gel as a promotional offer to try the product for free</li>
            <li> I have to pull out my one-blade razor to get around these areas first before using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette razors forever, and I&#x27;ve been using the Fusion for a bit now, and I&#x27;m a fan of the most recent upgrade.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more replacement razors for this one.</li>
            <li> After receiving this product to try from BzzAgent, I&#x27;m overall extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Overall though, this razor is fantastic and I look forward to continuing to use it!</li>
            <li> this going to be better than what I currently have&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another great feature is that you do not have to change razors that often as it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t seem to shave the exact places I wanted to, like on the side and below my chin.</li>
            <li> This razor has my face feeling smooth and soft with no razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s an okay razor.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that the flex ball lives up to any hype that Gillette has try to craft, because it may move more than a traditional razor</li>
            <li> the Flex Ball also gets around my chin close the first time and every time with no worries about cuts.  </li>
            <li> The first few uses were good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally got my son to try it, you can witness his first &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; on youtube at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t leave the dreaded leaking shaving cream behind!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors for years, but now that I&#x27;ve tried this, I doubt I&#x27;ll be able to go back.  </li>
            <li> With five blades packed up top in the cartridge, you&#x27;ve gotta have a solid grip on things.</li>
            <li> I had changed to higher end shaving creams and a beaver brush over some time ago</li>
            <li> When I first seen this razor</li>
            <li> Great, long lasting razor.</li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday for being in the army so having a good razor</li>
            <li> Regarding the razor, I found it very good and similar to my previous Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not entirely certain to be honest.</li>
            <li> I have always used Gillette manual razors and have never found a new model to be any better than the old ones.....</li>
            <li> The one thing that I would say that sets it apart from my current razor is the amount of times I need to shave over a certain area for it to feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was lucky enough to get a free sample from Gilette via BZZAGENT and if it wasnt because I already use Gillette&#x27;s brand I would throw ANY razor out the window and use this one 5&amp;#34;stars</li>
            <li> However i was lucky enough to get to try it for free as part of a promotion through BZZAGENT</li>
            <li> The multiple sharp blades give a smooth and close shave and the strip on the razor acts as a good indicator of the life of the razor.  </li>
            <li> If you think that statement is true, you must be using the new Fusion ProGlide men&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> The flexball worked really well with the shape of my face and when I thought I needed to pick up the razor and change direction, I didn&#x27;t have to, because the flexball moved it in the right direction for</li>
            <li> you think “Right is he really telling the truth”.  </li>
            <li> it comes out at a pretty high pressure and really sprays a nice solid stream into my hand.</li>
            <li> However, if I were to use a cartridge razor as my primary, everyday razor, I would definitely use the Gillette Brand of razor as there are many options to choose from and you are able to get a pretty close shave in using them.  </li>
            <li> When using this product with Gillette&#x27;s ProFusion Gel for Sensitive skin, my skin is left feeling so smooth and soft, and smelling nice as well.</li>
            <li> I am able to get a fairly close shave with this razor after several passes, in various directions, over my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> But after the first shave with this razor, I&#x27;m positively making the switch.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even notice the little blade on the back for precision trims until the second time I used it, but it was very effective and came in handy for getting edges.  </li>
            <li> The flexball technology is amazing, and gets every hair with absolutely no nicks!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read any of my other reviews; then you know I always give my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> When I first recieved the blade, I honestly thought is was just going to be a regular old blade and is going to suck.</li>
            <li> I did not see anything overly spectacular about it versus other Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li> Sure, we understand Gillette wants to make money with cartridge sales, but they used to make stellar safety razors that are treasured in families and last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> It has a chilling tingle that makes the shaving experience much more enjoyable—the best part is that it lingers after rinsing off the gel providing comfort and moisture long after the shave is done.  </li>
            <li> It really does provide a very smooth shave, remaining in constant contact with the skin over subtle curves and provides a great shave.</li>
            <li> which I LOVE feels very high end and solid in your hand.  </li>
            <li> so my beard was good and tough with three days worth of stubble and the blade performed very well giving me a close clean shave.</li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s, more importantly, give a much closer and less damaging shave to the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I have stubble much faster afterwards, and it leaves my skin bumpy and kind of rough afterwards, I can see some of the hairs just at the level of skin if I look close.  </li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide  Flexball razor in the mail from Gillette and wow, it really was a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li> convenience the electric razor wins when you don’t need a particularly close shave</li>
            <li> Others who have a much friendlier set of facial hair will find this product enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I received this Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor as a promotion for my true review,  Overall not bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to get a nick and cut free shave for one of the few times ever.  </li>
            <li> The ProGlide&#x27;s five super-thin blades provided a clean, smooth, and comfortable shave with very little friction and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t bother my skin very much and the Flexball razor really did get around all the angles without nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> As for the Flexball part, I dont really know if it adds very much value.</li>
            <li> The gel lubricates tremendously and the the shave you get get from the razor rivals a professional shave from a barbershop!</li>
            <li> The bottle is very cool because it has an indicator to tell you how much is left in the can.</li>
            <li> This is a simple, but great addition that I wish that other manufacturers to pick up on.</li>
            <li> With the higher pressure, I hadn&#x27;t realized just how much I had expelled, so after applying to my face I had quite a bit of leftover.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Gillette Fusion razor for a long time and didn&#x27;t think this would be better.  </li>
            <li> Great Razor, I&#x27;ve used dozens of different models both Gillette and other brands</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty much sold on this item.</li>
            <li> handle is solidly built too, it is not some cheap plastic, but rather, this handle is bound to last many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying Gillette&#x27;s latest blade and handle, just to see what I was missing.  </li>
            <li> First of all it the Flexball Technology seems to work, it really moves around my jaw line a lot smoother.  </li>
            <li> It dose glide over surfaces very well, all in all this razor does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> The ProGlide shave gel also offers a cool sensation while shaving.</li>
            <li> The way the 5 blade head runs down your face makes the shave so smooth and comfortable not to mention it get a majority on the first pass.</li>
            <li> The quality difference between cheaper and more expensive certainly is noticed and undeniably Gillette has an edge in quality, but the type of shaving cream/gel used seems to be the most important factor for me.</li>
            <li> It caught so many more of the hairs on the contours of my neck especially that other razors could not catch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As expected, the gel felt cool and smooth going on.</li>
            <li> The contours of my face such as chin and jawline, were easy to handle with this razor.  </li>
            <li> the moisture strip provides enough movement to allow the razor to easily pivot around my face.  </li>
            <li> I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it he says it&#x27;s a really nice razor that doesn&#x27;t have the typical pull he feels with the cheaper razors.</li>
            <li> This was expected since the first shave demanded much more effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to try to get this razor into the rotation, but it will take a lot more practice before I feel comfortable with this one compared to the Mach 3 I usually use.</li>
            <li> At the same time the FlexBall technology allows for easy maneuvering around the curves.</li>
            <li> The rubber grips make it easy to maneuver the razor in different angles</li>
            <li> Not the case with this razor, I am on my 3rd shave and it is just as smooth as can be with no pulling or razor burn on my neck which some razors will do on the first use.  </li>
            <li> One word, smart.</li>
            <li> The added bonus of the Flexball is pure genius.</li>
            <li> But you don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to shave because the less you use, the better your shave will be since just a little will give you a good lather.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how quick the shave was, and I didn&#x27;t really need any cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised how quick the shave was, and I didn&#x27;t really need to go over any missed areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Gel smells good and has a nice texture, but is too thick and needs to be watered down a bit.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very smoothly, but not very close.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used single &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; shaving blade on the top around my nose, didn&#x27;t get cut, and my shave looks really</li>
            <li> It reminds of the ball feature in most new vacuum cleaners today that enhance maneuverability.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, if I got it at a decent price, I&#x27;d be interested in continuing to use this razor and its blades.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty decent job.</li>
            <li> multiple times made it an incredibly quick shave as well!</li>
            <li> I had very high expectations on the razor but also with the gel.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> the razor is great and cuts better than the disposable ones but at the same time it seems to me that these razors dont last as long which they should last longer considering how much they cost</li>
            <li> I was so impressed how it easily adjusts and glides over my jawline, chin and neck gently with low cutting blades</li>
            <li> razor makes quick work of facial hair, and floats seamlessly across my face as I shave, leaving a very close and smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave with little to no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp but gentle, as usual, and always give me a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It makes shaving a little bit enjoyable, but it&#x27;s still shaving and shaving isn&#x27;t fun at all.</li>
            <li> Its also good under my nose in that hard to reach area.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say that problem is completely gone, but with this new fusion blade, I have to admit that the irritation is significantly less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gently glides around on a pivot and makes going over my chin and neck much easier, and on short hair it shaves cleanly the first time around.</li>
            <li> The single blade on the reverse side is perfectly angled to get a sharp line on my Goatee, when I have one, and gets all the hair around my ears, whereas before I would need a separate straight razor for the area above my</li>
            <li> This thing is the only one I am going to use from now on, trying the product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> The shave is close and accurate and the ball actually does work.  </li>
            <li> Prior to this, my everyday razor was a refillable competitive brand razor, which I thought did a great job - that is, up until I received this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design of the bottle is very sleek.</li>
            <li> As I began to shave, I was trying to make note of the swivel head, to see if it was really doing anything as I shaved.</li>
            <li> One simple light pass</li>
            <li> so not only does it glide well on smooth surfaces, it also pivots from side to side</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lately, I&#x27;d started learning how to use a straight edge because disposable razors just don&#x27;t give you that close of a shave.</li>
            <li> It takes longer with a straight edge, but my wife loves the result.</li>
            <li> and there where it was absolute smoothness in the beginning</li>
            <li> I really like Gillette Fusion products, they give me a very close shave and the blades</li>
            <li> I was actually using it for a while before I got the free one, but I have to say,</li>
            <li> The blades from all Fusion razors will fit and work, though Gillette markets different models for power and non-power models.</li>
            <li> This begs the question: Why are you pulling your razor with so much straight line force?</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I got this product free as part of a promotion from Gillette and they&#x27;ve definitely made a permanent customer out of me!</li>
            <li> The razor has 5 blades which give a much closer shave than the 3 blade razor i&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> But this is the real life</li>
            <li> I really do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would it bend too much?</li>
            <li> It didn’t flex too much.</li>
            <li> As someone with thick, coarse hair, a comfortable shave is the most important aspect of my experience.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really look at what&#x27;s going on with razors, but the Fusion ProGlide caught my eye because of the flexball.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li> It really did not matter as to the length of my beard.  </li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and wasn&#x27;t expecting much, really; I&#x27;ve already been using the fusion razor.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> I recently got this for free from Gilette and I was not optimistic.</li>
            <li> It really hugs the curves of your face</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This razor is very durable, as I have dropped it on the ground a couple times, and everything stays in place, including the razor head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of a hefty razor, and I thoroughly enjoy the weight of this one in my hand.</li>
            <li> I would say that the head really did contour for maximum contact.</li>
            <li> like it so much I&#x27;ll be buying a blade refill.</li>
            <li> In the end, I much prefer a more simple razor without so many gimmicky features.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and does not give you {much} razor burns.</li>
            <li> This made shaving my head so much easier.</li>
            <li> It was really invigorating.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again to Gillette for sending me</li>
            <li> it really helped it move with my skin from any direction.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is really a fault of the FlexBall, so much as my inexperience with it.</li>
            <li> I was recently offered the chance to try out for free the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Technology as part of a promotion.  </li>
            <li> the flexibility doesn&#x27;t look very permanent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very hairy guy.</li>
            <li> I actually received this razor free to try as a promotion from gillette.</li>
            <li> The flex ball really does help the blades follow the contour of your face.</li>
            <li> Combined with the blade design this makes the shaving experience really smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is now smooth and I actually look forward to shaving each morning instead of viewing it as a chore.</li>
            <li> This razor gives the closest shave without leaving cuts/nicks from applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I do not notice it contouring to my face much if any.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be part of a test panel where I was given a sample Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor to test.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think I would like this one nearly as much.</li>
            <li> My face feels just as smooth with this razor as it did while using my prior model.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> but thanks to Gillette I have chance to try it.</li>
            <li> It really takes the thought out of shaving, and allowed me to just trust my my shaver handle.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette razors my whole life</li>
            <li> The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale.</li>
            <li> &gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it.</li>
            <li> This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a razor on my neck and cheeks just leaving a trace of beard and this was twice as fast as using my Schick.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because of the flex ball which really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is that I can&#x27;t figure out how much it contributes to the shave.  </li>
            <li> This blade is another in a list of blades that do the job very well.  </li>
            <li> razor shaves very close when in a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which doesn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The feature really helps when your soapy hand holds a razor in the shower.</li>
            <li> I really do.  </li>
            <li> This time the shave went much smoother (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> Because it costs me $5 for 100 disposable razor blades for my $10 straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> Because it costs me $5 for 100 disposable razor blades for my $10 straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very please with the smoothness of this razor...</li>
            <li> Even when using the manual razor, it would still take several strokes to get all of the hair for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The razor has 5 blades which give a much closer shave than the 3 blade razor i&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this razor in the store because I&#x27;m THAT much of a stickler.</li>
            <li> this cleaned out so much</li>
            <li> easier!&lt;br /&gt;Can be used really well for body hair as well.</li>
            <li> I know this because I had to shave my chest (very hairy chest) for a tattoo I was getting.</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t help nor hinder.</li>
            <li> I really like the FlexBall that&#x27;s been added</li>
            <li> I recently received a Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology along with the shave gel to test for free from Gillette through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> The Proglide seemed to be much smoother.</li>
            <li> I found the contouring feature of the product to be very beneficial when attempting the jaw-line.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave without having to put out much effort and risk cuts.</li>
            <li> He is not a real hairy faced guy and he thought this was a turbo charged version of a razor and just too many blades for him.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend signed me up for Bzzagent and thanks to their company and Gillette</li>
            <li> 1 nick or razor burn area then to give a real test I waited a couple days and used the Gillette proglide gel with it</li>
            <li> Thanks buzz agent and thank you Gillette</li>
            <li> I do however really like</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li> It makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li> my hair grows fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it gives me the closest shave I ever had.</li>
            <li> so not only does it glide well on smooth surfaces, it also pivots from side to side</li>
            <li> , it really gives me confidence during my shave.</li>
            <li> The flex-ball allows the blades to really hug your skin.</li>
            <li> I have to drag a razor across my face the better.  </li>
            <li> They work very well for me.</li>
            <li> The handle is also comfortable for my larger hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent for this opportunity.</li>
            <li> The head moves horizontally along with the strokes, which can really help when shaving my neck.  </li>
            <li> As a BZZAgent reviewer, I recently received a free sample of a Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology, and gave it a whirl.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> You get a much closer shave</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s part of my morning routine thanks to this razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette and Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> but it does really add to the shaving comfort.</li>
            <li> it worked smoothly, did not irritate my skin, and I finally had a close shave.  </li>
            <li> it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really have a need for that</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> skin feels much so much smoother and improved.</li>
            <li> The pivot of the ball really does force the razor to contour to every angle of your face and head.</li>
            <li> Being a bearded gentleman, I really don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on some fancy razor.  </li>
            <li> Something else that I noticed is that I didn&#x27;t need to apply as much pressure to get just as close of a shave up there.  </li>
            <li> But if you are looking for something to shave the entire head area, I have yet to find a razor as comfortable and productive as this one.e blade, but either way, I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for something to shave the entire head area, I have yet to find a razor as comfortable and productive as this one.</li>
            <li> Overall a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I did side by side tests and though the razor performs very well, it just doesn&#x27;t beat my mach 3.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been much of a razor user in some time (just the electric)</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this opportunity.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think the blade pivoting 4 ways would do much for me.</li>
            <li> The flex ball really just seems like a novelty to me that doesn&#x27;t appear to make any difference while shaving.</li>
            <li> my wife has been using this razor as well and really doesn&#x27;t see much of a difference (or any) either.</li>
            <li> But I recently received a Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology to test for free from Gillette through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t grow a real immaculate or rugged beard.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Any extra gel is easy to clean off by twisting the cap to the locked position and back.</li>
            <li> It left my face and neck smooth and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> The Flexball razor that goes along with it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if I would want to replace the whole razor all the time</li>
            <li> Very close shave by it</li>
            <li> It does provide a very close shave and contours to your face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in quality of shave.</li>
            <li> this is where this product really shines.  </li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t 100% say it was do to the Flexball</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m docking it a star because I really miss the vibrating handle</li>
            <li> But I am optimistic enough with the ProGlide experience that I will try shaving more frequently.  </li>
            <li> Since she was currently using a Schick, and Gillette was kind enough to send me a trial kit</li>
            <li> So after shaving a few times with this razor I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Gillette is GILLETTE what more can you say about a product you&#x27;ve been using your entire adult life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a shave with my old razors that left my face this virtually irritation free!</li>
            <li> I like how soft my skin feels immediately after shaving (that&#x27;s most likely</li>
            <li> First i felt that the Flexball was kind of pointless feature</li>
            <li> I didn’t think smaller blades would be as effective, but it actually helps decrease pull &amp; tug.  </li>
            <li> so it is worth it to spend the few extra bucks for a good shave.  </li>
            <li> The first couple shaves were actually really good, but if you have thicker facial hair, like myself, then you will start to notice that the blades start to dull rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not your cheap, plastic disposable razor handle!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to try a new razor since my face is very jagged</li>
            <li> but since I have used it OH WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> was surprised at how the majority of the hairs fell right out of the cartridge without much of a fuss.</li>
            <li> Other key features are how comfortable the handle fits in the hand, even for various hand positions - I use this as a body razor and have no problem getting a good hold on it.</li>
            <li> , let me be clear: I still LOVE the Proglide, and firmly believe that if I have the choice of using the Gillette versus pretty much every model of personal shaver available, I&#x27;ll go with the Gillette pretty much every time (unless of course I cannot afford one, in which case I have 3 different and much cheaper models which I believe work easily 98% as good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First day using the new razor.</li>
            <li> I was pretty pumped about trying the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with the flexball handle.  </li>
            <li> The new Flexball handle seems to fit existing Fusion blades, so you can use your old stash of blades with this new handle.</li>
            <li> My first shave with the new blades required just one pass over each area of my face and</li>
            <li> I noticed I didn&#x27;t really change hand positions much, I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same areas multiple times, mostly I was just able to do long strokes from my neck all the way up my face...</li>
            <li> I noticed I didn&#x27;t really change hand positions much, I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same areas multiple times, mostly I was just able to do long strokes from my neck all the way up my face...</li>
            <li> As far as the Fusion line of razors go it fits right in.</li>
            <li> They were amazed at how smooth it had left my skin and by the end of the day they left curious and interested in getting their own.</li>
            <li> Though I do love the blades and would recommend to anyone I will not be purchasing any refills due to the high cost of these blades!</li>
            <li> My other knock isn&#x27;t really a dislike, but more of a preference.</li>
            <li> The gel dispenser stays clean and has a gauge on the side of it that lets you know how much you have left.</li>
            <li> The flex ball allows for a smooth and seamless transition across your jawline and makes it easy to get in those tight areas around the ears etc.  </li>
            <li> This is a completely new and better shave over the dollar store, single blade razors I have been using before I got the battery powered unit and now this manual unit.</li>
            <li> The shave was smooth and clean, and took less passes than my normal razor.  </li>
            <li> Other persons who apply more pressure when they shave may find the FlexBall</li>
            <li> Is the razor better than any other?</li>
            <li> and it does not irritate my face like most other razors.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying this product not only for my face but my head as well.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor, I have used it 7 times and the blades seem to still be sharp, I like</li>
            <li> But he was so excited, talking about how the quality was supposed to be, so I decided I wouldn&#x27;t take it back</li>
            <li> The shave is close, safe, and lasts longer than any other product on the market.  </li>
            <li> The price of replacements is a little daunting but given the way it performs its necessary to get the best shave possible without seeing a professional!</li>
            <li> I assumed it was like any other razor, and that I would not be able to feel the FlexBall Technology.</li>
            <li> I personally do not notice a significant difference with the flexball technology</li>
            <li> Better than other razor out there.</li>
            <li> With my other razors I would even consider more than 4 shaves before changing the blade.(coarse</li>
            <li> It has more nooks and crannies then other blades</li>
            <li> Not any more close of a shave than the other razors I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for years, especially the original Fusion.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide w/Flex ball from BzzAgent &amp; Gillette and let me say that I have always used Gillette&#x27;s for as long as I can remember and before this free sample I had the last Gillette Fusion Powerglide</li>
            <li> By the time I finished shaving, the wear strip was nearly completely worn down, which is a huge bummer considering the cartridges aren&#x27;t exactly cheap.</li>
            <li> BTW, I love the Active Sport scent and cooling sensation...</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a long winter and growing a full beard throughout, I was not looking forward to my first shave of the spring.</li>
            <li> Normally, because of a &amp;#34;cowlick&amp;#34; quality to my beard, I have to come at it from four different directions to achieve a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The razor definitely provided a clean and easier shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same areas to get a clean shave</li>
            <li> Being a safety razor user, I was skeptical of the ProGlide and at first thought it was a great marketing gimmick.</li>
            <li> Clean shave continue after multiple uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The gel and the razor left me with a clean close shave.</li>
            <li> I normally use a double edge safety razor and shave using shave soap and brush but received this item for free to review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a short while now and have to say that I get really clean, close shaves.</li>
            <li> Razor burn hasn&#x27;t really ever been an issue for me, but I&#x27;m sure this would cut down on that too.</li>
            <li> and the single cartridge is still going strong -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any guy who wants a closer shave without the hassle.</li>
            <li> The shave itself seemed fine, for an average man&#x27;s beard, but no better than a good disposable blade, in his opinion.</li>
            <li> I bring this up because this has been a huge pain point for me with other blades getting clogged quickly, always right in the middle of the length of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts my shaving time about in half because it takes so many fewer &amp;#34;swipes&amp;#34; to get my whole face done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this razor previously and it is my absolute favorite razor of all time.</li>
            <li> I would easily recommend it to those looking to step their shaving game up to the top tier.</li>
            <li> I tried it first as a true test dry shaving not</li>
            <li> felt that it was more power than he needed to do what his other razor normally does for him.  </li>
            <li> So after recieving my free sample Gillette Fusion Pro-glide razor with the flexball, I had relatively long stubble to be removed.</li>
            <li> The razors seem to last a longer time than my normal disposables so to me that is worth it!</li>
            <li> Love the dark chrome and metal</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I noticed the slick packaging was eye catching.  </li>
            <li> My neck is pretty sensitive when it comes to shaving, but I had no issues here.</li>
            <li> In general the razor met what he&#x27;d read in the advertisements and he felt it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s logical for me to spend nearly $30 on 8 cartridges for the ProGlide if each cartridge lasts me two to three</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s logical for me to spend nearly $30 on 8 cartridges for the ProGlide if each cartridge lasts me two to three</li>
            <li> I have used other Gillette razors in the past and have had pretty good success with them.  </li>
            <li> but when I do the skin on my neck is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have used the Fusion for years, and Gillette has made a believer out of a most skeptical critic, as I was sure the product couldn&#x27;t be that much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> When I got this campaign on buzz agent I couldn&#x27;t wait to catch it in the mail, simply a dream come true.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After trying this I am confident I can go back to a razor or at least be able to use it once in awhile.</li>
            <li> I found cleanup of the blades went quickly and easily under the faucet, but I’m not sure if this was a result of the blade, or the gel.  </li>
            <li> but I still would go out and buyone if you need a new razor!</li>
            <li> The benefits I have seen are that the handle of the new Flexball model seems a bit more comfortable, the razor seems to last a little longer (I shave 3-4 times a week</li>
            <li> I normally use a single blade safety razor old school style well not any more</li>
            <li> It feels very smooth and doesn&#x27;t catch on my thick hair when I first start shaving which most other razors do.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with a Gillette Fusion for their great shave, sharp (pun intended) looking product and willingness to build a better razor.  </li>
            <li> I think Gillette has a winner again with this new Proglide Flexball razor, very dependable product and company.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from the new Proglide.  </li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide Power with the new FlexBall Handle really allows this razor to adjust to the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> and I really like the feel of this new Fusion,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like a slightly heavier feel, perhaps with a bit more metal than plastic.  </li>
            <li> but I got a close, smooth, non cut shave and skin did not feel dry, so</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m probably just not the target user for this particular style of handle / razor.</li>
            <li> Word of advice, don&#x27;t press too hard and let the blades work their magic!  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product as part of a promotion from Bzzz Agent!</li>
            <li> I have both an older version of the ProGlide without the FlexBall and a Schick Hydra.</li>
            <li> Some blades stick with the 1 blade on top for edging system, some gave it up and left the 4-5 regular blades.  </li>
            <li> I have a decent amount of irritation when using this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am already a reluctantly loyal Gillette Fusion user, and the only thing that can keep me from championing the brand is the cost of replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> The main reason to get this is for the Flexball handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and painless and have yet to have a nick (which was constant with my safety razors_.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if the Flexball is more expensive, I cannot endorse paying more.</li>
            <li> so you really have to be diligent keeping it clean and dry after use to get maximum usage from the blade.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying it if you can find replacement cartridges at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a sample from Gillette and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a close shave with less effort than with my older Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> For a while I decided to stop shaving all together and just go with a scruffy face and beard trimmer because it was far too difficult to get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using various 5 blade razors and most function about the same.  </li>
            <li> the razor made shaving my neck very easy though, as long as the hair wasn&#x27;t too long it shaved very well.</li>
            <li> By far the nicest razor i&#x27;ve used, such smooth strokes really made my skin feel soft when I finished my shave!</li>
            <li> What I found most fascinating was the innovative design of the container—it’s plastic with a viewing window which means no more rust rings on the counter or running out of shave gel at the wrong moment!  </li>
            <li> Ok so yet another Razor to spend your hard on money on right?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit more expensive than some of the competition, but it&#x27;s a price I&#x27;ll gladly pay to avoid the discomfort that I&#x27;ve experienced from every other razor on the market.</li>
            <li> I received this razor with a single blade to try for free from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> they are well made with formidable materials that are comfy to hold, don&#x27;t slip out of ur hand, the blades are sharp leaving you clean and smooth, and the unique flexball technology adjusts to the uneven contours of ur face for that close shave.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel.</li>
            <li> I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance.</li>
            <li> The razors have tilted backward &amp; forward to follow the contour of your face for literally at least a decade or more, right?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Shave Gel + Skin Care which I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccommend everyone to try this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to others.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> That being said I would highly recommend trying this out.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> The razor moved across my skin and caused no skin irritation or problems I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> If you can catch a promo coupon with some coupons on blades and gel I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone who is on the fence of buying one.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor for anyone that is wanting to try it.  </li>
            <li> There razors are high quality and the ease of shaving is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This combination with leave you with a nice close shave with very soft skin without the burn found in the usual razors and creams.</li>
            <li> the razor, I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li> The precision razor on the back is the same as I&#x27;ve experienced with previous Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> Way better than the old razor.&amp;#34;  Now, we don&#x27;t use amazeballs to describe anything other than an 11 on a scale of 1 - 10, so that was quite the compliment.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight difference in handling while shaving but not something worth significantly more money depending on how its priced compared to the regular Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a member of BzzAgent and was lucky enough to be part of the group selected to receive a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor, along with their new Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> So the first, and most obvious change in this razor over other razors I&#x27;ve used is the swivel head.</li>
            <li> so this isn&#x27;t a major issue, just an issue for my first time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, I prefer the old-fashioned razor that I shaved with when my beard was little more than peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Blades stay sharp after multiple shaves, so it lasts long, making it a great value.  </li>
            <li> I prefer something with a little more heft in my hand.</li>
            <li> I really do like this razor and keep it as a backup to my main, an old Gillette ball tech.</li>
            <li> so you get a good clean, quality shave, but the real game changer is the flexball.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide with its 5 blades cuts cleanly and smoothly, whether I went with the grain or against (I usually do with first, then against on a second pass--</li>
            <li> It cut right through with ease, but once again, was less smooth and less comfortable than my Fusion</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re ready to get busy with this sleek looking razor.  </li>
            <li> The blades provide a close shave with absolutely no tug or pull in my case for a heavenly comfortable experience.</li>
            <li> , it really is an improvement above the old razors and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I recommend people with sensitive skin or doen&#x27;t like spending much time shaving to use this product.  </li>
            <li> so far, i really like this razor.</li>
            <li> The next think I noticed was the ball that gave the head flexibility while huge didn&#x27;t really seem to add anything to the actual shave experience.</li>
            <li> Expensive but a great shave.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a smooth guide and works very well on my coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> I put this razor to the test a bit more, as I haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days and so stubble has gotten a bit longer.</li>
            <li> After Shave Balm post shave, I did not feel any burn like I normally do.  </li>
            <li> normally shave once a week, even with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Paired with the ProGlide 2-in-1 shave gel, my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth and soft in a long time.</li>
            <li> The handle feels sturdy and heavy, leading me to feel like it is a better quality product.</li>
            <li> and I have a job to go to, five days a week, like a normal person.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure how well the razor would work at first because I had a thick beard.</li>
            <li> This combination handily wins my contract for future shaving needs!</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t officially switched in a long time because there really haven&#x27;t been any advancements worth abandoning my cartridges.</li>
            <li> First of all, I wanted to say that I received this product a few weeks ago for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> This is exciting for me, as normally my skin gets irritated with multiple passes</li>
            <li> I received one of these from Gillette to review as the normally do.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that will appear over a few uses.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant about that ball, but at the end of the day, it does actually serve a useful function.  </li>
            <li> &gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard.</li>
            <li> Ribbed handles are not common in women&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li> My face feels alot smoother than normal too since when the blade contours it literally doesnt miss hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had ingrown hair trouble much more since I&#x27;ve started using this razor.  </li>
            <li> This is actually worth spending the extra for the newer model.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Mach 3, so I am used to a &amp;#34;straighter&amp;#34; razor when I shave.  </li>
            <li> Second time I used the razor, I had about 4 day&#x27;s worth of growth.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t expect more than another few shaves out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  normally get caught up on my chin</li>
            <li> To begin with, my baseline for comparison was what I normally used, a schick hydro 5.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Mach 3 or an electric razor.</li>
            <li> The blades glide easily and so far I haven&#x27;t had a single cut!</li>
            <li> but my face is not that contoured so that was not a hard feat.</li>
            <li> New feature is the angle-bending action so that the blade can now both tilt AND swivel, if you pull it in s straight line and apply a lot of force.</li>
            <li> I find that a shave with a straight razor is the closest I can get to a baby&#x27;s-bottom soft face without growing a new layer of skin.</li>
            <li> back feature of the Hydro 5 which would make for easy cleaning/drying of the razor, the key to longevity.  </li>
            <li> It contours to your face making one stoke shaving easy, and it gets all those hairs you usually miss the first time around.  </li>
            <li> The handle makes it very easy to hold and glide over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: An enlarged Lubristrip lubricates skin, allowing for a smoother shave, however, sometimes I felt it left a little too much residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried using single, double, triple, quadruple, and five blade razors and prefer the ones with more blades.  </li>
            <li> The final bit of advertising on the bottle, I&#x27;ll state right off that I like.</li>
            <li> As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction.</li>
            <li> It looks like they have the razor backing right next to the blades</li>
            <li> My neck was too long under my beard, so I quickly turned to my BzzKit.  </li>
            <li> Like almost everyone, I hate shaving, yet when i have a Gillette product in my hand, invariably I am more confident of my ability to get a clean, close shave without nicks and cuts and this shaver delivers on all levels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been loyal to Gilette for my shaving needs</li>
            <li> I was a little let down that I received the Non-powered razor as I&#x27;ve been using a powered razor for years, and love how smooth of a shave I get from them.</li>
            <li> Gillette is one smart cookie for making an easier razor for a busy busy guy like me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li> The razor provided a comfortable shave, and it did not leave the &amp;#34;itchy residue&amp;#34; my other razors provided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts, including battery-powered, and this gives you as close, comfortable shave as any other.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the ball move as much as I expected, but could tell a significant difference in the results of my shave.  </li>
            <li> The shave head is as smooth as any other Gillette razor</li>
            <li> While I like the lubricating strip razor manufacturers have added to blades in the past few years, features like rotating heads, more than 2 blades, and &amp;#34;FlexBall&amp;#34; technology always seemed like gimmicks to get you to spend more on your razor.  </li>
            <li> The razor is smooth and sharp and it doesn&#x27;t get clogged like my Schick Quatro does during a shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> can shaving creams and gels but after trying this free sample seems Gillette has come along way, It doesn&#x27;t foam up my face like my other product with a brush</li>
            <li> I had high hopes at first, but for me, it turned out to be about the same as any other razor, except for the really cheap no-frills type brands.</li>
            <li> My first razor back in high school was a Gillette</li>
            <li> Compared to the stick I&#x27;ve been using, it was a smooth, painless shave, and I am now ending up with little or no cuts--a step better than what I typically experience.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> However, this new razor was a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I participated in a Bzz campaign to try the new Fusion Proglide.  </li>
            <li> Plus the new ball technology helped the razor glide with ease around the curvy parts of my face.  </li>
            <li> Got the chance to try the flexball with the new gel as well.</li>
            <li> I will be switching to this new razor and using it from now on.</li>
            <li> I will be switching to this new razor and using it from now on.</li>
            <li> Received the NEW Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care and Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology from Gillette for testing.</li>
            <li> Testing the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology and the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> Let me tell you this one thing about this new Proglide Razor.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I like to try new razors.</li>
            <li> This is a problem with all new 5 blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> Partnered with their new shaving gel you get the closest and cleanest shave on the planet.</li>
            <li> This razor blade comes off as new age technology.</li>
            <li> I need new blades, it will be for this one.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor has continued to live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve told a couple of friends about this new razor.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s new 2-in-1 shave gel</li>
            <li> I received this new razor and shaving gel as a test and review from Gillette and man, the 5 blades in it makes it seem like you are shaving on glass.</li>
            <li> You Will Not Have To Buy New Blades</li>
            <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new razor has 5 blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would I buy a new pack of blades for the Gillette Fusion Proglide?&lt;br /&gt;No.</li>
            <li> have since passed on the ProGlide razor to my father, along with a brand new 6 pack of cartridges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would I buy a new pack of blades for the Gillette Fusion Proglide?&lt;br /&gt;No.</li>
            <li> have since passed on the ProGlide razor to my father, along with a brand new 6 pack of cartridges.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it with the new razor.  </li>
            <li> which I was amazed about, the new razor head along with the flexball technology is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for everything else, this is my new go-to razor.  </li>
            <li> after trying the new flexball technology on the fusion proglide razor</li>
            <li> I recommend it to any one who is looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> The new Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology</li>
            <li> would still recommend this product to someone who is new to manual razors, but for me it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I was part of a promotion where Gillette sent me a new Fusion ProGlide razor to test and review.</li>
            <li> I like this new razor and can recommend it to discerning shavers everywhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades don’t seem to be anything new to me from the Gillette line.</li>
            <li> If I were buying a new razor I would probably get it, but I don&#x27;t know that i would trade in what I had for it.</li>
            <li> Gillette has a customer for live with these products.</li>
            <li> It has a new design with the bottom made out of plastic which will not leave any rust stain on your counter.</li>
            <li> The new FlexBall solves that problem because it allows the razor to bob, weave and adjust to the contours of my jaw line.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades should be cheaper than the razor itself, otherwise, why not just buy a new razor every time.</li>
            <li> They claim that the FlexBall razor paired with their new shave gel provides maximum contact and a closer shave in each stroke.  </li>
            <li> Would I go out and buy this razor if I needed a new razor?</li>
            <li> The handle is slim and easy to use, the blade is very sharp and got all the hair in one pass.</li>
            <li> and i do get a smooth shave, but the price is a tad high, bring the price down a tad</li>
            <li> Gillette claims you no longer have to do that, and that you can fit their Flexballs into all those hard to reach little crevasses on your face as it rotates left and right as well as up and down.&lt;br /&gt;Still, honestly,</li>
            <li> Whenever I&#x27;d tried to move to a 4-blade system, they&#x27;ve always clogged up or been harder to clean, so there I&#x27;ve stayed.  </li>
            <li> Got this free as a product promotion along with some \\&quot;Active</li>
            <li> Although Gillette razors are not cheap but the Fusion Proglide razor is amazing and I will not go back to another razor again.  </li>
            <li> However, when I received a free Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology and a can of their Active Sport Shave Gel, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> harder to clean out the hair with each swipe.  </li>
            <li> So in comparison to the Norelco, the ProGlide was equally smooth and close without the multiple passes and extra time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As such I also received a free trial not only of the razor but of Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mostly used electric shavers in the past because the normal razors would leave my neck area irritated and bumpy.</li>
            <li> and never even thought to drop the extra dough on &amp;#34;new razor technology.&amp;#34; Gillette sent me their razor a while back to try risk free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mostly used electric shavers in the past because the normal razors would leave my neck area irritated and bumpy.</li>
            <li> Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I dont have very course facial hair, but this thing works really well.  </li>
            <li> This is a better razor but they are better at cutting hair.</li>
            <li> They all have close shaves, especially with repeated swipes, very much including this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very surprised at the close shave I got from this razor.</li>
            <li> With my very sensitive skin i was a bit hesitant on using the Fusion ProGlide razor.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and always break out after shaving.</li>
            <li> I usually shave in the shower, and without a mirror, so this is a key factor and demonstrates how quick and easy the shave is.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence or are willing to try out a new razor definitely give this one a try.</li>
            <li> He find it got as close as his regular go-to razor (which I can&#x27;t give you the name of because I&#x27;ve been told to stay away from it), but he was a little vexed by the motion created by the Flexball (I really can&#x27;t tell you how much I love that name).</li>
            <li> The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change.</li>
            <li> and I think they are a little expensive, but hey I get a pretty good shave, so I think its worth it!</li>
            <li> On the limited evidence provided by one shave, it pretty much delivers.</li>
            <li> I cannot currently see any negatives, outside of the fact that I think that if I continue using this razor, I shall be sure to pick up the Powered option however that&#x27;s probably just personal preference.</li>
            <li> I surprised!</li>
            <li> I have used many razors in the past but</li>
            <li> It would probably result in a long and drawn out process with steep court fees and hours of my time, but for a razor that combines the power and flexball technologies, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure though if this is more attributable to the razor itself or that I was also using the Gillette</li>
            <li> After all, what have you to lose other than more facial hair!</li>
            <li> but it actually gets pretty close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty similar to my hydro5</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about the razor being any better than the other manual razors on the market, but I will never be going back after using this product.</li>
            <li> Ever tried shaving while doing all sorts of funny stuff just to get the shave you want, you know, using all your facial muscles so your face will conform to the shaver&#x27;s blade?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fascinated to watch all the latest technology in shaving over the past decade</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the shave this razor gave me, it left nothing behind but my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that is more the handle or the blade, but either way, I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually would get rashes and bumps with most creams and gels</li>
            <li> so I know when it&#x27;s time to pick up another bottle and just to see how much I go through, in general.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t actually the first time I&#x27;ve recieved this paticular brand of razor.</li>
            <li> It does look cool and space aged, but that is all I got out of it.</li>
            <li> It did give me a rather clean shave and it was nice having the single razor on the reverse to touch-up those sideburns that sometimes are difficult to get straight with the normal razor head.  </li>
            <li> I have previously owned this new line of Gillette razors, and all I can say is that they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I always thought of it as another gimmicky product like the rest of the 3-4-5 razors promising to produce a clean shave (which they never did).</li>
            <li> The results of the Fusion ProGlide razor with 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care (Active Sport to be precise) really surprised me.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a perfect razor due to having a little trouble around the neck area, but otherwise I found it to be fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I like the close and smooth shave provided by this razor, and the Flexball is functional, but I am not completely satisfied with the large size of the blade head.  </li>
            <li> I use other razors and just don&#x27;t get the close clean shave Gillette gives me.</li>
            <li> All the blades are sharp and clean, and have not cut me yet.  </li>
            <li> The other gillette brand I used was a lot easier to clean out.  </li>
            <li> The new flexball technology  has pivot action to help with curves (on your face or around your knees and ankles).</li>
            <li> I get upset when compmanies don&#x27;t make new models compatible with old.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to participate in a campaign through BzzAgent to review The new Fusion ProGlide Sensitive 2-in-1 Shave Gel and the Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball technology.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the folks at Gillette, I recently had the opportunity to try the new Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall handle technology in combination with the new Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 shave gel.  </li>
            <li> Considering that I&#x27;ve always been very careful to shave straight however, I was still a bit unsure how much of a difference this would really make.</li>
            <li> The flexibility and the track ball leave you with a smooth shave using less effort on your part.</li>
            <li> I must also say that it left me extremely smooth and gave me one of the closest shaves I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> This razor gives as smooth a shave as the previous versions of the razor, but</li>
            <li> If I was using my old razor, I would have to shave over the same area multiple times to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> While this razor provided the BEST shave I ever had it might be expensive for the average consumer.</li>
            <li> The gel is nice as well, very faint scent so not overpowering and provides good coverage of your face with just a little amount.</li>
            <li> The new Fusion ProGlide Sensitive 2-in-1 Shave Gel Plus Skin Care creates a shave experience with no mess, no rust and no guessing!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see it in action much on my face and in the end it really took no shorter time than with my other razors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the cost, for all that it does, this blade is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of razors and spent some serious money on the expensive models so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be impressed with the Proglide or not.</li>
            <li> pricing on razors is what always send me to the dollar store however this razor is lasting a long time with its 5 blades and will most likely surpass the value I thought I was getting with the cheapest ones</li>
            <li> The gel has a very smooth lotion like consistency which allowed this crazy sharp razor to glide smoothly over my face cleanly taking all of the hair in one pass with no pulling or hesitation.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide and the ProGlide razor with FlexBall thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I found I could live with cheaper alternatives, even if the shave was not perfectly smooth and totally comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t say that I really noticed any swivel on the razor, and kept shaving straight as I usually do, I can say that it felt very smooth on my face and no areas of extra pressure I may notice with my regular razor.</li>
            <li> The razor itself hugs your face like a magnet and the moisture strip provides just enough moisture to allow the razor to easily pivot around each curve, nook and cranny with careful precision.</li>
            <li> You can instantly feel a smoother, gliding cut that is even more effortless than the previous generation.</li>
            <li> It is fairly quick to shave with, so if you are in a hurry, it can be a solid choice to get a decent-enough shave to last you a business day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shaver especially for people who do designs or any type of artistic stuff with their facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other major cartridge based razors and found I received more irritation and a shave that left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> I originally chose electric both because I would cut myself every single time with a manual razor and because electric doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much.</li>
            <li> Same high quality I&#x27;ve come to enjoy from other Gillette razors, but</li>
            <li> The razor itself is pretty much just like any other mulit-blade razor on the market</li>
            <li> The gel is nice and thick, the shave is close (with both the Fusion razor and my previous razor, gave both a try) and my face feels fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> The Flexball Handle essentially now allows it to curve not only up &amp; down, but now left &amp; right as well, giving your new razor unprecedented facial comfort and coverage.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s because the regular Proglide works so well, that the difference is purely subjective to each user</li>
            <li> Finally, I have found one that I can live with!!</li>
            <li> When I used the original shaving cream the results were fine, but nothing I hadn&#x27;t received from other manual razors in the past.</li>
            <li> The handle itself is significantly thinner and sleeker than the previous model I owned.</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthy upgrade over other models.  </li>
            <li> After your shave feel free to go cut down a tree while fighting a bear!</li>
            <li> to say, since I usually buy my razors at the dollar store, that it is a very cool shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have had not cuts or nicks with this blade.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different razors, and Gillette is honestly the best shave I can find, the least irritating to my skin, and I can get almost a month out of the blades before they get dull.</li>
            <li> I had the 1st generation handle and really like the sleek new handle and really like the new black color of the handle itself.</li>
            <li> This ProGlide razor somehow managed to get most of the hairs on my cleft chin; any missed hairs were cleaned up using the single razor &amp;#34;Precision Trimmer&amp;#34;, which is just as sharp as the five blades on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also participated in a previous Gillette promotion where they were offering a battery-powered version of the same razor; it came with a button that you would press to turn on vibration--while it did feel kind of cool, it seemed all in all a little gimmicky to me; this is the same razor with just as good a shave for a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using the razor for a few shaves now, still on the original cartridge, and still only has positive things to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my skin feels great all day, even after working out or a crazy day at work.  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor if you have problems with cutting yourself while shaving.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide gives my straight edge a run for it&#x27;s money as far as closeness and takes only a fraction of the time to shave.</li>
            <li> The ProGlide mastered a smooth shave every time, without me having to drag the razor over the same patch of skin over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You might use it for more precise cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette user my whole adult life and was recently using the Power ProGlide before getting this one with the FlexBall.</li>
            <li> Plus since it doesn&#x27;t get clogged, so there a fewer instances of tapping it to clear it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for minimal face shaving, I can&#x27;t say that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball technology is a huge improvement over prior Fusion versions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for minimal face shaving, I can&#x27;t say that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball technology is a huge improvement over prior Fusion versions.  </li>
            <li> (I have incredibly sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I traditionally use a safety razor to shave, which means I take my time and am very deliberate with my movements, angle of blade / handle, and I shave twice (once with and once against the grain).  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a razor for sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t believe we are there quite yet.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaving kit, especially the gel in the dispenser thing</li>
            <li> So much in fact that I have given up my electric razor and gone back to these disposable blade razors.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it never leaves razor burn.</li>
            <li> Gel + Skin Care also thanks to Gillette with the Proglide Razor for the ultimate shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin prone to neck razor burn.</li>
            <li> Sensitive shave gel in Alpine scent.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;ve had no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> I received this razor and the Fusion for sensitive skin gel as part of a promotion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;1)The blades really glide along your skin, and they appear to last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten any cuts so far</li>
            <li> mdue to the flex action of the razor.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well this razor performed on my face.  </li>
            <li> but because he&#x27;s so adamant I stay away from his.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel.</li>
            <li> Hurts too much to shave with this monster (physically, not emotionally).</li>
            <li> I wanted to break it, even if it meant that I&#x27;d put my sensitive skin through hell just to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> three week old beard measured nearly a quarter inch at its longest, and the shortest hair would have been about 2-3 mm closer to where I would trim hairs to shape my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nicer $80 straight edge razor that does not require disposable blades has been a solid friend for over two years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My nicer $80 straight edge razor that does not require disposable blades has been a solid friend for over two years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Do you remember being a young kid and &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; alongside your dad using a spoon?  </li>
            <li> It did take a few strokes to get a completely smooth shave around my chin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a long-time cartridge razor user up until the last calendar year, I dealt with irritated skin, shaves that weren&#x27;t very close, and the cost of cartridge refills.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Heavy, in my eyes this is a pro, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap</li>
            <li> I used the sensitive skin gel from Gillette that came with, which I feel helped.</li>
            <li> A couple years back I started using a Schick Hydro and found it gave me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said all that, if you have problems with your shave - closeness, sensitive skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> It contours to the natural curves in my face and is truly a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin as well and did not have any problems with cuts or razor burn afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the smoothest, easiest, and quickest shave</li>
            <li> so far I like it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have been through about every razor,cream,gel, and after shave on the market.</li>
            <li> It passed all three tests seamlessly.</li>
            <li> I think I will return to using my old Trac II which has worked well for years and years, and let my wife have this razor for her legs.</li>
            <li> It hugged every curve of my face, not missing a spot.  </li>
            <li> Overall I really like this blade and handle.  </li>
            <li> was genuinely surprised with my results when I coupled this razor with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> That being said, I have fairly sensitive skin and find that shaving with cartridge razors, including this one, irritates my skin and does not leave me with as close a shave as my safety razor does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It catches all the stubble that my old razor could not.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does this razor cut very close, but the flexball allows it to contour to your face and remove hair evenly across all planes of your face (cheek bones, chin, etc.).</li>
            <li> This is really the next generation of razor technology.</li>
            <li> I was surprised-</li>
            <li> I use it along with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2in1 gel for sensitive skin and man</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Proglide from Gillette about two weeks ago and have used it so far about 5-6 times.</li>
            <li> This is an area that has always been a been sensitive to razors causing bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The Pro-Glide has really surprised me...</li>
            <li> I have been using it with Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel +</li>
            <li> But with the Gillette 2 in 1 sensitive shaving cream combined with the Flexball razor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the least enjoyable morning tasks imaginable</li>
            <li> I would hope that I would be able to get at least four or five shaves out of each razor.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but so far has held up.  </li>
            <li> so  far.  </li>
            <li> Cost of blades could pay for a Country Club membership, but if you really want the closest shave and easiest, this is likely it.</li>
            <li> I started to shave my head few years ago and have tried many different brands of razors found in markets or wholesale stores</li>
            <li> Also, they rarely have that weird lotion strip that seems to be the hallmark of most women&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li> Most of the hair was gone in one stroke, only a few times did I have to go over an area again</li>
            <li> The razor is professionally engineered to perform effortlessly in even the most stubborn of stubbles or delicate skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off to give you an idea of what kind of shaver I am, I maintain a beard while using the razor to keep the thick brush that constantly grows on my neck at bay.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t remember the last time i cut myself and these blades are fine and sharp.</li>
            <li> That sometimes happens to me when razors dull quickly after first 3 uses, but thankfully was not the case</li>
            <li> The combination easily handles a few millimeters of whiskers and, if past experience with the razor is an accurate guide, can clear a full-ish beard with a minimum of effort without needing the assistance of power tools.</li>
            <li> Now, this sounds like straight out of a paid advertisement where I&#x27;m pushing Gillette products, but I&#x27;m usually an automatic razor guy and don&#x27;t use manuals that much, but the combo of the razor and gel did make a big difference in getting a quick, painless and close shave.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am very happy and have found myself a new razor, definitely check it out you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are a bit more expensive, but they also last a pretty long time without significant deterioration in shave quality.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and soft, which is not easy for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it got the job done and was not bad per se, just not as good as the razor I previously used.</li>
            <li> With this new Proglide that i received for free from Gillette, the flex-ball allows the razor head to actuate correctly and hug the contours of my face to shave the areas I was struggling to reach in the past.</li>
            <li> Having very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve only been able to shave every 2 or 3 days in the past.</li>
            <li> Though I am an Asian male, so at most I shave once every other day.</li>
            <li> The razor is a little heavier than my old one, but I&#x27;ll take the better shave over this minor detail any day.</li>
            <li> while it did do a little better as far as following my face, I have been doing this long enough to where I already knew how to use my old razor to follow my face lines pretty well.</li>
            <li> This may mean that the product is really more geared towards those who shave rather quickly and with less care / precision than myself.  </li>
            <li> A great benefit since replacement blades are so expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this cream, I like that there is no mess</li>
            <li> so perhaps the flexball is useful if you&#x27;re using it on other parts of your body.</li>
            <li> The Gillete Fusion Proglide Manual razor offers little in terms of a true upgrade.</li>
            <li> the Flexball handle allows me to shave tough spots (chin/neck) very easily, with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you have sensitive skin such as myself.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days of use, it definitely shaves better than the previous ProGlide Power Razor I have been using for the last year or two.</li>
            <li> The only downside I saw was when I&#x27;d let my facial hair get out of control and didn&#x27;t trim first.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did give a decent shave, but overall it was only decent.</li>
            <li> But all in all a decent enough shave.</li>
            <li> do and that little convenient blade on the back of the shaver makes it easy to get the hairs under my nose</li>
            <li> the downside, I feel the lubricating strips don&#x27;t seem to last as long as my other razors, but I also tend to use a blade longer than most people would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found it was cool on my face and gave a little tingle.</li>
            <li> only other downside to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide is the ability to keep the razor head clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost effortless compared to other razors as it just slides right over the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> If you are a daily shaver like me, you&#x27;ll appreciate the necessity of a high quality razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially for head shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely well constructed and screams high quality.</li>
            <li> Gillette in my opinion has always produced high quality razors, this one is not different.</li>
            <li> This new model had a orange power LED, while the previous &amp;#34;silver tone&amp;#34; model had a cool blue LED.</li>
            <li> Since it has a five bladed head that is mounted on a handle, it is capable of lateral movement of about 20 degrees, so it is not limited to only face!</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s worth the little bit extra that Gillette wants for it.</li>
            <li> but I thought the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; piece to the razor I had been to be a little gimmicky and wasn&#x27;t sure how much it did.  </li>
            <li> The FlexBall makes it extremely comfortable wet or dry as I used it in the shower and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes considerably less strokes to get the hair on the back of my head and neck off completely smooth.</li>
            <li> This razor left my face very smooth and hardly any irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li> I also love the double sided razor the single blade helps me get those pesky areas that the 5 other blades just can&#x27;t reach.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle truly is mess free, and there was not the slightest bit of gel left on the nozzle after applying to my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always leery of switching razors in general because I know my old ones work.</li>
            <li> The final shave was actually smoother than my old vibrating razor ever accomplished.  </li>
            <li> My only negative is the trim blade on the back of the razor does not give an effective close up shave for sideburns and under the nose.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it is any different than what I normally use, but I am a brand person</li>
            <li> Now, I have used other Fusion blades in the past, so I kind of knew what I was getting there.  </li>
            <li> I have since found several razors that work pretty much just as well--all for cheaper (sometimes quite a bit cheaper) than what a typical Proglide razor will cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a deal breaker but the electric model is a little bit more ergonomic and doesn&#x27;t slip out of wet hands.</li>
            <li> For this reason I have been a long time user of Gillette razors because they seem to minimize my razor burn, I definitely could never use a cheap disposable single blade razor, it would leave cuts on my face for a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used safety razors in the past, and when using a safety razor, you want a light touch and loose grip so as not to put much pressure on the skin, which results in nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a new razor definitely try this one out</li>
            <li> I grew a beard for 4 months and decided to finally shave it off for spring using the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> and I plan on buying it the next time I need a new shaved.</li>
            <li> Even with a brand new razor I don&#x27;t get the same ease of</li>
            <li> The new thinner blades last longer and the shave gel works well</li>
            <li> ProGlide Flexball has features similar to my ProGlide Power except for one new feature – FlexBall Technology.</li>
            <li> Truth be told I prefer the traditional razor to this new fangled one.  </li>
            <li> I recently got a chance to audition the new Gillette Fusion Proglide razor, but with &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, a manual razor I can live with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really big fan of this new generation of the Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology.</li>
            <li> The Excel has always provided a clean, close shave but with the downside of raw, reddish, irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The simple vibrating seems to really help with the overall experience of the shave, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Gillette did a fantastic job of keeping the blades thin, thinner than the Excel blades, but they do still command a bit of real estate.  </li>
            <li> My fiance absolutely loves the fact that I shaved my entire face, and that there is no razor burns, or bumps, or any hair left over.</li>
            <li> The 5-blades and microcomb allow for a smooth shave and remain resilient after repeated uses, but because the lubristrip wears out after only a few uses, the cartridge needs to be replaced sooner than I would like.</li>
            <li> I typically look for coupons and rare discounts and then buy the cartridges in bulk (2 year supply), because they are so expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> years, I gave up the closeness of a blade shave and used an electric razor because most of the blades were too irritating to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The only negative to this is the claim of “post shave goo” on the top of the container.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more expensive but flexball makes shaving much easier and quicker in the morning.</li>
            <li> downside though is that it took a while, at least 20 minutes just for one side of my face, so maybe not so great for thick beards, or if you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just need a few quick swipes of the neck and cheeks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for daily use especially for people with sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> Despite this small setback, I didn&#x27;t find it to be too much of a hassle due to how easily the Fusion Proglide moves over the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my old Fusion handles, certain areas of my neck would require multiple passes from multiple different angles to get every stray whisker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for a long time, and they finally added something to the razor that is worth trading up from their traditional razor!</li>
            <li> have used several of the Gillette family of cartridge razors in the past and have found most of them to be very similar from my shaving experiences with them.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette sending me a Fusion proglide with flexball technology, I can finally stop buying the cheap razors that only last for half a shave and/or cut me several times.</li>
            <li> It has that single blade on the back which worked a little, but i didn&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I have a cleft chin, and with razors in the past, it has been a mission to clean up hairs in the cleft.</li>
            <li> The Proglide works so well, that it only takes a few quick strokes to complete my shave.</li>
            <li> Now I normally use the Gillette Fusion Power and this was a non-power version of the flexball, so I was a little scared at first to go back (to a non-powered).</li>
            <li> The razor gently and effortlessly removed tough facial hair leaving my face perfectly smooth and without razor burn.</li>
            <li> The razor cuts all the hair on the first stroke, even in hard to reach places thanks to the flex ball.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got those places on my face and neck that are hard to get a close shave for, and I usually have to go over and over those places just to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> and I was sure that have to trim it down a little with my electric razor before using the manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shaving is not something I generally look forward to.</li>
            <li> it has enough blades to perfectly clear a path in</li>
            <li> The flexball looks very durable and long lasting</li>
            <li> I would advise trimming excessive long hair as is needed prior to using most razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the blades that come with the razor last longer than my old razor&#x27;s as well.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised to find that it definitely was.  </li>
            <li> : The handle is sturdy and the rubber grips are very helpful when shaving in the shower or just have wet hands.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Men&#x27;s Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology has replaced my electric razor completely and blade cartridges last for about a month.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m used to it, I do notice a difference in comfort if I have to go back to a fixed handle.</li>
            <li> Never have i used a razor that left my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> will recommend buying and will buy in the near future</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of 5-blade razors, however the flex ball really does the job well.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to my old razor.</li>
            <li> The flexball did take some getting used to, but afterwards it was a very neat idea that allowed you to get those harder areas around the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mineral oil from the lubristrips also left my skin feeling soft and irritation-free.</li>
            <li> I would prefer if they left it off completely, and I have never heard anyone say they buy Gillette blades because of their lubricating</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan to go back to my old razor or shaving gel again.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son is the person who has never shaved but has the beginnings of &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; above his lip so I have been trying to get him to try it out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been in the shave game for many years</li>
            <li> I had seen this product before , but never tried because I thought it was kind of expensive for a razor</li>
            <li> However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it leaves behind more trouble than it feels worth it.  </li>
            <li> but it did not seem to do any better or worse that my non-flexball razor.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me a couple months to grow something that resembles anything close to a full beard.</li>
            <li> There is no significant drag on my skin, and the blades glides easily across all parts of my face.</li>
            <li> There is no significant drag on my skin, and the blades glides easily across all parts of my face.</li>
            <li> but they have solved the problem by placing additional super tiny little gap fillers between each razor so that 1.</li>
            <li> But the first time I used this razor, I did so with about a month of growth on my face and didn&#x27;t trim it down at all before shaving.</li>
            <li> I strongly encourage you to give it a try, especially for those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> It gets so close with no little stubble left over.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t hesitate to give a low rating to a product that doesn&#x27;t live up to the claims made regarding it, or if it falls short of my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have been a Gillette fan for sometime, and will never go back to a different razor since this new Proglide Flexball as came into my life.</li>
            <li> The scent was certainly evocative of an ocean breeze and plays well with those of the other similarly-themed products I use.</li>
            <li> The new FlexBall allows for long shaving strokes that match the contour of your face.</li>
            <li> The razor hugs every curve of my face and gently glides over every bump and crook in my next without a single slice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so stiff and I am not afraid that I am going to cut myself because like I self it moves with the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> I tend to grow my facial hair out and shave once a week and by doing so, I notice that the lubricating strip begins to fade right after the first shave and typically wears down in about four shaves.  </li>
            <li> IT HAS MADE WHAT WAS A CHORE, INTO A VERY SIMPLE TASK AND TAKES ABOUT HALF THE TIME TO DO A BETTER JOB THAN MY PREVIOUS RAZOR, WHICH IS NOW IN THE TRASH.</li>
            <li> The appearance of the razor is sleek and sexy but nothing out of the ordinary compared to other Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many razors in the past including other gillette models</li>
            <li> What stands out is the FlexBall handle which swivels slightly when you push the razor head to the left or right.  </li>
            <li> , If you have problems with irritation due to razors that make you constantly pass over the same areas to get a clean shave I would highly suggest that you give this one a shot, and as previously mentioned the Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> I dry my razor after every use and the strip right above the razors looks all dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I have thick stubble around my chin mainly, and the grain of the hair on the right of my neck goes up, leading to constant razor burn.  </li>
            <li> One of the things I like about this razor is that I don&#x27;t get cut even when I shave fast, that is not the case with other brands.</li>
            <li> Other three blade cartridges seem to be much easier to rinse out, extending the life of the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades are made very well and give an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference form other Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> one pet peeve is it can be hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using his razor for quite some time but really don&#x27;t find any difference between it and other razors, the blades are what make the difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as sharp and does not hug your face, but it&#x27;s much cheaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you could only figure out how to make that blue strip not get all dry and cracked so fast, this could get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> For those times I have traditionally relied on  the triple blade disposable that nearly always left me nicked and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure if there is a single negative to report back.</li>
            <li> The major difference is the ball, it does help with getting closer in same areas.  </li>
            <li> But my experience was a less than positive one.</li>
            <li> handle is a bit on the heavy size, but that is actually a benefit as it seems to impart a little more control.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer the Power to this unit (ever so slightly) and this is the first and last thing I grab when the batteries run out!</li>
            <li> I recently received this as part of a promotional package and was very skeptical because I haven&#x27;t had a pleasant shave in over a decade.</li>
            <li> Makes my face smoother with less strokes, with other razors I have to go over and over my face to get a clean close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and i recommend you give it a try you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This razor is great and will not leave you disappointed.</li>
            <li> Whether you are shaving your face or other areas, you really just have to guide the razor and no longer need to worry about proper angle.  </li>
            <li> The can is cool, not a kind of material that will rust or leave the goo all over.</li>
            <li> As a man who shaves everyday, buying razors can be pretty costly.  </li>
            <li> And the shave was consistent regardless of whether I was shaving a few days of growth or over a week.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly like the power version sans the gimmicky oscillations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first think I noted was how heavy the product is.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone as it is worth the price as one blade usually lasts 2 weeks if you shave every 2 days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all but its not amazing.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that with my old razor having a battery in it that it would be as heavy, if not a little heavier.  </li>
            <li> Decent price for the actual razor (which is roughly $10).</li>
            <li> I was getting the same shave with the flexball razor that I do with other razors with the only difference being that it took less strokes to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is plain simple evolution of your everyday razor :)</li>
            <li> The ball does help a little in molding to my face, but if I let my beard grow out more than usual</li>
            <li> This particular shaver has kept it&#x27;s edge longer than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have never had an issue with the blade going dull quickly.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and have never really liked shaving very much.  </li>
            <li> I also like the button for releasing the blades which makes for easy, convenient shaving, especially when I am running late for work!</li>
            <li> The price of the cartridges are very high and, in my opinion, not worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> , the bottle can&#x27;t rust (which is always gross with other bottles), the guage to tell you what is left is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Also the blue strip stays clean and soft longer than with other razors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Gillette has made me a new lifelong customer.  </li>
            <li> Just a FYI, I apply a little bit of mineral oil to the blades after shaving to keep it clean, sharp, and rust-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly doubt I will be using any other razors in my house after my experience with this one.</li>
            <li> This razor is so easy to use that it&#x27;s hard to miss a single hair!</li>
            <li> Disposable razors, or even a real razor with less flexibility just can&#x27;t rival the agility of this razor head that manages to pick every hair up.</li>
            <li> This feels much sturdier than a typical razor, and you can tell that they wanted to put this in another class.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The less advertised improvements are where the real beauty is.</li>
            <li> In reality, I noticed absolutely ZERO difference in how close the razor shaved than my previous Proglide without the</li>
            <li> I am also surprised how long the blades last.</li>
            <li> If you have one of the 3 Blade razors like a Mach3 or earlier (or that other brand I never liked), it&#x27;s definitely worth the upgrade to go straight to the ProGlide Power Razor with FlexBall.</li>
            <li> Long story short, my dollar razors continue to collect dust in my cabinet while my 15 year old brother buys me 5 extra Gillette razor heads for Christmas.</li>
            <li> a little easier to get certain places that i usually am turning the razor all different direction to get just right.</li>
            <li> The shaving experience is much smoother than with my previous razor, especially on the rougher parts of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically have trouble getting a close smooth around my chin.  </li>
            <li> Try to invent a razor that will not get dull within the first 2 uses!</li>
            <li> No more trying to wrap my left hand over the back right side of my head while facing downwards trying to get that spot at the part of my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually rushed, so I use a pretty high end electric, but my fiance on the other hand uses a cartridge razor for her legs/etc.  </li>
            <li> The FlexBall is unique but not sure why they call it FlexBall when it really is not a ball</li>
            <li> 5 blades is a little too much for me.</li>
            <li> it felt a little too much.  </li>
            <li> Gillette has put a lot of marketing power into this new &#x27;Flexball&#x27; razor - from endless ads to even sending me this sample to review.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the new flexball razor would help get me a smoother shave quicker than the other razors.  </li>
            <li> The head is shared with other Gillette razors so no need for buying new heads if you already are a Gillette Fusion user.</li>
            <li> A little of the gel goes a long way which helps to negate the higher price for this product.</li>
            <li> Really, I try to shave as little as possible.  </li>
            <li> Yes they may be a little more expensive but really, you are shaving</li>
            <li> Again, because the razor head is relatively large and not easily maneuvered there.  </li>
            <li> well the first couple of times, but literally after 10 uses it still works really well and the rotating neck doesn&#x27;t slow down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look to see if I can find the cartridges at the right price (equivalent or less than other options).</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time getting the right angle on the left side of my face.</li>
            <li> Now if you could buy a tiny vacuum for these razors we might be onto something revolutionary.</li>
            <li> Normally, when I use a new razor, I get nicked at least once; I didn&#x27;t have any problems with this razor.</li>
            <li> My only two complaint about the razor itself is when shaving my mustache area is that it doesn&#x27;t catch every hair, just one or two right below my nostrils would stay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After half of a swipe of the razor, it was ready to be rinsed to remove the long hairs from between the blades.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades are definitely a plus and reduces pull and tug that I would normally have from a razor with less blades.</li>
            <li> The razor is easy to hold and has a sturdy base to allow you to safely put it down.</li>
            <li> It also stung a little bit more than other plain gels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> but so far I feel Fusion ProGlide razors last the longest comparing to all other brands I tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this family uses the razor, none of us think it is any better or worse than any other cartridge razor out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got ten whole shaves out of this little beastie!</li>
            <li> With the advent of the Dollar Shave Club and some other cheaper competitors, it is just not price conscious to buy these anymore.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started shaving I&#x27;ve always had issues with razor burn due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin there was absolutely no way that I could shave every day!</li>
            <li> But since I don&#x27;t shower and shave out in public for all to see (at least not often), I&#x27;m not too worried about people gocking at the sight of my big orange blade ;)</li>
            <li> I noticed the blades got a little gunked up easy and a little difficult to clean, but manageable.</li>
            <li> Handle really feels no different to me than any other razor, not worth paying extra for the flex-ball gimmick&lt;</li>
            <li> My one complaint would be that the cartridges are not cheap, but when considering the amount saved on not using a new one every day, the cost is certainly worth it.</li>
            <li> I receive the Active Sport Fusion ProGlide Sensitive 2-in-1</li>
            <li> I also tried the Gillette Fusion Pro-glide Sensitive Gel in the Active Sport scent.</li>
            <li> have also tried the Gillette Fusion Pro-glide Sensitive Gel in the Active Sport scent.  </li>
            <li> I must have a thicker than average beard, because if I have any growth at all I can only take about ¼ inch strokes before the blades are completely clogged and have to rinse it out.</li>
            <li> The only downside I have found is that the smoothness of my face doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long.</li>
            <li> they last long since I only shave about once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> As for the flexball head, I normally have issues around my jawline, and have to make a few passes to get a proper shave.</li>
            <li> Only down fall to the razor is that the razor grabbed my goatee every time i was shaving near it.</li>
            <li> This is designed so that as you near the last half of supply, you can monitor as you are about to run out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades cut better which means less time irritating your face</li>
            <li> Alright so I have tried a lot of razors, I typically go for the cheaper brands because I didn&#x27;t think there was enough difference between a cheap razor and higher priced razor to warrant the extra money, boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> It was subtle but appealing—just the right amount of fragrance.  </li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;m really not sure if it made that much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> Not sure the ball thing is really a need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming pink plastic is more expensive than gray, but I have no research to back this up.</li>
            <li> I usually use this gel when shaving with my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much of it is the razor design (flexball) vs. the cartridge...</li>
            <li> I did like the razor, not sure about the breakthrough tech that much.</li>
            <li> I’ve finally met the cliché ridden baby’s butt, which I’d long ago written off as being a fable like the proverbial unicorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up.</li>
            <li> Blade last long</li>
            <li> my flat razor couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I also forgot to add how long that they actually last.</li>
            <li> However, I can see the mechanics of this razor not lasting long</li>
            <li> This was the true test of these amazingly thin blades.  </li>
            <li> The pivoting motion of this amazing tactical knife of a razor forces the blades to go in the right direction, cutting down your thick forest of facial hair like it was clearing for a strip mall!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be switching to this razor and using it for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> They seem not to last very long and already need to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> The single blade on the back of the razor head is somewhat hard to use and doesn&#x27;t really seem necessary.</li>
            <li> This product has made those difficult areas easy to shave.</li>
            <li> The flexball technology makes it easy to shave the curvy and difficult to reach spots on face.</li>
            <li> Usually when companies upgrade their product it&#x27;s minor and doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the less</li>
            <li> The gel wasn&#x27;t entirely needed but it made shaving a breeze as I wasn&#x27;t even sure I was cutting hair from my face</li>
            <li> I keep thinking I&#x27;m going to step up from the stick razors to the electric razors, and I&#x27;ve spent several hundred on the electrics, but I just keep coming back to the sticks.</li>
            <li> My face is sensitive to products that are too heavily perfumed and that do not offer enough protection from the razor.  </li>
            <li> Flip the razor around and you have a single blade trimmer on the back...</li>
            <li> I especially like the single blade precision trimmer to work on the edge underneath my nose.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that often looks like a blotchy mess after a razor shave.</li>
            <li> I mean I like vibrating objects as much as the next guy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still skeptical that my long hairs would get stuck in the blade, I kept my straight razor ready</li>
            <li> This is where I was most disappointed with the new Proglide.  </li>
            <li> that said, I was skeptical when first trying the new Proglide Flexball razor; which I received from Gillette for gratis.</li>
            <li> I know humidity plays a large role and since moving to Oregon razors do seem to dull faster.  </li>
            <li> I use my straight razor, I usually make a single pass against the grain (I know, some of you may think I have a death wish).</li>
            <li> Also has the same simple push-pop removable head that we&#x27;ve become accustom to with other razors.    </li>
            <li> Sharp blades, which are key of course, and last for two or three dozen shaves.</li>
            <li> have been using it daily or every other day for the last 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any better contact over contours, or anywhere for that matter, than any other razors, expensive or inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with FlexBall technology provides a decent shave, feels hefty in my hand, and is offered at a comparable price point, but I&#x27;m not sure about the FlexBall technology.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the flexball feature is beneficial yet mainly because it seems like a non-issue to me.</li>
            <li> There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far.</li>
            <li> (I have incredibly sensitive skin) with little wrist contortion.</li>
            <li> However, I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the razor tended to be difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is no exception and works well, but does seem to dull rather fast like others.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other brands, this special flex ball handle gets the hard to reach areas by your chin and neck that the other razors could never reach for me.</li>
            <li> I use the old razor mainly because the blades on newer razors are way too expensive, especially compared to picking up some double bladed razors.</li>
            <li> My only available method to clean the razor is the weak spray that is my sad little shower head, or risk dulling the blades by brushing them with my hand.</li>
            <li> Gillette is getting to desperate trying to sell more razors.</li>
            <li> kind of makes it ugly in my opinion.</li>
            <li> As I lose more hair up there, I keep cutting it shorter and shorter.  </li>
            <li> The flexible head had me skeptical at first, but after seeing it in action I was sold.  </li>
            <li> End result - One of closest shaves I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> The closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I did it once and went back to my wet shave kit.</li>
            <li> This razor could be a replacement for my Gillette Mach 3 which i have been using for as long as i can remember.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette razors for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> My facial hair tends to grow in patchy and uneven, so hairs are at different angles and of various lengths.</li>
            <li> I was so worried about getting razor burn after not shaving for so long, but not a scrape or scratch.</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and if I do not leave a few days between shaves</li>
            <li> oh, it&#x27;s a long name.</li>
            <li> But as long as I don&#x27;t see blood, I keep using it &#x3D;-).  </li>
            <li> It was heavy, nearly 2 oz without the cartridge.</li>
            <li> I have used gillette fusion power for a long time now.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel irritation but that is to be expected from a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> but he thinks it&#x27;s because his hair was so long on his face.</li>
            <li> This ball like razor is something that I have been waiting for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette razors for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really one of the first razors I&#x27;ve used that I don&#x27;t have to manually adjust myself (not that it&#x27;s very difficult) to shave the different spots of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired</li>
            <li> The user of this razor with the FlexBall technology only has to provide minimal pressure and the FlexBall does the rest.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bleade since using it and have been shaving roughly 5 to 6 times a week.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, if I go for too long without shaving, the ProGlide feels like it is tearing the whiskers out of my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hassle, takes a good chunk of my morning away, all the while cutting myself in small, minute places.</li>
            <li> Also, the trimmer works very well for me with my medium to slightly thick hair.</li>
            <li> I found that the shave was much closer, and actually a little less &amp;#34;accurate&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using the same blade for over a month now and its still very sharp and does not tug or pull on my facial hair.</li>
            <li> It could be from the new lubrastrip design, it&#x27;s a little bit larger than previous models or the spacing of the blades.</li>
            <li> and I was a bit skeptical of how much of a difference the new hinge would make</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if the differences are in the blades or in the new FlexBall head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using old style single blade safety razors for a few years now to shave my head and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products with the same number of blades, and those razors typically lasted a week because I would need to shave over my facial hair numerous times.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical that a little ball underneath the blade cartridge could really make a difference in my shave.</li>
            <li> The blade does not seem to dull after the first few weeks of using this, so I am definitely impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Definitely check out your major retailers and check in the coupon section because they usually have coupons for this brand.</li>
            <li> It takes only one swipe with the razor to do what took two or three with other razors</li>
            <li> So if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re concerned about or haven&#x27;t mastered with other razors then this is definitely for you</li>
            <li> I suspect this is due to the larger size of the razor cartridge.</li>
            <li> I like the design and the fact that this one is a bit smaller than the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I only have to shave once every other day.</li>
            <li> The extra movement in the razor head took a little getting used to, but it actually made my shaving faster and easier.  </li>
            <li> In truth, I have been a &amp;#34;Shaving snob&amp;#34; in the past going for the old fashion double edge razor and wet shave gear.</li>
            <li> These Proglide cartridges seem to last longer than my other non Gillette cartridges also.</li>
            <li> The treated strip also left my face feeling refreshed, while not leaving that just shaved burning feeling that other razors tend to do.</li>
            <li> Though it was an improvement over other gels I have used, the foam crud that accumulates was still present post-shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could only shave with the grain here and very carefully at that.  </li>
            <li> I am also a fan of the single blade for getting sharp lines on my facial hair.</li>
            <li> When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel.</li>
            <li> shaved dry and didn&#x27;t have any burn as well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that post-shave, my skin doesn&#x27;t seem too dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewd several razors in the last few months.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; edge on the back seems like a waste to me, but that may be a personal preference.</li>
            <li> A straight-edged razor would also be preferable, I think, but I still give the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor high marks, at least for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this product at least once</li>
            <li> and it seemingly doesn&#x27;t get any easier because I nick myself every single time.</li>
            <li> - most likely because I am not used to the flexball and frankly a little scared of it and cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> At around $4 dollars per cartridge, it will get very expensive very quickly for anyone with thicker facial hair.</li>
            <li> Once you try this razor, its hard to go back to the standard double razor.</li>
            <li> the other side, though, unaccustomed as I am to a razor that pivots, when I tried to shave in a normal manner, the pivot ball moved, allowing the blades to slide sideways across my head, leaving a small slice in the skin.</li>
            <li> It took fewer swipes than razors I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I attribute that directly to the 5 blade system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I was never really able to shave with a razor because my skin would get so irritated and bearable.</li>
            <li> My shaving technique has me holding the razor handle loosely with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> This razor is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found where the head doesn&#x27;t just swivel up and down, but from side to side.</li>
            <li> There were still some areas where it was a little tough to reach but was way better than razors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I’ve never been able to  get past the price of the expensive blades to ever try them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Generally, we&#x27;re pretty harsh critics, but as of yet I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.  </li>
            <li> Typically, a razor will last me just one shave before drawing blood with each stroke.</li>
            <li> I do like the overall heavier feel of the handle, but all-in-all this razor is a zero-gain from the previous versions.</li>
            <li> With other razors I have to go other some places multiple times to get all the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> The multiple blades will get you an extremely close shave without the razor rash of some other razors.</li>
            <li> I found in both dry and wet shaving</li>
            <li> I will not go back to the previous version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it truly added anything to the shave versus the previous generation Fusion Proglide razor (not the pulsing one, the regular).</li>
            <li> I would constantly find small patches that were missed, even though I went over that area several times.</li>
            <li> problem with the razor is that the shave head is so large (5 blades and the comfort strip) that&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s hard to get it into tight corners.</li>
            <li> This razor could be a replacement for allllllll my other razors which i have been using for as long as i can remember.</li>
            <li> have a tough, thick beard that grows back fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The inclusion of a single-blade on the back of the blade makes trimming sideburn edges and tight spaces easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the single blade on back as well for a few spots I don&#x27;t want to drag 5 across.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the commercials and was pretty skeptical about the claims that they made thinking that it would just be the same as any other razor.</li>
            <li> , personally, couldn&#x27;t find any benefit to the little Flexball.</li>
            <li> flexball swivel takes a little getting used to, but after a few shaves it feels natural to use.</li>
            <li> It seems to be lasting longer than his other razors typically do.</li>
            <li> I was comfortable shaving with it as the ball head turns to prevent cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> I was comfortable shaving with it as the ball head turns to prevent cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> However, if you have more than 3 days growth you might be in for a painful experience.</li>
            <li> It slides smoothly against my skin and hugs the curves of my face with out cutting or scratching up my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t make notes of the packaging prior to throwing it away, so there&#x27;s nothing I can really write about in that regard.</li>
            <li> and it seems to make it harder to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Save your money and your face by getting a safety razor and wet shaving.</li>
            <li> tried out the razor over the course of a few weeks, with different lengths of time between shaving.  </li>
            <li> The weighty handle gives a feeling of quality and you provides confidence that the razor will deliver as expected.</li>
            <li> Not really anything else to ask for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Schick Hydro 5 for the last few years, and a Mach 3 before that,</li>
            <li> In fact, the way the flexball is structured makes me think it is set up to be obsolete in a few years of constant use as the metal strip that aids</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re looking at this product thinking to yourself, that ball in the center is a gimmick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are also allegedly improved, and I would have to agree.</li>
            <li> let the gel sit on my face for roughly two to three minutes to soften my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are expensive but, Worth it.</li>
            <li> My face is not a bit rough at all after shaving.</li>
            <li> It performed as expected it conformed to the contours of my face</li>
            <li> There is no pulling or rough sensation.</li>
            <li> and the rubber kept the razor from slipping.</li>
            <li> well they are razor blades not much to them</li>
            <li> aspect that left me missing my ProGlide Power was the factor that the ProGlide Flexball was not battery powered.</li>
            <li> Shaving to me is one of those things I really do not look forward to....ever.</li>
            <li> I am not very convinced that the swivel of the ball helps any.</li>
            <li> i like how it don&#x27;t have my skin feeling all itching and feeling rough</li>
            <li> The refill blades are expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I had the same trouble spots on both of them.          </li>
            <li> and she found the pivoting head made it easier for the harder to reach places as well.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> When I tested the Fusion ProGlide razor for a few days, I was very presently surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades last for quite a few shaves as well.</li>
            <li> I used this product in a few different ways.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to be careful with my shaving.</li>
            <li> The rubber grips allowed it to be controlled with ease no matter how wet it was.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using the standard fusion pro glide for the past 3 years, and let me tell you, this is definitely an upgrade.  </li>
            <li> If there are improvements, it&#x27;s marginal, but it&#x27;s certainly not a step backwards or anything like that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because the scent of the gel was a little overpowering to me, but my sense of smell is pretty sensitive so it may not be bad for others.</li>
            <li> That is not saying the other one is bad, this one is just that much better.  </li>
            <li> My only criticism with this razor is it is difficult to clean when soap scum builds up.</li>
            <li> One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li> One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li> With the ProGlide, I don’t have to worry about attracting sharks and vampires, or walking around with little pieces of toilet paper all over my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have rough hair, so sometimes using other razors i would get cuts, with this one, i don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel any single blade pressing down on my skin at any time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel any single blade pressing down on my skin at any time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whether or not the FlexBall is making the difference vs the cartridge is a hard thing to tell just yet, but I do know I saw a surprisingly big improvement with shaving 2-3 day stubble without the blade pulling when I moved from the standard previous model ProGlide Manual razor to the ProGlide Power Razor.</li>
            <li> It makes it only a little less desirable as a travel razor if you are trying to save weight.  </li>
            <li> The precision trimmer on the back of the razor is also slightly improved, now having a little comb guard.  </li>
            <li> The electrics were not perfect, and were rather expensive since most of them did not last long or required yearly head replacements, but they irritated me less.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long the blade will stay sharp but its been almost a week now and its still cutting my beard fine.</li>
            <li> The blades stay sharp and cut with ease.</li>
            <li> on the other hand, I can change blades in a safety razor for a dime</li>
            <li> I find hairs build up between the 4 blades due to how close they are set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The jury is still out on whether the results are enough to get me to rethink my spending but, all costsaside, there is no better cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> I now shave every other day because it&#x27;s so close.</li>
            <li> With the plastic can it does not rust like every other one, as I shave in the shower and leave the can in there.</li>
            <li> As someone who has been ignoring all innovation in shaving and sticking exclusively with the Gillette Mach 3, I was clearly skeptical when first trying out the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball technology.</li>
            <li> It gives an extremely close shave with out any razor burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Gillettes Venus razor (the pink girlie one thats twice the price!)</li>
            <li> The ball that makes the head pivot seemed like a silly gimmick at first.</li>
            <li> When it came time to define the beard, I used the other side, which has the one blade, and it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cartridges are compatible with other Fusion Proglide handles.</li>
            <li> and I have sharp cheekbones</li>
            <li> , the blades didn&#x27;t clog up with hair like other multi-blade disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Definitely not as much tug and pull as well!</li>
            <li> I attribute this to the power capability though as I had noticed this on my power version when my battery died and I was too lazy to get another one, my shave wouldn&#x27;t seem to last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use an electric razor due to my skin normally irritating from razor blades.</li>
            <li> The flexible nature of the razor rocked on my legs and other lady shaving points.</li>
            <li> I will not buy any other razor from now on.  </li>
            <li> I used to change blades every other day because it seemed that the other blades didn&#x27;t shave well unless I did.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t cut myself once, even with a couple of birthmarks and other &amp;#34;tough spots&amp;#34; on my neck and face.  </li>
            <li> There are a few minor gripes I have.  </li>
            <li> After shaving I could see that I had gotten the cleanest and smoothest shave I have ever seen due its flex ball adapting to the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> I even shaved \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;, which is something I cannot do with other razors I have tried.</li>
            <li> I shaved with a 6 day stubble face the other day</li>
            <li> Ive used other 3-4 blades the you have to smack out every swipe.</li>
            <li> sharp blades maybe?,</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to deal with upper lip and around the small of my chin, so</li>
            <li> While I initially saw this as gimmicky, I truly have noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the razor under multiple conditions over the past three weeks: 1 day shave, 3 day shave, and 1 week shave.</li>
            <li> is the shaver to get close to what the other 5 blades can not do.</li>
            <li> I used a similar Gillette Fusion Proglide razor in the past but it had a vibration feature to it, which I did not like.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to be my savior, but as it turns out after several shaves it performs no better than my Gillette Fusion Power.  </li>
            <li> This razor out does any other.</li>
            <li> The blades are really sharp.</li>
            <li> While it takes  time, it is extremely close.</li>
            <li> THE BLADES HAVE REMAINED SHARP AND IT EVEN TAKES THE HAIR OUT OF  MY CLEFT CHIN WITHOUT A HITCH OR NICK.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me an extremely close shave without nicking myself.</li>
            <li> The thing I was extremely please about was how they designed the blades.</li>
            <li> The Gillette razor shaves circles around the other one.  </li>
            <li> I would say it works as well as other Gillette razors and other premium brands.</li>
            <li> If I could afford to buy these all the time, I wouldn&#x27;t use any other razor.</li>
            <li> burn that I could not get with any other shaver</li>
            <li> Before this razor i was shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp</li>
            <li> With the shaving gel, I haven&#x27;t noticed a substantial difference between Gillette&#x27;s gel versus some other brands.</li>
            <li> The lone trimming razor on the other side stays consistently sharp and allows me to trim my sideburns with ease.</li>
            <li> I usually get cut, especially with my boxy face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All too often, it&#x27;s to nick a tough area with a brand new razor, but I didn&#x27;t have that issue with this one.</li>
            <li> The lathered gel can dry out a little bit</li>
            <li> This razor does an amazing job at cutting close and leaving nothing behind.</li>
            <li> While my skin does still dry out after a few days shaving with this, I have had almost no problem with razor burn or cuts with the Fusion Proglide, so +1 for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never happy with my shaving options, and am in constant search for &amp;#34;the ultimate shave&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super east to glide around awkward curves.</li>
            <li> However, the shave was less than what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It was so uncomfortable I stopped using it halfway through the shave and went back to my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You have to press down a little firmer for the cream to come out, but it sprays out in smaller amount to avoid waste.</li>
            <li> Pricing on this shaving system, including refill cartridges, is comparable to other products but the value of what you get for your hard earned dollar goes further with Gillette.  </li>
            <li> My skin usually requires a break before the next shave and shaving short stubble after a few days usually results in pain.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this gives a smoother shave, but it&#x27;s a little wide for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get the closeness with less shave strokes and less drag on your face.</li>
            <li> but it was about half of the strokes I take with other manual razors.  </li>
            <li> I do usually keep somewhat of a beard and if its been a little while since my last shave, it can be a lot of work.  </li>
            <li> Well, I tried this shaver while trying hard NOT to flex any facial muscle, and guess what?</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first thinking this was just another shaver.</li>
            <li> The FlexBall especially feels like i am getting to all the hard to reach places and getting an even shave.</li>
            <li> It did not feel any different than the razor that I was currently using and maybe just a little bit worse.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and thick facial hair, which is a tough combination to have.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I mean that it subtly pivots when needed, but you won&#x27;t really notice it.  </li>
            <li> Problem is, with the curvature of one&#x27;s melon, not to mention the angles you need to get at, it&#x27;s next to impossible (for me at least) to get a clean, even shave all over the cranial</li>
            <li> My wife said the razor &amp;#34;looked like a superhero.&amp;#34; The dark and orange color scheme is nice.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I have been sampling several razors lately, and this one did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> In terms of the razor, it was average.</li>
            <li> The ball works very well to get the weird corners of my face -</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cost of refills but this can be minimized if you keep your eye out for sales.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have thick facial hair</li>
            <li> With my thick unmanageable beard it still left me cut up.</li>
            <li> The fact that it pivots in all directions helped keep the 5 micro blades firmly on my face, getting every bit of stubble but did not create any rough spots or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had far less stubble than usual and it seemed like I shaved a little less than usual.</li>
            <li> The cut seems closer and less irritating than the old fusion.</li>
            <li> But in the end, it all comes down to one thing</li>
            <li> Is your beard beating you down?</li>
            <li> This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck.</li>
            <li> But in the end, it all comes down to one thing…</li>
            <li> Down strokes, across the grain, done.</li>
            <li> I did bump it down one star for costs but trust me</li>
            <li> Once again Gillette did not let me down.</li>
            <li> But this razor chopped down anything in its path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> seem to stay sharp a little longer than others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I mean it only has to cut hair?</li>
            <li> The Flexball handle seems to twist just enough to keep the cutting surface flat against my face and neck at all times, eliminating the need for extra passes.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is a little large which makes some detail work difficult, like around the nostrils.</li>
            <li> I can usually get about 3 months of shaving from a single Hydro 5 cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed it was less prone to run down my face and neck or drip.</li>
            <li> Since that time I&#x27;ve tried a few other cartridge-type razors with replacements offered at a fraction of Gillette&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> One problem I have had with other razors is the blade popping off when I would tap it to rinse after a few strokes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed less redness and irritation with the Fusion ProGlide than I have seen in a while.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has an invigorating feeling that follows its application to your slightly moist skin.  </li>
            <li> They are also slightly wider than the Excel.  </li>
            <li> I also had slight difficulty under the jaw where the skin dips.  </li>
            <li> and I notice the difference from previous iterations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the rotating head on it though and felt it made the razor unnecessarily difficult to use compared to a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I typically shave in the shower, so</li>
            <li> The blade head can swivel about 90 degrees with a slight movement of the wrist.</li>
            <li> For any of your ladies reading over their shoulder, I&#x27;m giving it four and a half stars.</li>
            <li> By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz.</li>
            <li> The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blade hugs my face allowing me to use less strokes and less razor burn.  </li>
            <li> The balled head that slightly turns the blade, I can&#x27;t attest that it does anything of merit.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve never tried a ProGlide razor previously</li>
            <li> I shave in half the time with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Though I thought I would miss the Hydro, I find the thinner blades of the Fusions shave with less friction (see blade size comparison in picture).  </li>
            <li> The gel itself also has a slight cooling feel that I like.  </li>
            <li> I had the previous Proglide and it did the job</li>
            <li> No longer do I need to stretch my face out trying to get those odd hairs under the chin.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving and have sensitive skin, but the razor worked really well, giving me a close shave without tugging or pulling.  </li>
            <li> If you already have one of the previous ProGlide Power Razors like I do</li>
            <li> and I am already up to two and half weeks without changing the blade.</li>
            <li> They say the blades themselves are finer and thinner for less tug and pull.  </li>
            <li> I typically use a 2-blade razor and have problems with stubble burn.  </li>
            <li> I have previously tested the vibrating version.</li>
            <li> And the blade is typical Gillette quality.</li>
            <li> I mean this thing glides with ease and precision and makes it only take one pass instead of 3 or 4 to round the corner areas.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first as all that I&#x27;ve seen usually have a little bit of mess.</li>
            <li> It was awkward at first using it because it didn&#x27;t feel like what you feel when you shave.  </li>
            <li> - it just makes a little less tension on your skin when you shave</li>
            <li> The shaving gel seems a little bit thick and is harder to rinse off the blades than other shaving creams I have used.</li>
            <li> It is hard on my skin, tends to dry me out and occasionaly casuses razor burn.</li>
            <li> Normally I hate to shave because it causes to many nicks and small cuts.</li>
            <li> With my two-three day neck growth I have not had a clog up yet that my shower spray could not clean out.</li>
            <li> I very sensitive skin, and one wrong move can cut me up in no time.</li>
            <li> Prices for the cartridges are a little out of my price range.</li>
            <li> Because I was going faster my skin was a little irritated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t found the need to use the little ball swivel with my thumb</li>
            <li> This razor contours to my face reaching areas under my neck that other razors have missed in the past.</li>
            <li> though I do miss the vibrate mode wich made it a little smoother.</li>
            <li> There was a little pull still</li>
            <li> it would still pull and hurt a little when shaving it off.</li>
            <li> This razor literally conforms to the shape of my sharp jaw line, avoiding any instances of small cuts.</li>
            <li> His feedback is that there is little difference between the two.  </li>
            <li> No better results one way over the other.  </li>
            <li> That worked, but no better than any other razors.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant as my experience with the Power was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> should you ever need to pack the gel for travel—which I did during my testing—and it kept my toiletry bag mess-free, something I can’t say with other shave gels that I have traveled with in the past.  </li>
            <li> to me it seems like it&#x27;s a little heaver</li>
            <li> If I could change anything I think I would like it ether a little longer or a little fatter</li>
            <li> As for the new gel that came with it, it really doesn&#x27;t have the problem of slowly leaking out after you&#x27;re done, and the plastic bottoms stops that annoying rust ring on your counter.</li>
            <li> Modern razors are more expensive and so are the blades, but freeing the blade of whiskers is difficult and sometimes impossible.</li>
            <li> Force that hair to do your bidding and get beat down!</li>
            <li> Cut down a tree with a bear!</li>
            <li> I got a much closer shave than I am used to and didn&#x27;t feel like I have to worry about cutting myself.</li>
            <li> The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting.</li>
            <li> I feel a few nicks and pulls here</li>
            <li> I like a heavy handle</li>
            <li> I knew from the moment I twisted the No Waste nozzle-guard and applied some Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> However, now I know what I was missing.</li>
            <li> I have been trying it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I can say after a few weeks is that the flexball seems to have no noticeable effect on my shaving.</li>
            <li> After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rotating ball mechanism didn&#x27;t seem like it would break or fall apart after heavy use.</li>
            <li> I originally tired this razor as part of a trial campaign from Gillette through Bzzagent, but I will definitely be using this razor from now on!</li>
            <li> The Flexball really is a game changer in terms of shaving closeness and I plan on sticking with the product for the immediate future.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts for the few weeks I have been using it.  </li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday</li>
            <li> The handle has a rubber coating which gives you a firm grip.  </li>
            <li> I shaved with the same blade for approximately 2 weeks, which is about 10 shaves for me.  </li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying I am not an everyday shaver.</li>
            <li> this was a stark contrast in the closeness of my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an epic fail flaw that needs to be corrected somehow.</li>
            <li> I found this addition to be a bit gimmicky, as I do not have trouble moving across the count ours of my face when I shave with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li> I tested it by skipping shaving a few days</li>
            <li> I think I might use it for travel when I don&#x27;t feel like lugging the heavy brush.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;tall&amp;#34; for narrow areas around the nose.</li>
            <li> &gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green.</li>
            <li> i felt a slight burning sensation over the areas that I was shaving, could be from the shaving cream, I am not sure what caused it.  </li>
            <li> He thought it was on the heavy side, was clunky in his hand, not easy to manuever.</li>
            <li> No razor bumps not sand paper feeling skin, just plain softness.</li>
            <li> Trying to shave on an up stroke under my nose is very difficult with the large blade head.  </li>
            <li> The razor just felt a little tall for that small region.  </li>
            <li> its partly laziness and its partly disappointment with the high cost of blades and</li>
            <li> WRONG, I will admit I am a sucker to try a new razor</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the handle is a little too thin.</li>
            <li> and it has lasted over 4 weeks, so not too bad) and the razors themselves don&#x27;t seem to get clogged as much as the previous blade I was using.</li>
            <li> I have a tough contour face and most razers either leave hair behind unshaved or end up cutting me.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I prefer to just use a beard trimmer because it&#x27;s much quicker and less painful.</li>
            <li> and I would be pretty shocked if this was not the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion battery operated razor for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a ProGlide Power razor for the past few months.  </li>
            <li> my skin felt really dry and kinda tough.</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide Power with the new FlexBall Handle allowed me to get all of the awkward places I&#x27;ve had trouble with in the past like my neck.</li>
            <li> I felt no nicks, pulls, or cuts, and my face never felt raw.  </li>
            <li> I manage a close shave with my new Proglide razor without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> The razor left sever razor burn on my neck and chin that made it painful to shave for the next three days.</li>
            <li> Previously it was common for hairs to get stuck in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt very little irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li> hey this is a hard spot to shave and with a razor that&#x27;s not a smooth shave....</li>
            <li> Small squirts.  </li>
            <li> -&lt;br /&gt;It became incredibly difficult for me to pay the price Gillette commands for replacement cartridges after switching to a safety razor several years ago.  </li>
            <li> mentioned that I was not sure about the FlexBall.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Gillette products in the past when I did shave.</li>
            <li> And then I shaved my head and it seamlessly moved around the awkward contours of my dome.</li>
            <li> The facial hair would become stuck and difficult to wash out just after one day of shaving.  </li>
            <li> My neck is usually riddled with razor burn but not with this razor.  </li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE!</li>
            <li> I get uncomfortable razor burn with noticeable red bumps.  </li>
            <li> But after using it now for the past four weeks, I would say this razor works just as well as the Power razor I have (or had).</li>
            <li> The contours of your face are not safe spot either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how the &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; technology works or if it even does anything to enhance my shave.</li>
            <li> There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place.</li>
            <li> Another pointless gimmick that is just fishing for sales.</li>
            <li> No more vibrating razor?</li>
            <li> Tap it against the sink’s basin and the cartridge usually falls off.</li>
            <li> I recently started trying a Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall and found out I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> With the Fusion ProGlide with Flexball technology, I usually on need one or two strokes.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from Pseudofolliculitis barbae (aka, severe razor bumps) for the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As part of a promotion sponsored by Gillette, I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Technology for the past week.  </li>
            <li> And, as usual, the price continues to go up.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is how expensive refill cartridges are.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, there&#x27;s not much else worse than razor burn and cuts on the neck.  </li>
            <li> I have used Gillette razors in the past and was looking forward to trying this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor looks like something an alien would use on their skin.  </li>
            <li> I also found this razor lasts longer than the others that I have used in the past, but I still wish it had a longer life span.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else to say...</li>
            <li> I usually had to shave every day.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not in the past</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get all of the irritation that I would get in the past.</li>
            <li> Except small children.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Manual version I received as a promotion from Gillette (Through BzzAgent) for the past couple of weeks, and although it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; I&#x27;m used to,</li>
            <li> I usually use the cheapest razor from Gillette and</li>
            <li> I usually have a permanent 5-o-clock shadow because I avoid shaving at all costs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just a gimmick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette battery powered razors in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the ball helped any, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Besides for a short uncomfortable month when I tried electric razors, I have been using manual razors when it comes time to shave.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s my razor that needs to do that</li>
            <li> Not sure what else I can say.</li>
            <li> It usually serves as my go to razor.</li>
            <li> The blades are cheaper but still expensive overall.</li>
            <li> In the past five years, I&#x27;ve used a combination of Gillette shavers, Dollar Shaving Club, and Harry&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product as I usually do not like cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> The first day that I used this product I was disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I usually nick myself at least a couple times shaving along my jaw line.</li>
            <li> Besides the hew horizontal pivot feature, the razor is basically the same as previous version... which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> The swivel feature may help prevent the scaping of your skin if you inadvertently press too hard on part of your skin, maybe during a manscaping session.</li>
            <li> The head pivots which helps it to stay close in those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> The Flex Ball didnt work and it was hard to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of nooks and crannies that are hard to get to.</li>
            <li> 2.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to justify the cost of refill</li>
            <li> , I tried to watch it as I shaved and never saw it move, I think if it is moving you are probably pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to push to hard while shaving and somehow the flex ball prevents me from doing so.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this razor out, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I probably stretch shavings out a bit...or at least my wife thinks so.  </li>
            <li> I can say that I have used gels since the late 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I usually go slow or deliberately.</li>
            <li> No matter what technique I try or how slow I shave, I always end up drawing blood.</li>
            <li> burn feel that I get occasionally, especially down on my throat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Getting under the chin and angle of the jaw is difficult just due to the size of the blade</li>
            <li> And I mean close, up to this point I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> My first shave with the razor was incrediblely painful!</li>
            <li> was just a little disappointed that it did not come with an extra blade&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely felt pulling during my shave that made it unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> The FlexBall technology is subtle.</li>
            <li> Seriously, men, you have to get this razor.</li>
            <li> It is a subtle difference versus the Mach 3 handle</li>
            <li> I began shaving closer to my jaw line with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor, I noticed the subtle movements of the rotating head as it followed the curves on my face.</li>
            <li> I have seriously tried just about every razor that you can buy.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d think, these are very thin yet very sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if he&#x27;s afraid to shave or enjoys having that little bit of fuzz but refuses to try it out yet.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and hate to shave</li>
            <li> wanted this razor to fail so bad that I used it to shave off a three week old beard.</li>
            <li> No more fidgeting around making weird faces trying to get those pesky hairs.</li>
            <li> That makes it a very slow process to shave.</li>
            <li> , it makes it impossible to get close under my nose and a couple other areas…</li>
            <li> On the side of the bottle is a thin window into the inside of the bottle.</li>
            <li> the gel was  something lacking, the cap was broken</li>
            <li> but I cannot say it was worse either.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> That thing is the secret weapon against your manly beard.</li>
            <li> Really, really thin and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t knick my ankles or anywhere behind my knees...</li>
            <li> I hate to use disposable razors as you can only use them one time and to me seems a wast of money.</li>
            <li> All of the blades I tried just made the problem worse.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully they have been in the game for quite a while</li>
            <li> It gets ALL the hairs on my face and neck without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY?!</li>
            <li> I was afraid that my beard would be too thick for the razor to glide through my face.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t terribly efficient since you need to rinse the blade(s) often to prevent them from clogging with hair and shaving gel, but the blades are sharp and seem to hold edge well for at least a couple shaves.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong trying it out.</li>
            <li> However in my opinion the replacement blades seem to be incredibly expensive.</li>
            <li> With the flexball technology it hugs to every curve on your face and it does not cause those uncomfortable nicks.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of the vibrating handle, so I was skeptical of this campaign.</li>
            <li> you are wrong...</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, too expensive to be the every day shave, but a requirement for those days you need a specialshave.</li>
            <li> You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> but after using it, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> However, the replacement cartridges are just too expensive.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I cut myself almost every time and end up with a lousy shave.  </li>
            <li> I wanted it to fail.</li>
            <li> the swivel...don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Are the replacement razors expensive?  </li>
            <li> That is still too expensive for me.  </li>
            <li> Well I will tell you I was skeptical myself of it</li>
            <li> it moved well even on the difficult face areas.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I tell all my friends about this razor, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> It allows the razor to swivel and pivot to and fro as needed to catch all of those awkward angles around my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I don’t have to hold the razor in an awkward way to get all of my contours of my face.  </li>
            <li> With this I don&#x27;t feel it cutting the hair on the skin</li>
            <li> I have ever had it shave so well even where the grain of my hair grows in crazy directions.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and keeps me from cutting myself.</li>
            <li> The FlexBell allows the razor to swivel and pivot to and fro as needed to catch all of those awkward angles around my chin.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Gillette razors!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> I saw the commercials and thought it was just another gimmick, boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Cartridge razors tend to be very expensive to buy refills for, and do no provide any benefit when compared to safety razors.  </li>
            <li> I trim everything up with an electric beard trimmer and then finish off the sides with this bad boy.  </li>
            <li> clog to bad.</li>
            <li> so well it makes you forget how bad manual razors used to be.</li>
            <li> Cant be disappointed with Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have always been using Gillette as razor and razor blade brand and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> the gel, it vas very disappointing that I could not try it since the bottle was defective.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> I just hate the price.</li>
            <li> I hate to shave every day, because I hate the feel of the razor.</li>
            <li> I just want to say that I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> TOO BAD HAIR SIXTH BLADE!</li>
            <li> but if it eliminates cuts and all sorts of ugly razor battles then so be it!</li>
            <li> Take my advice and try this razor, I guarantee that you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Try it - you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Lets face it, we all hate shaving!</li>
            <li> That being said, I don&#x27;t believe in paying a lot of money for razors (which may be counterintuitive-maybe that is why I hate shaving?!)  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this razor previously and it is my absolute favorite razor of all time. The flexball technology helps the blades guide to ever angle of your face. The blades stay sharp and cut with ease. On top of all this you get the Gillette quality that you expect with the great name. I recommend this to anyone looking for a new razor. Even if you aren&#x27;t, I recommend that you try it and I bet you will switch. I received this for free as a promotion from Gillette, thanks!</li>
            <li> excellent razor. Leaves face smooth and silky. It glides along the face effortlessly. Does not &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; at the hair like some razors do.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor from Gillette to try for free. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Fusion Proglide razors for quite some time now and I haven&#x27;t found another one that performs better. Also, if you use coupons that usually available, you&#x27;ll be saving money. One of the things I like about this razor is that I don&#x27;t get cut even when I shave fast, that is not the case with other brands. I don&#x27;t care so much about the flex ball since I seem to get good shaves with or without any flexibility. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with Gillette and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase their products.</li>
            <li> So I just received my Gillette ProGlide and shaving cream yesterday as a bzzagent client, to try out and review, and got my first chance to use it today. I have to say that I&#x27;ve used my Gillette M3 Power for years now and have been quite happy. Whenever I&#x27;d tried to move to a 4-blade system, they&#x27;ve always clogged up or been harder to clean, so there I&#x27;ve stayed.  However, this new razor was a pleasure to use. Let&#x27;s take a closer look at the bundle below.    First of all, the razor.  I was a little let down that I received the Non-powered razor as I&#x27;ve been using a powered razor for years, and love how smooth of a shave I get from them. The simple vibrating seems to really help with the overall experience of the shave, in my opinion. But, I am willing to overlook this for the sake of the review.  Afterall, there is a power option for this razor if I decide that I like it enough to change.  So the first, and most obvious change in this razor over other razors I&#x27;ve used is the swivel head. When manually moving the head, it does move very smoothly and easily. Considering that I&#x27;ve always been very careful to shave straight however, I was still a bit unsure how much of a difference this would really make. The handle to the razor feels very solid in my hand, being of a metal design. Adds some good weight that feels good in my hands. Good rubberized grips keep it from shifting or sliding.  Also has the same simple push-pop removable head that we&#x27;ve become accustom to with other razors.    Secondly, the shaving gel. The design of the bottle is very sleek. Easy to hold thanks to the  matte feel to the bottle, and a rubberized bottom to help avoid rusting, as advertised on the bottle itself. That will take some time to test and I dont&#x27; leave mine sitting in water anyhow. Also advertised, is the no-mess nozzle. I was a bit skeptical at first as all that I&#x27;ve seen usually have a little bit of mess. And this one touting the twist to lock top, I figured that&#x27;s about where it ended. More on that in a bit. The final bit of advertising on the bottle, I&#x27;ll state right off that I like. On the side of the bottle is a thin window into the inside of the bottle. This is designed so that as you near the last half of supply, you can monitor as you are about to run out. This is a simple, but great addition that I wish that other manufacturers to pick up on. Great idea!    So, now that we&#x27;ve gone over the basics of the items received, let&#x27;s get to the shaving. I put this razor to the test a bit more, as I haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days and so stubble has gotten a bit longer. Probably could have trimmed it first. *shrug*  First thing I noticed was in applying the gel. The nozzle truly is mess free, and there was not the slightest bit of gel left on the nozzle after applying to my hand. it comes out at a pretty high pressure and really sprays a nice solid stream into my hand. Could probably shoot it across the room at someone, if I really wanted! :p  With the higher pressure, I hadn&#x27;t realized just how much I had expelled, so after applying to my face I had quite a bit of leftover. So, note to self next time. Small squirts.  As expected, the gel felt cool and smooth going on. foamed up perfectly and the scent that I ordered was fresh and strong. But not too strong to irritate while shaving.  As I began to shave, I was trying to make note of the swivel head, to see if it was really doing anything as I shaved. Although I can&#x27;t say that I really noticed any swivel on the razor, and kept shaving straight as I usually do, I can say that it felt very smooth on my face and no areas of extra pressure I may notice with my regular razor. This most likely will make a difference in the razor burn feel that I get occasionally, especially down on my throat. I haven&#x27;t noticed any after shaving here. One simple light pass and it has left my face well shaved. This was to be expected, but a bit more impressive as I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days, as I&#x27;d previously noted.Rinsing the razor was pleasant as well, as I noticed not the slightest clogging as I&#x27;d expected with the 4 blades, and longer stubble. Felt like a good, clean shave.    Overall, I was very impressed with this razor. I cannot currently see any negatives, outside of the fact that I think that if I continue using this razor, I shall be sure to pick up the Powered option however that&#x27;s probably just personal preference. Initial impression on these items, definitely impressed and know that I&#x27;ll most likely look for these shaving gels for replace..if nothing more than simply the window on the bottle. The absolutely no mess at this point is nice as well. The razor? I&#x27;ll use this one without power for awhile, and decide how to proceed later.    My Rating on this razor set? Probably a good 9 out of 10.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide and the ProGlide razor with FlexBall thanks to Gillette. This razor has always caught my attention every time I passed by the mens care section at the super market. I always thought of it as another gimmicky product like the rest of the 3-4-5 razors promising to produce a clean shave (which they never did). However, this morning before going to an all-day teacher workshop I decided to give it a try and boy was I surprised! It just felt so good and natural that I couldn&#x27;t resist to share it with my coworkers. They were amazed at how smooth it had left my skin and by the end of the day they left curious and interested in getting their own. This is without a doubt the best razor available out their right now and its companion Fusion ProGlide Gel is another great and wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all but its not amazing. I use Gillette everything and never been unsatisfied but its not that different than the rest...    Side note: i did get this for free, so I cant complain. But I i probably wouldn&#x27;t switch from my Gillette razor to this.  If it&#x27;s not broke dont fix it. Just saying!</li>
            <li> Got this free as a product promotion along with some \\&quot;Active Sport\\&quot; scented shave gel. I&#x27;ve used it twice already, and it&#x27;s a pretty awesome experience. It has two pivots (most disposable razors only have one, if at all) so not only does it glide well on smooth surfaces, it also pivots from side to side so it handles the jawbone with ease. I noticed I didn&#x27;t really change hand positions much, I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same areas multiple times, mostly I was just able to do long strokes from my neck all the way up my face... so I had almost no irritation (I have incredibly sensitive skin). I was surprised how quick the shave was, and I didn&#x27;t really need any cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I&#x27;d started learning how to use a straight edge because disposable razors just don&#x27;t give you that close of a shave. It takes longer with a straight edge, but my wife loves the result. The Fusion Proglide gives my straight edge a run for it&#x27;s money as far as closeness and takes only a fraction of the time to shave. BTW, I love the Active Sport scent and cooling sensation... I would recommend that if you get razor burn easily.</li>
            <li> I participated in a Bzz campaign to try the new Fusion Proglide.  It made sense to me that the next evolution in shaving would be pivoting heads. After all, our vacuums have them, right?  I traditionally use a safety razor to shave, which means I take my time and am very deliberate with my movements, angle of blade / handle, and I shave twice (once with and once against the grain).  Because of this, I don&#x27;t think I was quite able to take advantage of the pivoting feature of this particular handle.  I didn&#x27;t really see it in action much on my face and in the end it really took no shorter time than with my other razors.  This may mean that the product is really more geared towards those who shave rather quickly and with less care / precision than myself.  They would probably see more benefit from the pivot than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the two most important things when it comes to shaving is a great lubricating cream/gel/soap and an incredibly sharp blade.  This is where I was most disappointed with the new Proglide.  I definitely felt pulling during my shave that made it unpleasant.  Probably more the blade&#x27;s fault than it was the pivot feature, but it&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t overlook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I would don&#x27;t know that I would go out of my way to use it again.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it, I&#x27;m probably just not the target user for this particular style of handle / razor.</li>
            <li> I love the Flex Ball and the way it rotates around my face!</li>
            <li> im trying the product for free thanks to Gillette. so far i am very pleased and will continue using this</li>
            <li> I got this razor as a proamtion from Gillette. I was kind of leery at first but since I have used it OH WOW!!! When shaving I would sometimes get it smooth and some times not. I must say with the ProGlide Silver it is smooth every time. I just love this razor and the fact I can use the fusion blades I already have is just an added plus.</li>
            <li> As part of the latest BzzAgent campaign, I was given the opportunity to try this product free from Gillette. This is actually the third time I have been given the chance to try some version of this razor. And while my previous critcism still holds true, I am loving the results this razor produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - My Protest -&lt;br /&gt;It became incredibly difficult for me to pay the price Gillette commands for replacement cartridges after switching to a safety razor several years ago.  While using the safety razor took a little more time, I was enjoying the process and felt comfortable with the savings I had found. Since that time I&#x27;ve tried a few other cartridge-type razors with replacements offered at a fraction of Gillette&#x27;s cost. Again, I felt that I was getting a better deal. To compare - With Gillette&#x27;s latest razor, the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology, you can expect to spend $4 or more per replacement cartridge. on the other hand, I can change blades in a safety razor for a dime a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other downside to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide is the ability to keep the razor head clean. I find hairs build up between the 4 blades due to how close they are set. Other three blade cartridges seem to be much easier to rinse out, extending the life of the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - My Praise -&lt;br /&gt;This time I was more excited to try this product than ever before. I&#x27;ve began questioning the money I was saving buying cheaper cartridge refills. I&#x27;ve noticed that the cost seems directly related to the quality of shave. And the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology produces top notch results. The blades glide effortlessly over any contour of the face and leaves a smooth finish in one pass. Also, I tend to suffer from some razor bumps on the neck but I&#x27;ve noticed less redness and irritation with the Fusion ProGlide than I have seen in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury is still out on whether the results are enough to get me to rethink my spending but, all costsaside, there is no better cartridge razor. So if you want a faster, closer shave give this a try but know that it comes at a price.</li>
            <li> I got to try this razor #free through a BZZagent campaign. I love this razor! It gives a very clean shave, very smooth, works great on coarse hair like mine, and is so easy to use. It is definitely worth the price! If you&#x27;re looking for a quick and easy shave, definitely go for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette! What a great product by Gillette! The blade pivots front to back and side to side to respond to contours for the best shave you can get. I have yet to cut my face with this blade and it is so easy to use. Very quick and easy way to shave!</li>
            <li> I received a sample Proglide razor from Gillette and I must say, it is amazing!  I have never had a shave this close and smooth and no razer burn.  Plus the new ball technology helped the razor glide with ease around the curvy parts of my face.  I will never buy another brand of razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always choose Gillette razors, but when I do, I choose the Fusion Proglide.  The future of razors is here at last. The Fusion product is one of those items that you stop and think, &amp;#34;How did I not think of that sooner?&amp;#34; Well, you probably don&#x27;t have a team whose job it is to come up with better shaving products. Gillette does - and this product demonstrates the commitment they have towards innovation.  The razor is simple, elegant, modern, and rolls across your skin like a glove (not my best analogy but you get what I mean)  Whether you are shaving your face or other areas, you really just have to guide the razor and no longer need to worry about proper angle.  If you are looking for a razor for sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t believe we are there quite yet. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my skin, but I still get a tad of razor burn afterwards - although better than normal razors.  The shave gel that goes with this razor is pretty sweet as well. It has an invigorating feeling that follows its application to your slightly moist skin.  Overall, very happy with the latest from Gillette  I did receive the product free as a trial thanks to Gillette. I am grateful and see this as the company investing in its product.</li>
            <li> I received both the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor and 2-in-1 Shave Gel as part of an evaluation program.  Here is my review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, what a smooth shave!  I&#x27;ve always laughed at the increasing number of blades in razors.  This coming from someone who has been using his 2-bladed Gillette Excel since he can remember.  The Excel has always provided a clean, close shave but with the downside of raw, reddish, irritated skin.  It was a consequence I accepted as just part of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m eating my crow, with relish!  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide with its 5 blades cuts cleanly and smoothly, whether I went with the grain or against (I usually do with first, then against on a second pass--everyone says go with but how can you get a close shave that way?).  I felt no nicks, pulls, or cuts, and my face never felt raw.  Applying Nivea After Shave Balm post shave, I did not feel any burn like I normally do.  It&#x27;s a good indication to me that my skin wasn&#x27;t raked raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also compared the ProGlide razor to my Norelco Coolskin 7775X electric shavor.  I put in the new HQ8 replacement blades since the original HQ177 blades are no longer available.  I found the HQ8 blades to be better than the HQ177: smoother and closer in my opinion.  Many reviewers contend otherwise (I shave in the shower so perhaps others have different results because of different circumstances).  I love my Norelco because it provides a smooth, close shave without irritation.  But it takes time and a good number of passes to achieve the results.  So in comparison to the Norelco, the ProGlide was equally smooth and close without the multiple passes and extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smooth shave really won me over but there were other great features about the ProGlide razor.  The articulating razor head was excellent at pivoting itself around cheek bones and jaw lines.  As a result, the razor stayed glued to my skin for a close shave.  Weight and grip of the razor felt solid and good, not plasticky or cheap.  Love the dark chrome and metal feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t come to any conclusions on the FlexBall yet.  I shaved without a mirror and didn&#x27;t notice whether the FlexBall pivoted side to side as it was intended to.  Perhaps it did to help navigate the contours of my face or perhaps it didn&#x27;t and is just a marketing gimmick.  I&#x27;ll have to shave again, this time in front of a mirror to judge properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ProGlide razor isn&#x27;t perfect and here is its one flaw: the razor head is big.  How can it not be with 5 blades?  Gillette did a fantastic job of keeping the blades thin, thinner than the Excel blades, but they do still command a bit of real estate.  They are also slightly wider than the Excel.  So all of this translates to some difficulty shaving hair at and around the upper lip.  I could only shave with the grain here and very carefully at that.  The razor just felt a little tall for that small region.  I also had slight difficulty under the jaw where the skin dips.  Again, because the razor head is relatively large and not easily maneuvered there.  I can see myself improving  my technique with practice so this isn&#x27;t a major issue, just an issue for my first time out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally shave once a week, even with the Norelco.  My skin usually requires a break before the next shave and shaving short stubble after a few days usually results in pain.  But I am optimistic enough with the ProGlide experience that I will try shaving more frequently.  If I am able to shave more often, then I can be content with a close enough shave rather than needing that super close shave.  In fact, I would prefer to shave more often just so I don&#x27;t look so scruffy by the week&#x27;s end.  Here&#x27;s hoping...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved several more times with the ProGlide and can tell the razor blades dulling after about 3 shaves.  Your mileage might vary since each person&#x27;s hair/stubble will be different.  My hair is coarse.  Even with a bit of dulling, shaving with the ProGlide does not irritate my skin.  I feel a few nicks and pulls here and there where it was absolute smoothness in the beginning but that is it.  Still love it over the Excel razor I used before.  Just a FYI, I apply a little bit of mineral oil to the blades after shaving to keep it clean, sharp, and rust-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned that I was not sure about the FlexBall.  I can say now that it isn&#x27;t useful for me.  My shaving technique has me holding the razor handle loosely with my fingers.  This way, I adjust to the contours of my face at the handle with my hand rather than rely on the FlexBall and the leaf spring that is used as a pivot.  Other persons who apply more pressure when they shave may find the FlexBall more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the ProGlide for its smooth, non-irritating shave.  I am pretty sure I won&#x27;t be going back to the Excel.  ProGlide blades are more expensive than the Excel ones ($3 vs $1 per blade).  But to me, a smooth shave that does not hurt my skin is worth the price premium.</li>
            <li> I am not one who loves to shave and since I am self employed and work from home I probably stretch shavings out a bit...or at least my wife thinks so.  I have used many razors in my life but this is the first to not leave any cuts after the first 3 uses.  I would advise trimming excessive long hair as is needed prior to using most razors.  Flip the razor around and you have a single blade trimmer on the back...many people over look this I bet!</li>
            <li> I really like Gillette Fusion products, they give me a very close shave and the blades seem to stay sharp a little longer than others I have tried.  This new flex ball technology is pretty great too.  It took me a while to warm up to it, but I think the shave is smoother and it seems to make it harder to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I received a promotional package including the ProGlide Flexball razor and a can of the ProGlide 2-in-1 shave gel+skin care, from BzzAgent, and I have to say, this razor is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I was using the Fusion ProGlide Styler, but I found it rather bulky to shave with, though the razor cartridges give a fantastic shave. When I got the Flexball razor and tried it out, I really loved how it contoured and how maneuverable it was compared to the Styler. I still use the Styler for trimming, but the Flexball is my regular razor now and just works better. Paired with the ProGlide 2-in-1 shave gel, my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth and soft in a long time. I now shave every other day because it&#x27;s so close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this fro free thanks  to Gillette, and I really think is a great product that definetely will buy again</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette! I just got my Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology and what great timing! I purposely didn&#x27;t shave for a almost a week. My wife was especially eager for me to get rid of my facial hair.  First thing that caught my attention with this razor was the packaging. One word, smart. I loved how easy it was to open the plastic casing. Unlike most plastic casings, no scissors required! A simple peel and voila! You&#x27;re ready to get busy with this sleek looking razor.  The appearance of the razor is sleek and sexy but nothing out of the ordinary compared to other Gillette razors. What stands out is the FlexBall handle which swivels slightly when you push the razor head to the left or right.  Let&#x27;s get our shave on! The first thing I noticed after my first &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; with the razor was the feeling of the &amp;#34;thinnest and finest&amp;#34; blades. It definitely takes some getting used to if you have never used a Fusion ProGlide. Word of advice, don&#x27;t press too hard and let the blades work their magic!  What about the FlexBall? The FlexBall technology is subtle. Honestly, compared to the amount it can swivel, I didn&#x27;t see it swivel much. I&#x27;m guessing the amount of swivel will depend on your facial contours? For me, I&#x27;m really not sure if it made that much of a difference.  End result - One of closest shaves I have had in a long time. As my wife would say, &amp;#34;smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34;.  Pros: The closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time. Decent price for the actual razor (which is roughly $10). Sleek look and feel. All Fusion cartridges are compatible with this handle.  Cons: Prices for the cartridges are a little out of my price range. I&#x27;m cheap but this shouldn&#x27;t discourage those of you who are willing to make the investment!  Overall this is a great product that I would be happy to recommend to anyone. Thanks again Gillette!</li>
            <li> I have the battery powered unit, but wanted to try the manual. Gillette gave me this razor to review and honestly, I am not disappointed in the slightest. After a month of shaves, I have not had any cuts and I haven&#x27;t had to run the razor over my face more then once! This is a completely new and better shave over the dollar store, single blade razors I have been using before I got the battery powered unit and now this manual unit. I still prefer the Power to this unit (ever so slightly) and this is the first and last thing I grab when the batteries run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for years and think this one tops them all. I got a free trial of the new razor and love it. It really gives me a great, close shave and I notice the difference from previous iterations.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette i got this free to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;So as a summary i would say that i have used Fusion ProGlide razors before and this one is definitely better - but i simply wouldn&#x27;t call it revolutionary&lt;br /&gt;That is plain simple evolution of your everyday razor :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth is that it helps with shave but don&#x27;t expect any breakthrough or more clean shave because of FlexBall - it just makes a little less tension on your skin when you shave</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I love the Gillette line of Fusion products, and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology is no exception. As with all Fusion products, the shave is smooth and painless. The added bonus of the Flexball is pure genius. The razor glides on your face and follows the contours of your face effortlessly. When all is said and done, I have a clean shaven face with no cuts or nicks. Definitely worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li> I tested the Gillette &amp;#34;Fusion proGlide 2 in 1 razor for BzzAgent. The razor is great the gel was  something lacking, the cap was broken i had to take it off and force my thumb nail into the nozzle to get some out to try.  I did it once and went back to my wet shave kit. the razor made shaving my neck very easy though, as long as the hair wasn&#x27;t too long it shaved very well.</li>
            <li> Got the chance to try the flexball with the new gel as well. What a great combination. No nicks and best of all, no ingrown hairs the next couple of days after. It has always been a trade off....close shave and ingrown hairs or stubbly shave and no ingrown hairs....NOT ANYMORE!!!!  Even though I got to try this as part of a promotion, I would buy them in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I received this razor and a can of alpine fresh shave gel free thanks to a promotion from Gillette and Amazon. This is by far the best razor I have ever used thanks to its new flex-ball technology. It allows the razor to perfectly contour to the curves on my face and the five blades allow for a very close shave without gouging the skin. The new Gillette shave gel allows for a very cool and refreshing shave as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette products for years. Sometimes, I switch it up and use an electric shaver for a bit, but I always seem to come back to Gillette. Thanks to their generosity, I received a free Flexball razor to test out. I was actually using it for a while before I got the free one, but I have to say, it&#x27;s an amazing product. It does flex and contour to your face. I do feel like I am getting a closer shave. I have a regular Gillette Proglide at home and I use the Flexball when shaving at the gym, and I can tell the difference. I had a full caveman beard going on for a while and it worked its magic to get me clean shaven in under 10 minutes. I was quite impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because Gillette gave me a $10 razor. I gave it 5 stars because it really is the best shave I have had in a while. You can&#x27;t go wrong trying it out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette razors for years. They are not the cheapest razors in the world so I feel like you should get what you pay for when it comes to razor blades. First of all the product itself looks great. The handle is very comfortable and feels solid in your hands. The flexball allows the razor to bend and contour to almost anything: with that being said so do my hands and wrist. The first day that I used this product I was disappointed to say the least. It did not feel any different than the razor that I was currently using and maybe just a little bit worse. Amazon has a great value price on this Gillette razor. This new model had a orange power LED, while the previous &amp;#34;silver tone&amp;#34; model had a cool blue LED. The blades from all Fusion razors will fit and work, though Gillette markets different models for power and non-power models. New feature is the angle-bending action so that the blade can now both tilt AND swivel, if you pull it in s straight line and apply a lot of force. This begs the question: Why are you pulling your razor with so much straight line force? I did not see that the swivel feature made a great deal of difference in comfort, and in some cases, it made it harder to reach beard hair in dimpled areas of the lower chin. The swivel feature may help prevent the scaping of your skin if you inadvertently press too hard on part of your skin, maybe during a manscaping session. The AAA battery lasts about 1 year and a couple months. Included and Replacement blades have 5 tiny blades plus a backwards facing blade for precision edging. However in my opinion the replacement blades seem to be incredibly expensive. Build quality of Gillette products is yop notch. Surprisingly everyday after that it seemed to get better and better. The one thing that I would say that sets it apart from my current razor is the amount of times I need to shave over a certain area for it to feel smooth and clean. This one is once and done. There is no need to keep shaving the same spot over and over like the current razor that I was using. I will be switching to this new razor and using it from now on. I would recommend this razor to anyone who currently uses any Gillette products. I would like to mention that this was a free trial from Bzz Agent.shaving the same spot over and over like the current razor that I was using.

            <li> I love this razor! I received this free as part of a promotion and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it is. It really gives a smooth shave and caters to the contours of my face. I&#x27;ve found the blades that come with the razor last longer than my old razor&#x27;s as well. The handle feels sturdy and heavy, leading me to feel like it is a better quality product.</li>
            <li> Received the NEW Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care and Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology from Gillette for testing. I found a small amout of the gel went along way and provided some of the best protection I have every received from shaving cream. It provided ease of shaving  each time I used the Proglide razor. Had no irritation or nicks from using the blade. very pleased with the razor and the way it fit in my hand. Would recommend this gel and razor to others.</li>
            <li> I tried the product for free thanks to Gillette. Mornings are already a hassle, but not with Fusion ProGlide. With the flexball technology it hugs to every curve on your face and it does not cause those uncomfortable nicks. With the plastic can it does not rust like every other one, as I shave in the shower and leave the can in there. With the awesome razor you don&#x27;t have to go over the same spots on your face more than once, one swipe and done. Thanks  for keeping it clean + comfortable.</li>
            <li> I received this blade from Gillette as a promotion. I really like it. The handle is slim and easy to use, the blade is very sharp and got all the hair in one pass. It didnt pull my hair and glided smoothly over my skin. My skin feels really nice and smooth, no irritation.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a test by Bzzagent and I am psyched I was chosen. I don&#x27;t shave often and when I do I really want it to be enjoyable.  The razor and the shaving cream I received definitely made that happen.  The shaving gel was easy to use and I really liked the new structure that didn&#x27;t require a cap.  I have been using a Gillette Fusion razor for a long time and didn&#x27;t think this would be better.  I was really surprised to find that it definitely was.  Between the shave gel and the FlexBall I got a much closer shave than I am used to and didn&#x27;t feel like I have to worry about cutting myself.</li>
            <li> I received  this product to try out for free and I absolutely love it! it left me with a nice close shave and smooth soft skin. I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> I got this product free as part of a promotion from Gillette and they&#x27;ve definitely made a permanent customer out of me! The razor easily contours itself to your face as you use it. One swipe of the blades gives a very good cut resulting in me being able to get a smooth shave in a lot less time than with previous razors. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is easily the best shave that money can buy.  I&#x27;m a daily shaver and using the razor against the grain was terrific.  No Nicks - No missed hairs!  The contours of my face such as chin and jawline, were easy to handle with this razor.  If you ask me you just can&#x27;t find a product out there that is as available and affordable.</li>
            <li> I started to shave my head few years ago and have tried many different brands of razors found in markets or wholesale stores but so far I feel Fusion ProGlide razors last the longest comparing to all other brands I tried.</li>
            <li> I got it for free from Bzzagent. As usual the presentation was very good. I had very high expectations on the razor but also with the gel. Regarding the razor, I found it very good and similar to my previous Gillette razor. It provides very precise and very lasting shave. The cleaning is very simple. Did not find very different the pivoting head.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the gel, it vas very disappointing that I could not try it since the bottle was defective. However it has a nice design and new features as the cap lock and the level indicator.&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it very good and will use it as my daily razor.</li>
            <li> My Gillette Razor showed up in the mail today, I work as a Firefighter and we have to be clean shaven since I had to work in the morning i thought i&#x27;d try it out. Out of the box i was impressed the razor handle is well built made of metal with rubber grips it feels great in your hand. The razor has 5 blades which give a much closer shave than the 3 blade razor i&#x27;m used to. I was comfortable shaving with it as the ball head turns to prevent cutting yourself. This razor could be a replacement for my Gillette Mach 3 which i have been using for as long as i can remember.</li>
            <li> Got this razor free as part of a promotional campaign (BzzAgent); here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am usually an electric kind of guy, I use the Fusion for special occasions when I need a really close shave--usually I can get by fine with my rotary electric, but I&#x27;ll admit it: this does a much better job of giving a nice, close shave. I originally chose electric both because I would cut myself every single time with a manual razor and because electric doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much. While my skin does still dry out after a few days shaving with this, I have had almost no problem with razor burn or cuts with the Fusion Proglide, so +1 for that. I also participated in a previous Gillette promotion where they were offering a battery-powered version of the same razor; it came with a button that you would press to turn on vibration--while it did feel kind of cool, it seemed all in all a little gimmicky to me; this is the same razor with just as good a shave for a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> With this razor I can&#x27;t help but be reminded of their slogan &amp;#34;The best a man can get&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t believe their slogan could be any more accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor as part of a test by Bzzagent and I&#x27;m happy I was chosen for this test. This morning was the first time using this razor and I&#x27;m more than happy with this new FlexBall addition to the razor. It makes shaving a little bit enjoyable, but it&#x27;s still shaving and shaving isn&#x27;t fun at all. This was able to glide over my face and give me an almost barber ship type result. My wife loves it when I shave and just despises any sort of stubble, so she was giddy when I gave her a kiss goodbye this morning. Now, if I could have it my way, I&#x27;d never shave, I&#x27;d have a log house in the mountains and I&#x27;d hunt my meals every day. But this is the real life and I have a job to go to, five days a week, like a normal person. I don&#x27;t think a single person, at work, cared at all that my wife was happy with the results from this razor, at all. But alas, a happy wife is a happy life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is well worth it. The shave is wonderful and your significant other will appreciate your effort.</li>
            <li> Testing the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology and the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care - Ocean Breeze Scent. These products was sent for me to review. I have sensitive skin and hate to shave but  I found that this razor got virtually every hair with one stroke. The FlexBall is unique but not sure why they call it FlexBall when it really is not a ball but more of a three-way pivot. Like a universal joint on a car or something. It does respond to the contours of the face and I didn&#x27;t find any missed hair.    I like the weight of the razor. I like a heavy handle and it lives up to this. The razor is balanced and feels good in the hand. The Proglide cartridges fit this handle and since I already was using the Fusion ProGlide I can just use those cartridges with this handle. I say go get you one now. If you look around you can find coupons online. Also if you are into subscription services Gillette has this option available and can save you money if you sign up.    Is the razor better than any other? I rate it right there with the original Fusion. I do not however think that the 5 blades shave any better than 3 but I cannot say it was worse either.</li>
            <li> Seriously, men, you have to get this razor. It is such an easy, smooth, close shave! I really do recommend it. My face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. My fiance absolutely loves the fact that I shaved my entire face, and that there is no razor burns, or bumps, or any hair left over. I can&#x27;t believe how great this razor works. The first time i used it, it glided over my face like there was nothing there. If i could, I would buy these for all my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free thanks to Gillette. As someone who has been ignoring all innovation in shaving and sticking exclusively with the Gillette Mach 3, I was clearly skeptical when first trying out the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball technology. Is it really that much better than the razor I have been using? I was not a fan of the vibrating handle, so I was skeptical of this campaign. Would I like a handle that bends or flexes while I shave? Would it bend too much? First, I took the product out of the packaging. It felt great. The Flexball handle was very solid. It didn’t flex too much. I moved it side to side, it was just enough, or so I thought. After my first shave I was incredibly happy with it. The razor lives up to every claim it makes. I have a fairly defined jawline and the Flexball makes a huge difference navigating the contours of my face and neck by pivoting side to side while staying close to my skin without any added pressure. As someone with thick, coarse hair, a comfortable shave is the most important aspect of my experience. The blades provide a close shave with absolutely no tug or pull in my case for a heavenly comfortable experience. The thinner blades just glide across my skin and required noticeably fewer strokes to get the job done. The Proglide handle feels great in my hand and has a nice weight to it, not too heavy but enough so that you know it is there. It is a subtle difference versus the Mach 3 handle but it is a welcome addition. Gillette has been making razors for over 100 years. It’s no surprise that they’ve come out with yet another quality product.</li>
            <li> I received a razor from BzzAgent and was asked to review the experience using it.  This razor is excellent. I&#x27;ve used used Gillette Fusion razors in the past, but this is the first time with the Proglide technology. It makes a difference. I sometimes have a tough beard, and this razor glided through easily with great results. The shave was close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I got to try Gillette Fusion Proglide for free as a bzzagent. I love the closeness of the shave from this razor. The flexibility of the razor allows it to contour to your face so you aren&#x27;t left with stubble in creases or on the sides eliminating the need to go over things a second time to get it all. It&#x27;s almost effortless compared to other razors as it just slides right over the surface of your skin. I don&#x27;t get as many bumps and nicks with this razor either.</li>
            <li> I received this kit for free to review as a promotion. I really like this shaving kit, especially the gel in the dispenser thing, it lathers well, foams up nice and works great!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer electric razors still, but if I HAD to use a manual razor, I think I would stick with Gillette.</li>
            <li> No complaints here! I am giving this product 5 stars because it actually does what it claims. After using this I can say that it delivers a smooth, even shave every time, and is very easy to handle. When I was done using it I had only a wonderful clean shave, rather than small cuts or missed spots. This razor is especially good going around contours and getting hard to reach spots. I did receive this razor as a free sample from Gillette, but please don&#x27;t think that is the reason for the good review. I won&#x27;t hesitate to give a low rating to a product that doesn&#x27;t live up to the claims made regarding it, or if it falls short of my expectations. This isn&#x27;t one of those products that flopped when I tried it. Great quality all the way around and would definitely use again, as well as recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I just tried this razor which I got for free in the mail thanks to BzzAgent for a trial run.  I had previously been using the standard fusion pro glide for the past 3 years, and let me tell you, this is definitely an upgrade.  The flex ball allows for a smooth and seamless transition across your jawline and makes it easy to get in those tight areas around the ears etc.  Pair it with the 2 in 1 Shave Gel and you&#x27;ll have a great shave every time.</li>
            <li> I received this for free through a promotion to try it out. It gives an extremely close shave with out any razor burn or irritation. However, I am not convinced that the Flexball Technology is of any benefit. Though I do love the blades and would recommend to anyone I will not be purchasing any refills due to the high cost of these blades! I wish Gillette would make all of their razors and blades universal. Every new &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; they come up with they change the connector of the blade, so if you are thinking you are going to use your favorite (and cheaper) Gillette blade with this razor you are wrong...it simply won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I dread shaving most days,  I can keep talking about technology, design and fancy marketing words… But in the end, it all comes down to one thing… Is the Fusion ProGlide any better than the original Gillette Fusion???  Yes, indeed! First of all, I am impressed by the smooth sensation while I am shaving. There is no significant drag on my skin, and the blades glides easily across all parts of my face. #Sponsored #FlexBall #HappyShave</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette razors for as long as I can remember so I have seen almost every innovation they have come up with.  Let me tell you this one thing about this new Proglide Razor.  This is hands down the best razor I have ever used.  So much in fact that I have given up my electric razor and gone back to these disposable blade razors.  The Flex Ball tech has got to be the best tech around for razors, it is so awesome that my wife uses it to shave her legs (she has her own fellas).  So if you are looking for a new razor definitely try this one out you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I received the product as part of a promotion, you know to try it out before you buy it.  At first I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but after first try I quickly changed my mind.  If you have a chance to get this product, get it!</li>
            <li> After 7 years of not shaving, I finally decided to get rid of my beard, and what better way than with a Gillette product. I used to use Gillette products in the past when I did shave. It&#x27;s the only brand I grew up seeing my dad and brother use, so I used it too. I haven&#x27;t been in the shave game for many years so I don&#x27;t really look at what&#x27;s going on with razors, but the Fusion ProGlide caught my eye because of the flexball. I got this product for free from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how well the razor would work at first because I had a thick beard. I was afraid that my beard would be too thick for the razor to glide through my face. I put the shaving gel on one side of my face, and began to shave. It took some time but it did work. It gave me such a close shave that when I touched my face, I didn&#x27;t feel any hairs. My face was so smooth. The flexball worked really well with the shape of my face and when I thought I needed to pick up the razor and change direction, I didn&#x27;t have to, because the flexball moved it in the right direction for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside though is that it took a while, at least 20 minutes just for one side of my face, so maybe not so great for thick beards, or if you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a great product, that gave me a really close shave and I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I think it&#x27;s over priced!  It makes my face feel so smooth, not matter what time I shave.  I have sensitive skin, and it never leaves razor burn.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the product for free due to a campaign by Gillette, and I am thoroughly satisfied with the razor. It provides a very clean shave, and I did not experience any nicks or cuts on my face while using the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this!  Save your money and your face by getting a safety razor and wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I received the razor from bzz agent to try and must say The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with Flex Ball is simply the best razor I have ever used.  It movies with the contours of my face to give the closest shave possible.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette I got to try their new Proglide Razor with Flexball Technology for free!  I really enjoy the FlexBall technology, it contours really nicely to my face and has helped me get a cleaner and smoother shave! This has been one of the best razors I have used whether I use shaving gel or just water. I would highly recommend trying this razor out, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  I’ve been an electric razor guy for a number of years now, but still use a manual razor when I go a couple of days without using one.  For those times I have traditionally relied on  the triple blade disposable that nearly always left me nicked and bleeding.  I’ve never been able to  get past the price of the expensive blades to ever try them.  But recently, BzzAgent provided me with a Fusion ProGlide with Flexball to try, and I must admit, I don’t think I’ve ever experience a closer shave.  With the ProGlide, I don’t have to worry about attracting sharks and vampires, or walking around with little pieces of toilet paper all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the areas I’ve always had a problem with is the forward sides of my neck where I have never found the proper angle to attack the grain of the beard.  As such, I’ve always had a bit of stubble left after shaving.  With the Fusion ProGlide, nada!  My wife was even impressed with just how close my shave was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For convenience the electric razor wins when you don’t need a particularly close shave but for those days that I need to be up close and personal, you can bet I’ll be using the Fusion ProGlide. Replacement cartridges are pricey, but my masochistic love affair with the cheap razors is over.  I’ll let my wallet do a bit of the bleeding from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also provided was the Fusion ProGlide Gel which seemed to work good with this razor.  I found cleanup of the blades went quickly and easily under the faucet, but I’m not sure if this was a result of the blade, or the gel.  The handle felt comfortable and easy to control.  I don’t know how effective the Flexball is, but my overall impression of the shave is superb.  I’ve finally met the cliché ridden baby’s butt, which I’d long ago written off as being a fable like the proverbial unicorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, too expensive to be the every day shave, but a requirement for those days you need a specialshave.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free, thank you Gillette for sending it out to me! I has a nice feel to it and it gives me a nice, smooth, clean shave. I would highly recommend trying this razor, top notch!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually rushed, so I use a pretty high end electric, but my fiance on the other hand uses a cartridge razor for her legs/etc.  Since she was currently using a Schick, and Gillette was kind enough to send me a trial kit, I let her run it through its paces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her first comments were &amp;#34;Wow!  This blade is amazeballs! Way better than the old razor.&amp;#34;  Now, we don&#x27;t use amazeballs to describe anything other than an 11 on a scale of 1 - 10, so that was quite the compliment.  She&#x27;s been using the razor for a few shaves now, still on the original cartridge, and still only has positive things to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, we&#x27;re pretty harsh critics, but as of yet I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.  Luckily for me, Gillette included a coupon for $5 off replacement cartridges (4 or more) so I can go stock up on blades for what appears to be her new favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette I&#x27;m trying the the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with FlexBall with technology for free. I love how this razor hugs the contours of my face to give me a close comfortable shave.  The Flexball technology allows the razor to pivot so it responses to every curve and contour of my face so I end with no irritation, nick or cuts. I used Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care also thanks to Gillette with the Proglide Razor for the ultimate shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I bounce around razors types. The quality difference between cheaper and more expensive certainly is noticed and undeniably Gillette has an edge in quality, but the type of shaving cream/gel used seems to be the most important factor for me. I have fairly sensitive skin prone to neck razor burn. As such I also received a free trial not only of the razor but of Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care which I would highly recommend.  My favorite aspect was the moisturizing aspect. I believe it helped prevent razor burn. I would purchase it above a standard shaving cream for this difference. A little of the gel goes a long way which helps to negate the higher price for this product. I also noticed it was less prone to run down my face and neck or drip. The can is cool, not a kind of material that will rust or leave the goo all over.</li>
            <li> I tried the Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball Technology as part of a promotion from Gillette even though I have always used an electric razor.  I was skeptical at first but thought I would give it a try.  Wow, was I pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I noticed the slick packaging was eye catching.  Gillette did a great job with the marketing department to get you to notice the product.  When I received it, I could not wait to open it!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried out the razor over the course of a few weeks, with different lengths of time between shaving.  I wanted to see how it worked with stubble as compared to over a week of beard growth.  It worked great every time!  The 5 blades provide a nice, close shave with no irritation.  It really did not matter as to the length of my beard.  The razor went through it with no problem at all.  The shaving gel helped make the shave seem as smooth as silk!  I feel like I actually got a much better and closer shave as compared to my electric razor.  Gillette should feel proud of themselves with this product.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and wasn&#x27;t expecting much, really; I&#x27;ve already been using the fusion razor. But after the first shave with this razor, I&#x27;m positively making the switch. It isn&#x27;t a lie or a gimmick where the packaging says gentlest shave. Not once did I feel any pain or discomfort from hair pulling caused by the razor. It was seamless and gentle and pleasant, even. This razor is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> As usual and once again Gillette has done its best job on bringing out yet again one of their best and superior quality of razor which is the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor. Its flex-ball technology helps in easy and smooth shaving and also the blades glide in every corner of your face to give you an easy, smooth and clean shave. I love the handle of this particular razor for the amazing grip it provides with the rubber like handle. Overall an amazing product for an amazing price to give you the most convenient, easy and smooth shave right from your home for an amazing cost. A must try for people who struggle shaving every day for a smooth shave in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I received this razor to try. As always, Gillette makes a superb razor. The gliding action on your face is really nice. I have always like Gillette Fusion, it&#x27;s a really great razor. The new flexball technology  has pivot action to help with curves (on your face or around your knees and ankles). So there are no scrapes or redness issues. I think Gillette has a winner again with this new Proglide Flexball razor, very dependable product and company. I am a Bzzagent and received this razor to review for a promotion. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Gillette razors!</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try this great product for free. This is a great razor. It gives me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten in 40+ years and the blades seem to last forever. A nice way to start the morning off with a close smooth shave. No nicks to deal with and it&#x27;s nice if you have to rush through a shave to know that a once over will be enough. But overall, I&#x27;d recommend it. Now time to purchase refills, so i can always have one on hand.</li>
            <li> Now this is probably the best razor I have ever used, I am trying the product free thanks to Gillette. I love this shave its clean, smooth, and pretty much gets every area of my face. I even Line up my hair line with this Razor its perfect. I just hate the price. You do truley get what you pay for because it is an awsome product, but just be prepared to dig deep in those pockets to get the razor refills. besides that. You will look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Great razor! I have been using Gillettes Venus razor (the pink girlie one thats twice the price!) and I find that this one gives me a closer shave. Plus, I love that its much cheaper than the razor geared toward women.</li>
            <li> Well i got to try this product for free and I absolutely love it. It gives a great finish and you dont have to shave a area twice. totally love it. you mist give it a try. i tried with the ocean breeze scent gel and it smells fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  I have tried every razor know to man (well almost).  This combined with the ProGlide shaving gel, is just great.  I have a very sensitive neck area that always gives me problems, but I have had great luck with the ProGLide so far.</li>
            <li> This Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor gave me the closest and smoothest shave I have ever had! I received this razor as a test product and after using it I would recommend to anyone wanting a great shave to rush out and purchase one.</li>
            <li> I received this Gillette Fusion proglide razor 100% free from BzzAgent.com for me to give my real thoughts and feelings towards this razor. I have to admit its the coolest lookin razor, very easy to use, fun. Gave me a nice smooth clean shave. I would def recommend this razor. Done what it promised to do.</li>
            <li> First off the Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!! This thing is the only one I am going to use from now on, trying the product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I recently got this for free from Gilette and I was not optimistic. I tried Fusion in the past and I honestly thought it was too many blades. I have a beard and shave my head, and did not think five blades gave me enough precision, so I went back to the Mach Three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, this razor is great. The ball that makes the head pivot seemed like a silly gimmick at first. And then I shaved my head and it seamlessly moved around the awkward contours of my dome. When it came time to define the beard, I used the other side, which has the one blade, and it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I switch full time from my Mach Three? Maybe. That depends on price, which I did not include in my review since I was given the product for free to review.</li>
            <li> This is truly the future of shaving! I tried the product for free thanks to Gillette. I knew from the moment I twisted the No Waste nozzle-guard and applied some Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care to my fingers that I was going to be enjoying a premium product. The scent was certainly evocative of an ocean breeze and plays well with those of the other similarly-themed products I use. The gel quickly produces a rich lather and imparts a pleasant cooling sensation on application. Shaving was efficient as always with my now-standby Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology. The combination easily handles a few millimeters of whiskers and, if past experience with the razor is an accurate guide, can clear a full-ish beard with a minimum of effort without needing the assistance of power tools. The skin care component to the gel meant my aftershave was going to be getting indeterminate R&amp;R in my toiletry pantry, speeding what was already the fastest shave to-date. And, most importantly, the post-shave face-wash revealed neither a millimeter of hair nor a microliter of blood! This combination handily wins my contract for future shaving needs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the prominent feature: the FlexBall. It&#x27;s a thing. And it&#x27;s amazing. It allows the razor to swivel and pivot to and fro as needed to catch all of those awkward angles around my face and neck. Disposable razors, or even a real razor with less flexibility just can&#x27;t rival the agility of this razor head that manages to pick every hair up. My facial hair tends to grow in patchy and uneven, so hairs are at different angles and of various lengths. The ProGlide mastered a smooth shave every time, without me having to drag the razor over the same patch of skin over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The handle is sturdy and the rubber grips are very helpful when shaving in the shower or just have wet hands. Sharp blades, which are key of course, and last for two or three dozen shaves. The gel strip, a good indicator of when it&#x27;s time to change cartridges. The vibration practically does the shaving for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Price of cartridges.</li>
            <li> good one, easy to shave</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I like to try new razors. But I haven&#x27;t officially switched in a long time because there really haven&#x27;t been any advancements worth abandoning my cartridges. Well I&#x27;m happy to say that for the first time, I think I found a razor I like better - The Gillette Fusion Proglide FlexBall. I also tried it with Gillette&#x27;s 2 in 1 Fusion ProGlide Sensitive shave gel in Alpine scent. Both were received as part of a sponsored, try it free campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;1. This thing flies while shaving, espcially over the jaw-line, and curves and contours of your face and neck. I usually go slow or deliberately. No need here. This is probably the easiest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s an inch ahead of me. I usually shave in the shower, and without a mirror, so this is a key factor and demonstrates how quick and easy the shave is. As a point of comparison I did switch between my old razor, and this was notably faster and easier.&lt;br /&gt;2. It looks really cool. My wife said the razor &amp;#34;looked like a superhero.&amp;#34; The dark and orange color scheme is nice.&lt;br /&gt;3. The cartridges are compatible with other Fusion Proglide handles. I get upset when compmanies don&#x27;t make new models compatible with old. I&#x27;m glad they kept it working with original handle.&lt;br /&gt;The Improvement Needs:&lt;br /&gt;1. Because I was going faster my skin was a little irritated. Not bad, but more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;2. The cartridge is a little large which makes some detail work difficult, like around the nostrils. This is a problem with all new 5 blade cartridges. It has that single blade on the back which worked a little, but i didn&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;3. This is a trial pack so it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand. Not a big deal, but some people want one so thought I&#x27;d mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - This is a strong four star shave. I&#x27;m going to look to see if I can find the cartridges at the right price (equivalent or less than other options).</li>
            <li> I got to try out this razor through Bzzagent and I think it is the best razor I have tried. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Men&#x27;s Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology has replaced my electric razor completely and blade cartridges last for about a month. I would recommend you try this razor. You wont be sorry. The flexibility and the track ball leave you with a smooth shave using less effort on your part.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette for years, so when Bzzagent asked me to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free and to review it, I was all in. This Fusion Proglide has to be the best Gillette manual razor yet! It really makes my face feel good when shaving.  I have course facial hair, and it still just glides over my skin! I highly reccommend everyone to try this product. You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s latest razor is a good upgrade to their previous razors. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors since the Mach3 and have never found another brand to match the consistency and quality of their products. As expected, this newest razor continues the trend of great shaving products. The weighty handle gives a feeling of quality and you provides confidence that the razor will deliver as expected. The new FlexBall allows for long shaving strokes that match the contour of your face. The razor shaves close and so far I&#x27;ve had no nicks or cuts. I haven&#x27;t replaced the head yet, which I&#x27;ve used over a dozen times and it should be good for a few more shaves. Overall, great product, would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this razor from BzzAgent as part of a Gillette promotion.</li>
            <li> I grew a beard for 4 months and decided to finally shave it off for spring using the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care and Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology I received as part of a free promotion from the brand. I was so worried about getting razor burn after not shaving for so long, but not a scrape or scratch. The razor slid over my skin with such ease and gave me the closest shave! After reaching up and feeling scruff for months on end, it was refreshing to feel incredibly smooth skin. The razor hugs every curve of my face and gently glides over every bump and crook in my next without a single slice. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for a long time, and they finally added something to the razor that is worth trading up from their traditional razor!</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Proglide Razor as part of a promotion from Gillette because I am a BzzAgent. Prior to receiving the razor, I had always used electric razors. I had found that combined with a good shaving gel, my electric shave was quick, effective, and satisfying. However, now I know what I was missing. My shave with this razor has been superior in every way. The shave is dramatically closer; I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin was afterwards. It was obvious and noticeable especially to my wife. The shave is also faster. This was perhaps the most surprising thing. The Proglide works so well, that it only takes a few quick strokes to complete my shave. I used to have to go over the same area multiple times with my electric razor. Lastly, the process is smooth and pleasant. Combined with Gillette&#x27;s 2-in-1 Gel, the experience is altogether something I look forward to each morning. I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It has changed my morning routine for good.</li>
            <li> As a man who shaves everyday, buying razors can be pretty costly.  Although Gillette razors are not cheap but the Fusion Proglide razor is amazing and I will not go back to another razor again.  I have been using the same blade for over a month now and its still very sharp and does not tug or pull on my facial hair. I love how the razor feels in my hands, its very lightweight and the flexball allows the razor to bend around my neck and chin areas.  I don’t have to hold the razor in an awkward way to get all of my contours of my face.  the moisture strip provides enough movement to allow the razor to easily pivot around my face.  I received this product as part of Buzz agent. Amazon has a great price on the razor blade, sometimes much cheaper the retail stores. I would recommend this razor to anyone who currently uses any Gillette products.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best manual razor i ever used. It is very smooth to use especially when combined with the Gillette fusion gel. The razor cuts all the hair on the first stroke, even in hard to reach places thanks to the flex ball. Leaves the skin feeling clean but not irritated. I highly recommend this product for daily use especially for people with sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li> My husband got to try this for the purpose of review. This has given the best shave that he has had in a long time. It gets so close with no little stubble left over. Thinking about getting one for myself.</li>
            <li> I got this shaved free from Gillette. I really like the new football technology, it allows for a nice smooth shave that moves with the contours of your face. This Razer allowed for a close shave with no Razer burn. I would definitely reccommend this shaved and I plan on buying it the next time I need a new shaved.</li>
            <li> The Razor works better than most that I&#x27;ve tried. It really hugs the curves of your face you are trying to make a smooth even shave. The best part is I don&#x27;t have to make multiple passes across my face as its cut down my total time for shaving while still giving me great results. I do have to let you all know that I did get this to test for free but why not. Its worth the money and the experience, it really is an improvement above the old razors and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Got a free sample from Gillette, but that isn&#x27;t the reason I am posting. It is an excellent razor. I really like it. Will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product as part of a promotion from Bzzz Agent! This razor is so easy to use that it&#x27;s hard to miss a single hair! When using this product with Gillette&#x27;s ProFusion Gel for Sensitive skin, my skin is left feeling so smooth and soft, and smelling nice as well. This razor is very durable, as I have dropped it on the ground a couple times, and everything stays in place, including the razor head. I will definitely be switching to this razor and using it for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> First of all, I wanted to say that I received this product a few weeks ago for free from Gillette. Since I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a couple weeks now, I figured I&#x27;d had enough time under my belt to give it a proper review. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t make notes of the packaging prior to throwing it away, so there&#x27;s nothing I can really write about in that regard. However, I do remember my first impression of the razor, and I have to say, &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; This razor has a great metal design, and, in my opinion, very eye catching. I was intrigued by the ball design, and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if it lived up to the hype. More on this later.  I&#x27;m a big fan of a hefty razor, and I thoroughly enjoy the weight of this one in my hand. This feels much sturdier than a typical razor, and you can tell that they wanted to put this in another class. I&#x27;ve used safety razors in the past, and when using a safety razor, you want a light touch and loose grip so as not to put much pressure on the skin, which results in nicks and cuts. That technique translates quite well with the Proglide Silvertouch.  Now, on to the shave.  I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I use the Art of Shaving lavender pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and badger hair brush. I built up a week of beard growth to give this a proper test. After my pre-shave routine, it was time to unleash this razor and see what it could do. First thoughts, the weight of the razor, in combination with good technique, feels great against the skin. My neck is pretty sensitive when it comes to shaving, but I had no issues here. One thing I noticed, the proglide strip, in combination with my pre-shave oil and shaving cream, was too goopy for my liking. I wouldn&#x27;t knock any stars off of the review, as I&#x27;m sure without the oil, it would be a non-issue.  As for the flexball head, I normally have issues around my jawline, and have to make a few passes to get a proper shave. With the flexball head, however, I had no problems getting the hair on the firstpass. This is exciting for me, as normally my skin gets irritated with multiple passes and I always dread the jawline. I would say that the head really did contour for maximum contact. Score one for Gillette. The precision razor on the back is the same as I&#x27;ve experienced with previous Gillette razors. No improvement there.  Overall, I&#x27;d have to say that this is the best razor that I&#x27;ve ever used. After two weeks, this razor is still treating me right, and is as great a shave as the first time. Then again, I only shave two times a week. This razor really does live up to the hype, and I&#x27;m very happy with the decision to get it. I&#x27;d say my relationship with shaving has turned into love/love, as opposed to love/hate. Cudos to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s kind of amazing how adding a simple swivel can upgrade a shaving experience. For the most part it seemed to make shaving quicker- I didn&#x27;t have to go back to patches I shaved with the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; angle. Razor burn hasn&#x27;t really ever been an issue for me, but I&#x27;m sure this would cut down on that too. Great scent. Close and quicker shave. Not really anything else to ask for.</li>
            <li> Great Razor, I&#x27;ve used dozens of different models both Gillette and other brands and this is by far my favorite razor.  The head pivots which helps it to stay close in those hard to reach places.  I received this razor free from Gillette, but like it so much I&#x27;ll be buying a blade refill.</li>
            <li> very comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I recieved this razor from Gillette for a review. I have been trying it for a few weeks and I must say that it gives an excellent shave. It follows the contours of my face just right because of the flexball technology. I get no cuts or scrapes. The blades are made very well and give an extremely close shave. I would definitely recommend buying this to anyone who asks. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really liked both the Shave gel and the razor, the shave gel had a nice smell and left my skin feeling soft. The razor gave me a really nice clean shave . I&#x27;ve used the gillette fusion razor for a long time and this one is really nice w/the pivot head.</li>
            <li> I normally use an electric razor and beard trimmer but needed to do a rare clean shave so I tried out the Gillette razor that I received free thanks to Gillette. The razor produced a pretty good shave and left my skin feeling clean and fresh without any skin irritation. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the rotating head on it though and felt it made the razor unnecessarily difficult to use compared to a regular razor. In the end, I much prefer a more simple razor without so many gimmicky features.</li>
            <li> This product is inexpensive and gives you a close, comfortable shave with no irritation. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was recently able to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall technology free from Gillette.  I have been sampling several razors lately, and this one did not disappoint.  The ProGlide&#x27;s five super-thin blades provided a clean, smooth, and comfortable shave with very little friction and no irritation.  I typically shave in the shower, so finding a razor that works well without shave creams or gels is important to me and this razor definitely fit the bill.  From the first time I drew the blades across my face I knew that it was going to be a winner.  The pivoting head hugs every curve as it glides effortlessly over your skin.  The lubricating strip delivers a quick, refreshing application of moisturizer that helps ward off pesky razor burn.  If I had a drawback to this razor, I would say that because blades are packed so closely together, it does get gummed up from time to time.  I was able to easily clean it out though.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from Gillette to try. I think its a great razor. The flex ball helps the razor slide over areas smoother. At first the steep angle of the blades threw me off, but overall its a great razor and results in a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This razor was overall great.  I had a smooth, nick-free shave.  The razor did turn/bend with my face as I shaved.  However, I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the razor tended to be difficult to clean.  The facial hair would become stuck and difficult to wash out just after one day of shaving.  After 3 days I had to use a pin needle to swipe the hair from the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a BzzAgent promotional trial so it cost me nothing.  Having seen the cost of the razor in store and because of the problem with facial hair binding up in the blades, I will not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a smooth shave and follows the contour of your face really well. It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and does not give you {much} razor burns. Lasts long. Guys get this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I received one of these from Gillette to review as the normally do. I really do like this razor and keep it as a backup to my main, an old Gillette ball tech. I use the old razor mainly because the blades on newer razors are way too expensive, especially compared to picking up some double bladed razors. But this razor is great to have on hand in case I want a nick free, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I got this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette. I really enjoyed using it and have continued to buy refills. The razors themselves produce a great close shave and the flexball allows for a close cut under the neck and around the jaw. And the shave was consistent regardless of whether I was shaving a few days of growth or over a week. If you like a good close shave with a superior product, give the Fusion Proglide a try.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to try a new razor since my face is very jagged and I have sharp cheekbones but I received this razor free through Bzzagent so I figured what better time than now. I was definitely not disappointed once I tried it and now consider it my new go-to razor. I was so impressed how it easily adjusts and glides over my jawline, chin and neck gently with low cutting blades so it has the ability to reach every corner and edge of my face without nicks! Compared to other brands, this special flex ball handle gets the hard to reach areas by your chin and neck that the other razors could never reach for me. The razor is easy to hold and has a sturdy base to allow you to safely put it down. The razor itself hugs your face like a magnet and the moisture strip provides just enough moisture to allow the razor to easily pivot around each curve, nook and cranny with careful precision. It is the best shaving experience I have ever had and it does not irritate my face like most other razors. I also like the button for releasing the blades which makes for easy, convenient shaving, especially when I am running late for work! Since it has a five bladed head that is mounted on a handle, it is capable of lateral movement of about 20 degrees, so it is not limited to only face! The blade head can swivel about 90 degrees with a slight movement of the wrist. The competitive pricing of this razor, in combination with the soft supple skin in provides is a win win situation. My own kids didn&#x27;t recognize me because of how &amp;#34;handsome&amp;#34; my face looked after using it. Take my advice and try this razor, I guarantee that you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor.  I have been a daily shaver for over 20 years.  My facial hair is very coarse.  That being said, I was given the opportunity by Gillette to try the Proglide razor.  It shaved my face with the easiest of touch.  The razor moved across my face very smoothly.  I&#x27;ve used other products with the same number of blades, and those razors typically lasted a week because I would need to shave over my facial hair numerous times.  With the Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor, I only need to go over my facial hair once.  This allowed the blade to last over a month!  Sure, the Proglide Razors may be slightly higher in price than other razors, but they are worth the price as you get so much more use per blade.</li>
            <li> I love EVERYTHING about this razor! Arthritic hands can make it a challenge to get around my chin but the flexball makes it very easy. Typically, a razor will last me just one shave before drawing blood with each stroke. My beard hair is just that coarse. I got ten whole shaves out of this little beastie! My one complaint would be that the cartridges are not cheap, but when considering the amount saved on not using a new one every day, the cost is certainly worth it. In fairness though, I didn&#x27;t have to pay for my first one. Bzzagent was kind enough to grant me my very first for this review, and I thank them wholeheartedly for that!</li>
            <li> This made shaving my head so much easier. The FlexBall Technology helped keep the razor on my scalp at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology from Gillette courtesy of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> The fusion proglide razor was easy to use with the cool new pivot head leaving. It left a great smooth feel with no bumps,  irritation, or burn. My neck and face felt smooth all day. The KS for letting me try the product free Gillette.</li>
            <li> I use this razor and love it. I use other razors and just don&#x27;t get the close clean shave Gillette gives me. Easy to clean out and lasts for a long time without having to change blades. Only brand of razors I use now. I received this razor as part of promotion to try out the brand but Gillette is my go to brand for close and clean shave.</li>
            <li> I received this razor and the Fusion for sensitive skin gel as part of a promotion.  If you&#x27;ve read any of my other reviews; then you know I always give my honest opinion.  So, all that out of the way...  This razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  It holds to the contours of your face and leaves you baby smooth!  I trim everything up with an electric beard trimmer and then finish off the sides with this bad boy.  The only downside I saw was when I&#x27;d let my facial hair get out of control and didn&#x27;t trim first.  It clogged up pretty quickly and needed to be rinsed out a lot if I didn&#x27;t trim up first.  I don&#x27;t think that this is a problem that&#x27;s specific to this razor - it&#x27;s been my experience that they all do it (with the exception of a strait razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving shaving again.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like a no frills razor, but it shaves so close and leaves a fantastically smooth feel. I guess it&#x27;s the trackball that allows the blades to trace the contours of my face but I really like the feeling I have after shaving with this razor!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to participate in a campaign through BzzAgent to review The new Fusion ProGlide Sensitive 2-in-1 Shave Gel and the Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball technology.  I have to say it was the best shave that I ever had.  I receive the Active Sport Fusion ProGlide Sensitive 2-in-1 Shave Gel. It was really invigorating.  I just love how the Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball technology contoured every curve of my face.  This is a product the every men shouldn’t be without. Thank you BzzAgent for the great opportunity.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion from Gillette through buzz agent and I love it! Great razor, gives a very close shave and there was not very much irritation. Would recommend 10/10</li>
            <li> Thanks again to Gillette for sending me this free to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this razor.  It really knows how to contour to my face, which by the way has many ups and downs.  Together with the fusion gel you couldn&#x27;t get a better shaving duo.</li>
            <li> As someone who hates shaving, I was looking for a razor that would make shaving &amp;#34;fun.&amp;#34; After trying copious amounts of razors that didn&#x27;t do the trick, I received the Fusion ProGlide as part of a promotion. What a terrific product. After shaving, my face was smooth &amp; silky. The razor provided a comfortable shave, and it did not leave the &amp;#34;itchy residue&amp;#34; my other razors provided. The shave gel is great, and it provides an easy shave.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Works well by conjuring to my skin.  Easily cuts my beard in one stroke.  I recommend people with sensitive skin or doen&#x27;t like spending much time shaving to use this product.  Not sure how long the blade will stay sharp but its been almost a week now and its still cutting my beard fine.</li>
            <li> This Gillette razor with the trackball technology is the cat&#x27;s meow for me. Partnered with their new shaving gel you get the closest and cleanest shave on the planet.The trackball made it possible for the blades to follow every contour of my face and get every bit of stubble with not a hint of irritation. This is the best , most comfortable shave I have ever experienced.  Gillette has made me a new lifelong customer.  Try it for the closest shave of your life.  The Gillette company supplied me with the razor and gel to try via the Buzz Agent program.</li>
            <li> I tried this wonderful product, great results!  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got a close shave and a smooth finish. I got to try this free from gillette for being a bzzagent. love the ball it really helped it move with my skin from any direction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of razors marketed towards men, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the fact that men are usually offered a million more blades than we ladies are. After all, those faces are pretty important. This razor is great, that rolling ball really helps with getting in there better than other razors do. The first time I used it on my legs, I was pretty impressed with the closeness of the shave. Didn&#x27;t cut myself once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using old style single blade safety razors for a few years now to shave my head and face.&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor through a promotional web offer, and I have mixed feeling about it.&lt;br /&gt;The ultra-thin 5 blade design provided quite possibly the smoothest, and cleanest shave I&#x27;d had in years, and oddly enough, the blades didn&#x27;t clog up with hair like other multi-blade disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;On the other side, though, unaccustomed as I am to a razor that pivots, when I tried to shave in a normal manner, the pivot ball moved, allowing the blades to slide sideways across my head, leaving a small slice in the skin. I do not believe this is really a fault of the FlexBall, so much as my inexperience with it. Once a person learns to use the unique razor design, it could provide for a superior shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology! This razor gets all of the hair without having to go over my face several times! Definitely not as much tug and pull as well! The trimmer on back is perfect for edging as well! Works great! Will definitely continue to use and recommend this one!</li>
            <li> This razor blade comes off as new age technology. The flex ball that flows with the contours of your face? Phenomonal. This product has made those difficult areas easy to shave. Under the jaw line and the chin are always problematic, but not with the flex ball technology. The precision trimmer is great for my sideburns. Its also good under my nose in that hard to reach area. Overall, this product is great and definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also trying this product for free thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li> I was recently offered the chance to try out for free the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Technology as part of a promotion.  I love this razor.  I used to miss spots, especially around my jawbone.  The flexball technology conforms to my skin and gives me a smooth finish each time.  I would highly recommend this to others.  Any Gillette cartridge can work with the stick.  I wish I could try the power version!</li>
            <li> I always use men&#x27;s razors over women&#x27;s - I find they give a smoother, closer shave for me. I&#x27;ve been using a Schick Hydro 5 for the last few years, and a Mach 3 before that, but this just might be the one to replace either of those. I love the flexball handle, even on my legs it makes it easy to work over the tougher areas, like my knees and the backs of my ankles. It feels like you have more control, and I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;d be any different on a man&#x27;s face. It gives a very close, smooth shave, and I didn&#x27;t nick myself even the the slightest. All too often, it&#x27;s to nick a tough area with a brand new razor, but I didn&#x27;t have that issue with this one. It&#x27;s also at a great price, and has a sturdy handle and set up, with a lightweight feel. I am pretty sure next time I need new blades, it will be for this one.</li>
            <li> Already use a fusion razor and fusion blades so this \\&quot;flex handle technology\\&quot; provided a good comparison.  The razor uses regular fusion blade cartridges and has about the same weight and feel of the regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexibility of the moving head is the main difference and while it had a good feel and seemed smooth and easy to handle I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s remarkably better than the regular fusion.  In fact, the way the flexball is structured makes me think it is set up to be obsolete in a few years of constant use as the metal strip that aids the flexibility doesn&#x27;t look very permanent.  There&#x27;s a slight difference in handling while shaving but not something worth significantly more money depending on how its priced compared to the regular Gillette razor.  If you aren&#x27;t used to Gillette it&#x27;s a nice start in the fusion line but not something that I would switch to from my regular fusion razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never happy with my shaving options, and am in constant search for &amp;#34;the ultimate shave&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I&#x27;ve just been using the Proglides for a &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; shave, or to clean up after an electric razor. So, when offered a shot to try the latest Proglide, I had to take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say after a few weeks is that the flexball seems to have no noticeable effect on my shaving. I do like the overall heavier feel of the handle, but all-in-all this razor is a zero-gain from the previous versions.</li>
            <li> I gave this item5 stars because it definitely deserves it!  The flexball technology is amazing, and gets every hair with absolutely no nicks! Smooth shave and great blades at a great price! I am now a loyal Gillette consumer for life.</li>
            <li> Where shaving is concerned there is no avoiding the need. Let go of one day, and one is well on their way to the shadow look. In my case, I do not have the requirement to let a beard grow because I start to develop a serious rash, so I must keep a very smooth shaved surface and apply and after shave touch of aveeno, which I discovered is the best for dry skin and vanishes any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology,  the daily staple of the shaving process, that together with the substantially expensive pro glide razors make the winning combination. I have been using mostly Gillette products for the better of a decade and more, and so far I have grown accustomed to using this particular shaver, which I guess makes me loyal to the brand. This newer development on the trustworthy Proglide series, is without a doubt a step on the right direction, without trying to say that is way much better to the previous model, it is slightly better, feels more manageable and somehow, even sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered that in my case, that the best possible approach to shaving with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology and its blades, is to combine it with an electric razor. Sometimes when I let go of shaving for a couple of day for whatever reasons I may have, I use the Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver in the shower. By doing it this way I take most of the larger part of the job, and I finish the job with this highly competent newer version of a very reliable method of shaving. I read somewhere that by spraying the blades of the fusion with glass cleaner it prolongs their usage, so after trying it I get to use the same blades for about 10 uses with no problem, sometimes a day or two more. Perhaps this works because of the electric razor helping to reduce the amount of work the Gillette Fusion is required to perform. Either way, I am very happy with the product, as I mentioned before, have been using it for a long time for it is the more convenient and effective method to shave without taking too much time to do it. I thank amazon for allowing me to try this amazing new design, which is with no doubt the newer and best in the lineup. 4.5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very hairy guy. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor has continued to live up to my expectations. I received this razor from Gillette to try. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for two weeks. My neck is usually riddled with razor burn but not with this razor.  The shave is very smooth and prevents ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve told a couple of friends about this new razor.  I&#x27;ve discussed the pros and cons (there are none).  I highly recommend using this razor for an awesome shave while it creates a baby-smooth texture!</li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE! Gillette has as all fooled! I was really excited about trying this product not only for my face but my head as well.  There was NOTHING to it. The Flex Ball didnt work and it was hard to get a close shave. Now before you say well yeah you shaved your head and your face what did you think would happen.... I used 2 razor things 1 for my head and 1 for my face. It still wasn&#x27;t worth the time an effort to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> The easy flexing of this  handle does not provide any benefit. In act a stronger spring would be beneficial ! !</li>
            <li> Love this razor. It fits my face and works with it. I have rough hair, so sometimes using other razors i would get cuts, with this one, i don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I actually received this razor free to try as a promotion from gillette. so far, i really like this razor. I like the maneuverability of the the flex ball. makes it  a little easier to get certain places that i usually am turning the razor all different direction to get just right. The 5 blades are amazing.  I felt like i only had to make one pass and my face was smooooth.  I do usually keep somewhat of a beard and if its been a little while since my last shave, it can be a lot of work.  If i use a cheapie razor, sometimes 1 doesnt do it.  had no problem with this one.  Face was baby smooth.  I noticed the blades got a little gunked up easy and a little difficult to clean, but manageable. Overall, i would continue to use this razor. Not all that thrilled with refill cartridge prices, but all the good ones are pretty pricey, not just these.</li>
            <li> Received this as a trial from BzzAgent. Thanks BzzAgent and Gillette! The Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care Ocean Breeze Sent is cool smooth and makes the Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology glide over face and skin with no razor burn,nice subtle sent refreshing highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I received this kit from Bzzagent for free so I can review it. I really enjoy this razor. The handle is pretty good. It does a pretty close shave. I also tried the Gillette Fusion Pro-glide Sensitive Gel in the Active Sport scent. The gel is pretty good. Its easy on my face. I love Gillette  Overall both the razor and gel is a good product.</li>
            <li> Overview: This razor is good. The flex ball and the blades are a noticeable improvement over standard disposable razors. Much better than the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; version (http://amzn.com/B00J3MPS4E )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I was given this product by the brand to test it out and review it, I did not purchase it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this razor I was using the power version of this razor. I like this version much better, the vibrations really did nothing for me. This product is exactly like the power version sans the gimmicky oscillations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I like about this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)The blades really glide along your skin, and they appear to last for quite some time. Though I am an Asian male, so at most I shave once every other day. And when I do shave, it&#x27;s not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The flex ball really does help the blades follow the contour of your face. Combined with the blade design this makes the shaving experience really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) 5 blades is a little too much for me. Maybe this gives a smoother shave, but it&#x27;s a little wide for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s a little pricey. This was given to me to test for free, but I don&#x27;t know if I would ever go out to buy one of these at $8-10. The refills are pretty costly too.</li>
            <li> I tried another razor that I got for free from Bzzagent from Gillette. It was the Silvertouch. I realize this uses the same technology, but I feel like the Flexball has improved. I can feel more pressure on my skin rather than the razor just making the turns with me. That being said, this gives a good clean, close shave so it gets 5 stars. I used the Shave Gel that Bzzagent/Gillette sent me. I found it was cool on my face and gave a little tingle. It worked well and my skin felt soft and smooth after my shave. I will continue to use this gel!</li>
            <li> This was free as a promotion and it is the best shave I have had in a long time!! It fits all the curves of the face for a close shave.  I just wish the replacement heads were cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite razor from Gillette, and I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them over the years.  BzzAgent provided me with a free Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball (manual), and I love it.  Despite receiving it for free, it&#x27;s well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I love this razor?  It gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  That&#x27;s it.  Same high quality I&#x27;ve come to enjoy from other Gillette razors, but the shave is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does the Flexball technology bring to the table?  For me, I think it&#x27;s like adding power steering to you shave.  It just really easy to shave around the bumps and contours of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think another razor would unseat the Gillette Fusion Power as my favorite, but this has.  I love them both, but I give the flexball the higher rating.</li>
            <li> This particular razor was sent to me for free to try for my Gillette BzzAgent Campaign &amp; I must say, it is worth every penny that you pay in stores or online. I will never go back to another razor. It give the perfect smooth, clean, quick shave that it claims. Pair it up with it&#x27;s new 2-in-1 shave gel &amp; it doesn&#x27;t even compare to your neighborhood barber. It feels wonderful &amp; leaves you razor burn free!</li>
            <li> By far the best shave of my life.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is all I could ask for in a razor and more.  I received this razor free from Gillette to try out and I can honestly say I have never been more impressed with a razor.  I often get cuts, nicks, abrasions or razor bumps when shaving but none of these occurred since I have started shaving with this razor.  My skin is now smooth and I actually look forward to shaving each morning instead of viewing it as a chore.</li>
            <li> This razor gives the closest shave without leaving cuts/nicks from applying too much pressure. The flex ball allows the razorblade to glide over the skin and move with the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> The razor works great. Not sure the ball thing is really a need. I do not notice it contouring to my face much if any. Seems gimicky to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you could only figure out how to make that blue strip not get all dry and cracked so fast, this could get 5 stars. I dry my razor after every use and the strip right above the razors looks all dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I have used many razors in the past but this one I have to say it is one of kind.  It is great with all new technology it is easy to use.  Leaves your skin so smooth with no breakouts.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from Gillette through a product testing site. I really enjoyed using it. I have a tough contour face and most razers either leave hair behind unshaved or end up cutting me. This one worked great. There were still some areas where it was a little tough to reach but was way better than razors I have used in the past. Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The gillette Fusion Proglide is phenomenal. I had received this product as part of a promotion from the brand and I am so glad! I love the ergonomic design of this product. It makes my shaving ritual a bit more comfortable and quick. When you look at it upclose you think high-quality. It&#x27;s sturdy yet at the same time the handle is lightweight and it&#x27;s very easy to maneuver against the facial contours. I am also using 2-in-1 shave gel in the Alpine scent along with this razor and they work well. The alpine scent is a bit minty, I would say and definitely gives you a tingly sensation while shaving. But the blade of the proglide razor is definitely friendly towards your skin. I haven&#x27;t gotten any cuts so far and I&#x27;m getting a close shave. No rusting either but I&#x27;m sure that will appear over a few uses. I highly recommend this model. Definitely check out your major retailers and check in the coupon section because they usually have coupons for this brand.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor for any face!  I was fortunate enough to be part of a test panel where I was given a sample Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor to test. I was extremely impressed with how smooth the shave is with this razor. I thought nothing could be better than their Mach 3 version, but I was wrong, this razor doesn&#x27;t miss anything. it has enough blades to perfectly clear a path in it&#x27;s wake. Male or female approved. I would recommend this razor to anyone that wants a rash free most comfy shave of any part of the body. Thanks Gillette for this free trial.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and if I do not leave a few days between shaves I get uncomfortable razor burn with noticeable red bumps.  For this reason I have been a long time user of Gillette razors because they seem to minimize my razor burn, I definitely could never use a cheap disposable single blade razor, it would leave cuts on my face for a week.  I recently had the opportunity to try their Gillette Power razor that vibrates to reduce friction during your shave and I absolutely loved it so I jumped at the chance to be able to try their newest Flexball razor for free through Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball technology does exactly what it states it would.  The flexball technology helps the blade to contour to your face giving you a closer and smoother shave.  The razor cartridges are just as good as I&#x27;ve come to expect, nothing new there.  The multiple sharp blades give a smooth and close shave and the strip on the razor acts as a good indicator of the life of the razor.  I seem to be able to get about 5 good shaves out of a single razor cartridge.  I wish it they lasted a bit longer for what they cost but they do the trick and that&#x27;s the most important thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give the razor a 5 star because it just was not as good as the Gillette Power razor.  I love the vibration effect that the power razor has, it helps to reduce friction and adds a bit of a tingle to my face that helps to reduce immediate irritation.  I definitely get the closest shaves with the power razor, but the flexball is a close second.  If and when they combine the two into one super razor, I would give that product 6 stars.  That&#x27;s currently not possible so I&#x27;d have to start a petition with Amazon to get them to add a star to their rating system.  It would probably result in a long and drawn out process with steep court fees and hours of my time, but for a razor that combines the power and flexball technologies, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> For starters, I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor w/Flex ball from BzzAgent. I have used Gillette razors for the last 10 years or so. Prior to receiving this razor, I was using the Gillette Fusion Power and I didn&#x27;t think I would like this one nearly as much. But after using it now for the past four weeks, I would say this razor works just as well as the Power razor I have (or had). The benefits I have seen are that the handle of the new Flexball model seems a bit more comfortable, the razor seems to last a little longer (I shave 3-4 times a week and it has lasted over 4 weeks, so not too bad) and the razors themselves don&#x27;t seem to get clogged as much as the previous blade I was using. I am not sure though if this is more attributable to the razor itself or that I was also using the Gillette 2-in-1 Shave Gel (which I also received as part of the offer from BzzAgent). My face feels just as smooth with this razor as it did while using my prior model. The only downside I have found is that the smoothness of my face doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long. I attribute this to the power capability though as I had noticed this on my power version when my battery died and I was too lazy to get another one, my shave wouldn&#x27;t seem to last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d recommend this razor as it works great, but I will likely end up buying the power version when my blade wears out.</li>
            <li> I recieved this pretty awesome razor from BzzAgent and Gilette, and boy am I glad I got it!  I have used manual razors for most of my life, and using electronic razors sometimes.  But this razor is so good, I probably don&#x27;t have to use electronic shavers!  I love the close shave I get, and the the flexball thing really makes my shave comfortable.  I also have somewhat sensitive skin and this razor does not really irritate me, or cut me.  The blades last about 2 weeks and I think they are a little expensive, but hey I get a pretty good shave, so I think its worth it!</li>
            <li> I received this razor to test from Gillette and I really like it.  It takes only one swipe with the razor to do what took two or three with other razors mdue to the flex action of the razor.  The blades also have a longer life before change.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Paired the the ProGlide shave gel its a great way to begin your day!!! I received the products as part of a testing program</li>
            <li> I love this razor, it is smooth. It seems to glide over my face. It shave&#x27;s close without tearing up my face. I received this as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> Hey guys, Glockspeed31 here and I&#x27;m a BzzAgent. I received this new razor and shaving gel as a test and review from Gillette and man, the 5 blades in it makes it seem like you are shaving on glass. I normally use an electric razor due to my skin normally irritating from razor blades. This razor left my face very smooth and hardly any irritation afterwards. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a top of the line razor but not at gold prices. The Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care has a nice refreshing smell and helped with any razor burn.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me this razor and I have been using it for about a month now and I can say without a doubt that it is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. The Fusion ProGlide razor is well made and feel great in your hand. Quite honestly before using it I though the The flexball technology was going to be just a gimmick and make no difference but after using it, I was wrong. It contours perfectly to your face which not only makes it possible to easily get to every hair, but it also shaves them more evenly and closer. In my opinion this is the best product to ensure that you get the best shave possible. I would easily recommend it to those looking to step their shaving game up to the top tier. Thank you Gillette.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product before , but never tried because I thought it was kind of expensive for a razor but thanks to Gillette I have chance to try it.Now after trying I can tell that it is worth every penny. So after shaving a few times with this razor I&#x27;m loving it. It gives a close shave without irritating my skin. The handle is very easy and comfortable to use. The blades did not even get plugged while shaving. This razor is definitely a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big fan of shaving gel I use a foam. Ocean breeze shave gel is great formula to leave your skin feeling smooth after shaving. Having a plastic canister is an excellent idea.</li>

YOUR A MAN NOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received Product as a Promotion from Brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. I hate to shave every day, because I hate the feel of the razor. With this I don&#x27;t feel it cutting the hair on the skin and it gives me the closest shave I have ever had. My wife loves that I now shave every day without her telling me that it is time to shave or did you shave today. It is worth every cent for this razor and it&#x27;s replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I have received the Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology to try as a free promotion from BzzAgent. I have always used Gillettes razors because I feel like they have always been the superior product on the market and have always been available at a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;I have been waiting to get this razor in the mail from BzzAgent and decided to hold off on shaving til it comes. Upon receiving the razor, I immediately ran to the bathroom to begin using it. I am very impressed with this model. Really liking the Flexball as it provides a smooth, and effortless shave and glides across my skin without any hassle. I give this a 5 star rating and continue to be a big fan of Gillette products</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor &amp; 2-in-1 Shave Gel as part of a promotion from Gillette. I must say, Gillette is never a disappointment. I used the sensitive shave gel and was more than pleased. The foam is thicker and stickier than most, leaving strings as you pull away and dropping some while applying but other then that, great performance. The razor itself gets close enough to leave me shadow free through most of the day. A nice smooth and shadow ridden shave. Cant be disappointed with Gillette.</li>
            <li> If you are a daily shaver like me, you&#x27;ll appreciate the necessity of a high quality razor. Thank you to Gillette for sending me this razor to try (for free) I could not believe how incredibly smooth my face felt after using it for the first time. Want a great shave? Try pairing it with Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide 2 in 1 shave gel. Great lather, softens skin and hair, offering a close shave with amazing results! It will not tear or pull your skin and the smooth gliding FlexBall conforms to every contour of your face.</li>
            <li> What a great product! I have always been a user of an electric razor because I could never find that manual razor that works good for me but that all many have just changed.  This razor is great!!! It conforms to your face like nothing I have used before and the Proglide razors ... Wow!!! Those are nice!!! Gillette has a new user thats for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> I was offered the chance to try the Fusion Proglide Power Razor through a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;ve been using this brand since their Mach 3 model came out, and I&#x27;ve always been happy with their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second model with FlexBall that I use, and I must say it&#x27;s grown on me. Now that I&#x27;m used to it, I do notice a difference in comfort if I have to go back to a fixed handle. The blades are sharp but gentle, as usual, and always give me a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> All i have ever thought of is how rough shaving is when you have sensitive skin. My skin would feel irritated while shaving. After i received a Fusion ProGlide Razor to try it a couple of months ago, i fell in love with it. my skin now feels very soft and smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li> My experience with the Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 + Skin Care was excellent.  My shave was smooth and efficient.  I had five minutes before I needed to leave for work.  My neck was too long under my beard, so I quickly turned to my BzzKit.  BzzAgent gave me a razor to try for free.  The shave gel was easy to apply, smelled great and aided in the fast shave.  The shave itself was snag-free and smooth.  My shave was so quick and efficient, I could not believe I was using a disposable razor.  The contours of my face were not match against this razor!  I would recommend this product and use it again.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re looking at this product thinking to yourself, that ball in the center is a gimmick.  Well I thought so too, however, I was presented one from Gillette to try out for free.  So good news, I&#x27;ve always used their razors, they&#x27;re great, you pay more, but they have the best razors, they do a lot of good RnD with the blades and how they&#x27;re designed that give you a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant about that ball, but at the end of the day, it does actually serve a useful function.  The shave is close and accurate and the ball actually does work.  That being said I would highly recommend trying this out.  After all, what have you to lose other than more facial hair!</li>
            <li> This razor uses the same replacement head with 5 blades as my existing Fusion razors.  The biggest difference is the smoothly pivoting head.  This swivel motion really allows all of the blades to squarely cut all whiskers and leave a remarkably smooth shave.  Your basically paying for the mechanical handle and I think it&#x27;s worth the little bit extra that Gillette wants for it.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide with Flexball handle technology is unlike any razor I have used before. The ability of the razor to hug the curves reminds me of a sports car. I had no difficulty using this to get around the angles of my jaw and under my chin. I have very coarse facial hair and this went through it with ease. It really takes the thought out of shaving, and allowed me to just trust my my shaver handle. This led to a quicker, cleaner, and more accurate shave. Of note I received this razor free from Gillette to try and review.</li>
            <li> This razor was great at getting a close shave and leaving my face baby-soft that was until my wife stole it and started using it. Had to go buy another one!! Great razor!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well this razor performed on my face.  The shave was smooth and clean, and took less passes than my normal razor.  The flexible head had me skeptical at first, but after seeing it in action I was sold.  It easily glided along the contours of my face, and provided a shave that was nearly perfect.  No missed whiskers, no skin irritation, no nicks/cuts/scrapes.  All-in-all a great shave for this type of razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. I love the Gillette products. However, the replacement cartridges are just too expensive. With the advent of the Dollar Shave Club and some other cheaper competitors, it is just not price conscious to buy these anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette razors my whole life and I have really liked them. When I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle it was one of the best shaves I have ever had. I love the way the handle is design and the way the razor glides so smoothly over my face. I love the blades that are on this razor. I haven&#x27;t had any cuts since I started using this razor. This will definitely be my razor of choice when they are released in stores in June. I can&#x27;t wait to see how the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor with FlexBall handle make this an even better experience!</li>
            <li> The Gillete Fusion Proglide Manual razor offers little in terms of a true upgrade. The handle itself is significantly thinner and sleeker than the previous model I owned. That said, it does function just as well as it&#x27;s predecessor. I&#x27;m not really sure how the &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; technology works or if it even does anything to enhance my shave. It seems like it does the same job just in a smaller package. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this razor how well it shaves my face so close to the skin smooth nice shave! highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband to try as he has been looking for a replacement to what he has used for years. This is not it. He thought it was on the heavy side, was clunky in his hand, not easy to manuever. The shave itself seemed fine, for an average man&#x27;s beard, but no better than a good disposable blade, in his opinion. The price of the replacements blades for all brands seem to be pricey, this was no different. He just didn&#x27;t like it well enough to invest in it. If he was happy with all aspects of the razor, then yes, the price of the replacement blades may warrant the investment.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide has given me the closest, smoothest and fastest shave I have ever had with a manual razor.  The addition of the flexball technology adds to the speed of the shave as the blades can flex over the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, I have used it 7 times and the blades seem to still be sharp, I like the flexball makes it easier to shave my face. Makes my face smoother with less strokes, with other razors I have to go over and over my face to get a clean close shave. I haven&#x27;t priced replacement blades yet but will buy because of the shave that Gillette fusion Proglide Razor gives me.</li>
            <li> This latest incarnation of Gillette&#x27;s five-bladed Fusion razor is advertised to have a flexible joint between the head and handle, thus more perfectly adjusting to the contour of one&#x27;s face.  Whether this actually happens is debatable.  What is incontrovertible is that this razor provides the closest, most comfortable shave I have ever encountered, even better than Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3, which was my former reference standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must for the well groomed man.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give you two reviews for the price of one with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manu... oh, it&#x27;s a long name. It&#x27;s a razor by Gillette that involves the term, &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m somewhat inclined to request more items use the term, &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; in their names, but I suspect it&#x27;s been copywritten by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two members of our family tried out this razor with somewhat different thoughts on it. My husband used it to shave his face, as most men do, and he found it to be, &amp;#34;pretty good&amp;#34;. He find it got as close as his regular go-to razor (which I can&#x27;t give you the name of because I&#x27;ve been told to stay away from it), but he was a little vexed by the motion created by the Flexball (I really can&#x27;t tell you how much I love that name). He found it added absolutely nothing to the experience, but still liked the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the Flexball (!) razor with somewhat more enthusiastic results. The flexible nature of the razor rocked on my legs and other lady shaving points. I actually prefer mens razors to women&#x27;s (except my husband&#x27;s, which I am not allowed to touch). Women&#x27;s razors are vastly overpriced compared to men. I&#x27;m assuming pink plastic is more expensive than gray, but I have no research to back this up. Men&#x27;s, more importantly, give a much closer and less damaging shave to the bikini area. Also, they rarely have that weird lotion strip that seems to be the hallmark of most women&#x27;s razors. This Gillette razor is my new favorite choice and I&#x27;ve banned by husband from touching it for no other reason but because he&#x27;s so adamant I stay away from his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the vast majority of people reading this will be men, so know that my husband gave this three stars. He liked it, but didn&#x27;t really love it. For any of your ladies reading over their shoulder, I&#x27;m giving it four and a half stars. I really liked it.</li>
            <li> 1. You Will Not Have To Buy New Blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, to address the first concern, no, you will not have to throw out your Gillette Fusion five-bladed razors. This is essentially an update to the Fusion line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It Swivels A Lot More&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, the key point here is that it swivels more. No more fidgeting around making weird faces trying to get those pesky hairs. Gillette claims you no longer have to do that, and that you can fit their Flexballs into all those hard to reach little crevasses on your face as it rotates left and right as well as up and down.&lt;br /&gt;Still, honestly, it’s a pretty good idea. Every guy has this problem, admit it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. That Adds Up To More Efficiency, In Theory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette claims two improvements by making a more flexible razor. The first is that you’ll miss 20% fewer hairs on your face, which for the hirsute is something fairly important. And it makes sense; if you’re able to shave more efficiently, of course you’ll get that hair that keeps growing between your nose and your cheek.</li>
            <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used. Fits well, stays put. The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale. By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz. I measured a Gillette disposable at 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it. I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced. I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor. Again--felt very solid and well constructed. The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #1,&amp;#34; I did not shave for several days, so that I had a 3-day beard. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard. I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel. I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften. This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck. I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory. As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave. Thus, both the Field Tests confirm the capability of this product. It works as advertised. When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel. With 5 blades closely spaced together, this is not a trivial feat. After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color. The Flexball pivots in 2 different ways. As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction. There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far. You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting. This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever. There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place. This fastener appears to be very solid; I doubt anything will come lose. The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering. It appears to operate flawlessly. All of this is to allow the razor to match the contours of your face. That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.) To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. The razor feels very solid. One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris LawsonY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors.

            <li> Before I received the Fusion ProGlide, I had two ways of shaving.  The first was/is a Norelco electric shaver, which is fine and does a good job and is very convenient.  The second is my grandfather&#x27;s razor, a Superspeed  II from the 1940&#x27;s that does a great job, albeit a lot more slowly than the Norelco.  When I was in the mood for a quick shave I used the Norelco, when I was looking for a closer cut I would use the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t have to choose between either convenience or a great shave.  The Fusion ProGlide cuts as well as the Superspeed but does it in about 1/3 of the time.  It does a MUCH better job than an electric razor ever could, but because of the multiple blades it does it much more quickly than a disposable razor or an older single-blade razor could ever do.  Plus, I have used it for two weeks and haven&#x27;t cut myself once, which is something I can&#x27;t always say for the SuperSpeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would unconditionally recommend this to a friend.  Thanks to Gillette for providing me with this great product!</li>
            <li> Smoothest shave from a trusted name in Men&#x27;s razors!  This is the best razor I have had.  I have tried MANY razors and can never seem to get a close, even shave.  This razor does that and the flexball is a unique and interesting idea for a razor.  It took some getting used to, but I am a fan for life.  I will not buy any other razor from now on.  Great Job Gillette!</li>
            <li> First day using the new razor. I have both an older version of the ProGlide without the FlexBall and a Schick Hydra. I just used this new one for the first time today and it worked great. The FlexBall makes it extremely comfortable wet or dry as I used it in the shower and then out to trim up. I use a razor on my neck and cheeks just leaving a trace of beard and this was twice as fast as using my Schick. Also, the handle is smaller and heavier and is not a plastic tube like the Schick which feels better and sturdier. My girlfriend also used it to shave her legs and said it was much better than her Venus razor. Going to use it this week and report again.</li>
            <li> I like the sturdy feel of this razor because it not only forms around my face as I shave but it feels a lot better and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; as much when I shave.  I&#x27;ve been using the powered razors for sometime and found this transition very easy and can see myself replacing my old Gillette razor.  I&#x27;d recommend this razor to anyone who doesn&#x27;t use a full featured electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I received this razor in the mail from #Bzzagent and I must say that it is the best razor that I have tried yet! I&#x27;ve mostly used electric shavers in the past because the normal razors would leave my neck area irritated and bumpy. With this razor and how it contours to the movement of your face and neck, I didn&#x27;t have any irritation at all. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> I only got one through the Vine program but one was enough.  The first think I noted was how heavy the product is.  The next think I noticed was the ball that gave the head flexibility while huge didn&#x27;t really seem to add anything to the actual shave experience. It seemed to be a lot of bells and whistles without any payoff.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide Razor by Gillete was provided free to me as part of a review promotion by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle itself is perfect and is tapered at the right places and quite ergonomic.  I&#x27;ve never had a better shave.  While this razor provided the BEST shave I ever had it might be expensive for the average consumer. The reason why the shave is so good is that the blades are placed closer together than other razor blade systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have thick facial hair so this razor does very well, leaving me a smooth and clean looking.  I don&#x27;t need to change my blade after a couple of shaves, so that is an added bonus.  The blade hugs my face allowing me to use less strokes and less razor burn.  That&#x27;s because of the flex ball which really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold, go out and try it now.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this razor, after all I love the one I have been using.  I had been using one with a battery that created vibrations to reduce friction and really liked it.  This one is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a battery or vibration of any kind it is smoother and gives me a great shave.  I shave in the shower with regular soap.  I&#x27;ve been using this now for 14 days and the blade is just now starting to need changed.  Really, really thin and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t figure out if I like the swivel head.  The problem is that I can&#x27;t figure out how much it contributes to the shave.  IN any event, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did drop the thing and the head popped off, but with a bit of work it went back together and remains to this day, my favorite razor ever.</li>
            <li> What can be said?  Every blade that Gillette has come out with is always amazing.  Since the Mach 3, meaning every blade after that generation, they have all been so good that little can be said about the differences between them.  Some blades stick with the 1 blade on top for edging system, some gave it up and left the 4-5 regular blades.  They all have close shaves, especially with repeated swipes, very much including this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m being very honest and fair in this review, much like all of my reviews.  This blade is another in a list of blades that do the job very well.  The balled head that slightly turns the blade, I can&#x27;t attest that it does anything of merit.  All the blades are sharp and clean, and have not cut me yet.  Only thing left to test is its longevity.  I only shave 1-2 times a week, and some of my blades I use well over a year as I&#x27;m just that cheap!  But as long as I don&#x27;t see blood, I keep using it &#x3D;-).  Again, this blade works just as well as all of the rest of the blades that are &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; since Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you in your decision to purchase this product, or against it.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Delighted with my purchase.  The Gillette razor arrived as described by the Seller and it arrived ahead of schedule.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Great razor for men or women. Works great for shaving my legs, doesn&#x27;t razor burn like chintzy razors. Definitely, a great deal.</li>
            <li> This new razor has 5 blades. It&#x27;s very sturdy with nice weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor shaves very close when in a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the razor is that the shave head is so large (5 blades and the comfort strip) that&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s hard to get it into tight corners. Nevermind the &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; which doesn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting under the chin and angle of the jaw is difficult just due to the size of the blade area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, nice idea and pretty design but not any better than other razors on the market.</li>
            <li> Gillette has put a lot of marketing power into this new &#x27;Flexball&#x27; razor - from endless ads to even sending me this sample to review. I&#x27;ve been using the older Fusion blade for a long time now and have been happy with it, so naturally I was interested in any improvements. As it turns out, this upgrade is worth the buzz - but not just because of the &#x27;Flexball&#x27; business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball is nice, though. You can instantly feel a smoother, gliding cut that is even more effortless than the previous generation. I almost never cut myself with a Fusion, but I imagine now the likelihood is even less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The less advertised improvements are where the real beauty is. The precision trimmer is noticeable better at trimming hairs, including semi-long ones, and also washes clean easily. Previously it was common for hairs to get stuck in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are also allegedly improved, and I would have to agree. The cut seems closer and less irritating than the old fusion. I have extremely sensitive skin that often looks like a blotchy mess after a razor shave. I won&#x27;t say that problem is completely gone, but with this new fusion blade, I have to admit that the irritation is significantly less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Fans of Gillette Fusion will want to go ahead and get this upgrade. The improvements are subtle, but impressive. The replacement blades aren&#x27;t much more expensive either, so why not?</li>
            <li> Gillette is getting to desperate trying to sell more razors. Another pointless gimmick that is just fishing for sales. Who in their right mind will use this razor and try to shave sideways to make the ball pivot? I would honestly cut my face up! The front and aft tilt is more than enough for a good shave. Try to invent a razor that will not get dull within the first 2 uses! That would be something to invest in.</li>
            <li> This thing tugs the blazes out of my stubs. Hurts too much to shave with this monster (physically, not emotionally). I think I&#x27;ll let my wife use this on her legs.</li>
            <li> My son (16yrs) was thrilled to receive this Razor, so thrilled that I thought I should&#x27;ve kept it for myself. Ribbed handles are not common in women&#x27;s razors. The feature really helps when your soapy hand holds a razor in the shower. But he was so excited, talking about how the quality was supposed to be, so I decided I wouldn&#x27;t take it back LOL :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it he says it&#x27;s a really nice razor that doesn&#x27;t have the typical pull he feels with the cheaper razors. In general the razor met what he&#x27;d read in the advertisements and he felt it&#x27;s worth the price. It seems to be lasting longer than his other razors typically do. The single blade on the back of the razor head is somewhat hard to use and doesn&#x27;t really seem necessary. You might use it for more precise cutting. The mobile head allowing the razor to turn more laterally at different angles is nice, but again isn&#x27;t something that you absolutely have to have either. He also tried the &amp;#34;silvertouch&amp;#34; which seems the same with just a different color handle. (If I&#x27;d known they were the same, I would have surely kept one for mom&#x27;s shower!)&lt;br /&gt;~ Would definitely purchase this again when these wear out.</li>
            <li> I just want to say that I hate shaving.  Really, I try to shave as little as possible.  its partly laziness and its partly disappointment with the high cost of blades and the lack of quality shaves I get from those blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has given me one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  I recently took it traveling with me and I was even able to shave comfortably WITHOUT shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found the need to use the little ball swivel with my thumb (there is a place for it) but I do think that the ability to angle the head is helping to get a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used single &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; shaving blade on the top around my nose, didn&#x27;t get cut, and my shave looks really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  I really do.  I cut myself almost every time and end up with a lousy shave.  My wife insists that I shave - she hates beards, moustaches and scruff.  So, to make her happy, I shave.  (you know the saying, happy wife, happy life!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying different razors hoping to find one that worked well, but hadn&#x27;t found the \\&quot;right\\&quot; one yet.  I belong to BzzAgent and they sent me a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology razor to try.&lt;br /&gt;I have found the RIGHT razor for me!  The blades glide easily across the contours of my face, no nicks, no cuts!  For the first time ever, I don&#x27;t mind shaving!  I used to change blades every other day because it seemed that the other blades didn&#x27;t shave well unless I did.  I didn&#x27;t even realize it, but I used the razor for almost 2 weeks daily without a blade change.&lt;br /&gt;VERY happy with this razor - highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(husband of A. Peleskey, and a dad of 2, stepdad of 4 and grandpa of 4)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge advocate for using straight edge razors when shaving. I find that a shave with a straight razor is the closest I can get to a baby&#x27;s-bottom soft face without growing a new layer of skin. Why use 5 blades when just one will do the job better and faster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I was skeptical when first trying the new Proglide Flexball razor; which I received from Gillette for gratis. I wanted it to fail. I didn&#x27;t want to go back to spending more time cleaning the cartridge than I did shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this razor to fail so bad that I used it to shave off a three week old beard. I wanted to break it, even if it meant that I&#x27;d put my sensitive skin through hell just to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My three week old beard measured nearly a quarter inch at its longest, and the shortest hair would have been about 2-3 mm closer to where I would trim hairs to shape my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I acquainted myself with the razor. I was impressed by its build quality. It was heavy, nearly 2 oz without the cartridge. The rotating ball mechanism didn&#x27;t seem like it would break or fall apart after heavy use. The razor body just felt good in my hand. Easy to hold &amp; contoured well in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inspected the blade cartridge. I have never used a razor with more than three blades, the last being a Gilette Mach 3 Turbo, which I still own and use on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;At this point I was intrigued by the spacing between the front five blades-they seemed to be spaced apart further than the blades on my Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still skeptical that my long hairs would get stuck in the blade, I kept my straight razor ready so I could clean up my face when the Proglide razor failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied a healthy amount of Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Skin gel to my beard. I usually use this gel when shaving with my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;I let the gel sit on my face for roughly two to three minutes to soften my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After half of a swipe of the razor, it was ready to be rinsed to remove the long hairs from between the blades. This was the moment I was waiting for. This is where I would prove to myself that using a traditional razor is a time consuming process.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how the majority of the hairs fell right out of the cartridge without much of a fuss. I didn&#x27;t find myself having to glide my thumb over the blades in a downward motion to loosen hairs from between any of the blades. I was officially impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I began shaving closer to my jaw line with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor, I noticed the subtle movements of the rotating head as it followed the curves on my face. It took fewer swipes than razors I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I attribute that directly to the 5 blade system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the most impressive bit about this razor? I have a cleft chin, and with razors in the past, it has been a mission to clean up hairs in the cleft. This ProGlide razor somehow managed to get most of the hairs on my cleft chin; any missed hairs were cleaned up using the single razor &amp;#34;Precision Trimmer&amp;#34;, which is just as sharp as the five blades on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use my straight razor, I usually make a single pass against the grain (I know, some of you may think I have a death wish). I didn&#x27;t feel the need to do so with the Gillette Fusion Proglide. I got a clean shave with minimal razor burn, which honestly, could have been avoided if I had a shorter beard. The results were impressive, although I still believe a straight razor is much less time consuming and the shave is closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the razor a second time, three days after the initial shave. This time the shave went much smoother (no pun intended). I did shave against the grain and received a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;The Lubrastrip on the cartridge fell apart on this shave. This was expected since the first shave demanded much more effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I believe this is a solid product. It&#x27;s effective and precise.

            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide razor from Gillette this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised at the close shave I got from this razor. I have used gillette fusion power for a long time now. Even with a brand new razor I don&#x27;t get the same ease of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball didn&#x27;t add anything for me in my shaving experience but again very impressed with the blades, the most important part.</li>
            <li> Through highschool and into college I rocked electric razors until finally someone brought me a Mach 3.  Loved it, never went back!  Since then I&#x27;ve graduated through the Gillette line.  Then the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; technology came out, added a batter, and vibrated the razor and I thought it doesn&#x27;t get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball handle technology.  First, let&#x27;s talk the unboxing.  Right when I picked up this razor, I loved the feel of it ... the weight ... the grip.  It&#x27;s like holding the weight of a quality pen, where you feel proud to display it as your write.  It&#x27;s like when you&#x27;re checking out quality watches and you can&#x27;t wait to get that perfectly balanced watch on your wrist.  And the look of the razor deliverd on that front, with a darker gun-metal style finish.  From looks alone I was glad to give up the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I thought I would be giving ground was in the shave.  No more vibrating razor? Had me worried.  However, the upgraded blades were amazing, and I made sure to bounce back and forth between new blades of the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor.  I wasn&#x27;t missing the vibration as much as I thought I would.  The shave was incredibly close, and somehow my old razor just felt to be of less quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe my shave has improved from my last razor. I have thick stubble around my chin mainly, and the grain of the hair on the right of my neck goes up, leading to constant razor burn.  Haven&#x27;t had it with the new razor.  And again, the weight and look of the new razor is so amazing that I&#x27;m more than willing to let go of my old one, it&#x27;s not the work of art this one is.</li>
            <li> When did razors get to be like spaceships at NASA with all this advanced stuff?  I suppose when there is competition everyone has to outdo the competitors.  Having said that....flexball handle...ok it works.  It&#x27;s not life changing but it does work.  And this razor did give me a close shave.  Ok...disclaimer here....I&#x27;m a woman who prefers men&#x27;s razors to womens.  Why?  I want it to work....it doesn&#x27;t have to LOOK pretty...and it&#x27;s been my personal finding that men&#x27;s razors work on my leg&#x27;s better than womens.  C&#x27;mon there&#x27;s a lot of women out there who steal or &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; their men&#x27;s razor&#x27;s to get a closer shave.  I stopped stealing his and just started buying them for myself too.  This one made my leg&#x27;s baby smooth....so WIN!  It also didn&#x27;t knick my ankles or anywhere behind my knees...hey this is a hard spot to shave and with a razor that&#x27;s not a smooth shave....yes knick city there.  Not with this one.  Those cheap throwaways....they&#x27;re just not as nice as a reusable one.</li>
            <li> I started shaving using my father’s razor, an old-fashioned one blade model that was easy to load (just spin the handle and the top opened up) and easy to clean. Modern razors are more expensive and so are the blades, but freeing the blade of whiskers is difficult and sometimes impossible. Tap it against the sink’s basin and the cartridge usually falls off. Replacing the blade is not as simple as it should be either. Then there’s the question of performance? Do they provide the smoother and closer shave that they promise?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide, which I received without charge through the Amazon Vine Program, promises much (“Responds to contours for our best shave,” “Less tug and pull for incredible comfort”). On the limited evidence provided by one shave, it pretty much delivers. It was a painless shave with no sting caused by a hair being pulled but not cut by the blade, and it left my face feeling clean and smooth. I didn’t have much of a beard to shave, only some stubble, so there were few whiskers to rinse off when I was done, but I wonder how cleaning will go after repeated use when the hairs start to build and clog the blade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I prefer the old-fashioned razor that I shaved with when my beard was little more than peach fuzz. A straight-edged razor would also be preferable, I think, but I still give the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor high marks, at least for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks</li>
            <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and this is their best so far. It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. My only criticism with this razor is it is difficult to clean when soap scum builds up. There are a lot of nooks and crannies that are hard to get to. Overall, this is a superior razor and a great value. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Schick Hydro 5 for the past couple of years and thought that it was the best shave out there.  I recently started trying a Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall and found out I was wrong.  Now, I&#x27;ve never tried a ProGlide razor previously so I&#x27;m not sure if the differences are in the blades or in the new FlexBall head.  However, from the first stroke, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  Do you remember being a young kid and &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; alongside your dad using a spoon?  That&#x27;s the only thing I can compare this to.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to some sensation of tugging and pulling on my skin when I shave.  No such thing exists with this razor.  The shave is smooth to the point where I was in disbelief that hair was being removed from my face until I looked in the mirror.  My skin is smooth in one stroke.  It&#x27;s cut (harhar) my shaving time by almost 50%.  Not to mention, I effortlessly can go against the grain so it&#x27;s really smooth.  I haven&#x27;t cut myself once, even with a couple of birthmarks and other &amp;#34;tough spots&amp;#34; on my neck and face.  It&#x27;s like mowing a lawn -- one pass and you&#x27;re all set.  The inclusion of a single-blade on the back of the blade makes trimming sideburn edges and tight spaces easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking off one star because I don&#x27;t have the option to rate it 4.5/5.  There are a few minor gripes I have.  First, the handle is a bit too light for my taste.  I&#x27;d like a slightly heavier feel, perhaps with a bit more metal than plastic.  Also, the blade seems to wear out a bit faster than some others.  I can usually get about 3 months of shaving from a single Hydro 5 cartridge.  However, I feel like this blade is starting to wear out a bit after a couple of weeks so I don&#x27;t anticipate it lasting more than 1.5-2 months. This might be because the blade doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;flip the lubrication stip&amp;#34; back feature of the Hydro 5 which would make for easy cleaning/drying of the razor, the key to longevity.  These blades are also a bit more expensive than the Schick counterpart.  However, if money is no object, this is easily the fastest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> fusion proglide gets better and better.  same smooth results but more comfort because of the flex ball.  it moves to the contour of your face and is very comfortable shaving.</li>
            <li> When I first recieved the blade, I honestly thought is was just going to be a regular old blade and is going to suck. But my opinion changed drastically as soon as I started using it! After shaving I could see that I had gotten the cleanest and smoothest shave I have ever seen due its flex ball adapting to the contours of my face. I did not even hurt myself. Gillette has outdone themselves.This is a great product and has a very premium build.</li>
            <li> Very please with the smoothness of this razor... The replacement blades are expensive but, Worth it. I am also surprised how long the blades last.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach III blades for years.  I will only be using Fusion Blades from now on.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball is an extraordinarily smooth razor.  This is the smoothest razor I have ever used, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball head rotates perfectly and smoothly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a bit on the heavy size, but that is actually a benefit as it seems to impart a little more control.  It makes it only a little less desirable as a travel razor if you are trying to save weight.  I imagine that Gillete will make lighter, disposable versions using the Fusion blade which can serve that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend without reservation.</li>
            <li> I think that this is the best razor that I have ever tried. I bleed super easy and even after using this four times no blood. I would recommend this to everyone. She stole it from me and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor to try by being a Bzzagent.  I was pretty pumped about trying the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with the flexball handle.  I have used other Gillette razors in the past and have had pretty good success with them.  I typically have trouble getting a close smooth around my chin.  I have tried various electric razors and several manual razors.  I have had better results getting a smooth shave using the manual razors rather than the electic razors.  Even when using the manual razor, it would still take several strokes to get all of the hair for a smooth shave.  I was hoping that the new flexball razor would help get me a smoother shave quicker than the other razors.  The flexball razor seemed to hug my face as I used it.  The razor moved with the contour of my face.  It glided across my face and did not tug or pull my hair.  It did take a few strokes to get a completely smooth shave around my chin but it was about half of the strokes I take with other manual razors.  Overall I was pleased with the shave that I got with this razor.  I did not see anything overly spectacular about it versus other Gillette razors.  I was getting the same shave with the flexball razor that I do with other razors with the only difference being that it took less strokes to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette is GILLETTE what more can you say about a product you&#x27;ve been using your entire adult life.In my case 84 years.Gives you the best shaves.</li>
            <li> Very good shave, very close, no irritation. No need for multiple passes.</li>
            <li> My Gillette Razor showed up in the mail today, I work as a Salesman and we have to be clean shaven since I had to work in the morning i thought i&#x27;d try it out. Out of the box i was impressed the razor handle is well built made of metal with rubber grips it feels great in your hand. The razor has 5 blades which give a much closer shave than the 3 blade razor i&#x27;m used to. I was comfortable shaving with it as the ball head turns to prevent cutting yourself. This razor could be a replacement for allllllll my other razors which i have been using for as long as i can remember.</li>
            <li> This razor is really great; better than most razors I have used. The shave is very close. My face is not a bit rough at all after shaving. Shaving with this razor was easy and comfortable. No irritation either. I even shaved \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;, which is something I cannot do with other razors I have tried. If you don&#x27;t know or ever use the ProGlide from Gillette, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing, it can be a real problem solver when it comes to shaving. If wasn&#x27;t for Gillete Fusion doing this promotion, I wouldn&#x27;t of been able to see how great their product really is.</li>
            <li> One of the best shaves of my life!  The FlexBall glides effortlessly across my face and neck without concerns of nicks or cuts.  The razor has a good weight and the comfortable handle stays secure even when wet.  Replacement blades are a bit pricey, but well worth the cost for a repeatably close shave every time!  A great razor that will not fail to deliver you a close and comfortable shave every time!    As an FYI, I received the product to demo from BzzAgent - check &#x27;em out!</li>
            <li> I got to try this shaver free thanks to gillette and in my opinion its the best shaver i used it glides smoothly across my skin and dont sutter on my beard like other shavers do and that little convenient blade on the back of the shaver makes it easy to get the hairs under my nose</li>
            <li> I have tried almost all of the models Gillette have on the market and I am willing to bet that this is THE best razor on the market of any brand. I shaved with a 6 day stubble face the other day and I didnt have any razor burns nor did it pull on the hairs when I shaved. It took 2-3 passes to get a shave that was smooth which I was amazed about, the new razor head along with the flexball technology is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to get a free sample from Gilette via BZZAGENT and if it wasnt because I already use Gillette&#x27;s brand I would throw ANY razor out the window and use this one 5&amp;#34;stars and thats only because I cant give more.</li>
            <li> Love this razor really worth the money. It does not leave my face irritated or cut me up.</li>
            <li> Gillette rebuilt shaving with the launch of the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology, and now it&#x27;s taken the best shave one step further by rebuilding the shave gel. The new Fusion ProGlide Sensitive 2-in-1 Shave Gel Plus Skin Care creates a shave experience with no mess, no rust and no guessing! So fast and reliable perfect for the novice or the pro. *product was provided via Bzzagent for review purposes #GotItFree*</li>
            <li> This was an alright shave. I definitely feel irritation but that is to be expected from a cartridge razor. I have a decent amount of irritation when using this product so I can&#x27;t use it all the time but it actually gets pretty close. I like my safety razors more just because they get much closer and are cheaper, but these are satisfactory. I may get this again for traveling, but that&#x27;s about it. I would use them over disposable bic razors that you find in bulk packs for sure. I&#x27;d like to mention that the razor was given to me free by an ad marketing campaign (bzzagent.com).</li>
            <li> Received this razor as a promotion to review it from Gilette. Gave an awesome shave. It&#x27;s pretty similar to my hydro5 but I must say that this is a better product.</li>
            <li> I have seriously tried just about every razor that you can buy. Finally, I have found one that I can live with!! Lets face it, we all hate shaving! I&#x27;m not going to lie and say that this razor makes me look forward to shaving every day, but I will tell you that it leaves my face smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation! Ever since I started shaving I&#x27;ve always had issues with razor burn due to my sensitive skin. After a week of using this razor, I have no sign of razor burn anywhere on my face or neck! It&#x27;s a little bit more expensive than some of the competition, but it&#x27;s a price I&#x27;ll gladly pay to avoid the discomfort that I&#x27;ve experienced from every other razor on the market. I originally tired this razor as part of a trial campaign from Gillette through Bzzagent, but I will definitely be using this razor from now on!</li>
            <li> I try to avoid shaving if I can, but sometimes you just gotta do it.  The Flex Ball is a nice addition to the razor.  I had been using the one without the Flex Ball, until Gillette sent me this one for free to try out.  Definitely a worthy upgrade over other models.  If you are in need of a go-to razor, this is a good bet.</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome!  Gillette sent me one to try and I am so glad they did.  The Flexball technology is pivotal in getting a better shave(pun intended).  The blades rotate with the contours of the face.  With other razors I have to go other some places multiple times to get all the whiskers.  With the Fusion ProGlide with Flexball technology, I usually on need one or two strokes.  The shave is easy and effortless.  The head is shared with other Gillette razors so no need for buying new heads if you already are a Gillette Fusion user.</li>
            <li> A close shave is what you get when you use this Gillette razor.  Make sure to get the shave gel as well for that close shave and the new close top gels makes me happy because it stops the loss of gel even after I am done using it.  Keep it up Gillette!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  I got this product to evaluate through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a long-time cartridge razor user up until the last calendar year, I dealt with irritated skin, shaves that weren&#x27;t very close, and the cost of cartridge refills.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I was enlightened by switching to double edge safety razors and my eyes were opened to how pleasurable, smooth, relaxing, and comfortable a good shave can be.  I swore off cartridge razors forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, the ProGlide showed up at my door.  It gives a very comfortable shave.  It isn&#x27;t terribly efficient since you need to rinse the blade(s) often to prevent them from clogging with hair and shaving gel, but the blades are sharp and seem to hold edge well for at least a couple shaves.  I have yet to test them further, as shaving with the ProGlide is not as exciting as the great shaves that one can get with double edge safety razors.  Sure, we understand Gillette wants to make money with cartridge sales, but they used to make stellar safety razors that are treasured in families and last a lifetime.  Anyway, the ProGlide does pivot and rotate well to flow over your skin, so it has that going for it.  It is fairly quick to shave with, so if you are in a hurry, it can be a solid choice to get a decent-enough shave to last you a business day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the ProGlide works per what it is supposed to do, and if you are a cartridge razor user, it is definitely worth giving a shot.  For me, it is ok and can fill a slot in my razor arsenal for a quick, mild shave, but it simply doesn&#x27;t compare to a good safety razor.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible shave - I hesitate to say that because I do NOT want the price to go up. I was amazed at the shave I got and that just shows you how great this razor is. I take free samples - LOVE THIS Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technology.  It is awesome at hugging my face and not tugging.  I received this shaver as a freebie and it is awesome.</li>
            <li> I think this razor is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Way better than my old MACH 3. It&#x27;s going in my travel bag for sure. I got this a promotional item for BZZAgent and I&#x27;m pretty much sold on this item. I&#x27;m always leery of switching razors in general because I know my old ones work. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this razor in the store because I&#x27;m THAT much of a stickler. If you are on the fence or are willing to try out a new razor definitely give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I used this product with great results. The shave was smooth, not after burn or rashes. It also leaves a cool feeling on your skin after use. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This razor works great and makes it easy to complete a quick, hassle-free, close shave</li>
            <li> Ok so yet another Razor to spend your hard on money on right? WRONG, I will admit I am a sucker to try a new razor however this is by far the best Razor on the market right now. The Flexball really is a game changer in terms of shaving closeness and I plan on sticking with the product for the immediate future. Great job Gillette!    P.S. I&#x27;m also trying the product for free thanks to Gillette which is very cool</li>
            <li> I have previously owned this new line of Gillette razors, and all I can say is that they are fantastic. Sure, they won&#x27;t give you the same shave as a safety razor or straight razor, but this is the next best thing. Gillette, I can safely say, offers the best blades, offering little to non existent tugging and pulling you would experience from cheap, disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I have never been happier with a razor than this.  I received a trial kit from Gillette to try and review and I was really surprised about how different and great this razor is.  It cuts my shaving time about in half because it takes so many fewer &amp;#34;swipes&amp;#34; to get my whole face done.  My face feels alot smoother than normal too since when the blade contours it literally doesnt miss hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide after Gillette sent me a free one to try and I will say I was pleasantly surprised! The results were instantaneous. It was like I wasn&#x27;t even shaving! The razor gently and effortlessly removed tough facial hair leaving my face perfectly smooth and without razor burn. I&#x27;ve never had a shave with my old razors that left my face this virtually irritation free! The pivoting head makes sure just the right amount of pressure is applied and the weight of the handle allows for the razor to do the work for you. I will recommend this razor to absolutely anyone looking for a nice shave! I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is my second time reviewing the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor this time it&#x27;s the trial pack. I received it from BzzAgent with the awesome Ocean Breeze Shave Gel! The razor runs smoothly against the skin and cut hair finely and precisely. I love how it can easily get around the curves of my face and can&#x27;t wait to keep using it. I love that in the trial pack you get a coupon for refills it helps keep the cost down on such a great product.</li>
            <li> Never have i used a razor that left my skin soft and refreshed. No razor bumps not sand paper feeling skin, just plain softness. I love it. I am enjoying it for free Thanks for Gillette.</li>
            <li> Received this from bzzagent to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- Heavy, in my eyes this is a pro, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap it is solid. Nice piece of equipment&lt;br /&gt;Close shave, with no razor burn. I used the sensitive skin gel from Gillette that came with, which I feel helped. shaved dry and didn&#x27;t have any burn as well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change blades. pop the button, push in replacement. so easy.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog to bad. Ive used other 3-4 blades the you have to smack out every swipe. this cleaned out so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;Can be used really well for body hair as well. Go ahead ladies try it out!!! I know this because I had to shave my chest (very hairy chest) for a tattoo I was getting. this cleaned me up to baby butt smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- the swivel...don&#x27;t get me wrong the swivel works great, however if you have a chubby face such as myself...it really doesn&#x27;t help nor hinder. If you have a more chizzled face this would work really well. I only state this as a con since I wouldn&#x27;t buy based soley on the swivel since it did not benefit me. See the pros for why I will continue using (bought my replacements)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So chizzled or not I recommend this razor. close comfortable shave for all!!!</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and have never really liked shaving very much.  That&#x27;s probably why I wear a beard most of the time.  However, when I received a free Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology and a can of their Active Sport Shave Gel, I decided to give it a try.  The gel made the shave very smooth so it didn&#x27;t bother my skin very much and the Flexball razor really did get around all the angles without nicks and cuts.  I&#x27;d recommend these products to anyone that doesn&#x27;t like to shave.  I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because the scent of the gel was a little overpowering to me, but my sense of smell is pretty sensitive so it may not be bad for others.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying I am a BzzAgent and I received this razor through a promotion.  But I have to say I&#x27;m sold.  I shave everyday and what I&#x27;m looking for is a close fast shave.  And I mean close, up to this point I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor.  I thought no disposable could match it but this razor is amazing!  I shave in half the time with no irritation.  What more can a man ask for.</li>
            <li> I raved about this razor.  It feels very smooth and doesn&#x27;t catch on my thick hair when I first start shaving which most other razors do.  I like how soft my skin feels immediately after shaving (that&#x27;s most likely the feel from the shaving cream), but I may have to take back some of what I said about this razor.  It shaves very smoothly, but not very close.  I have stubble much faster afterwards, and it leaves my skin bumpy and kind of rough afterwards, I can see some of the hairs just at the level of skin if I look close.  I&#x27;ve also had ingrown hair trouble much more since I&#x27;ve started using this razor.  It may feel really good while I&#x27;m using it...sharp blades maybe?, but it leaves behind more trouble than it feels worth it.  Maybe the blades aren&#x27;t at the right angle? I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s just not as close a shave as I&#x27;d like and am used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  :)</li>
            <li> I have suffered from Pseudofolliculitis barbae (aka, severe razor bumps) for the past 15 years.  After years of trying different shaving methods, I finally determined I can keep it under control by only shaving once every couple days.  As a tax CPA in public practice, this can be an issue if I appear disheveled when meeting with clients.  A couple years back I started using a Schick Hydro and found it gave me a very close shave.  I liked that you can flip up the top portion to use the top blade as a straight-edge, but have found the moisturizing strip to not work as well as it did several years back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of a promotion sponsored by Gillette, I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Technology for the past week.  I was tentative to try something new, but wanted to give it a fair shake.  I can honestly say I like the Gillette Fusion even better than the Hydro.  Though I thought I would miss the Hydro, I find the thinner blades of the Fusions shave with less friction (see blade size comparison in picture).  I can go a couple days without shaving, and though I of course have stubble, I do not look visibly unshaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care has also been enjoyable to use.  I shave in the shower and I appreciate that the nozzle stays clean and the canister doesn&#x27;t rust.  The gel itself also has a slight cooling feel that I like.  All in all, I’m very happy I was introduced to the Gillette Fusion Proglide shaving system and plan to use it into the future.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me this and their 2in1 Shave Gel to try out for free. I loved the weight and feel of the razor. It felt comfortable and easy to use. The shave gel honestly was the highlight for me. It provided great foam and a soothing tingle to make the experience great. In terms of the razor, it was average. It performed as expected it conformed to the contours of my face but my face is not that contoured so that was not a hard feat. With my thick unmanageable beard it still left me cut up. Others who have a much friendlier set of facial hair will find this product enjoyable. I must also say that it left me extremely smooth and gave me one of the closest shaves I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> As usual, a new razor has a new technological advance that is promoted as the best thing since sliced bread.  And, as usual, the price continues to go up.  The price of the cartridges are very high and, in my opinion, not worth the extra cost.  I have always used Gillette manual razors and have never found a new model to be any better than the old ones..... they just cost more for the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, if you have problems with your shave - closeness, sensitive skin, etc.  this might be the razor for you.  It does provide a good shave and seems to be as advertised.  And Gillette continues to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to try out thanks to Gillette. I have been using similar razors to this for years, but none of them compare.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide gives me the closest shave I have ever had.  I also haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts for the few weeks I have been using it.  I had my doubts about the razor being any better than the other manual razors on the market, but I will never be going back after using this product. The shave is close, safe, and lasts longer than any other product on the market.  If your looking for a close shave without any blood this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I have a preference for Schick. I was a long-term Gillette user before my wife bought a Schick razor on a whim and I have never looked back. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with FlexBall technology provides a decent shave, feels hefty in my hand, and is offered at a comparable price point, but I&#x27;m not sure about the FlexBall technology. Seems beneficial in theory, but I&#x27;ve been using a razor without it for months now and feel like I get a closer shave with that and never experience nicks/cuts. Thanks to Gillette for the opportunity to try this product for free as a member of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> The shave you&#x27;ll get from this razor is second to none. The multiple blades will get you an extremely close shave without the razor rash of some other razors. You&#x27;ll get the closeness with less shave strokes and less drag on your face. The Flexball Technology didn&#x27;t do much for me but the shave I got still makes it worth it for me. Thanks to Gillette for sending me this razor to try for free!</li>
            <li> I had received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Technology as a product trial through BzzAgent and I am highly impressed and satisfied with the results. This razor contours to my face reaching areas under my neck that other razors have missed in the past. It also leaves me without razor burn or nicks and cuts which is a great relief.  I would recommend this razor to anyone as it is worth the price as one blade usually lasts 2 weeks if you shave every 2 days.</li>
            <li> I received this in a kit from BzzAgent for free so that I could review it and spread the word on the product&#x27;s qualities.  Im happy to say that love this razor.  I have been free of sensitivity and razor burn since I started using this razor.  The Fusion ProGlide Power with the new FlexBall Handle allowed me to get all of the awkward places I&#x27;ve had trouble with in the past like my neck. I will definitely be purchasing this razor again and will proudly recommend it to all of my friends.  Now, if I can keep this away from my wife I will be good!</li>
            <li> Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is a good razor . I received a frre sample from www.bzzagent.com which was an excellent opportunity to try it. YI used it many times before it dulled. will recommend buying and will buy in the near future</li>
            <li> I tried this new razor free from Gillette. It is by far the best shave money can buy. No question. Expensive but a great shave. I would opt for the power version of the razor heads (I do not use a power handle) because I swear I get a better shave from the micro-comb the power heads have.</li>
            <li> So happy with this product! Great shave and amazing scent! It is the best shave I have had in years! I will never use another product!! Got this as part of a deal from BzzAgent!!</li>
            <li> I received this free from Gillette as part of a promotion.  I like the razor as it does actually conform to my face.  It provides a nice smooth shave.  The shaving gel seems a little bit thick and is harder to rinse off the blades than other shaving creams I have used.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not really a fan of 5-blade razors, however the flex ball really does the job well. Only downside is how expensive refill cartridges are. Glad I got it from Bzzagent for free.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing- you have to shave (unless you&#x27;re a rugged outdoorsie-type).  You can go manual or electric, and you know that you&#x27;ll never get as close of a shave with an electric as you would with a manual, right?  So now you&#x27;re left with what brand of manual to get...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll make it easy for you- in the year 2030, short of having a razor shave you automatically, this will still be a gold-standard for manual razors.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts, including battery-powered, and this gives you as close, comfortable shave as any other.  I received this as a free promotion from Gillette, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels as if the razors are hugging your face, but without any hint of tugging/friction.  It&#x27;s comfortable, and it FEELS close- you only need one pass with the grain, and one against, and you&#x27;ll feel confident that you got it all.  You WON&#x27;T experience razor burn (and I&#x27;ve yet to get a cut).  Does the flex-ball work?  Well, it doesn&#x27;t NOT work, and by that I mean that it subtly pivots when needed, but you won&#x27;t really notice it.  By itself it doesn&#x27;t a LOT, but it does add just enough to the experience to give you a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a jam, I&#x27;ll use an electric razor.  But for everything else, this is my new go-to razor.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received the Proglide Razor with a can of shave gel for free to try from Gillette.  I found that the razor provides one of the closest shaves I have ever gotten from a disposable blade.  The ball technology helps the blade move across the contours of your face with a more even stroke that seems to get just about every hair.  I have seen people complaining about the price, but you can get the razor refills in bulk quantities which makes it fairly cost effective.</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome, and it is the next step in razor technology.  I really like the FlexBall that&#x27;s been added; it makes it easier to give your entire face a close shave.  I&#x27;ve got those places on my face and neck that are hard to get a close shave for, and I usually have to go over and over those places just to get a good shave.  Then I end up with razor burn.  If you&#x27;re like me, this razor may help.  Full Disclosure: I received this razor free from Gillette to product-test.</li>
            <li> I received both the Gilette Fusion Proglide Razor and the 2-in-1 Gel courtesy of Gilette. The results of the Fusion ProGlide razor with 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care (Active Sport to be precise) really surprised me. I made sure I had worked up a good shaggy mess of stubble and hair, a good week&#x27;s worth. After smoothing on the gel and letting it sit for about two minutes, I stared to work with the ProGlide razor. Most of the hair was gone in one stroke, only a few times did I have to go over an area again and that was mostly my neck area. The blades cut very close and the 2-in-1 Gel which is marked for sensitive skin, made it very comfortable, so comfortable in fact that I didn&#x27;t even have to moisturize my face afterwards. Definitely the best disposable shave I have had in a long time. If I had any gripe at all, it&#x27;s that the replacement blades cost a mint.  Otherwise, good job Gilette!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great new razor from Gillette. I have to shave everyday so I need a razor that works well and quickly gets the job done.  The rollerball technology on this razor makes shaving so much easier!  It contours to the natural curves in my face and is truly a pleasure to use.  I am trying the product for free thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li> I received a Gillete Fusion Proglide Razor to try out for free thanks to Gillette, for many years I have used electric razors and have been looking to maybe switch back to manuel razor.  I have to say I am very happy I tried Gillete Fusion Proglide razor, I got a clean close shave with no bleeding or nics.  Even when I let my hair grow a bit, the ease of the Gillette Fusion was still smooth and seemless. I have to say I am very happy and have found myself a new razor, definitely check it out you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received this a a free promo from Gillette! I&#x27;m happy I did! Great razor, the roller ball is amazing! Holds every curve of my face! I will definitely stick with this razor! I love how you only have to change the cartridge once a month! I think the shave gel is great also! The can doesn&#x27;t rust! I&#x27;m amazed. Face feels smooth as silk after! I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> Gillette was kind enough to send me this as a promotion. The razor is just as good as the mach 3 though I do miss the vibrate mode wich made it a little smoother. As for the new gel that came with it, it really doesn&#x27;t have the problem of slowly leaking out after you&#x27;re done, and the plastic bottoms stops that annoying rust ring on your counter. Also the top of the gel locks. The razor is a good shave but not really any better but definitely not worse than the older one, so a good buy if you need a new razor, and the shaving gel is great from container to scent and providing a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> After using this razor, I can honestly say I would not use any other.&lt;br /&gt;This razor makes quick work of facial hair, and floats seamlessly across my face as I shave, leaving a very close and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is solidly built too, it is not some cheap plastic, but rather, this handle is bound to last many years.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the cost, for all that it does, this blade is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> I got to try out this product for free thanks to Gillette. This is a great razor for every where! My best example/testimonial is this. I was getting a tattoo on my leg and as anyone with tats knows you have to be shaven. Well many artists use their own razor. I brought this one for my artist to use and he thought it was incredible. Super east to glide around awkward curves. He now has this razor with his tattooing tools!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide  Flexball razor in the mail from Gillette and wow, it really was a fantastic shave. I can tell you that this razor is worth changing out from the original Fusion Proglide! It really does provide a very smooth shave, remaining in constant contact with the skin over subtle curves and provides a great shave. I have sensitive skin as well and did not have any problems with cuts or razor burn afterwards. I would highly recommend trying this product at least once so you can see for yourself!</li>
            <li> For the finest of all shaves and for the smoothest cut out there you have to try this razor it is heads and shoulders above the rest</li>
            <li> I keep thinking I&#x27;m going to step up from the stick razors to the electric razors, and I&#x27;ve spent several hundred on the electrics, but I just keep coming back to the sticks. Gillette sent this one to me, and it was a definite upgrade over the Mach 3 I&#x27;ve been using. I&#x27;ve gotten &#x27;burned&#x27; (no pun intended) buying the 5-blade razors before so I was skeptical I&#x27;d like this one, but I&#x27;d put it in my Top 2 or 3. Compared to the stick I&#x27;ve been using, it was a smooth, painless shave, and I am now ending up with little or no cuts--a step better than what I typically experience. Overall, I give it 4 stars--not *THE* best, but in the conversation.</li>
            <li> I have to shave every day of the week, sometimes on the weekends. It is hard on my skin, tends to dry me out and occasionaly casuses razor burn. The razor is smooth, gets every area, even great on the chin, part of my neck and around my mouth. There is no pulling or rough sensation. I&#x27;m a fan of this cream, I like that there is no mess, the bottle can&#x27;t rust (which is always gross with other bottles), the guage to tell you what is left is very helpful.</li>
            <li> With my very sensitive skin i was a bit hesitant on using the Fusion ProGlide razor. First i felt that the Flexball was kind of pointless feature, I didn&#x27;t feel that it moved very much while shaving. The razor left sever razor burn on my neck and chin that made it painful to shave for the next three days. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> My husband was excited when I showed him what came from Bzzagent. The razor has a cool design and a nice handle for gripping and control. He says he tried it for the first time after 2 days without shaving. There was a little pull still but he thinks it&#x27;s because his hair was so long on his face. He tried it again for week, every day before work. He loves the way it feels using it and I love the way his face feels after.</li>
            <li> I got this and shaving gel free from Gillette to test and I love the results so far.</li>
            <li> I got this razor free from Gillette in order to sample and try it, and to write this review for them. I am glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a long winter and growing a full beard throughout, I was not looking forward to my first shave of the spring. But having the Fusion ProGlide with the Flexball Technology, that shave was done with comfort and ease. And isn&#x27;t that what you want from a razor?  The way that the razor conformed to my face made this one of the most comfortable shaves ever, not to mention each subsequent shave.</li>
            <li> Just when you think they can&#x27;t keep improving manual razors, Gillette somehow did it.  Here&#x27;s what I found most impressive about the razor: it handled my cleft chin with ease.  Not an easy task.  This razor gave me a smooth shave and navigated the contours of my face without difficulty.  I received the razor free from Bzzagent, so I can&#x27;t speak to the value of the razor.  True test will be the longevity of the blades and the cost of refills.  All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with the performance of the cutting-edge (pun intended) product.</li>
            <li> after trying the new flexball technology on the fusion proglide razor I am very impressed with the smooth close shave from the first use of this product.  I was worried at first how this is would work but im glad I tried it.  #gotitfree #buzzagent</li>
            <li> Great Shave every time with Gillette Fusion Proglide. I have tried tons of razors and spent some serious money on the expensive models so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be impressed with the Proglide or not. I received the shave gel and razor as a sample from Gillette and I will be a Proglide customer from now on. The shave is great and as close as I have ever got. The flexibility of the razor and 5 blades really gets the job done right!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave all that often but when I do the skin on my neck is pretty sensitive. I recently received a Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology along with the shave gel to test for free from Gillette through Bzzagent. I&#x27;ve seen the commercials and was pretty skeptical about the claims that they made thinking that it would just be the same as any other razor. However, after actually trying it there is a noticeable difference in how the razor conforms to your face. It does glide very smooth and did not irritate my skin. The razor itself is pretty much just like any other mulit-blade razor on the market but like I said the difference is in the Flexball for sure. So if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re concerned about or haven&#x27;t mastered with other razors then this is definitely for you</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a free promotion from Gillette, but I must say its one of the better manual razors that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve also used this razor with two different shaving gels, one was a basic on I had from the store and another that was the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care that came with the promo. When I used the original shaving cream the results were fine, but nothing I hadn&#x27;t received from other manual razors in the past. The ball does help a little in molding to my face, but if I let my beard grow out more than usual it would still pull and hurt a little when shaving it off. With the Gillette shave gel + skin care, the experience became a lot better. Now, this sounds like straight out of a paid advertisement where I&#x27;m pushing Gillette products, but I&#x27;m usually an automatic razor guy and don&#x27;t use manuals that much, but the combo of the razor and gel did make a big difference in getting a quick, painless and close shave. I&#x27;d say the gel is actually what made the difference, I&#x27;d say buy that. The razor is fine, does its job but isn&#x27;t astounding by itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for years and have tried out many different cartridge style razors that they offer. I received a sample razor from Gillette and figured I&#x27;d put it to the test right away. As soon as I used the Fusion ProGlide, I was impressed. It&#x27;s by far the smoothest, easiest, and quickest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m sold on using this product! I&#x27;ve been using it, actually as a body razor, for over a month now and the single cartridge is still going strong - I use it once a week. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying replacement cartridges for this style razor. Other key features are how comfortable the handle fits in the hand, even for various hand positions - I use this as a body razor and have no problem getting a good hold on it. The flexing head also contours very nicely around the face and chin area.</li>
            <li> I received the Proglide as part of a BzzAgent promotion. Normally I hate to shave because it causes to many nicks and small cuts. My face is often irritated throughout the day and there always seems to be leftover stubble. The Proglide seemed to be much smoother. It hugged my face and stayed in contact more closely. I&#x27;ve had far less stubble than usual and it seemed like I shaved a little less than usual.</li>
            <li> Received this as a trial from Gillette, so far I have only good things about this product. It makes it easier to shave, faster, and smooth. I would recommend this shaver especially for people who do designs or any type of artistic stuff with their facial hair. The Flexball makes it very easy to maneuver for smooth curves for any design. This razor allows me to shave a lot quicker since i am able to move smoothly around edges. Its basically a more comfortable, efficient and smooth shave. My trial box came with the 2 in 1 shave gel also that smells great and leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I received the product complimentary to try from Gillette.I am so happy with the result.I have a clean smooth shave like never before.The flexball technology makes it easy to shave the curvy and difficult to reach spots on face.I will never go back to my old razor.</li>
            <li> Shaving is a HUGE improvement with Gillette Fusion Proglide. Ever tried shaving while doing all sorts of funny stuff just to get the shave you want, you know, using all your facial muscles so your face will conform to the shaver&#x27;s blade? Well, I tried this shaver while trying hard NOT to flex any facial muscle, and guess what? I got the shave I wanted! Like I said, HUGE improvement in shaving experience! And there&#x27;s even a &amp;#34;subscription plan&amp;#34; that delivers blade refills right to your doorstep (via &amp;#34;dollarshaveclub.com&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* received free trial package that includes shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor is a quality razor and gives a nice clean shave. The first thing I noticed when using the razor was the weight and feel of the handle. The handle is sturdy and has rubber grooves that prevent the razor from slipping out of your hand when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by how the razor was able to shave my beard with minimal tugging and afterwards, I felt no irritation on my face. If I was using my old razor, I would have to shave over the same area multiple times to get a clean shave. With the Fusion Proglide, the area would be clean with one to two passes of the razor. My neck area did need multiple passes, however. I suspect this is due to the larger size of the razor cartridge. Despite this small setback, I didn&#x27;t find it to be too much of a hassle due to how easily the Fusion Proglide moves over the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Proglide ranks as one of the best razors I have used. It gives a nice close shave with little to no skin irritation. It isn&#x27;t a perfect razor due to having a little trouble around the neck area, but otherwise I found it to be fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am trying this product free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received this Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology from Gillette courtesy of BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did give a decent shave, but overall it was only decent. The first couple shaves were actually really good, but if you have thicker facial hair, like myself, then you will start to notice that the blades start to dull rather quickly. With the number of blades per cartridge you do need to keep rinsing it out to keep it from clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle and flexball felt pretty good, it fits that hand rather well and the rubber kept the razor from slipping. Although the flexball itself did look kinda flimsy, in reality it was built sturdy enough. The flexball did take some getting used to, but afterwards it was a very neat idea that allowed you to get those harder areas around the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it provides a decent and comfortable shave. The only downfall for me is the price point of the refills. At around $4 dollars per cartridge, it will get very expensive very quickly for anyone with thicker facial hair.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I was able to test this product.  While I like the way it contours to my face with the &amp;#34;ProGlide&amp;#34; functionality, I am not that &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; on the blades themselves.  They seem not to last very long and already need to be replaced.  Sadly, the sample only came with one blade and a coupon for more (maybe that&#x27;s why they included the coupon)?  The product did work well with the included sample of ProFusion 2-in-1 Shave Gel and I like the way the product looks.  It did give me a rather clean shave and it was nice having the single razor on the reverse to touch-up those sideburns that sometimes are difficult to get straight with the normal razor head.  All in all, if I got it at a decent price, I&#x27;d be interested in continuing to use this razor and its blades.</li>
            <li> I love the weight of this razor, it feels good in your hand. It feels solid. The new thinner blades last longer and the shave gel works well and it gives a good shave. I like the way that it contours against your face. I would highly recommend this razor. If it had a battery and vibration function I would give it a perfect five</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide to try for free. I really have to say this razor was pretty awesome. It gave a nice smooth and clean shave. I also liked how it was easy to glide across my face and into creases without leaving marks. I will be purchasing this razor for now.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this razor</li>
            <li> The thing I like the best about Gillette&#x27;s new razor was how smooth my shave was after running the razor over my face once.  Normally, because of a &amp;#34;cowlick&amp;#34; quality to my beard, I have to come at it from four different directions to achieve a smooth shave.  With the Fusion Proglide. I found that I had a very smooth shave after only one pass.  After receiving this razor as part of an advanced preview, I can honestly say that this is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve used, and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor free,thanks to BzzAgent.com. I have always been using Gillette as razor and razor blade brand and have never been disappointed. The Razor has great grip and fits comfortably into my hand,i like the design it is simple yet appealing to the eye. The most noticeable feature is of course the Flex Ball. This feature makes shaving easy, the Flex Ball moves to the shape of your face and will take the hurtle of cheek to under your chin like a pro. No akward adjusting and repositioning needed.&lt;br /&gt;Lets talk Blades... well they are razor blades not much to them you&#x27;d think, these are very thin yet very sharp. I manage a close shave with my new Proglide razor without cutting myself. This is a great razor and i recommend you give it a try you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you thought all razors were made equally, you should probably try this razor.  I tried this product as a free sample from Gillette, and it was not the first Gillette razor I had used.  Prior to receiving the sample I had used the Fusion ProGlide Power, also from Gillette.  I always enjoyed the blades but I thought the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; piece to the razor I had been to be a little gimmicky and wasn&#x27;t sure how much it did.  So naturally when I tried this product, I was expecting a good shave, but really because of the pricey razor blades it includes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  The FlexBall technology does make a significant difference and the difference is felt shave after shave.  I didn&#x27;t feel the ball move as much as I expected, but could tell a significant difference in the results of my shave.  It caught so many more of the hairs on the contours of my neck especially that other razors could not catch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are the replacement razors expensive?  Yes, they are a bit more expensive, but they also last a pretty long time without significant deterioration in shave quality.  In my opinion, there&#x27;s not much else worse than razor burn and cuts on the neck.  Make the investment, get this for yourself or ladies for your favorite guy and experience the best shave you&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Gillette, via BzzAgent, let me try a free sample of this razor and I was pretty impressed.  I used it to shave my scalp and face and it worked great for both, especially with all the curves involved.  I think that&#x27;s the real win for the Flexball portion of the Gillette Fusion Proglide.  Lots of blades got the shave nice and close and minimized the frequency of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the razor that just never stops impressing me. I love how easily this glides across my skin without any pulling or tugging. I highly recommend this to any guy who wants a closer shave without the hassle. I recieved this product for free in order to test it out and give my thoughts, but this does not impact my opinion in any way.</li>
            <li> Received this product free from Gillette, ad so far I like it. I don&#x27;t find the FlexBall technology to be that big of a deal, but I do like the overall feel of the shave. It does make it easier to get around your neck and chin.  I have a goatee so I don&#x27;t have to deal with upper lip and around the small of my chin, so I can only imagine how it might better for that.</li>
            <li> This product provides the best shave experience as far as manual razors go. I recently received the product on promotion from Gillette and was impressed. I found the contouring feature of the product to be very beneficial when attempting the jaw-line. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Best Shave Ever,  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.  It is worth the money to buy.  The proglide technology is amazing.  I got a close shave with my skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  I had no tugs or pulling of the skin it was great.  My skin felt soft and smooth with every shave.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a promotion from Gillette and wanted to share my thoughts. I have used Gillette for a while and I have to say this is the best razor I&#x27;ve used. The main feature and the best is the flexball. My face has a lot of sharp edges and this razor does the job perfectly. The flexible nature of the blades and handle gives me the best control and gets every hair. Great technology!</li>
            <li> The razor moved across my skin and caused no skin irritation or problems I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzz Kit along with their skin care gel. I have used Gillette razors in the past and was looking forward to trying this one. It gives a very smooth shave and the flexball technology really helps the razor to glide more easily around the face. I will definitely be using this razor again!</li>
            <li> I had the previous Proglide and it did the job but this one is a big improvement. Usually when companies upgrade their product it&#x27;s minor and doesn&#x27;t really make a difference. This is actually worth spending the extra for the newer model. This with their Proglide shaving gel (I got ocean breeze) work well together and give me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. If you can catch a promo coupon with some coupons on blades and gel I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate that Gillette provided me with a free Fusion Proglide razor. The fact that this was free is not the reason for my positive review. The fact is that this is the first razor, and I have tried many, that has provided me a close shave with no burn. My initial impression of the Flexball was that it was a gimmick. I found out very quickly that it was not the case. The Flexball did glide over my face thus giving me a close shave. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology for free thanks to promotion from Gillette, and I have been loving it. The ProGlide razor has quickly become the best razor I have ever used. I have consistently used Gillette razors because the build quality is superb - the handle is sturdy and solid and the gel strip ensures a smooth shave and provides a nice indicator of when it is time to change cartridge.The most prominent feature, the Flexball, allows the razor to pivot along the contours of your face nicely, ensures that no hair is missed while providing one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  While I initially saw this as gimmicky, I truly have noticed a difference! I do wish that this razor had a battery operated version, but even without it, the shave is just about as close as you can get. What&#x27;s better, is that you really cannot beat the price Amazon is offering!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to try this product free thanks to Gillette.  I normally use the Mach 3, so I am used to a &amp;#34;straighter&amp;#34; razor when I shave.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor is definitely different than the Mach 3.  I found that the shave was much closer, and actually a little less &amp;#34;accurate&amp;#34; - most likely because I am not used to the flexball and frankly a little scared of it and cutting myself.  I will continue to try to get this razor into the rotation, but it will take a lot more practice before I feel comfortable with this one compared to the Mach 3 I usually use.</li>
            <li> Officially a tester for this razor, and I have to say it is the best I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using not only on my neck, but to shave my head and it rocks.  Sure, the lubricating strip is gone after the first head shave, but the razor blades themselves lasted a full 5 head shaves before I had to change the cartridge.  I&#x27;ve already used my $5 coupon for another set and feel I&#x27;ve finally found a razor and blade that works.  I didn&#x27;t get the battery operated one, but am looking to buy that next.  Good job!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed my new ProGlide razor that Gillette provided to me free of charge for my opinion. The shave is great and paired with their shave gel, provides a great,smooth shave every time. I have sensitive skin and have been through about every razor,cream,gel, and after shave on the market. I finally settled on Gillette products a few years ago and this razor is just the latest improvement  in an already good product line.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Flexball razor for a month and the results have been dependable. Gillette is a brand name synonymous with a great shave. My first razor back in high school was a Gillette and I have been a devoted Gillette user since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tough, thick beard that grows back fairly quickly. I work in an industry where it is important to maintain a clean-cut look. I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Flexball razor through a program sponsored by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ProGlide Flexball has features similar to my ProGlide Power except for one new feature – FlexBall Technology. The flexball is supposed to enable the blades to pivot back and side to side to respond to the contours of the face. It reminds of the ball feature in most new vacuum cleaners today that enhance maneuverability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the razor under multiple conditions over the past three weeks: 1 day shave, 3 day shave, and 1 week shave. It passed all three tests seamlessly. The first time that I used the Flexball out of the box, my shave was so effortless that I was in awe. The combination of the lubristrips and flexball allowed the razor to glide across my face. I didn’t feel a thing and was done in record speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the flexball to be effective in responding to the contours of my face while staying close to the skin. In particular, it was more effective below my nose and along my jawline, which is area where I often have missed hairs. The ergonomic design of the handle made it easy to grip. The microcomb lifted the hairs up and guide them in a uniform direction for a closer cut. The lubristrip allowed for smooth strokes and as a result, the razor was gliding effortlessly. The mineral oil from the lubristrips also left my skin feeling soft and irritation-free. The power of 5 blades meant that I did not have to repeat my strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One aspect that left me missing my ProGlide Power was the factor that the ProGlide Flexball was not battery powered. I feel that the power technology allows for the razor to glide effortlessly with no friction (ie. no tugging and pulling) or discomfort after repeated uses. While the my first use of the ProGlide Flexible was incredible, the friction levels increased after more uses. I assume that this is because the lubristrip was wearing out. I think having the razor be battery powered would help compensate for some of this. The power technology coupled with the flexball would have been a killer combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Flexball because it really does fulfill what it is advertised to do and offers a comfortable shave, primarily because of the flexball technology and ergonomic design. The 5-blades and microcomb allow for a smooth shave and remain resilient after repeated uses, but because the lubristrip wears out after only a few uses, the cartridge needs to be replaced sooner than I would like.</li>
            <li> This razor is quite awesome. It gives a great shave and works as advertised. It contoured to my skin and gave a close shave. Combined with an Art of Shaving kit, it gave the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The price of replacements is a little daunting but given the way it performs its necessary to get the best shave possible without seeing a professional!</li>
            <li> Shaving is not something I generally look forward to. It&#x27;s a hassle, takes a good chunk of my morning away, all the while cutting myself in small, minute places. I&#x27;ve been true to my brands over the years (hats off to you my trusty disposable dollar razor!) and never even thought to drop the extra dough on &amp;#34;new razor technology.&amp;#34; Gillette sent me their razor a while back to try risk free. Long story short, my dollar razors continue to collect dust in my cabinet while my 15 year old brother buys me 5 extra Gillette razor heads for Christmas. This razor literally conforms to the shape of my sharp jaw line, avoiding any instances of small cuts. Highly recommended to anyone who is on the fence of buying one. Definitely not overrated technology. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I like the close and smooth shave provided by this razor, and the Flexball is functional, but I am not completely satisfied with the large size of the blade head.  Trying to shave on an up stroke under my nose is very difficult with the large blade head.  I think I will return to using my old Trac II which has worked well for years and years, and let my wife have this razor for her legs.</li>
            <li> I can keep talking about technology, design and fancy marketing words… But in the end, it all comes down to one thing…&lt;br /&gt;Is the Fusion ProGlide any better than the original Gillette Fusion???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, indeed! First of all, I am impressed by the smooth sensation while I am shaving. There is no significant drag on my skin, and the blades glides easily across all parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I love love this brand of razor. Gillette is one smart cookie for making an easier razor for a busy busy guy like me. I love this razor as I have used it three times already and still going strong. I hate to use disposable razors as you can only use them one time and to me seems a wast of money. I have never had any issues with Gillette Pro Glide. Since I have used this razor I can tell a difference in the way it handles. It makes it easier for me to use and maneuver around my face. I very sensitive skin, and one wrong move can cut me up in no time. This ball like razor is something that I have been waiting for a long time. It glides to every curve on my face, and the grip of the handles makes it so easy to shave in the shower. I still like the fact at the end of the razor is the shaver to get close to what the other 5 blades can not do. I have been a Gillette fan for sometime, and will never go back to a different razor since this new Proglide Flexball as came into my life. I use the Gillette Proglide Styler as well. These two as a tag team makes my life of shaving a whole lot beter!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor for anyone that is wanting to try it.  The razor have 5 blades that help with the quick shave that is sometimes needed in the mornings.  I also went 7 days without shaving and it still was a quick easy shave without the tugging and pulling of the longer whiskers.</li>
            <li> This razor is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found where the head doesn&#x27;t just swivel up and down, but from side to side. That makes the blades stay against your skin with a minimum of effort. It gives a close shave without having to put out much effort and risk cuts. Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My first impression was the movie Alien.  This razor looks like something an alien would use on their skin.  It wobbles and flops like . . . like a mop.  It was awkward at first using it because it didn&#x27;t feel like what you feel when you shave.  It kinds of flops and wobbles around your face.  Truth be told I prefer the traditional razor to this new fangled one.  If it were not for the very close shave and smooth skin after shaving I would not be as generous with my stars.  Again I prefer using a traditonal razor to the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette to use and must say I like the shave. Its nice and close and leaves a nice smooth finish.  I have used this razor before and found after using it many times I have grown to like this razor.  Its flexball technology works great on the curvy areas of my face getting a close shave in all the hard to reach areas of my face.  I also found this razor lasts longer than the others that I have used in the past, but I still wish it had a longer life span.  It did a great job and would no doubt buy and use again.</li>
            <li> I recieved this razor to review ans Il must say I am pretty impressed with the swival ball like feature. very smooth shave. I would buy this razor.</li>
            <li> This razor does an amazing job at cutting close and leaving nothing behind. I found in both dry and wet shaving I got the same results which is exactly what I am looking for in a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is lightweight and easy to transport wherever you need to go. The blade does not seem to dull after the first few weeks of using this, so I am definitely impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this two thumbs up and for the price this is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> First - the design of the flexball is incredible. I played with it the moment I took it out and couldn&#x27;t wait for the next morning to give it a test drive. Now I normally use the Gillette Fusion Power and this was a non-power version of the flexball, so I was a little scared at first to go back (to a non-powered). I was impressed the minute it hit the curves on my chin. I mean this thing glides with ease and precision and makes it only take one pass instead of 3 or 4 to round the corner areas. Great razor! I am going out and buying the power version of this!</li>
            <li> This shaver is amazing! I&#x27;m a woman and I have always preferred men&#x27;s shavers, they seem to get a closer shave. This particular shaver has kept it&#x27;s edge longer than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used. I have to admit I keep my shavers longer than I should lol. I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I used a similar Gillette Fusion Proglide razor in the past but it had a vibration feature to it, which I did not like. This one that I received as a sample from BzzAgent didn&#x27;t have that feature. I like the design and the fact that this one is a bit smaller than the other ones I&#x27;ve tried. It seems to fit my hand much more comfortably. I like this razor much better because it makes cleaning out the blades much easier. I also like the way the blades are changed. Very unique. The overall shave was very smooth and the way the razor glides around the corners of my face makes it an impressive improvement over the traditional razors. A great innovative design!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewd several razors in the last few months.  My honest opinion-all are overpriced.  That said, if the price of shaving doesn&#x27;t make you squirm, this is an excellent razor.  The flex ball helps get you a closer shave and the blades cut cleanly.  I&#x27;m not sure what else to say...</li>
            <li> I received this razor in the mail and I must say that it is the best razor that I have tried yet! I&#x27;ve mostly used electric shavers in the past because the normal razors would leave my neck area irritated and bumpy. With this razor and how it contours to the movement of your face and neck, I didn&#x27;t have any irritation at all. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion battery operated razor for the past few years.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with it, so I didn&#x27;t expect much from the new Proglide.  The first thing I noticed about this new razor is that it has a good weight to it.  I was surprised that with my old razor having a battery in it that it would be as heavy, if not a little heavier.  That weight does help in making it feel comfortable in your had as you shave.  The movement of the Proglide head does help when shaving contours around neck and face.  Now for the big surprise.  The final shave was actually smoother than my old vibrating razor ever accomplished.  The really good thing is that the package of replacement heads I had just bought will also fit this razor!!  Yaaaay!</li>
            <li> I received a sample version from Gillette and I&#x27;m happy to report that it works as advertised. I used it on both my head and face and it works much better than a traditional style razor. No longer do I need to stretch my face out trying to get those odd hairs under the chin. The shave head is as smooth as any other Gillette razor so you get a good clean, quality shave, but the real game changer is the flexball. It contours to your face making one stoke shaving easy, and it gets all those hairs you usually miss the first time around.  Overall I’m very satisfied, I can now shave in a straight line and get every hair. Highly recommended, especially for head shaving.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide handle with Flexball technology is great, but the blades are even better. I have used the Fusion for years, and Gillette has made a believer out of a most skeptical critic, as I was sure the product couldn&#x27;t be that much of an improvement. Boy was I wrong! Having very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve only been able to shave every 2 or 3 days in the past. However, to my wife&#x27;s delight I&#x27;ve been shaving every day with great results... No bumps... And baby-smooth skin. I received the product for free, to try and review, from Gillette.</li>
            <li> Being that it is a man&#x27;s product, I let my husband use it and tell me what he thought.  He is not a real hairy faced guy and he thought this was a turbo charged version of a razor and just too many blades for him.  He did say it gave him a smooth shave but felt that it was more power than he needed to do what his other razor normally does for him.  He uses a different Gillette product and will continue to stick to that.  So if you are a hairy guy, this may be the razor for you.</li>
            <li> great product trim awesome no mess no hair left after a good shave</li>
            <li> love this gives a good shave and is easy to use</li>
            <li> Great product! My girlfriend signed me up for Bzzagent and thanks to their company and Gillette I was able to try this product for free. The product is wonderful, it really does rotate and adapt to your face to make shaving a much easier task without all the worry.</li>
            <li> Incredible Shave! I tried it first as a true test dry shaving not 1 nick or razor burn area then to give a real test I waited a couple days and used the Gillette proglide gel with it, Awesome not only did the gel smooth my skin but it also made for a 1 pass shave no retracing steps to make sure I got all the hairs Excellent job Gillette I am a customer for life and thank you BZZAGENT without the chance to try out this product for free I would not have known!!</li>
            <li> Love this razor. #sponser . A smooth shave, no pull and tug and no nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I recently received this as part of a promotional package and was very skeptical because I haven&#x27;t had a pleasant shave in over a decade. My skin is very sensitive and I get razor burn very easily. I am happy to report that I am razor burn free and enjoying a smooth face for the first time in a long long time. The fusion proglide took all the work out of shaving and I no longer dread having to shave.</li>
            <li> Does a great job with a smooth close shave. The flexball makes for more maneuverability.  Clogs easily if I don&#x27;t shave for a day or 2.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to justify the cost of refill cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was received for evaluation through a promotion by the brand.</li>
            <li> Great razor, it shaves very smooth. I recommend it to any one who is looking for a new razor. I received as a promotional item to try and it&#x27;s a razor I will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> I recently got a chance to audition the new Gillette Fusion Proglide razor, but with &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 bladed face with a 6th detailing blade design is really nice, and cleanly removes the harsh stubble off my face without giving me razor burn or leaving scruffy patches.  It also doesn&#x27;t rip the hair out of my face like a waxing gone wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am already a reluctantly loyal Gillette Fusion user, and the only thing that can keep me from championing the brand is the cost of replacement cartridges. I have used a lot of different razors, and Gillette is honestly the best shave I can find, the least irritating to my skin, and I can get almost a month out of the blades before they get dull. I typically look for coupons and rare discounts and then buy the cartridges in bulk (2 year supply), because they are so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexball handle is really a nice upgrade from the previous version allowing the razor to swivel and flex even more than before. I will not go back to the previous version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find the cartridges cheap, buy in bulk!</li>
            <li> After years of being a Schick Quattro user, I didn&#x27;t think I would change...until I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It&#x27;s the longest lasting cartridge I&#x27;ve ever used. Using it 4-5 days per week, it held for up for 4 weeks and didn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s sharpness.  This was better than my Schick.  I hate shaving and have sensitive skin, but the razor worked really well, giving me a close shave without tugging or pulling.  I didn’t think smaller blades would be as effective, but it actually helps decrease pull &amp; tug.  Blade stabilization was great for the contours of my face.  The handle makes it very easy to hold and glide over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: An enlarged Lubristrip lubricates skin, allowing for a smoother shave, however, sometimes I felt it left a little too much residue on my skin.  I like to use aftershave after shaving and with the residue it felt a little too much.  Note:  Received free product.</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;So as far as razors go the proglide is one of the best, I have been a fan of gilletes since the beggining of time. There razors are high quality and the ease of shaving is unbeatable. When I got this campaign on buzz agent I couldn&#x27;t wait to catch it in the mail, simply a dream come true. My first impression of the razor was quality, it was made of metal and had been polished. It was a thing of beauty, and in addition it had these really nice rubberized grips. So I tried it right out of the box and let me tell you; the flex ball technology is nice. It contours to the shape of my face! I&#x27;ve never had a razor do that before. I also recieved the 2 in 1 shave gel that kept my face hydrated and left me without nicks or cuts. The can is also made of plastic so it won&#x27;t leave rust rings on your sink. The most amazing thing to me is how cheap these razors are, there is no excuse to be buying the little disposables. You&#x27;re saving way more money.i recommend this to anyone who wants a pleasant shave and wants to save money. Thanks buzz agent and thank you Gillette</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this razor. It&#x27;s super smooth and works great. The simple fact is; it is better than the competition.</li>
            <li> Got to try this free from BzzAgent thanks to Gillette. I like the razor and i like the shave, but i honestly haven&#x27;t noticed that the ball makes a HUGE impact on my shave. The shaving cream was a tad thing for my liking. I do however really like the rustless can bottom. that&#x27;s a huge plus. The razor overall is very nice and i do get a smooth shave, but the price is a tad high, bring the price down a tad and it gets another star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide products for a while now (3 in 1 ProGlide Styler, the Original ProGlide Manual and ProGlide Power Razor) and just got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide FlexBall Manual razor as a promotional item and really like it.    After 3 days of use, it definitely shaves better than the previous ProGlide Power Razor I have been using for the last year or two. Whether or not the FlexBall is making the difference vs the cartridge is a hard thing to tell just yet, but I do know I saw a surprisingly big improvement with shaving 2-3 day stubble without the blade pulling when I moved from the standard previous model ProGlide Manual razor to the ProGlide Power Razor. I will be keeping an eye out for a deal on the updated ProGlide Power Razor with FlexBall since I am betting that will show an improvement also.    If seems counterintuitive to me to have a razor blade vibrating on your face, but it makes a noticeable difference. If you have one of the 3 Blade razors like a Mach3 or earlier (or that other brand I never liked), it&#x27;s definitely worth the upgrade to go straight to the ProGlide Power Razor with FlexBall. If you already have one of the previous ProGlide Power Razors like I do it may not be but all the Fusion/Proglide cartridges are interchangeable, so no loss there.    It seems like most guys hold on to their ole trusty razor for years without considering replacing it. Now is the time for a better shave, go get yours now!</li>
            <li> Excellent shave!! Very smooth, highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve used.  It hugged every curve of my face, not missing a spot.  It was a great, close shave and no irritation.  Not once during shaving, even after multiple uses, did the handle slip from my hand.  Blades stay sharp after multiple shaves, so it lasts long, making it a great value.  I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  However, I will continue to use this product regardless.  It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I was given a Gillette Fusion ProGlide to test out and it offers a close shave with minimal resistance. I felt very little irritation while shaving. The ProGlide shave gel also offers a cool sensation while shaving. My only negative is the trim blade on the back of the razor does not give an effective close up shave for sideburns and under the nose.</li>
            <li> Shaving to me is one of those things I really do not look forward to....ever. I have yet to find that Holy Grail of ultimate closeness and no skin irritation. From the Gillette Company, I was able to get and test this product for free.  The new Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology I was hoping to be my savior, but as it turns out after several shaves it performs no better than my Gillette Fusion Power.  I am not very convinced that the swivel of the ball helps any. It does look cool and space aged, but that is all I got out of it. I could feel the shave head moving and pivoting as I shaved but it did not seem to do any better or worse that my non-flexball razor.  So I am giving this 3 stars as it did the same job as my current Gillette razor. I think that the idea of this type of razor was a good one, maybe it worked for other people. But my experience was a less than positive one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, a world of a difference!  It is amazing what all you can get used to when it becomes part of your daily routine.  Once you make the switch to this razor by Gillette, you won&#x27;t know how you have been coping without it!  The flexball technology is amazing at cornering all of the bumps and contours of your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I got the Razor from BzzAgent, and I am fairly happy with it. I am used to the Fusion Power razor which I have been using for over a year.  After seeing the reviews of this ProGlide, and those cool in-store motorized displays, I had high hopes for this product.  I was expecting a really smooth clean shave.  I have sensitive skin and thick facial hair, which is a tough combination to have.&lt;br /&gt;I first used the razor with about 1 day&#x27;s worth of growth, and it worked pretty well.  Gillette says that this razor has the thinnest blades they have ever used, and that FlexBall technology is pretty cool.  However, the shave was less than what I expected.  It worked through the face smoothly, but not as smooth as my Fusion Power.&lt;br /&gt;The Second time I used the razor, I had about 4 day&#x27;s worth of growth.  This was the true test of these amazingly thin blades.  It cut right through with ease, but once again, was less smooth and less comfortable than my Fusion Power.&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend this product to someone who is new to manual razors, but for me it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  #sponsored #flexball</li>
            <li> I regularly use razors and have used numerous brands. Gillette Fusion ProGlide stands out of the crowd with how effectively it works.It provides a close shave without giving me cuts. At the same time the FlexBall technology allows for easy maneuvering around the curves. I have always preferred Gillette Match 3 but this one is its&#x27; close contestant. I am happy to receive this sample for a review.</li>
            <li> i received a sample of this product for free. very comfortable feel while using. smooth shave that is nice and close. i really like the 2 in 1 gel!</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care and Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall from Gillette to try and review.  I hadn&#x27;t shaved in 4 months so I guess God was telling me something.  This razor did a great job of cleaning up my face after months of neglect.  The fact that it pivots in all directions helped keep the 5 micro blades firmly on my face, getting every bit of stubble but did not create any rough spots or razor burn.  It did a great job and left my face smooth and comfortable.  Since it got more stubble per pass, I made less passes and was done very quickly but still with a quality shave.</li>
            <li> The entire idea of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall technology in theory is a great idea.  While it works well, just doesn&#x27;t quite get everything all the time.  I have had the chance to use it twice thus far and in both time after thinking I had a good close shave, upon washing off, it&#x27;s not quite done.  There&#x27;s still a bit of a shadow as you can see in the after picture so it doesn&#x27;t quite get close enough I guess.  So for me the razor is good but not quite near perfection yet.</li>
            <li> Closest shave of my life...I love Gillette and all of there products and I trust them with man personal care!    I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. However my review is honest and true.</li>
            <li> the razor is great and cuts better than the disposable ones but at the same time it seems to me that these razors dont last as long which they should last longer considering how much they cost which is why i give 4 of 5</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this razr. I have pretty sensitive skin and this was not a problem for this razor. I use it daily and I am already up to two and half weeks without changing the blade. I will be using this brand from here on out!!</li>
            <li> I tried the ProGlide as part of a promotion from Gillette and after being a long-time Mach 3 consumer. The razor definitely provided a clean and easier shave without irritation. If you&#x27;re looking for sculpting or precision, then this is not the product for you. But it is perfect for a clean and easy full shave.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product as part of a promotion for the brand.  I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide instead of my electric razor.  I am hooked.  The blade tilts and moves with the contours of my face.  I have gotten a smooth shave with no irritation.  I love it.  I plan to continue using this razor.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This razor out does any other. I just used it for the first time, and wonderful results. Easy to hold and easy to use. It fits all the angles to get all the hairs! I shaved once, not 2 or 3 times. It got everything! This is a great product!</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Thanks to BzzAgent I got mine free to test &amp; had my best most comfortable shave ever. It contours to your face for a better shave.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology from Gillette.  This is one of those products that is so innovative and works so well it makes you forget how bad manual razors used to be. The handle has a rubber coating which gives you a firm grip.  The Flexball head contours to the curves of the face so precisely it allows the blades to remove virtually every hair.  Finally, the 5 blades give the smoothest shave I have ever had.  If you want the best manual razor on the market today, this is it.</li>
            <li> I received this razor with a single blade to try for free from Gillette.  I used to use Gillette razors, but stopped buying them when the price was more than $1.00 per blade.  I found I could live with cheaper alternatives, even if the shave was not perfectly smooth and totally comfortable.  I was excited about trying Gillette&#x27;s latest blade and handle, just to see what I was missing.  While I like the lubricating strip razor manufacturers have added to blades in the past few years, features like rotating heads, more than 2 blades, and &amp;#34;FlexBall&amp;#34; technology always seemed like gimmicks to get you to spend more on your razor.  I have to admit, the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with FlexBall technology is amazing, and the best, most comfortable, and smoothest shave I have ever had.  I especially like the design of the handle and the trimmer blade built into the razor blade.  The trimmer blade does an excellent job getting straight lines on my sideburns, and trimming close under my nose.  Very awesome feature.  Overall I really like this blade and handle.  My only issue is the price.  I shaved with the same blade for approximately 2 weeks, which is about 10 shaves for me.  The quality and comfort of the shave started to decline after about 6 or 8 shaves.  While I love the razor, the blade, and all the features, the cost of each blade is still an issue for me.  Checking prices at the local big box stores, an 8 pack of blades costs just over $30, or almost $4 per blade.  That is still too expensive for me.  The shave I get from my $3.00 a month Dollar Shave Club blades will be good enough -  until I decide I want the luxurious shave provided by the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying I am not an everyday shaver. I tend to shave once or twice a week. So after recieving my free sample Gillette Fusion Pro-glide razor with the flexball, I had relatively long stubble to be removed. My first shave with the razor was incrediblely painful! It felt like I was pulling out each hair individually. It was so uncomfortable I stopped using it halfway through the shave and went back to my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly thought I&#x27;d never use it again. But after talking to some friends who use it and like it, I gave it another shot. My second shave went much better. When finished it did leave my face feeling quite smooth. I would use this razor if I shaved more frequently because it is good for very short facial hair. However, if you have more than 3 days growth you might be in for a painful experience.</li>
            <li> Ok so i don&#x27;t really do that many reviews on products. I&#x27;ve made an exception in this case. I receive this product from to try. I though what is so much better with this razor then the rest? I mean it only has to cut hair? Well the ball on this is amazing. It makes shaving so much easier. The blades are really sharp. I admit i wish they lasted longer. The shave is so close. it is amazing. I only have to shave once every other day. I usually had to shave every day. some times twice a day. yeah my hair grows fast. I recommend you take a chance on this. You won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
            <li> I received this kit from BzzAgent for free so that I could review it. I wanted to make sure it was a product that I would want to invest money in and I have to say, I love this razor! The Fusion ProGlide Power with the new FlexBall Handle really allows this razor to adjust to the contours of your face. For me personally, this comes in handy, because being right handed I always have a hard time getting the right angle on the left side of my face. It has also been some time since I used a razor that vibrates and I forgot how it does actually help me to get a closer shave. I can say this, because I have been using the Gillette Fusion for about 3 years now and this was a stark contrast in the closeness of my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the Gillette Fusion Pro-glide Sensitive Gel in the Active Sport scent.  I can say that I have used gels since the late 90&#x27;s and I always preferred them over shaving cream.  My face is sensitive to products that are too heavily perfumed and that do not offer enough protection from the razor.  I can easily say that this product meets both of these requirements.  I can&#x27;t say that it is any different than what I normally use, but I am a brand person and I love Gillette.  If you are a man that needs a product that will offer protection for you face and one that has a great scent, well you have to give it a try and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Can use same cartridges as the Fusion(if you have extra)&lt;br /&gt;Vibrates for closer shave&lt;br /&gt;Flexball handle actually works&lt;br /&gt;Microcomb does a great job channeling hair&lt;br /&gt;Blades cut better which means less time irritating your face&lt;br /&gt;Gel is really easy on my face&lt;br /&gt;Gel smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I was just a little disappointed that it did not come with an extra blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this really is a great razor that I would recommend to anybody seeking a more ergonomic and better functioning razor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that shaving is something that I always dread. I have very sensitive skin and always break out after shaving. Believe it or not in the past I have found using an electric razor to be an easier more comfortable shave and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve used for the last decade. That is until Gillette gave me an opportunity to try this razor for free through BzzAgent. I have to admit that I&#x27;m truly impressed. The first time that I used this razor I have about 4 days worth of stubble and I was sure that have to trim it down a little with my electric razor before using the manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;I was genuinely surprised with my results when I coupled this razor with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care shaving gel. The gel has a very smooth lotion like consistency which allowed this crazy sharp razor to glide smoothly over my face cleanly taking all of the hair in one pass with no pulling or hesitation. I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same areas to get a clean shave and since I only has to make one pass I didn&#x27;t get all of the irritation that I would get in the past. This can be attributed to the very sharp razors and the flexball the allows the razor to keep great contact to the contours on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it daily or every other day for the last 2 weeks and it is still very sharp and is shaving as good as the first day although the moisturizing strip has worn quite a bit so I wouldn&#x27;t expect more than another few shaves out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to summarize, If you have problems with irritation due to razors that make you constantly pass over the same areas to get a clean shave I would highly suggest that you give this one a shot, and as previously mentioned the Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care shaving gel compliments this razor exceptionally. This combination with leave you with a nice close shave with very soft skin without the burn found in the usual razors and creams.</li>
            <li> this razor is one of the best i have used i mostly use clippers to trim or shave my beard but this while be my go to razor from now on i like how it don&#x27;t have my skin feeling all itching and feeling rough it leaves my skin feeling clean in soft with a nice scent</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it gives me the closest shave I ever had. I like the blades and how easy it is to rinse out. Also the blue strip stays clean and soft longer than with other razors I have used in the past. The flex ball technology seems to work - I still make my &amp;#34;faces&amp;#34; when shaving but it definitely adjusts to the contours of my face. The refill blades are expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Got this free to review from BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve used it twice already, and it&#x27;s a pretty awesome experience. The razor has two pivots (most disposable razors only have one, if anyl) so not only does it glide well on smooth surfaces, it also pivots from side to side so it handles my jawline with ease. I noticed I didn&#x27;t really change hand positions much, I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same areas multiple times, mostly I was just able to do long strokes from my neck all the way up my face... so I had almost no irritation (I have incredibly sensitive skin) with little wrist contortion. I was surprised how quick the shave was, and I didn&#x27;t really need to go over any missed areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the weight of the metallic handle in my hand as well, it really gives me confidence during my shave. The five blades and flexball keep continual and even contact to the skin no matter how you hold the handle.</li>
            <li> That being said I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology and the regular Fusion ProGlide.    I had the same trouble spots on both of them.          ***Received product for free thanks to Gillette.***</li>
            <li> When I first unpackaged the razor I wiggled the head in all its directions.  I was unsure how this was going to work out.  I&#x27;m used to a competitor&#x27;s quad blade razor with just the up/down movement. I was worried the side to side movement may make me slip and cut my face or neck easier.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I have a full beard and mustache, but I keep my neck and cheekbones clean cut, so I don&#x27;t have any experience with the razor on my cheeks/chin/etc. The extra movement in the razor head took a little getting used to, but it actually made my shaving faster and easier.  I found myself not having to go over the same spot from different angles.&lt;br /&gt;My wife borrowed it and she said it did a great job on her legs and she found the pivoting head made it easier for the harder to reach places as well.&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, I feel the lubricating strips don&#x27;t seem to last as long as my other razors, but I also tend to use a blade longer than most people would.&lt;br /&gt;I used this with the ProGlide Alpine shave gel and I&#x27;d recommend both products to anyone.  Except small children.  They can&#x27;t be trusted with razors and tend to use the shaving gel as shower-time spray paint. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this as a special promotion but the price for the blade and gel is easily within my price range and I plan on making this my go-to razor from now on.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first thinking this was just another shaver. I was pleasantly surprised. It is the smoothest razor I have ever used. The flex-ball allows the blades to really hug your skin. It also has a heft to it, rather than the flimsy shavers I am used to using. The gel is nice as well, very faint scent so not overpowering and provides good coverage of your face with just a little amount. Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a smooth shave. I received the razor as part of a promotion from Gillette, but had I not I would still be raving about it.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Flexball is a fantastic disposable razor system. The fusion heads give an easy smooth shave without roughing up my skin and the Flexball handle noticeably improves the razor&#x27;s ability to follow the contours of my skin. With my old Fusion handles, certain areas of my neck would require multiple passes from multiple different angles to get every stray whisker. The Flexball handle seems to twist just enough to keep the cutting surface flat against my face and neck at all times, eliminating the need for extra passes. The new Flexball handle seems to fit existing Fusion blades, so you can use your old stash of blades with this new handle. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes with the razor blades themselves; they&#x27;re excellent as they have always been. The main reason to get this is for the Flexball handle. i received a free sample to test and review. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I received this razor from BzzAgent to test out and it is a great all-around product! I have always loved Gillette products and they just continue to get better. The razor has a good grip on it, smooth on my skin, and easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was part of a promotion where Gillette sent me a new Fusion ProGlide razor to test and review. In truth, I have been a &amp;#34;Shaving snob&amp;#34; in the past going for the old fashion double edge razor and wet shave gear. While it takes  time, it is extremely close. When I tested the Fusion ProGlide razor for a few days, I was very presently surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was quick, close and comfortable. I prepped my skin with shaving oil pre-shave, then let the Fusion ProGlide &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; over my face. Down strokes, across the grain, done. Quick and very serviceable close shave in record time. I like this new razor and can recommend it to discerning shavers everywhere.</li>
            <li> As a headshaver this razor is great!  The heft and feel of the handle make it easy to maintain contact without digging in.  The ball joint allows the head to swivel easily.  The blades are what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Gillette - high quality and easy to maintain.  All in all - 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying this product free courtesy of Gillette.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I would definitely use this again. Blade last long</li>
            <li> I received this razor along with the Gillette Sensitive Skin Ocean Breeze shave gel as a promotional offer to try the product for free and I&#x27;m glad I did!  What a fantastic shave this new razor with the FlexBall is!  I have sensitive skin and the less I have to drag a razor across my face the better.  This razor stays on all the contours of my face and minimizes the number of times I need to go over places more than once.  The razor is a little heavier than my old one, but I&#x27;ll take the better shave over this minor detail any day.</li>
            <li> I got this razor from the fine folks at Gillette and got to say it&#x27;s worth the fuss.  Close shave, no cuts and contours perfectly around chins, noses, etc.  I did bump it down one star for costs but trust me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette razors for as long as I can remember. I started using Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor With Flexball almost as soon as it became available. I really like the Gillette razors as they give a clean and close shave. As for the Flexball part, I dont really know if it adds very much value. I like the razor, and I&#x27;ll keep using it though, with or without the Flexball. I did receive the product free from Gillette and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I love gillette products. They work very well for me. I&#x27;ve had the fusion, power, mach 3, mach 3 power. I love them. I was naturally intrigues by this one, and the great guys at Bzzagent made sure I got one. I love it, it&#x27;s a great shave, especially around my adam&#x27;s apple. I strongly encourage you to give it a try, especially for those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I got this razor through a promotion with Braun and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used most of the Gillette razor varieties through the years, and this has the newest feature you never knew you needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball swivel takes a little getting used to, but after a few shaves it feels natural to use. Shaving over the chin moving from my cheek to neck it does help the razor in contact like it should and I was impressed how much I liked that part. I did figure out pretty quick how to hold it to disable the swivel feature though, it makes it impossible to get close under my nose and a couple other areas…The handle is also comfortable for my larger hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades don’t seem to be anything new to me from the Gillette line. I must have a thicker than average beard, because if I have any growth at all I can only take about ¼ inch strokes before the blades are completely clogged and have to rinse it out. That makes it a very slow process to shave. The Mach 3 blades to much better for me and don’t clog as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don’t understand the lubricating strip, when going for the second pass it leaves my skin feeling slimy and irritated at the same time somehow. I would prefer if they left it off completely, and I have never heard anyone say they buy Gillette blades because of their lubricating strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good razor… just not the right one for my face, but I will admit I am picky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a ProGlide Power razor for the past few months.  I have been using the Manual version I received as a promotion from Gillette (Through BzzAgent) for the past couple of weeks, and although it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; I&#x27;m used to, it but it does not disappoint.  I haven&#x27;t had a nick or a cut since I started using the ProGlide razors.  I&#x27;m Hooked!</li>
            <li> The Gillete Fusion ProGlide is definitely worth checking out! I had three days worth of stubble, that&#x27;s about how often I shave, and it didn&#x27;t pull once. Normally, when I use a new razor, I get nicked at least once; I didn&#x27;t have any problems with this razor. My face was smooth, minus the hair I purposely left in place, and the precision razor on the backside helped shape that up nicely! All-in-all a great product that I would purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I received this from bzzagent for review and was extremely pleased with this razor, I have been using gillette razors for years, just didn&#x27;t see the need to upgrade to the flexball technology. But let me tell you I am very happy that I tried it, I love how the flexball contours to your face making it much easier to get a close shave in all the &amp;#34;awkward&amp;#34; areas of your face.  The proglide gel is also strongly recommended. together they leave your face feeling smooth and refreshed.  Thanks BzzAgent for this opportunity.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought nothing of this razor. I assumed it was like any other razor, and that I would not be able to feel the FlexBall Technology. However, upon using it, I found it to be the most versatile razor I had ever used in my whole life. It made shaving so much more smooth, and easier than ever. I highly doubt I will be using any other razors in my house after my experience with this one. Thanks Gillette, for letting my try this awesome product for free!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the Mach 3 razor for the longest time.  He was excited to switch to another model for variety.  His feedback is that there is little difference between the two.  Since he likes the Mach 3, I am giving this one a 4 star as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fascinated to watch all the latest technology in shaving over the past decade and I&#x27;ve literally tried them all. It&#x27;s amazing how companies like Gillette and their competition started adding more blades, extra gizmos and gimmicks, and more all trying to set themselves apart. This new Proglide is the latest incarnation of this marketing campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What did I like about the Gillette Fusion Proglide? The shave itself is smooth and close as you would hope it would be with a million blades. The feel of the shaver is comfortable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What genius at Gillette thought this would be appropriate to shave beneath the nose, around the mouth, and evening out sideburns? SERIOUSLY?! I have to pull out my one-blade razor to get around these areas first before using this shaver. That&#x27;s an epic fail flaw that needs to be corrected somehow. You can&#x27;t proclaim to be the best shaver if you can&#x27;t adequately shave your whole face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette razors forever, and I&#x27;ve been using the Fusion for a bit now, and I&#x27;m a fan of the most recent upgrade.  I now have a beard and only shave my neck, and this razor&#x27;s great for just that.  The head moves horizontally along with the strokes, which can really help when shaving my neck.  Besides the hew horizontal pivot feature, the razor is basically the same as previous version... which isn&#x27;t a bad thing. The bending head, the heavy handle, and the trimming blade are all wonderful aspects that are still in place and should be appreciated.  All in all, great product that works well.</li>
            <li> Being a safety razor user, I was skeptical of the ProGlide and at first thought it was a great marketing gimmick. After shave one, the marketing gimmick thought passed and by weeks end I was a believer. I kept waiting for the newness and cool factor of the flex ball to wear off, and three weeks in, for the first time since I can remember, I don&#x27;t look at shaving as a chore. It&#x27;s quick and painless and have yet to have a nick (which was constant with my safety razors_.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very, very pleased with the razor. One blade has lasted me into my 3rd week before the strip begin to fade, which I was concerned about the blades lasting no longer than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome job, Gillette!</li>
            <li> I was sent this razor by Gillette to try and I really like it! I&#x27;ve been a Gillette user my whole adult life and was recently using the Power ProGlide before getting this one with the FlexBall. handle It does a really great job of giving a close, comfortable shave, and the FlexBall makes it that much more maneuverable, but I do miss the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; function. It my experience that added feature makes the shave even more smooth. And it could be in my head, but it seems to make the blades last longer, too...A great benefit since replacement blades are so expensive!</li>
            <li> Note: I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor from Gillette for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Experience:&lt;br /&gt;I have used several of the Gillette family of cartridge razors in the past and have found most of them to be very similar from my shaving experiences with them.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide proved the same for me.  I am able to get a fairly close shave with this razor after several passes, in various directions, over my facial hair.  That being said, I have fairly sensitive skin and find that shaving with cartridge razors, including this one, irritates my skin and does not leave me with as close a shave as my safety razor does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor Design:&lt;br /&gt;The design of the ProGlide is very similar to the Gillette Fusion razor, except that the ProGlide contains a FlexBall to allow the razor to adapt to the contours of the surface the razor is shaving.  I found this addition to be a bit gimmicky, as I do not have trouble moving across the count ours of my face when I shave with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; razor.  This seems to be more of a marketing item to get people to spend money on upgrading their razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Cartridge razors tend to be very expensive to buy refills for, and do no provide any benefit when compared to safety razors.  However, if I were to use a cartridge razor as my primary, everyday razor, I would definitely use the Gillette Brand of razor as there are many options to choose from and you are able to get a pretty close shave in using them.  Also, given that I already own a Gillette Fusion razor, I do not feel it is worth upgrading to the new ProGlide razor as I found they both produced just about the same shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I got this excellent razor from Gilette for free. It catches all the stubble that my old razor could not.  Clean shave continue after multiple uses.  Quicker shave without having to go over areas repeatedly. Love the flexball...makes it easier to reach parts my flat razor couldn&#x27;t. Definitely recommend this one. And the prize is not bad for this razor either.</li>
            <li> I FOUND THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE RAZOR TO BE THE BEST RAZOR THAT I HAVE EVER USED. THE BLADES HAVE REMAINED SHARP AND IT EVEN TAKES THE HAIR OUT OF  MY CLEFT CHIN WITHOUT A HITCH OR NICK. IT JUST GLIDES OVER FACE WITHOUT ANY PULLING OR DRAGGING. I WILL BE A CUSTOMER OF THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE RAZOR FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. IT HAS MADE WHAT WAS A CHORE, INTO A VERY SIMPLE TASK AND TAKES ABOUT HALF THE TIME TO DO A BETTER JOB THAN MY PREVIOUS RAZOR, WHICH IS NOW IN THE TRASH. THANK YOU GILLETTE. I APPRECIATE THE TRIAL MODEL THAT YOU SENT TO ME.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette products for a number of years. Having received this product as a free trial offer from Gillette I was happy to try it. Once again Gillette did not let me down. The piveting head is awesome for getting around those hard areas. This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Gillette razors for quite some time now, and honestly believe they are about the best available. I have since found several razors that work pretty much just as well--all for cheaper (sometimes quite a bit cheaper) than what a typical Proglide razor will cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I just thought I was ordering a regular Fusion Proglide razor...but no, this is the model that comes with the Flexball Handle. So what does the Flexball Handle actually DO? Good question. The razors have tilted backward &amp; forward to follow the contour of your face for literally at least a decade or more, right? The Flexball Handle essentially now allows it to curve not only up &amp; down, but now left &amp; right as well, giving your new razor unprecedented facial comfort and coverage. All this should translate into not only the best shave ever, but smoothest as well, right? In reality, I noticed absolutely ZERO difference in how close the razor shaved than my previous Proglide without the Flexball Handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me be clear: I still LOVE the Proglide, and firmly believe that if I have the choice of using the Gillette versus pretty much every model of personal shaver available, I&#x27;ll go with the Gillette pretty much every time (unless of course I cannot afford one, in which case I have 3 different and much cheaper models which I believe work easily 98% as good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, I LOVE the Proglide--but don&#x27;t see that the Flexball Handle works really any better than the regular model. Maybe that&#x27;s because the regular Proglide works so well, that the difference is purely subjective to each user, I&#x27;m not entirely certain to be honest. All I know is it works, and works well...but if the Flexball is more expensive, I cannot endorse paying more. If they are the same price as the regular Proglides, then no problem. Otherwise, I&#x27;d stick with the regular razor.</li>
            <li> Great product, received on time</li>
            <li> As a BZZAgent reviewer, I recently received a free sample of a Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology, and gave it a whirl. This is a pretty fine razor in my opinion. There&#x27;s a bit of heft to it, which allows for a confident, close shave. The flexball tecnology allows me to confidently traverse the countours of my face. Overall, a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, will it make me leave my power Proglide razor? No. Not for a minute. But it will definitely be my razor of choice at my summer home.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  This is the second one Ive used of the flexball type.  It has made a believer out of me and I will be buying replacement cartridges when this one wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only shave 3 times a week.  I dont have very course facial hair, but this thing works really well.  I definitely like razors over the shavers I have used.  You get a much closer shave and since I shave in the shower, no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this one free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received the razor as part of a promotion from the brand. I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor a handful of times to trim around my beard and keep my neck smooth and bump free.  It&#x27;s been a breeze.  I especially like the single blade precision trimmer to work on the edge underneath my nose.  The result is an exceptionally close and pain-free shave.  Way to go Gillette!</li>
            <li> First off, Gillette sent me this razor FREE to test it out for them! Great guys, huh? I especially think so after trying it out! This razor is absolute magic! With my sensitive skin there was absolutely no way that I could shave every day! Now it&#x27;s part of my morning routine thanks to this razor. It moves from my cheek to my throat in one smooth stroke and takes absolutely all of the hair on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with this new razor. However i was lucky enough to get to try it for free as part of a promotion through BZZAGENT so that was cool. To me it did not offer a measurably better shave than the original ProGlide.</li>
            <li> Great Razor. Received as part of promotion but will definitely be buying these cartridges going forward. Best I&#x27;ve ever used (and i&#x27;ve used a lot).</li>
            <li> I usually use the cheapest razor from Gillette and they last long since I only shave about once or twice a week.  I have sensitive skin and this why I can shave that often.  I got the Fusion ProGlide for free to review.  It feels great on my skin.  smooth save without damaging my skin!!!</li>
            <li> I received a free razor along with the 2in1 shaving gel from Gillette. And I have to say that it is an incredible duo! The gel lubricates tremendously and the the shave you get get from the razor rivals a professional shave from a barbershop!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette and Bzzagent.com I received one of these for free to try out. As far as the Fusion line of razors go it fits right in. As far as the flexball goes, for me it was okay. If I were buying a new razor I would probably get it, but I don&#x27;t know that i would trade in what I had for it.</li>
            <li> I received a Fusin Proglide FlexBall as a promotion to try and see what I thought.  Now like most of you I know when you see this was a promotion for this you think “Right is he really telling the truth”.  Well I will tell you I was skeptical myself of it but I tried it and guess what you got it I liked it.  I normally use a single blade safety razor old school style well not any more I now use a FlexBall.  Closest shave and best cut I have ever had it shave so well even where the grain of my hair grows in crazy directions.  I will be using this razor from now on.</li>
            <li> Great clean shave of course! I personally do not notice a significant difference with the flexball technology but if it eliminates cuts and all sorts of ugly razor battles then so be it!</li>
            <li> It gives a great shave, I like how well it moves on contours to my face. I  normally get caught up on my chin but this hasn&#x27;t had any problems. I am trying the product for free thanks to Gillette. I have seen this before many times and I thought maybe it would work well the first couple of times, but literally after 10 uses it still works really well and the rotating neck doesn&#x27;t slow down. I will definitely buy more replacement razors for this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a member of BzzAgent and was lucky enough to be part of the group selected to receive a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor, along with their new Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel+Skin Care for testing purposes. Prior to this, my everyday razor was a refillable competitive brand razor, which I thought did a great job - that is, up until I received this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this razor cut very close, but the flexball allows it to contour to your face and remove hair evenly across all planes of your face (cheek bones, chin, etc.). It&#x27;s really one of the first razors I&#x27;ve used that I don&#x27;t have to manually adjust myself (not that it&#x27;s very difficult) to shave the different spots of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with the 2-1 shaving cream (which has an extremely pleasant scent), the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Razor and shaving cream are absolutely a recommendation I can gladly make.</li>
            <li> After receiving this product to try from BzzAgent, I&#x27;m overall extremely pleased with the results. This razor gives me an extremely close shave without nicking myself. The blades last for quite a few shaves as well. My only complaint is that the handle is a little too thin. I prefer something with a little more heft in my hand. Overall though, this razor is fantastic and I look forward to continuing to use it!</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide manual razor through bzz agent courtesy of Gillette and of course was excited to try it. To begin with, my baseline for comparison was what I normally used, a schick hydro 5. Of course what I look for is the answer to the question &amp;#34;is this going to be better than what I currently have&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the razor, I had high expectations. The razor is supposed to follow the curves of my face for a perfect shave right? I honestly felt like the blades did not get as close as my schick and while it did do a little better as far as following my face, I have been doing this long enough to where I already knew how to use my old razor to follow my face lines pretty well. The shave did not feel as close, and it was not as comfortable as the one with my schich razor. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it got the job done and was not bad per se, just not as good as the razor I previously used. The flex ball technology didn&#x27;t seem to help improve my shave.</li>
            <li> This is really the next generation of razor technology. I got this product as a trial sample and I was a bit skeptical of how much of a difference the new hinge would make but it does really add to the shaving comfort. The joint rotates more than I have ever needed but it makes a difference for me while shaving my jaw line and on to my neck. I am also a fan of the single blade for getting sharp lines on my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially on my neck. Whenever I shave (even with an electric razor) I always get skin irritation and red bumps on my neck. I was very excited to try the sensitive gel and the Fusion Pro Glide Razor to see if I could finally get a nice close shave, irritation free.... It worked! After shaving with the Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel and Skin Care and the ProGlide Razor - No Bumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the tingling, cooling, fresh feeling left by the Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ProGlide Razor was fun to use and flowed with every bump and turn on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel and the razor left me with a clean close shave. I will continue to use this gel and razor in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree #BZZAgent</li>
            <li> I love the new Fusion Razor.  This razor gives as smooth a shave as the previous versions of the razor, but the Flexball handle allows me to shave tough spots (chin/neck) very easily, with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor free thanks for Gillette! This is a really great razor. It stays close to the skin for good coverage and leaves my skin nice and smooth. The flexball looks very durable and long lasting It really is perfect and has me ready to run to the store for more blades.</li>
            <li> Finally, a manual razor I can live with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I gave up the closeness of a blade shave and used an electric razor because most of the blades were too irritating to my sensitive skin.  I had issues with razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  All of the blades I tried just made the problem worse.  The electrics were not perfect, and were rather expensive since most of them did not last long or required yearly head replacements, but they irritated me less.  When I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor as a promo to try, I gave it a shot.  I was surprised- it worked smoothly, did not irritate my skin, and I finally had a close shave.  The flex ball feature seemed to help quite a bit- it moved well even on the difficult face areas.  The lubricating strip also helped.  The only downside is the cost of the blades. Many of the advertisements seem to say you can use a blade for two weeks. I find I get one week, maximum, before I need to replace the blade.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free thanks to Gillette, and since I&#x27;ve started using it, I have gotten the best shave I have had in a long, long time. The razor is smooth and comfortable and of course, gives a great shave! I use it along with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2in1 gel for sensitive skin and man it really makes a difference. Gillette has a customer for live with these products. I don&#x27;t plan to go back to my old razor or shaving gel again. Try it! You will not be sorry! #Sponsored #2in1ShaveGel #FlexBall</li>
            <li> #GotItFree #BzzAgent Thank you #Gillette for giving my husband a chance to try your razor.&lt;br /&gt;Review from my husband: Great Razor, great for the price. Better than other razor out there. Close shaving to skin and it contours to the skin. Recommended.</li>
            <li> i received the Gillette fusion proglide w/ flexball technology trial razor from Gillette for free.&lt;br /&gt;i am already a faithful user of the Gillette fusion proglide w/ flexball technology. i have used all the major brands but Gillette fusion proglide razors are by far superior. they are well made with formidable materials that are comfy to hold, don&#x27;t slip out of ur hand, the blades are sharp leaving you clean and smooth, and the unique flexball technology adjusts to the uneven contours of ur face for that close shave. i can&#x27;t remember the last time i cut myself and these blades are fine and sharp. there is a preceision trimmer on the back too but i don&#x27;t really have a need for that</li>
            <li> I hate shaving and I always cut myself and leave scars on my face. I usually have a permanent 5-o-clock shadow because I avoid shaving at all costs. However, I received a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall in the mail to try from Fusion and so far, this is my favorite razor. The blades glide easily and so far I haven&#x27;t had a single cut! I am really happy with this razor and the quality of the handle and blade. I have only needed to change the blade once in a month and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Proglide from Gillette about two weeks ago and have used it so far about 5-6 times. So far I have to say its a great blade but what I&#x27;m really loving is the engineering of the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off to give you an idea of what kind of shaver I am, I maintain a beard while using the razor to keep the thick brush that constantly grows on my neck at bay. With my growth rate I HAVE to shave ever two days or I end up looking like a bum. I don&#x27;t use any soap or creams, I just &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34; in the shower. My only available method to clean the razor is the weak spray that is my sad little shower head, or risk dulling the blades by brushing them with my hand. I bring this up because this has been a huge pain point for me with other blades getting clogged quickly, always right in the middle of the length of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shaving that this blade provides, it is what you would (and should) expect, a good consistent shave that does not slice your face off. Thankfully they have been in the game for quite a while and I would be pretty shocked if this was not the case. All 5-6 times I got a good shave and did not notice bleeding once. That sometimes happens to me when razors dull quickly after first 3 uses, but thankfully was not the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I say, in my opinion, you should expect all that. The thing I was extremely please about was how they designed the blades. With my two-three day neck growth I have not had a clog up yet that my shower spray could not clean out. I cannot tell you how happy this makes me. After the 3rd or 4th day I noticed it and was trying to figure out why. It looks like they have the razor backing right next to the blades but they have solved the problem by placing additional super tiny little gap fillers between each razor so that 1. it provides support and 2. its stops the clogging problem while allowing it to still cut evenly. Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I say so far I&#x27;m loving the blade. If I had to nitpick something that I didn&#x27;t like then it would probably be just that its big and the orange ball kind of makes it ugly in my opinion. But since I don&#x27;t shower and shave out in public for all to see (at least not often), I&#x27;m not too worried about people gocking at the sight of my big orange blade ;)</li>
            <li> I first want to disclose that I received this razor free through a promotion from Gillette and BzzAgent. I shave and shave and shave a lot. I shave my face and head every 2 days and I have hair that is on the coarser side. This razor is hands-down the best I have used yet. The razor is smooth and sharp and it doesn&#x27;t get clogged like my Schick Quatro does during a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes considerably less strokes to get the hair on the back of my head and neck off completely smooth. This is an area that has always been a been sensitive to razors causing bumps and ingrown hairs. I have to say, I have shaved my head and face 5 times with the same blade and I think I will try one more, then check the blade for changing. With my other razors I would even consider more than 4 shaves before changing the blade.(coarse hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels much so much smoother and improved. The pivot of the ball really does force the razor to contour to every angle of your face and head. One problem I have had with other razors is the blade popping off when I would tap it to rinse after a few strokes. I have yet to have this blade pop off once, even after dropping it on the floor. Plus since it doesn&#x27;t get clogged, so there a fewer instances of tapping it to clear it. This is a great razor. The single blade on the reverse side is perfectly angled to get a sharp line on my Goatee, when I have one, and gets all the hair around my ears, whereas before I would need a separate straight razor for the area above my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering how many shaves you get per blade, this will certainly be more economical than my Quatro blades. If you shave a lot, you will love this razor.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product as I usually do not like cartridge razors. I normally use a double edge safety razor and shave using shave soap and brush but received this item for free to review so I gave it a shot. I have tried other major cartridge based razors and found I received more irritation and a shave that left a lot to be desired. I was pleasantly surprised with the shave this razor gave me, it left nothing behind but my skin feels great.  I do think the pivot ball is a gimmick though, I tried to watch it as I shaved and never saw it move, I think if it is moving you are probably pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> By far the nicest razor i&#x27;ve used, such smooth strokes really made my skin feel soft when I finished my shave!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette, I got to try this product for free! Let me start off by saying, I have not used a better razor, period! This razor gives me the closest shave, without having to worry about nicks in the skin or pulling of the hair. The Flexball handle is great for following the contours of the skin and ensuring you don&#x27;t miss a spot! This razor will give you the fastest, cleanest shave you can get!</li>
            <li> Being a bearded gentleman, I really don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on some fancy razor.  I just need a few quick swipes of the neck and cheeks and I&#x27;m good there, so I tend to just uses and good old fashion 3 blade disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My head is a different story.  As I lose more hair up there, I keep cutting it shorter and shorter.  Electric clippers don&#x27;t get close enough, so I like to take blade to the scalp as well.  Problem is, with the curvature of one&#x27;s melon, not to mention the angles you need to get at, it&#x27;s next to impossible (for me at least) to get a clean, even shave all over the cranial area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lo and behold, I received a Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball Technology as part of a promotion from Gillette and I thought that it would be worth a try.  I was not disappointed. Now, I have used other Fusion blades in the past, so I kind of knew what I was getting there.  The 5 blades do provide a nice, close shave with no irritation.  They say the blades themselves are finer and thinner for less tug and pull.  I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference form other Fusion blades.  That&#x27;s not a bad thing.  You know what you are getting from Gillette and it&#x27;s a quality.  If there are improvements, it&#x27;s marginal, but it&#x27;s certainly not a step backwards or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that Flexball, oh that beautiful Flexball.  The way the thing responded to the contours of my head was like a dream.  Instead of going over an area several times form several different directions trying to get an even cut, I was able to just go over the top of my head once and things were perfect. No more trying to wrap my left hand over the back right side of my head while facing downwards trying to get that spot at the part of my hair just right. No, it&#x27;s just a simple swipe or two and it&#x27;s all good.  Something else that I noticed is that I didn&#x27;t need to apply as much pressure to get just as close of a shave up there.  Not sure if that is more the handle or the blade, but either way, I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for minimal face shaving, I can&#x27;t say that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball technology is a huge improvement over prior Fusion versions.  But if you are looking for something to shave the entire head area, I have yet to find a razor as comfortable and productive as this one.e blade, but either way, I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for minimal face shaving, I can&#x27;t say that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball technology is a huge improvement over prior Fusion versions.  But if you are looking for something to shave the entire head area, I have yet to find a razor as comfortable and productive as this one.</li>
            <li> I enjoying this razor. I believe its one of the best on the market! Smooth shave, 5 star feeling. I feel like i have a baby face and received many positive comments from females! Once you try this razor, its hard to go back to the standard double razor. Another great feature is that you do not have to change razors that often as it is long lasting. Im sold as a customer and if you havent already, you should consider too! I would like to give a special thanks to buzz agent which i am a member of and allowing me to try this product, and also thanks to gillette for creating a fine product!</li>
            <li> I was absolutely 100% pleased with this Gillette Fusion Proglide razor.  My skin on my face tends to be very sensitive and for years I have searched for the perfect razor that will assist me with getting a great barbershop shave but also caressing my skin enough that I will not break out or have a raw experience after shaving.  I have found my razor!! I cannot tell you how pleased I am with this razor; it is perfect and for the price you cannot beat it! I highly recommend this if you have sensitive skin such as myself.  I will definitely be purchasing these from now on!</li>
            <li> Finally I have a razor that can reach everywhere on my face! I&#x27;ve used many razors in the past including other gillette models but I couldn&#x27;t seem to shave the exact places I wanted to, like on the side and below my chin. With this new Proglide that i received for free from Gillette, the flex-ball allows the razor head to actuate correctly and hug the contours of my face to shave the areas I was struggling to reach in the past. These Proglide cartridges seem to last longer than my other non Gillette cartridges also. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Awesome Stuff! I always knew Gillette is one of the top makers for men&#x27;s grooming products in the market, so I was already optimistic about this product. Was I right! This razor has my face feeling smooth and soft with no razor bumps. Nice clean look and an awesome shave! Will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> I am a Bzzagent and tried this product for free thanks to Gillette. The Gillete Fusion Proglide razor flexball technology helped me get a close shave by contouring to the curves of my face. face. It didn&#x27;t leave me with razor burn or knick my face. Overall a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology is a very good razor, I love the textured handle, the grip feels great in your hands and allows you to get a really close shave in hard to reach areas such as your neck, chin and around the lips.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor has a very good blade that delivers a smooth shave even after two weeks of heavy use.  I tested it by skipping shaving a few days so my beard was good and tough with three days worth of stubble and the blade performed very well giving me a close clean shave. The razor has a flex ball that allows it to move freely and smoothly over your face helping to deliver that wonderful shave. I would recommend this blade to anyone.  Full disclosure, I received the product free from Gillette as part of a promotional offer, but I still believe in the razor and its blades.&lt;br /&gt;#sponsored.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  That being said, I don&#x27;t believe in paying a lot of money for razors (which may be counterintuitive-maybe that is why I hate shaving?!)  Either way, I recently saw the dollar shave club and thought I would give it a try.  At the same time, I got invited by Gillette to try out this razor.  I must admit, there is no comparison between the dollar shave club&#x27;s mid-range razor and this Gillette.  The Gillette razor shaves circles around the other one.  That is not saying the other one is bad, this one is just that much better.  I am not sure how much of it is the razor design (flexball) vs. the cartridge...but it definitely gets the job done.  The &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; edge on the back seems like a waste to me, but that may be a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure, i got this as a sample from gillette...but that doesn&#x27;t change whether or not i would actually want it!  Overall, the ProGlide is an awesome razor.  The packaging has been redesigned so you can&#x27;t cut yourself on the blister pack...and the razor itself is outstanding.  Refills, as you&#x27;d expect are pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the razor is how close a shave you can get with it.  It is the smoothest, best shave i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I received this razor via a BzzAgent thingy and tried for some time. I normally use a Mach 3 or an electric razor. I did side by side tests and though the razor performs very well, it just doesn&#x27;t beat my mach 3. A quick summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;5 Blades perform well and give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;More blades &#x3D; more shave swipes before you have to clean it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Just doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my mach 3&lt;br /&gt;The Mach 3, for whatever reason, is also easier to clean between swipes&lt;br /&gt;I, personally, couldn&#x27;t find any benefit to the little Flexball. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just a gimmick or if it&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a solid razor and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. However, I have yet to encounter a razor that beats my trust mach 3.</li>
            <li> As part of the preview group, I received this razor and I can say that the results are amazing, only have to shave once a day and no irritation, incredible!</li>
            <li> I received this razor free through Bzzagent in a promotion and I&#x27;m really happy I was lucky to get it. Best razor I&#x27;ve used by far. I have a tendency to push to hard while shaving and somehow the flex ball prevents me from doing so. Don&#x27;t hesitate to get one for yourself!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion razor has exceeded my expectations.  I gave it a try as part of the BzzAgent and I will be a repeat customer.  The quality of the shave and the shave gel had been outstanding.  The gel is nice and thick, the shave is close (with both the Fusion razor and my previous razor, gave both a try) and my face feels fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> I did receive this free from Gillette via Bzzagent. Overall, it&#x27;s an okay razor. I do not feel that the flex ball lives up to any hype that Gillette has try to craft, because it may move more than a traditional razor but it does not move to the bumps and such like they want you to believe before you buy. Plus the lubrastrip basically melts away in the presence of warm water during the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> awesome razor  rec&#x27;d as part of promotion and will defenitely buying more</li>
            <li> The Pro-Glide has really surprised me...I was looking for a basic razor for those days I didn&#x27;t use my electric.  The Pro Glide has by far been the best shave I have gotten....the Flex Ball also gets around my chin close the first time and every time with no worries about cuts.  Thanks to Gillette and Bzz Agent, I was given one of these for free to try. When combined with the Pro Glide shaving gel, not only is it a close shave but my skin feels great all day, even after working out or a crazy day at work.  I haven&#x27;t been much of a razor user in some time (just the electric) but I go to the Pro Glide quite a bit now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a short while now and have to say that I get really clean, close shaves. The razor does everything that Gillette says it does - the Flexball allows the blades to move with the contours of your face so the blades (all 5 of them) keep in contact with your skin.It gets ALL the hairs on my face and neck without irritating my skin. I have been using it with Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel + Skin Care 2-in-1 - Ocean Breeze. The gel dispenser stays clean and has a gauge on the side of it that lets you know how much you have left. And, since it&#x27;s made of plastic it won&#x27;t rust. I have found the combination of the gel and razor provide me with a truly smooth shave, a cool, refreshed sensation on my face and an added benefit - a very pleasant residual scent of an ocean breeze.  This product is great!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  The first few uses were good.  I used it in conjunction with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care.  The blades on the razor glided nicely and cut stubble easily, without tugging and pulling, as advertised.  But, within 1 week I noticed the razor tugging and pulling, and causing irritation.  I didn&#x27;t notice any better contact over contours, or anywhere for that matter, than any other razors, expensive or inexpensive.  I used this product in a few different ways.  Sometimes, I shaved with just this razor.  I used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Gel and I also tried it just using soap/shampoo.  No better results one way over the other.  The Gel smells good and has a nice texture, but is too thick and needs to be watered down a bit.  I also tried doing the bulk of the shaving with my electric razor and then following up with this one to get closer.  That worked, but no better than any other razors.  I had high hopes at first, but for me, it turned out to be about the same as any other razor, except for the really cheap no-frills type brands.</li>
            <li> I got this Razor and 2 in 1 shaving cream for free to try and I was a bit septic. So far I was never really able to shave with a razor because my skin would get so irritated and bearable. But with the Gillette 2 in 1 sensitive shaving cream combined with the Flexball razor I am now a happy man. For the first time ever I can shave and it&#x27;s looks amazing. Thank you so much for this opportunity. Gillette is now my favourite shaving buddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product it&#x27;s amazing the shaving cream applies nice and smells awesome as for the Flexball razor it&#x27;s easy to use and handles like a charm. I love the way the ball makes it contour my face to give me a close shave. Father day is coming up and I strongly suggest that you give him the Flexball razor and 2 in 1 shaving cream. Believe me he will be Happy :-)</li>
            <li> As being a ProGlide user for years Gillette sent me the FlexBall to check out. I was a little hesitant as my experience with the Power was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think the blade pivoting 4 ways would do much for me. I was wrong.  Coupled with 2 in 1 Gel this is absolutely the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I took it on vacation used it for 2 weeks and figured the blade would be done. It lasted 5 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s now been 6 weeks I&#x27;m using the FlexBall and I have not gotten one nick or cut and for me that&#x27;s amazing. So I&#x27;m all in and will continue using this system.&lt;br /&gt;My one pet peeve is it can be hard to clean. It has more nooks and crannies then other blades so you really have to be diligent keeping it clean and dry after use to get maximum usage from the blade.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days when you get nicks and cuts when you shave.. If you think that statement is true, you must be using the new Fusion ProGlide men&#x27;s razor. Gillette is hands down the best razor in the market today. This coming from a guy who loves to shop around and try different razors! Try it - you will not be disappointed! I received a package of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor to review and I have to tell you it blew my mind. I didn&#x27;t have to be careful with my shaving. I could just run the blade all over my face and it got every hair in every nook and corner and I had zero nicks and cuts! What more do you want!</li>
            <li> Gillette has been a household brand for many years now. There is a reason for that; their products work great and are a good value. Recently I was sent Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care and Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology to try out for free. The razor is amazing. It slides smoothly against my skin and hugs the curves of my face with out cutting or scratching up my skin. I tried the razor with a basic soap and then with the 2 in 1 gel (Ocean Breeze). The gel is much better. I had to take my time with the razor and soap whereas with the razor and gel it was a quick shave. I was not afraid of hurting my face. The gel also is a great moisturizer and smelled very nice. My face felt smooth days afterwards.</li>
            <li> I will happily admit that I am a Gillette man. Like almost everyone, I hate shaving, yet when i have a Gillette product in my hand, invariably I am more confident of my ability to get a clean, close shave without nicks and cuts and this shaver delivers on all levels. Note that I did receive this Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology to test for free from Gillette through Bzzagent. I was also provided with the Fusion 2-in-1 shave gel. Together they are a winning combination. I love putting the shave gel on in the morning after a shower and feeling the cooling sensation hit my face. Then the razor just makes quick work of whatever growth I have going on. The FlexBall especially feels like i am getting to all the hard to reach places and getting an even shave. Then, the cooling feeling persists even after I am done, leaving my face feeling refreshed. A Gillette man I will remain...</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology free from Gillette and in exchange I would give my honest opinion. I have been using his razor for quite some time but really don&#x27;t find any difference between it and other razors, the blades are what make the difference. The flex ball really just seems like a novelty to me that doesn&#x27;t appear to make any difference while shaving. my wife has been using this razor as well and really doesn&#x27;t see much of a difference (or any) either. My 14 year old son is the person who has never shaved but has the beginnings of &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; above his lip so I have been trying to get him to try it out. I&#x27;m not sure if he&#x27;s afraid to shave or enjoys having that little bit of fuzz but refuses to try it out yet. I&#x27;ll keep trying to get him to use it though. if he does, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Handle really feels no different to me than any other razor, not worth paying extra for the flex-ball gimmick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. My wife uses one as well and can&#x27;t tell any difference between this razor and others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this family uses the razor, none of us think it is any better or worse than any other cartridge razor out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;Finally got my son to try it, you can witness his first &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; on youtube at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/XKgrgiHKSkc</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor made shaving a pleasure, not a chore. The roller ball technology left me with one of the closest shave that I have ever had. The treated strip also left my face feeling refreshed, while not leaving that just shaved burning feeling that other razors tend to do. The razor glided smooth and evenly across my skin and the gel.</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor from Gillette to review and I was delighted by the look and feel of the razor. I have used Gillette for years and have always enjoyed them as they work as desired. It was definitely a smooth guide and works very well on my coarse facial hair. Compared to many other brands Gillette just is the best. Yes they may be a little more expensive but really, you are shaving you are face and everyone see&#x27;s it so it is worth it to spend the few extra bucks for a good shave.  The 5 blades are definitely a plus and reduces pull and tug that I would normally have from a razor with less blades. The handle is easy to use and glides well. I&#x27;m not quite sure if there is a single negative to report back. My face is smooth and no issues here! Go get yourself one and feel the difference on your skin!   Updated: I also forgot to add how long that they actually last. The razors seem to last a longer time than my normal disposables so to me that is worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the best razor to date that has been used. It gives a close shave and keeps me from cutting myself. The rotation is great also and lets me move smoothly around my face. I will forever purchase this product I&#x27;m happy that i received it as a promotional gift and that helped with my decision to continue purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of razors, and nothing has worked nearly as good as the ProGlide. What I like about the ProGlide is that it gets all the hairs, and the flexball technology is really great which allows for closer shaves. Also, the greatest thing about this razor is I got it free; all thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I am trying this product free from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using the new Pro Glide 2-in-1 Gel. It has a new design with the bottom made out of plastic which will not leave any rust stain on your counter. You have to press down a little firmer for the cream to come out, but it sprays out in smaller amount to avoid waste. However, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t leave the dreaded leaking shaving cream behind! I did notice when I was shaving i felt a slight burning sensation over the areas that I was shaving, could be from the shaving cream, I am not sure what caused it.  I received Ocean Breeze and it had a nice mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion ProGlide razor with flexball technology is an excellent over previous razor. The FlexBall technology helps when shaving under your neck leading up to your chin for a more precise shave. My only two complaint about the razor itself is when shaving my mustache area is that it doesn&#x27;t catch every hair, just one or two right below my nostrils would stay. It could be from the new lubrastrip design, it&#x27;s a little bit larger than previous models or the spacing of the blades. Secondly, the precision trimmer, where you turn the razor around to &#x27;mark up&#x27; I can&#x27;t seem to get it to work properly, maybe I don&#x27;t have the correct angle. It is something I will have to experiment with.</li>
            <li> I despise shaving. It&#x27;s one of the least enjoyable morning tasks imaginable and it seemingly doesn&#x27;t get any easier because I nick myself every single time. That&#x27;s why I prefer to just use a beard trimmer because it&#x27;s much quicker and less painful. But I recently received a Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology to test for free from Gillette through Bzzagent. And to put it simply, this razor is one of the best ones I have ever used. Below is a breakdown of what I liked and disliked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The most notable and important feature that separates this razor from the rest is the FlexBall Technology, so it comes as no surprise that this innovation really stands out. I usually nick myself at least a couple times shaving along my jaw line. No matter what technique I try or how slow I shave, I always end up drawing blood. The new FlexBall solves that problem because it allows the razor to bob, weave and adjust to the contours of my jaw line. I also liked how comfortable the handle felt and sat in my hand when using it. The rubber grips allowed it to be controlled with ease no matter how wet it was. Lastly, the five blades provided a nice, close shave. Most of the time, I have to go over areas multiple times to clean it up even if it&#x27;s just stubble. But this razor chopped down anything in its path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I don&#x27;t grow a real immaculate or rugged beard. It usually takes me a couple months to grow something that resembles anything close to a full beard. But the first time I used this razor, I did so with about a month of growth on my face and didn&#x27;t trim it down at all before shaving. By the time I finished shaving, the wear strip was nearly completely worn down, which is a huge bummer considering the cartridges aren&#x27;t exactly cheap. I would hope that I would be able to get at least four or five shaves out of each razor. My other knock isn&#x27;t really a dislike, but more of a preference. I&#x27;ve used Gillette battery powered razors in the past andI think they provide a much better shave than any manual razor. So while I like this razor, I think it would be that much better if it was battery operated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if there&#x27;s one razor that can change my mind on how I feel about shaving, it&#x27;s this one. And while I still may prefer using a beard trimmer, that may soon change if I ever get my hands on a battery operated power version.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail and I was really surprised at how good it was. I am more of an old school razor type person. This one was smooth and did not pull hairs as it went. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> This razor was generously provided to me by the lovely people at Gillette to try. The razor worked well. I would say it works as well as other Gillette razors and other premium brands. I&#x27;m not sure if the ball helped any, but it didn&#x27;t hurt. I would recommend buying it if you can find replacement cartridges at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I tried this gel. I usually would get rashes and bumps with most creams and gels so I used to use only a electric shaver. After trying this I am confident I can go back to a razor or at least be able to use it once in awhile.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a promotion from the brand. I wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; by it. It is a great razor but I was expecting more. Not any more close of a shave than the other razors I use. Definitely good and worth the money, but didn&#x27;t go &amp;#34;above and beyond&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really big fan of this new generation of the Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology. I had the 1st generation handle and really like the sleek new handle and really like the new black color of the handle itself. I&#x27;ve long been loyal to Gilette for my shaving needs so I continue to get a closer, more comfortable shave with each new product. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for years, especially the original Fusion. I received this as a free promotion from Gillette so huge props to them, they are a fantastic company. I got everything I&#x27;ve come to expect from a Gillette razor - baby smooth shave, no cuts, no snagging or discomfort, and fairly decent life of the blades. This razor is great and will not leave you disappointed. As for the flexball handle - honestly I can leave it. I can&#x27;t say that it truly added anything to the shave versus the previous generation Fusion Proglide razor (not the pulsing one, the regular). Sure it looks cool, but I couldn&#x27;t feel a difference and can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s superior to any of the previous Gillette proglide razors. Either way still a great product and the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li> I Love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Technology and 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care. It leaves my skin smooth and soft, which is not easy for my sensitive skin.  I have been a supporter for over 15 years and will not switch for nothing. I have tried others but nothing else gives me a closer or better shave than a Gillette Razor.</li>
            <li> Price notwithstanding, this is one of the best razors ever to be made. It provides an amazingly close shave without the nicks or redness generally associated with close shaves. The user of this razor with the FlexBall technology only has to provide minimal pressure and the FlexBall does the rest. These replaceable razors usually last a good six weeks before you have to change them, sometimes longer. They also clean out very easily and thoroughly. If I could afford to buy these all the time, I wouldn&#x27;t use any other razor. I was lucky enough to receive a sample from Gillette and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Through BzzAgent and Gillette, I tried Gillette&#x27;s Alpine Clean 2-in-1 Gel and Flexball Razor and found both to make shaving a lot easier. The smell is very fresh and exactly what I would imagine based on the name, but not too strong. The push button has a textured grip so your finger won&#x27;t slip, and when you stop pressing it, the gel stops dispensing.  Any extra gel is easy to clean off by twisting the cap to the locked position and back. The gel gauge is a great feature so I know when it&#x27;s time to pick up another bottle and just to see how much I go through, in general. But you don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to shave because the less you use, the better your shave will be since just a little will give you a good lather. It left my face and neck smooth and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. There are a couple things that could be improved, though. The lathered gel can dry out a little bit so I just apply it to one side of my face at a time, and while you can lock the cap to prevent leaks I think the lock needs be tighter.  The Flexball razor that goes along with it is better than I expected. It gently glides around on a pivot and makes going over my chin and neck much easier, and on short hair it shaves cleanly the first time around. I also have sensitive skin but I haven&#x27;t experienced any nicks or irritation from this razor, which is not something I can always say. But the razor is great on its own because not only does it flex in the right way, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold while shaving because of the rubber grips, size and shape of the handle. Also, the trimmer works very well for me with my medium to slightly thick hair. Overall, this is a very good razor and shaving gel and I would recommend trying them together.</li>
            <li> Besides for a short uncomfortable month when I tried electric razors, I have been using manual razors when it comes time to shave.  I have tried using single, double, triple, quadruple, and five blade razors and prefer the ones with more blades.  Disclaimer* I am a BzzAgent and was offered to try this product for free thanks to Gillette.  I have used the regular Gillette Fusion razors and can speak to the benefits of switching to the Fusion ProGlide.  This one has a pivoting head called FlexBall technology that makes it easier to position and glide the blades across facial contours.  It&#x27;s not that it will drastically change positioning when you glide it along your face but rather makes it easier to hold the razor at some of those tougher angles.  The precision trimmer on the back of the razor is also slightly improved, now having a little comb guard.  I find it easier to align my sideburns with fewer strokes and it is easier to rinse out compared to the Fusion.  Besides for that, it is basically a good manual razor that keeps your skin taught and blades moving without much tugging. I tend to grow my facial hair out and shave once a week and by doing so, I notice that the lubricating strip begins to fade right after the first shave and typically wears down in about four shaves.  To account for this, I worked a pre-shave oil and a moisturizing aftershave into my routine.  I will be back for more of cartridge refills and will hold on to the Fusion ProGlide as my primary razor.</li>
            <li> Great product by Gillette. I was able to get a close shave with less effort than with my older Gillette Fusion. Adjusts to face contours for a great shave.  Will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I received this Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor as a promotion for my true review,  Overall not bad.  I have to shave everyday for being in the army so having a good razor is really important.  First of all it the Flexball Technology seems to work, it really moves around my jaw line a lot smoother.  However, I can see the mechanics of this razor not lasting long and I don&#x27;t know if I would want to replace the whole razor all the time but so far has held up.  No razor burn and left with a close shave.  It is. harder to clean out the hair with each swipe.  The other gillette brand I used was a lot easier to clean out.  I would recommend this product and may buy again</li>
            <li> I really loved the product it gave me the closest shave with no razor burn that I could not get with any other shaver , my wife has actullay token over my razor because she liked the close shave it gave her.</li>
            <li> I was seriously impressed with this guy!  I should mention that I received this through Gillette&#x27;s promotion on BzzAgent, but that does not affect my opinion.  The flexball technology was really cool and allowed for the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I didn&#x27;t even notice the little blade on the back for precision trims until the second time I used it, but it was very effective and came in handy for getting edges.  I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors for years, but now that I&#x27;ve tried this, I doubt I&#x27;ll be able to go back.  This thing was amazing and I recommend it to anyone who likes to look great without the pain.</li>
            <li> Closest shave ever.  I highly recommend this razor.  Very smooth and it does glide on your skin.</li>
            <li> Great Razor and a great price!  You&#x27;ve got to pick up this one - it not only promises a smoother, closer shave with fewer nicks, but it delivers</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette sending me a Fusion proglide with flexball technology, I can finally stop buying the cheap razors that only last for half a shave and/or cut me several times. The way the 5 blade head runs down your face makes the shave so smooth and comfortable not to mention it get a majority on the first pass. For someone like me who wants to look his best at all times it&#x27;s important to me to be properly lined up , the fusion proglide accomplishes this with its edging blade. That way the head flexes around the curves of your face is definitely a nice chance. This will be the last razor I ever own that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology. At first I was skeptical that a little ball underneath the blade cartridge could really make a difference in my shave. Boy was I wrong. The shaving experience is much smoother than with my previous razor, especially on the rougher parts of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also really impressed by how sturdy this razor&#x27;s handle is. With five blades packed up top in the cartridge, you&#x27;ve gotta have a solid grip on things. The rubber grips make it easy to maneuver the razor in different angles and it&#x27;s easy to hold, even in the shower.</li>
            <li> great razor great shave look no further</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t actually the first time I&#x27;ve recieved this paticular brand of razor. I didn&#x27;t expect to recieve one again and with gel! Last time I sort of skimped on shaving my face with it I got a family member to do it but this time I felt like doing it myself so I gave it a go. It&#x27;s a pretty good shave I didn&#x27;t cut myself once. The gel wasn&#x27;t entirely needed but it made shaving a breeze as I wasn&#x27;t even sure I was cutting hair from my face it was that painless and seamless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no battery in it I noticed. Last one was battery powered but this one is not and that makes sense to me. I mean I like vibrating objects as much as the next guy but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s my razor that needs to do that while I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than the barbershop? Well. This is a better razor but they are better at cutting hair. And getting rid of it is their problem. Now if you could buy a tiny vacuum for these razors we might be onto something revolutionary. Really good razor though. Probably should buy one for my father.</li>
            <li> After getting my Fusion ProGlide Razor from Gillette, for free thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent&#x27;s partnership, I have not stopped using it. The razor is professionally engineered to perform effortlessly in even the most stubborn of stubbles or delicate skin. I fully recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product! It gives you a really close and smooth shave.  I would recommend this to everyone.  The Gillette 2 in1 shaving gel goes great with it as well</li>
            <li> I recieved this from bzzagent and I was really excited when I was offered to try out this product. I have seen it in the store and I was sent one before by BZZAGENT and I really enjoyed it. So when I was offered to try it again but with the shave gel I was  very pleased to do so! The shaver itself is very nice. It moves with the structure of your face and curves. Very close shave by it self without the shaving gel. It&#x27;s not so stiff and I am not afraid that I am going to cut myself because like I self it moves with the contours of your face. its really amazing. The shaving gel was really nice it smelled great very fresh and masculine. The only thing is when I used it on my face after I shaved my skin felt really dry and kinda tough. I didn&#x27;t really enjoy that. But I just washed my face afterwards. All in all this set is really nice and any man would enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. I have not every had a razor that has given me such a closer shave. The razor seemed to move with every curve on my face. It has been 3 days since i shaved and the hair is just now getting to where i need to shave again. Before this razor i was shaving every other day. Only down fall to the razor is that the razor grabbed my goatee every time i was shaving near it. the longer goatee hair got caught in the roller ball.</li>
            <li> Alright so I have tried a lot of razors, I typically go for the cheaper brands because I didn&#x27;t think there was enough difference between a cheap razor and higher priced razor to warrant the extra money, boy was I wrong!  I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor from Gillette as a promotional item to try and review and I&#x27;ve got to say, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse facial hair and when I buy razors I use them once, maybe twice if I am feeling daring, and then throw them away.  Not the case with this razor, I am on my 3rd shave and it is just as smooth as can be with no pulling or razor burn on my neck which some razors will do on the first use.  I love how this leaves my skin baby smooth virtually on the first pass and the way the head of the razor moves with the contours of my face is amazing!  I saw the commercials and thought it was just another gimmick, boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> I got this razor and I am very happy with the results thus far.  It does provide a very close shave and contours to your face.  I have not gotten any nicks or cuts from this razor so  far.  Pair this with the Pro Glide shave cream, and it will be one of the best shaves you have ever gotten!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Pro Glide razor and 2in1 Shave Gel as a BzzAgent at no charge to give it a whirl&lt;br /&gt;Have to say, since I usually buy my razors at the dollar store, that it is a very cool shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have had not cuts or nicks with this blade. I was always reaching for the cut face supplies before but not since using the Pro Glide&lt;br /&gt;I have tried some tricky maneuvers that would have sliced me before but not now&lt;br /&gt;The pricing on razors is what always send me to the dollar store however this razor is lasting a long time with its 5 blades and will most likely surpass the value I thought I was getting with the cheapest ones&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a coarse beard and have used this razor for three weeks every day and it is still performing&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this is a quality product&lt;br /&gt;Although pricey I believe it will outperform the dollar store razors in a cost per week comparison</li>
            <li> Loved that the Fusion ProGlide was smooth and provided a comfortable shave especially when I used it with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care. Never did I cut or nick myself because it moved around my face lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care was not messy or gooey which was great for not cleaning my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Gillette was kind enough to include me in a promotion where I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor.  I typically use a 2-blade razor and have problems with stubble burn.  This ProGlide razor is the bomb, I get the smoothest shaves and I never seem to nick myself up like I do with the 2 blade razor.  I tell all my friends about this razor, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  I see that Gillette is offering a coupon by purchasing through Amazon.  This is a superb quality razor, that gives you the closest, smoothest comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Not sure what else I can say.</li>
            <li> I got one of these free from Gillette to review. I have previously tested the vibrating version. The two are almost identical except for this model doesn&#x27;t vibrate and doesn&#x27;t take a battery. I love the razor, it is a smooth shave and is good for sensitive skin. If I could change anything on this razor it would be the handle. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker but the electric model is a little bit more ergonomic and doesn&#x27;t slip out of wet hands. I own many different razors but the Fusion model is one of the better ones. It usually serves as my go to razor. The blades are cheaper but still expensive overall. Replacement blades should be cheaper than the razor itself, otherwise, why not just buy a new razor every time. Overall, you&#x27;ll get a great, smooth shave. I also received the ocean breeze 2 in 1 shave gel. The bottle is very cool because it has an indicator to tell you how much is left in the can. I didn&#x27;t like the ocean breeze scent because it was very strong. It also stung a little bit more than other plain gels I&#x27;ve used. I would like to try an unscented can just to compare but it did leave my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette. They sent me the razor along with shaving cream. I&#x27;ve been using both for about 3 weeks now and I do like the feel of the shave. The blades are sharp so I don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure to my skin and the extra lubricant strip helps provide extra protection. I&#x27;m not sure how the flexball feature is beneficial yet mainly because it seems like a non-issue to me. I&#x27;ve been simply using this razor to shave my face so perhaps the flexball is useful if you&#x27;re using it on other parts of your body. With the shaving gel, I haven&#x27;t noticed a substantial difference between Gillette&#x27;s gel versus some other brands. However, I have noticed that post-shave, my skin doesn&#x27;t seem too dry.</li>
            <li> Let me start with I got this product for free through bzzagent. I have been a Gillette customer for years now. And I always have been happy with their product. But I do have to say the flexball is great. I feel like I get a close shave with out having to go over the same area 2 or 3 times. I have never had an issue with the blade going dull quickly. I give my razor a quick rinse before each pass and that helps keep the blades free of hair and shaving cream. I also love the double sided razor the single blade helps me get those pesky areas that the 5 other blades just can&#x27;t reach.  I also love how the rubber grip handle doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve used. For a while I decided to stop shaving all together and just go with a scruffy face and beard trimmer because it was far too difficult to get a good clean shave. I would constantly find small patches that were missed, even though I went over that area several times. But then I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor free as part of a promotion from Gillette and now shaving is a breeze. I have not one had a missed spot since I started using the Gillette Fusion Proglide about a month ago. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use a different razor.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a promotion as a BzzAgent and this is a fantastic razor.  It is the only razor I will use.  Nice and smooth and leaves a nice clean shave.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this razor as much as I do any Gillette razor. I don&#x27;t see much difference in quality of shave. This is a great razor if you have problems with cutting yourself while shaving. It dose glide over surfaces very well, all in all this razor does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Best shave I have ever had made blade slid with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Yeah i didnt think that this blade would be so efective since all razor are all electric specialized for sentive skin like the ones of gillete that tried that past , but i see that i dont need all that technology for a great shave.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  I almost always get a cut or knick and have patches that no razor seems to be able to cut.  I still shave though.  The best shaves I get are still from a barber but the next best thing is the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology razor.  I got to try it free thanks to BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get a nick and cut free shave for one of the few times ever.  I have been using it for about 4 weeks now and the shave is incredible.  I am on my second bleade since using it and have been shaving roughly 5 to 6 times a week.  This razor and blade rock.  A must try for all shavers including ones who think that their&#x27;s is better.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty decent job. I did like the razor, not sure about the breakthrough tech that much. I think that it could be improved upon perhaps adding battery power like they did years ago with the mach 3, as then you would have both the rollerball and the  and the vibration to help with the shave. But that is just my opinion. But all in all a decent enough shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the folks at Gillette, I recently had the opportunity to try the new Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall handle technology in combination with the new Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 shave gel.  They claim that the FlexBall razor paired with their new shave gel provides maximum contact and a closer shave in each stroke.  After about a month of use, here are my impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel: the sample that I received came in “Active Sport” scent, which is an awesome aroma.  It was subtle but appealing—just the right amount of fragrance.  Even more impressive was the cooling sensation that I felt immediately upon application.  It has a chilling tingle that makes the shaving experience much more enjoyable—the best part is that it lingers after rinsing off the gel providing comfort and moisture long after the shave is done.  What I found most fascinating was the innovative design of the container—it’s plastic with a viewing window which means no more rust rings on the counter or running out of shave gel at the wrong moment!  It also comes with a unique twisting top that blocks the opening should you ever need to pack the gel for travel—which I did during my testing—and it kept my toiletry bag mess-free, something I can’t say with other shave gels that I have traveled with in the past.  The only negative to this is the claim of “post shave goo” on the top of the container.  Though it was an improvement over other gels I have used, the foam crud that accumulates was still present post-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades: this is where this product really shines.  The claim of maximum contact and a closer shave in one stroke are no exaggeration.  My first shave with the new blades required just one pass over each area of my face and the end-result was the smoothest shave I have ever had—not having to pass over the same area multiple times made it an incredibly quick shave as well! I credit the lubrication strip included on the cartridges as well as the new shave gel which goes on smooth and easy.  Throughout the entire shave I could feel the layer of protection that remained on my skin stroke after stroke—no nicks, cuts, or razor burn after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: the Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razor paired with ProGlide 2-in-1 shave gel is a package that lives up to all of the hype.  Pricing on this shaving system, including refill cartridges, is comparable to other products but the value of what you get for your hard earned dollar goes further with Gillette.  This combo of razor and gel is truly the best a man can get.</li>
            <li> This is probably a gimmick, but the razor itself is great.  I am not sold that the swivel head really made much of a difference, but the razor was a good one... so who cares?</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide w/Flex ball from BzzAgent &amp; Gillette and let me say that I have always used Gillette&#x27;s for as long as I can remember and before this free sample I had the last Gillette Fusion Powerglide and I think the Fusion before that and this Flexball model gives you the same GREAT shave.  Would I go out of my way to buy the Flexball model over my last Powerglide?  NO, my opinion is that I don&#x27;t see the advantage of the Flexball as of my 2nd shave, did I get a great close shave? YES but I really can&#x27;t 100% say it was do to the Flexball, I got a great shave from my older Fusion.  Would I go out and buy this razor if I needed a new razor? YES, as I said gives a great shave and I really like the feel of this new Fusion, to me it seems like it&#x27;s a little heaver which I LOVE feels very high end and solid in your hand.  If I could change anything I think I would like it ether a little longer or a little fatter but it really does feel great in your hand.  It&#x27;s been about 9 hours since I shaved and my face still feels very smooth and with the Razor Gillette included a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care shaveing gel and tell you what it feels very nice on my skin.  I had changed to higher end shaving creams and a beaver brush over some time ago and I had sworn off over the counter can shaving creams and gels but after trying this free sample seems Gillette has come along way, It doesn&#x27;t foam up my face like my other product with a brush but I got a close, smooth, non cut shave and skin did not feel dry, so I think I might use it for travel when I don&#x27;t feel like lugging the heavy brush.  All in all you can&#x27;t go wrong with a Gillette Fusion for their great shave, sharp (pun intended) looking product and willingness to build a better razor.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice now and even though I got a great shave both times I&#x27;m not sold yet on the usefullness of the Flexball, maybe after a few more shaves but I still would go out and buyone if you need a new razor!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor for free as part of a promotion run by Gillette through BzzAgent to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used Gillette razors because they&#x27;ve always worked well for me and I&#x27;ve never had any complaints. The Fusion ProGlide is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the prominent feature: the FlexBall. The FlexBell allows the razor to swivel and pivot to and fro as needed to catch all of those awkward angles around my chin. It leaves me with a smooth-as-silk face each time I shave. Huzzah for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is sturdy and has a good balance to it. It&#x27;s definitely well constructed and screams high quality. It&#x27;s certainly not your cheap, plastic disposable razor handle! The rubber grips ensure I don&#x27;t drop the razor or slip while shaving, even when I occasionally shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp blades are what make or break good shaves, and the Fusion ProGlide&#x27;s five blades don&#x27;t disappoint. The gel strip ensures a smooth shave and is always a good indicator of wear and tear on the blades and lets me know when it&#x27;s time to change cartridges. The lone trimming razor on the other side stays consistently sharp and allows me to trim my sideburns with ease. Overall, the blades last for two or three dozen shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor that, in my opinion, grants it only four out of five stars, is that it is not the Fusion ProGlide Power razor. I&#x27;ve tried the battery-powered razor and I would always choose that over the manual, battery-less razor. Simply because that version exists and is superior in every way to this razor, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor will never get five stars in my book. But for all the reasons I noted above, this is a great razor, battery-powered or not.</li>
            <li> Received my Gillette Fusion Proglide razor and matching shaving gel about two weeks ago in a trial by Gillette. In the past five years, I&#x27;ve used a combination of Gillette shavers, Dollar Shaving Club, and Harry&#x27;s. Here&#x27;s how the three brands compare to each other:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette: Best shave - the Fusion Proglide gets it right the first time around - it&#x27;s extremely sharp and accurate. It costs much more, but if you&#x27;re in a hurry, it&#x27;s a very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dollar Shaving Club - Good blades (I&#x27;m comparing to the 4 blades). It&#x27;s not as sharp and does not hug your face, but it&#x27;s much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry&#x27;s - Good blades (between the DSC and Gillette), the plastic is flexible but not feel as study as the DSC and Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially compared to the DSC, I don&#x27;t have to shave several times to get a very good, smooth feel. Paired with pre-shaving oil and the shaving gel, it&#x27;s a pretty clean shave. The ball works very well to get the weird corners of my face - I usually get cut, especially with my boxy face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overal, the Gillette Fusion Proglide is a very good razor - sharp and accurate. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive but flexball makes shaving much easier and quicker in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette® Fusion ProGlide Razor &amp; 2-in-1 Shave Gel but I am a bit dissatisfied with the results. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I normally use an electric razor and I get much better results with my electric razor. Additionally, if I go for too long without shaving, the ProGlide feels like it is tearing the whiskers out of my face.</li>
            <li> Good razor I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. It gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> When I first seen this razor I was like I wonder if that works. I received one from BzzAgent and what can I say I was not disapointed. I get the same great long-lasting shave and long-lasting razor blade with the new flex ball technology which I thought might just be a gimmick but turns out it really does help with the contours of my face. So all in all im glad o was finally able to add it to my collection.</li>
            <li> Great, long lasting razor. Shaves great but it&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;tall&amp;#34; for narrow areas around the nose. I received this for free as a promotion from Gillette - Thanks!</li>
            <li> State of the shavers art. Cost of blades could pay for a Country Club membership, but if you really want the closest shave and easiest, this is likely it.</li>
            <li> I have been using various 5 blade razors and most function about the same.  This is no exception and works well, but does seem to dull rather fast like others.  I know humidity plays a large role and since moving to Oregon razors do seem to dull faster.  The major difference is the ball, it does help with getting closer in same areas.  I like the single blade on back as well for a few spots I don&#x27;t want to drag 5 across.  Now if they could make a blade that lasts longer here, I&#x27;d be in love.  I was sent this razor as part of a promotion for the brand.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette I was able to try their Fusion Proglide Manual Razor with Flexball Technology for free. This razor produces a very smooth and close shave. Gillette in my opinion has always produced high quality razors, this one is not different. The Flexball technology allows you to shave with fewer passes minimizing irritation. I have very sensitive skin most razor I have use cause burning and breakouts when finish but Gellette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide with Flexball does a good job minimizing the burning and breakouts. My only complaint is the cost of refills but this can be minimized if you keep your eye out for sales.</li>
            <li> I love Gillette razors because I am susceptible to razor bumps and have been able to avoid them since I switched.  I&#x27;ve used an older power razor but got the chance to use this one for free through Buzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, its great.  The flex ball is useful since I shave my face and and my head.  And the blade is typical Gillette quality. The handle also has a nice feel.  I&#x27;m docking it a star because I really miss the vibrating handle so I&#x27;ll be going back to the powered version.  But I have no problem recommending this one.</li>
            <li> It works smoothly, I like it very much.</li>
