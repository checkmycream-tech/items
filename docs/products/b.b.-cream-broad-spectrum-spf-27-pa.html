            <li>The B. B. Cream made my skin look so good</li>

            <li>love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely AMAZING product --</li>
            <li>I am the kind of girl who always wears foundation to cover skin imperfections.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s supposed to blend into every skin tone, it&#x27;s kind of a joke.</li>
            <li>It blends in perfectly with my skin, even though it came out of the packet looking much darker than my skin does, it adjusts to the color of my face and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>but you have to spend more than 2 seconds rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>As someone who is always trying to find the next best thing - my search is over.  </li>
            <li>My favorite bb cream.</li>
            <li>Although, I have to say it&#x27;s one of the better combo products I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>Maybe a brush would be better?</li>
            <li>&quot; some people really love</li>
            <li>It also has a shimmer/sparkle to it which I love.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth with a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>(I do use a beauty sponge to apply) and I love that it is SPF 27.  </li>
            <li>no, this is my favorite product</li>
            <li>Really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for quite some time now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Boscia for about one year and love it, but the price has more than doubled in that time.  </li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>I Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I tried the product the very next day and was Amazed at how wonderful my skin looked.</li>
            <li>I Love it</li>
            <li>I just apply it right out of the shower and brush on some finishing powder and mascara and am good to go.  </li>
            <li>I ventured into the land of BB creams with the cheapest stuff I could find (I should have know better, but I&#x27;m cheap).  </li>
            <li>It offers great coverage, without looking \\&quot;cakey\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and the color of the face it looks uniform but is a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised that this one does do fairly well in a kind of magical way--goes on one color then really blends well to even out my skintone without looking overly made up.</li>
            <li>but I mix it with a little oil of Olay and its perfect.</li>
            <li>; I have fair skin with yellow undertones &amp; this blends in great for a natural look.</li>
            <li>I do apply a light powder over it to set.</li>
            <li>&quot; light category.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light on my skin and as promised, somehow it matched my complexion (honey light-medium).</li>
            <li>Just dab it all around and smooth it in until it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Sephora clerk that helped me was young and had gorgeous skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a full face of makeup since I work out a lot, nor do I like the look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend this 100 % and can&#x27;t wait for my full size bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Full coverage w/</li>
            <li>I really like that it doubles as sunscreen!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great do-everything product for those that want a little coverage and an even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I ended up with two huge beige blotches on my cheeks that needed to be wiped off straight away.</li>
            <li>It is light and feels like nothing is on although it really evens the tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an obvious shimmer, though, which is nice</li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy it because of the price but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>&quot; approach to color is never quite right.</li>
            <li>A friend shared a sample of this makeup with me and I needed to have it right away.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with BB cream</li>
            <li>But the first time I wore this my acne literally disappeared overnight, like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how it adjusts to my skin tone, so I am not constantly changing foundation colors with each season.</li>
            <li>My first time using it</li>
            <li>I noticed it covered everything pretty well and evens out my skin tone</li>
            <li>I got a couple free sample packets of this from Sephora when I bought some other makeup items, and even though I didn&#x27;t buy this specific product, I have to write a review because I loved it so much!</li>
            <li>Plus I spent 4 hours in the bright sunlight yesterday on a cloudless day and my face was not burnt</li>
            <li>You have to apply moderately at first to see how much you will need and it truly will adjust to your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much coverage comes out of this cream when it&#x27;s pretty much transparent.</li>
            <li>I love the slight shimmer in it, particularly for summer, as it also helps mildly</li>
            <li>for application, you need to work fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also read, however, a lot of reviews of this by people who said that this made them breakout really fast.</li>
            <li>Really evens out skin tone.  </li>
            <li>so the color works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed since I use the B.B. Cream I don&#x27;t use as much foundation.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>and this really does conceal them and almost makes you \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>However, the self-adjusting color is too dark for my fair skin tone, so I do mix it with a light foundation to tone down the color a bit.  </li>
            <li>My almost two year old granddaughter doesn&#x27;t point at my face and say oh boo boo anymore. ;)</li>
            <li>and I am very hesitant to use new products for fear of reactions.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can apply it in the morning and 12 hours later it still looks fresh.</li>
            <li>It goes on light, doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and works as a great base.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin, and this has caused no irritation whatsoever</li>
            <li>For the first time in weeks I could go out in public and not be embarrassed.</li>
            <li>I live in a very warm climate, so I hate wearing heavy foundation, but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>no heavy masky greasy face&lt;br</li>
            <li>a mature woman with some skin cancer issues on my face.  </li>
            <li>The natural treatments I&#x27;m using for the cancer are also making my face detox (break out).</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a store near you, you can always order it online from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I totally disagree with the other 1 star review, it blends in just fine</li>
            <li>First, I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it comes out of the bottle white but actually gives you flesh colored coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not for the lightest of light skins, nor anything between medium and dark.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Hyrdoxatone BB cream, as it essentially functions the same, but with higher SPF.</li>
            <li>, that was a major accomplishment.</li>
            <li>Also, the main reason I bought it is because Boscia is paraben free and also free of a bunch of other horrible chemicals that you find in most beauty products.</li>
            <li>The product is a little steep for the pricing but worth it.</li>
            <li>It is only $38 for the 1.75oz from other retailers, $54 is waaaay too much!</li>
            <li>, my only complaint is the price, but it seems that anything that really works costs you a pretty penny.</li>
            <li>I put this on with a little under eye concealer and powder and it gives me just as much coverage as MAC Studio Fix foundation!</li>
            <li>She told me she used the Boscia B.B. Cream Broad Spectrum and mineral makeup, the same makeup I used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also got a slight shimmer to it which really hides any imperfections.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thick and doesn&#x27;t blend well at all.</li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin</li>

            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The price is high but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And since it is so quick drying, it is also a rather matte product, so not good for dry skin</li>
            <li> I mean REALLY white, so I assumed that the coloration would be extremely off when I put it on and that I&#x27;d have to get rid of it right away, But it didn&#x27;t it actually looked amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay moist for long</li>
            <li> It can be particularly hard for me to find skincare products that look natural on my Asian skin.</li>
            <li> It takes a few seconds to blend into the skin, but once it is properly applied, you are left with a hydrated, even, radiant complexion.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not worth buying it only to find out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: it contains dimethicone and other silicones, similar to other BB creams and products that \\&quot;protect.\\</li>
            <li> Coverage is not much.</li>
            <li> Thanks and sorry this review was so long.</li>
            <li> Tinted sunscreen has always been out of the question due to lack of coverage and greasiness.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re not sure, go back and get another.</li>
            <li> I got the sample of this in my Birchbox and I was really skeptical of it when I first tried it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not oily like some other BB creams.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a really dark colored creme when it comes out of the tube/bottle</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am really Impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use my combination skin experiences fewer breakouts in my trouble zones but is still hydrated on my dry patches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy, but I don&#x27;t have to use as much of it as other products.</li>
            <li> a few tries, but every time I used it I broke out with small bumps.</li>
            <li> I mean every single time, someone comments on my skin when I begin to use it again.</li>
            <li> If I run out and go without for a few days, people always comment when I begin to use it again.  </li>
            <li> This product covers up all of my redness and blotchiness without looking heavy.  </li>
            <li> I wear it almost everyday and the tube lasts almost 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> but it was harsh and kept causing breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The product can be found at a less expensive price at a major retail cosmetic store.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure what to think.</li>
            <li> tiny bit of concealer to touch up any difficult areas if needed and my foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was so bad I was embarrassed to go out in public because my makeup wasn&#x27;t even coming close to covering all the breakouts and cancer spots.</li>
            <li> I have tons of broken blood vessles, along with some blotchiness</li>
            <li> and she told me she actually has some very bad acne scars.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent color; I have fair skin with yellow undertones &amp; this blends in great for a natural look. The product is a little steep for the pricing but worth it.</li>
            <li> I am the kind of girl who always wears foundation to cover skin imperfections. Tinted sunscreen has always been out of the question due to lack of coverage and greasiness. This stuff is amazing. First, I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it comes out of the bottle white but actually gives you flesh colored coverage. It&#x27;s also got a slight shimmer to it which really hides any imperfections. I cannot believe how much coverage comes out of this cream when it&#x27;s pretty much transparent. I totally disagree with the other 1 star review, it blends in just fine but you have to spend more than 2 seconds rubbing it in. I put this on with a little under eye concealer and powder and it gives me just as much coverage as MAC Studio Fix foundation! I have no idea how this is possible but I&#x27;m telling you it&#x27;s awesome! Also, the main reason I bought it is because Boscia is paraben free and also free of a bunch of other horrible chemicals that you find in most beauty products. Amazing stuff, my only complaint is the price, but it seems that anything that really works costs you a pretty penny. No pun intended!</li>
            <li> As someone who is always trying to find the next best thing - my search is over.  Aside from lip gloss or perfume I DO NOT rate cosmetics 5 stars but this product is truly the exception.  You have to apply moderately at first to see how much you will need and it truly will adjust to your skin tone.  I just apply it right out of the shower and brush on some finishing powder and mascara and am good to go.  It&#x27;s a great do-everything product for those that want a little coverage and an even skin tone.  A+++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this stuff zero stars if I could. It&#x27;s super thick and doesn&#x27;t blend well at all. I ended up with two huge beige blotches on my cheeks that needed to be wiped off straight away. DO NOT PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and the color of the face it looks uniform but is a bit greasy. Coverage is not much.</li>
            <li> This is the best hypo allergic tinted moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li> My favorite bb cream. It is light and feels like nothing is on although it really evens the tone. I do apply a light powder over it to set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit undecided on this product. This is my first experience with BB cream and I&#x27;m not sure what to think. My makeup routine? Moisturizer, some mineral powder here and there and concealer here and there. That&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t like a full face of makeup since I work out a lot, nor do I like the look.&lt;br /&gt;This product has the same problem that a lot of tinted moisturizers have: it can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s a skincare product or a makeup product, and the \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; approach to color is never quite right. Although, I have to say it&#x27;s one of the better combo products I&#x27;ve come across. Even though it&#x27;s supposed to blend into every skin tone, it&#x27;s kind of a joke. It&#x27;s definitely not for the lightest of light skins, nor anything between medium and dark. I guess it falls into that \\&quot;fairly\\&quot; light category.&lt;br /&gt;As for application, you need to work fast. It doesn&#x27;t stay moist for long so you have to do your best to get it blended right away. I&#x27;d definitely use your finger since a sponge is going to absorb all of that product. Maybe a brush would be better? And since it is so quick drying, it is also a rather matte product, so not good for dry skin types.&lt;br /&gt;If you like the feeling of your face being protected during the day, of having an spf in your makeup and something that&#x27;s rather matte, then this is for you (providing that the color works). If you lean your face on your hand it&#x27;s definitely not going to come off like a liquid makeup would. If you can, I&#x27;d definitely get a sample before you buy. And if you&#x27;re not sure, go back and get another. For the price, it&#x27;s not worth buying it only to find out it&#x27;s not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: it contains dimethicone and other silicones, similar to other BB creams and products that \\&quot;protect.\\&quot; some people really love/hate these ingredients so I thought I&#x27;d mention it.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely AMAZING product -- absolutely brilliant-- but you can get it for $38 at Sephora. Don&#x27;t buy at this price.</li>
            <li> It is light on my skin and as promised, somehow it matched my complexion (honey light-medium). It still looks like I have something on but it protects the skin, hydrates, as well as covers the appearance of blemishes. It lives up to its promises; however, I find it too pricey. I prefer the Hyrdoxatone BB cream, as it essentially functions the same, but with higher SPF.</li>
            <li> I got a couple free sample packets of this from Sephora when I bought some other makeup items, and even though I didn&#x27;t buy this specific product, I have to write a review because I loved it so much! It blends in perfectly with my skin, even though it came out of the packet looking much darker than my skin does, it adjusts to the color of my face and looks amazing. It also has a shimmer/sparkle to it which I love. It&#x27;s not an obvious shimmer, though, which is nice so it&#x27;s not too distracting and it looks natural. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I gave this product a few tries, but every time I used it I broke out with small bumps.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 2 years. If I run out and go without for a few days, people always comment when I begin to use it again.  I mean every single time, someone comments on my skin when I begin to use it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is REALLY great....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got the sample of this in my Birchbox and I was really skeptical of it when I first tried it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really dark colored creme when it comes out of the tube/bottle and I have really white skin, I mean REALLY white, so I assumed that the coloration would be extremely off when I put it on and that I&#x27;d have to get rid of it right away, But it didn&#x27;t it actually looked amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It self corrected to match my skin in just a minute or two. Needless to say I am really Impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also read, however, a lot of reviews of this by people who said that this made them breakout really fast. But the first time I wore this my acne literally disappeared overnight, like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this 100 % and can&#x27;t wait for my full size bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Just started using this product after a friend recommended it. It goes on smooth with a nice matte finish. Not oily like some other BB creams. The product can be found at a less expensive price at a major retail cosmetic store.</li>
            <li> Great, great, great product. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and my skin looks great when I use it.  However, the self-adjusting color is too dark for my fair skin tone, so I do mix it with a light foundation to tone down the color a bit.  I don&#x27;t have problems blending it (I do use a beauty sponge to apply) and I love that it is SPF 27.  The moisturizer works well and my skin feels great when I use this product.  The price is high but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wandered into Sephora on a lunch break and a Boscia rep happened to show me this product.  I have very dry and sensitive skin and I am very hesitant to use new products for fear of reactions.  I gave this product a try and was amazed.  It takes a few seconds to blend into the skin, but once it is properly applied, you are left with a hydrated, even, radiant complexion.  This product covers up all of my redness and blotchiness without looking heavy.  In fact, it looks like I am wearing no make up whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;I have worn this BB cream every day ever since.  I just bought my second bottle last week!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found since.....no, this is my favorite product ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some complaints about blending...use your fingers!  Just dab it all around and smooth it in until it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff feels weightless and is TOTALLY NOT GREASY.  Plus I spent 4 hours in the bright sunlight yesterday on a cloudless day and my face was not burnt AND i wasn&#x27;t all shiny and melty.  I live in a very warm climate, so I hate wearing heavy foundation, but this stuff is amazing.  Full coverage w/ no heavy masky greasy face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have VERY sensitive skin, and this has caused no irritation whatsoever and I&#x27;ve used it daily for a month now.</li>
            <li> A friend shared a sample of this makeup with me and I needed to have it right away. Couldn&#x27;t get it from Boscia and couldn&#x27;t get it from a local store so Amazon to the rescue. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.  Really evens out skin tone.  It is a little thick but I mix it with a little oil of Olay and its perfect.</li>
            <li> Blends with skin and give a neat look</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for quite some time now.  Great for the skin and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome-- I wear it almost everyday and the tube lasts almost 4-5 months. It&#x27;s a little pricy, but I don&#x27;t have to use as much of it as other products. Great coverage! I love how it adjusts to my skin tone, so I am not constantly changing foundation colors with each season. Whoo hoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Boscia for about one year and love it, but the price has more than doubled in that time.  What&#x27;s up with that??</li>
            <li> I ventured into the land of BB creams with the cheapest stuff I could find (I should have know better, but I&#x27;m cheap).  It was okay but it was harsh and kept causing breakouts.  I did my research and found this.  I LOVE it!  It is absolutely worth the money.  It goes on light, doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and works as a great base.  I have very fair skin so the color works very well for me.  However, don&#x27;t buy it off of here.  It is only $38 for the 1.75oz from other retailers, $54 is waaaay too much!</li>
            <li> I Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a mature woman with some skin cancer issues on my face.  The natural treatments I&#x27;m using for the cancer are also making my face detox (break out). My skin was so bad I was embarrassed to go out in public because my makeup wasn&#x27;t even coming close to covering all the breakouts and cancer spots. I mustered the courage to go to Sephora and ask the ladies for help. The Sephora clerk that helped me was young and had gorgeous skin. She told me she used the Boscia B.B. Cream Broad Spectrum and mineral makeup, the same makeup I used. I commented on her skin and she told me she actually has some very bad acne scars. I looked even closer and all I saw was Perfect skin and at that point I was sold on the product. I tried the product the very next day and was Amazed at how wonderful my skin looked. For the first time in weeks I could go out in public and not be embarrassed. The B. B. Cream made my skin look so good I felt like I could have gone out without any foundation on my face. I have also noticed since I use the B.B. Cream I don&#x27;t use as much foundation. My first time using it I noticed it covered everything pretty well and evens out my skin tone, that was a major accomplishment. This product stays where you put it. I can apply it in the morning and 12 hours later it still looks fresh. The temperatures have been in the upper 90&#x27;s and I can be outside and don&#x27;t feel like this product is sliding off my face.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter was astonished at how good my skin looked . My almost two year old granddaughter doesn&#x27;t point at my face and say oh boo boo anymore. ;)&lt;br /&gt;My routine is as follows; wash my face, use my cancer treatment, moisturize, primer, Boscia B. B. Cream, tiny bit of concealer to touch up any difficult areas if needed and my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my Boscia B. B. Cream at Sephora for $38. If you don&#x27;t have a store near you, you can always order it online from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product 100 stars if I could. I Love it and I highly recommend it. Thanks and sorry this review was so long.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. It offers great coverage, without looking \\&quot;cakey\\&quot;. I have rosacea and it actually provides enough coverage to wear by itself. I have tons of broken blood vessles, along with some blotchiness and this really does conceal them and almost makes you \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. I was hesitant to buy it because of the price but it is well worth it. I really like that it doubles as sunscreen!! I really love Boscia products!!</li>
            <li> It can be particularly hard for me to find skincare products that look natural on my Asian skin. Pleasantly surprised that this one does do fairly well in a kind of magical way--goes on one color then really blends well to even out my skintone without looking overly made up. I love the slight shimmer in it, particularly for summer, as it also helps mildly contour/highlight my face shape. After a few weeks of use my combination skin experiences fewer breakouts in my trouble zones but is still hydrated on my dry patches. Wish it were easier to rub in evenly, thus the star deduction.</li>
