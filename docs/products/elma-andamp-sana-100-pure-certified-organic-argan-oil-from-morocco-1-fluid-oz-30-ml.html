            <li>This oil is so amazing!</li>
            <li>and this oil does amazing things with it!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I even use it in my own shorter hair for styling!  </li>
            <li>And best of all for the first time in my life I have overheard people commenting on how beautiful my hair is!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value for the money, fair trade, and you&#x27;re getting 100% argon oil.</li>
            <li>This is every bit as good; it&#x27;s organic; and it&#x27;s a great price.  </li>
            <li>Also, I use the ROSE WATER from this seller and it has also done wonders!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and I will buy more of it.</li>
            <li>I love this and fully expect I will use it always :D</li>
            <li>Love this mix, feels great on the skin!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses or anything pleasant, but rather nutty.</li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as desired but it serves it&#x27;s purpose and portable bottle</li>
            <li>How do I know if the argan oil is any good?  </li>
            <li>good for winter elbows</li>
            <li>how good it is for your skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The good review is that it felt good on my skin...</li>
            <li>I bought one bottle loved it</li>
            <li>I also think the oil is a good price.</li>
            <li>I bought  this oil because the price was really good</li>
            <li>a try because the price was good.</li>
            <li>I did not expect it to be so good.</li>
            <li>good for hydrating skin...</li>
            <li>I found this one and it was a good price, so I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>Looks good under my makeup (gives my skin a glow) and</li>
            <li>For the price, it is good .</li>
            <li>Good price for quality oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good as a night moisturizer,but I think it would leave face way too oily for daytime use.</li>
            <li>But read lots of information on Argan oil and how good it is for your skin, hair, you name it...</li>
            <li>Good quality oil.  </li>
            <li>does a good job.need to use a lot of it [on my hair anyway].not greasy.</li>
            <li>I think that rule of \\&quot;too much of a good thing\\&quot; applies here.</li>
            <li>Good for:&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li>It is extremely light and makes my skin feel absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>But I did have good results on speeding up the healing on a cut, and shrinking a pimple breakout on my husband.   </li>
            <li>But this argan oil would probably be good to use on the face or to mix in with cosmetics or creams.</li>
            <li>Listen to all the good reviews on here about this oil.</li>
            <li>I make my own shampoo and conditioner and this has been a welcome addition to my products.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great, it absorbs into my skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>I read about this being good for my skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>Also have used it in my hair and seems good for both.</li>
            <li>but I like using it, and it feels good.  </li>
            <li>I also added a good amount into my drugstore (loreal) morrocan hair oil.</li>
            <li>I love Argan oil and am interested in purchasing the best at the best price</li>
            <li>Excellent price, comparable to Josie Maran, Argan oil, and so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>This is a great value too since the immitators cost more.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not the greatest for wearing eye makeup and having my face look fresh.</li>
            <li>My hair looks very healthy.</li>
            <li>Very very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have been using 2-4 drops am and pm in combination with the Jurlique Calendula Cream and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>like it alot- great and compares to 40$ a bottle or more. would buy again definitely.&lt;br /&gt;smoother</li>
            <li>and though it feels very light, it hydrates well!</li>
            <li>I loved how hydrating hers was and that it soaked into my skin nicely with no oily appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try and what a buy at $8.99 and free shipping!!!  </li>
            <li>100% pure virgin argan oil is one of the best products I have ever used, and this one is superior.</li>
            <li>I love this oil!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>but I love the way it feels!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve colored my hair for more than 20 years (started turning gray at 19!)</li>
            <li>and I love it!.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>

            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product also NEVER broke me out, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes nicely but don&#x27;t expect to see any miracles.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is excellent for everyday skin maintenance and it is also wonderful for hair.  </li>
            <li>It is also a nice hair treatment.</li>
            <li>and I love that I&#x27;m getting it at a good price.</li>
            <li>I liked this alot.</li>
            <li>Really nice oil that is drt and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.  </li>
            <li>Soaks into skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know what makes this so effective</li>
            <li>and have always had a problem keeping it moisturized and looking nice.  </li>
            <li>I tried another brand and liked it</li>
            <li>This works nicely.</li>
            <li>I use it for my face at night and it glides on nicely.</li>
            <li>Bought this 1 oz bottle to try more and loved it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I liked how this felt when I used it on my hands and elbows</li>
            <li>wonderful, the real thing...</li>
            <li>to create my own argan oil products and use it undiluted on my face, cuticles and lips.</li>
            <li>This is a nice oil because it is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Especially useful for damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>It is good for your hair, nails, and most of all for making your skin moist.  </li>
            <li>For blemishes I apply coconut with it at night and by morning I have a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an expert on argan oil, but I am an expert on my own face.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no fragrance, which is nice, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Also nice for around eyes and mouth and neck.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil did, but no one liked the smell.</li>
            <li>It just gives it a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be a nice softening, smoothing treatment that I now do every week or so.</li>
            <li>Nothing else had been so effective.</li>
            <li>This is nice argan oil.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of nutty...</li>
            <li>, I have used this particular brand of the oil and find it of a very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>this is wonderful and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommended - best buy indeed.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>All the great things that have been said about argan oil are true when it comes to moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks for this great product!</li>
            <li>The Oil came nicely packaged and comes in a nice bottle with a dropper unlike most of the oils I got.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with that because I don’t think I’ll be going through this bottle quickly, even with nightly use.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and very easy to breakout, however, I have been using this oil as moisturizer for a week and experience no breakout.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and very effective.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 5 days and so far it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love the nice glow it gives my face afterward also.</li>
            <li>I most the rose water on my face then apply the Argan oil and moisturizer mixture.</li>
            <li>However, the fact that it&#x27;s a Fair Trade product and rather strictly distributed is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>The bottle was packages nicely and the oil comes in a nice glass bottle, which is awesome if you are trying to avoid plastic as much as possible.</li>
            <li>I was reading a book on inexpensive beauty luxuries and buying your own argan oil was top of the recommendations.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is by far the best \\&quot;eye cream\\</li>
            <li>Use on your hair,  face and neck, but I especially love for nails, makes the cuticle so soft.</li>
            <li>I will say that my hair, from using those god-awful curling irons, was not in the best of shape because of the damage those styling tools can cause, and that the argan oil might work better on normal hair.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited after reading all the nice reviews about Elma&amp;Sana argan oil</li>
            <li>It is very light and absorbs very easily.</li>
            <li>Love organics argan oil is very good leaves your skin very supple</li>
            <li>I liked this it works very well, a great moisturizer for hair and skin.</li>
            <li>great to use on hair, face and body even nails.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the difference even after just first use.</li>
            <li>They say if things seem too good to be true, then they probably are.</li>
            <li>It also seems to work easing fine lines!</li>
            <li>Its very light.</li>
            <li>Very light</li>
            <li>use Argan oil on my face as my moisturizer and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>But I was so impressed with the oil put on an open finger wound.  </li>
            <li>I may still use it more sparingly in my hair, or maybe just on my cracked skin on my fingers/toes.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Both my hair and skin looked healthy after using it</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed how</li>
            <li>It is cheap and it makes my unruly, frizzy, curly/wavy (depends on the day!)</li>
            <li>My skin just looks better period.</li>
            <li>My makeup also goes on so much better and quicker without all the zit covering up and doctoring.  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks better than it has in years (literally).  </li>
            <li>I had read so many reviews and articles that said Argan oil has a nutty smell and taste</li>
            <li>Having said that I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Not too sure about the face, just rubbed two drops on after cleansing at night</li>
            <li>But this oil is not greasy at all, just makes my skin look really healthy &amp; radiant after I take my make-up off at night.</li>
            <li>So glad I took a chance &amp; wasn&#x27;t scared off by the lower price of this brand.</li>
            <li>my hair had more shine and felt a lot softer.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, my skin has NEVER BEEN BETTER.</li>
            <li>I love this site.</li>
            <li>This argan oil is all the rage and in so many products now.</li>
            <li>I have doubt if this product do any better to my hair.</li>
            <li>and I keep getting carded for wine :).  </li>
            <li>Such a great oil !</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it might do a better job on skin, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li>I bought this to see if the Josie Maran argan oil was worth the price, and I ended up returning the Josie Maran because the Elma &amp; Sana oil is just as good.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly at night, alone or underneath a cream.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my eczema is much better as well, almost cleared up.</li>
            <li>I have not tried them, but I can&#x27;t imagine they work better than this.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heal my split ends (not even God can fix split ends), but it does hydrate the hair and make it shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a miracle, but it was the best experiment that I&#x27;ve had with a simple product.    </li>
            <li>It is fragrance free which is an added bonus!  </li>
            <li>so I decided I would use this oil for my hair which works better.</li>
            <li>My hands have never been softer nor my nails in better condition.</li>
            <li>I do not have many wrinkles, so I cannot commend on the Anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li>Works great as a moisturizer, really does the job, and sometimes I notice it gives me a rosy glow.</li>
            <li>Awesome product overall.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure you are going to love it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels better in just 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I wish it&#x27;d absorb into my skin much better</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>yet I received many remarks about how much better I looked and what was I doing.......</li>
            <li>most companies sell it, but argan oil is like the 6th product listed on the bottle...</li>
            <li>Family members have commented on how healthy, shiny and thicker my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I particularly am enjoying using it on my nails/cuticles.</li>
            <li>Why couldn&#x27;t I have had this hair in my teens and twenties?  :-)</li>
            <li>I love using Argan oil on my face.</li>
            <li>This oil has dramatically evened out my skin tone, reduced bags under my eyes, and even made my lips look better.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use any type of product on my face except medication.  </li>
            <li>I love the argon oil.</li>
            <li>I love it ...</li>
            <li>I love this argan oil.</li>
            <li>I like the way it absorbs better than the coconut oil I was using.</li>
            <li>-- in this circumstance, why would you pay 10x more?</li>
            <li>I used to pay a lot more to buy this oil from another brand.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema and psoriasis, so I cannot express enough how wonderful of a find this argan oil has been.</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>But, I was satisfied</li>
            <li>and I wanted to make sure</li>
            <li>I got the best quality I could possibly get.</li>
            <li>so use it appropriately, but you will notice a difference when you do.  </li>
            <li>Love Argan oil.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this for my hair and use as a serum for my face at night.</li>
            <li>I believe that my skin looks plumper and feels better, and my acne has not increased in frequency or severity.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m allergic to most face products.  </li>
            <li>more thing:</li>
            <li>One more thing:</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>do LOVE the softness I get from it though.  </li>
            <li>An insert would make it   better telling you how to use it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, although I wouldn&#x27;t call it miraculous, just yet.</li>
            <li>I love it for my face.</li>
            <li>I even put body lotion on top of it without a problem.  </li>
            <li>and I find myself using this more and more.</li>
            <li>One thing for sure though</li>
            <li>I used to love it and order it all the time</li>
            <li>Maybe someone else will have more advantage of using this product.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s certified organic, too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picking up some more to give out as gifts to family members.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will take care of you.</li>
            <li>I had bought another brand of Argan oil and that felt better on face.</li>
            <li>Lotions and most soaps break my skin out in a rash where ever I apply the product.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my face mostly and to the ends of my hair since it&#x27;s organic and safe for anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>OK... it&#x27;s still produces the moistureizing effect I am looking for</li>
            <li>My nails are in better condition and growing.</li>
            <li>I get more results using coconut and castor oil on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the lightweight feeling of this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I do intend to try a better sourced Argan Oil product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have used so many essential oils and carrier oils, this is among the best oils I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still figuring out all the things you can do with Argan oil, but I already know I love it.</li>
            <li>I recommend adding some to your favorite body moisturizer to boost the benefits.</li>
            <li>hope it works as purported, but I&#x27;m sure it takes a while to see effects, and I haven&#x27;t seen anything drastic yet.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil yet have this scent that reminds me olive oil</li>
            <li>and I mix it into my tinted sun screen for a better consistency.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I really love the way this oil makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>it produces more oil</li>
            <li>and I love the scent, so</li>
            <li>Like many others, I bought this as a sort of dupe for the Josie Maran Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the strength of will to resist the brainwashing, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar for the designer brands out there</li>
            <li>This may have increased the results I got from it more than just using it before lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to purchase the four organic ones offered on Amazon that interest me the most.</li>
            <li>I am not addressing a skin condition just wanting to maintain healthy skin with a youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also makes a great and unique home made gift for any girlfriend on your list, and I have reaped success with a gift like that repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very Pricey but very effective.</li>
            <li>hair look clean, neat, nicely bunched up/curled, and healthy.</li>
            <li>I like this brand because unlike the HSI brand, this is 100% organic argan oil, &amp; it works wonderful with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s particularly helpful for someone that has experienced a lot of sun.</li>
            <li>Works great for me and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is awesome at sealing out humidity and making my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Also, bottle is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin around eyes</li>
            <li>I find that I get my best results with this product when I use it with a bit of water - if my hair is wet from the shower for example, as it better prevents fly-aways.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because the price was good and there were several good recommendations.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product: it is made in Morocco for American company.</li>
            <li>It make both their hair much more manageable and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The Argan Oil helps manage frizziness and keeps my hair looking healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is always soft, silky, shiny with no frizz or fly away but lots of body.  </li>
            <li>Quality oil and great natural nutty smell.  </li>
            <li>I have better luck on my skin with the Neutrogena Light Sesame Oil product I bought at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I put it in my palm, then smooth it over my brows and eyelids, on the corners of my eyes, top of my lips and neck.</li>
            <li>Word of caution from someone who battled acne for 7+ years and just got it cleared out within the last 4 years: if you still have moderate/severe acne, it&#x27;s best to keep your skin moisturized (and this oil is a good option - it may seem counterintuitive to put more oil on oily skin, that&#x27;s the only way to prevent your body from making even more oil),</li>
            <li>The best part is that it won&#x27;t build up like silicones do, but it makes the dry ends just as shiny and smooth as any anti-frizz silicone balm or spray on the market.  </li>
            <li>The best for me is 3 drops every other day.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need any other moisturizer for my face or hair - it&#x27;s awesome!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same great quality of the name brand without the huge mark up in price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li>The Argan Oil was delivered to the house very quickly.  </li>
            <li>They also delivered very quickly...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to over do it and make it look oily.</li>
            <li>This seller ships very quickly and</li>
            <li>And the bottle cap comes with a dropper, which makes it easy to measure and use.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and does not leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I require more drops to moisturize my face and it feels like it just sits on top of my skin, rather than being absorbed.</li>
            <li>Gifted to a family friend, and she swears by it for lovely , silky, shiny hair, and easily absorbed into skin without being greasy and without break outs.</li>
            <li>It soaks into my skin very quickly and once it does it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>and I would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I noticed the strong smell of olive oil.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much, it has a nice feel to it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how my skin will take it in the hot summer months, but right now, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty nice too.</li>
            <li>I add argan oil (sometimes also raw organic coconut and/or avocado oil) and a hint of organic lavender oil to create the best natural skin and hair product I have experienced so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also helps alot with fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It also smoothes the fine lines I&#x27;m getting around my eyes and makes my skin almost glow.</li>
            <li>, I usually have to switch up moisturizers a lot because my skin stops looking as good, but this argan oil has given me consistently great effects.</li>
            <li>I put a couple of drops on my face at night after I cleanse with Cetiphil face wash and message the oil into my fine lines around my mouth and eyes and the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>But for now, this will do me just fine.</li>
            <li>It makes those fine lines from dryness disappear.</li>
            <li>If I put it on my hair after I&#x27;ve shampooed, it makes my fine hair look oily,</li>
            <li>and it seems to help any fine lines practically disappear.  </li>
            <li>but this works better and soaks into my skin really quickly.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into the roots of my hair and makes them look lovely without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause my very sensitive skin to break out so a good product in my book.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, great packaging and easy to just get the couple of drops that you need without making  a mess or wasting product.</li>
            <li>Good natural product!</li>
            <li>it was iligeble for super free shipping :)</li>
            <li>I bought another full bottle of that other brand through sephora and was very happy with it, except for the fact</li>
            <li>Being a picky person myself, I have always looked for the best quality products for my hair and body that contains little or no synthetic ingredients.</li>
            <li>it has helped my hair become very healthy, I have no more split ends or dryness / fly aways.</li>
            <li>Went back to the Mogador brand and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels smooth and moisturized.    </li>
            <li>Service was excellent and arrived within a few days.</li>
            <li>&quot; free.</li>
            <li>This oil goes on smooth and does not have a noticible odor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great used daily.</li>
            <li>I had been resistant to trying an oil based moisturizer, but got a free sample of argan oil through sephora.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Estee&#x27; Lauder advanced night time eye repair for years.  </li>
            <li>I love Golden Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>I use it to smooth frizz and protect from heat styling tools, but my sister swears by it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now, my skin is softer, my hair is shiny and silky, overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>After it is massaged in, I lightly brush it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Complexion is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>After I wash my face, I use 2-3 drops and lightly pat it on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and non-greasy with no odor whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My face has never been so smooth.</li>
            <li>and I know you will receive the same great</li>
            <li>(Loreal&#x27;s sulfate free) which helped.  </li>
            <li>Its FANTASTIC and well work the price.</li>
            <li>Goes on light, dries almost matte on the skin and is non-greasy (oily).</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so smooth in my life</li>
            <li>For the price and the amount used its a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>The most damaged parts of my hair feel like they&#x27;ve been freshly</li>
            <li>I have light eczema, and tried it on some irritated patches, without miraculous results.</li>
            <li>The argan oil has a light, nutty scent and comes with a mini-dropper to prevent over use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it on my body and a tiny bit on my face, and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Or before blow drying/flat ironing, I apply it lightly</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>it is smooth and&lt;br /&gt;not oily.</li>
            <li>I use it for my cuticles primarily but you could use for your hair or skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>In comparison to the Agadir argon oil , I just felt as though it didnt smooth out my hair .</li>
            <li>Worth the price, my favorite all purpose oil.</li>
            <li>The fact that is virgin and organic is also a necessary item for good oils to add to one&#x27;s beauty regiment.  :-)</li>
            <li>I am adding this oil to my hair conditioner and it has tamed and moisturized my color-treated, dry, frizzy hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the price is lower than many other brands out there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While my hair isn&#x27;t perfect, I&#x27;m positive if I keep using the argan oil, and perhaps a bit more frequently, my hair will feel soft and be healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin.........absorbs quickly and easily</li>
            <li>This is a great quality product, absorbs quickly, feels good on the skin, and it&#x27;s very affordable compared to some other brands.</li>
            <li>B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil]] is a good cheap alternative to other more reputable brands like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but I like this one a lot better now, plus its half the price, which is great.</li>
            <li>The package claims that the oil can reduce the appearance of wrinkles/fine lines, but I have not seen anything significant on my face...</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and was quite excited when m Argan Oil arrived.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this oil since it&#x27;s cheaper than the Josie Maran brand and also it claimed to be ECOCERT cerfitied.</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with this oil after the first time using it.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d see if I could find a quality Argan Oil at a better price, read the reviews on this Elma &amp; Sana and bought my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I always think oil is a better moisturizer than lotion or cream, it is much easier for oil to be absorbed by skin than any lotion and cream and had a better result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not shy to say this one is a top contender.</li>
            <li>first it seemed to be ok.</li>
            <li>when I put a drop in with my normal moisturizer as I applied it, the cream helped it to absorb and it felt nice.</li>
            <li>It also gives my skin a really pretty healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I also found that it works to heal small eczema patches wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed into skin and hair!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to use on my face.  </li>
            <li>I received it yesterday and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>it smells great and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, but it also stays greasy for a long time (staining my pillow at night).  </li>
            <li>Great as a shine serum on dry hair too.</li>
            <li>I use a combination of oils to clean my face, and I use this Argan oil to moisturize afterward.</li>
            <li>I mix it with coco butter and put on my clean face.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Everything stated is 100% truthful and my own personal views.</li>
            <li>This oil is so clean on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I have rather dry skin, and my skin soaks it up and feels great.  </li>
            <li>, it is also good to use it on hands and body, I used oil on my legs, because no lotion or cream can do a better job on moisturizing my super dry legs in winter.</li>
            <li>One has curly hair like me and the other has fine hair that get frizzy and fly away.  </li>
            <li>As for prescription meds, try antibiotics first (personally my skin cleared after years of acne with Doryx, but regular doxycycline should be just fine), avoid sugar and dairy, eat healthy, and best of luck!</li>
            <li>This product is nothing special.</li>
            <li>It has no odor, which is very nice and seems to work well on my dry skin over night.</li>
            <li>Super healing and smells good too unlike many other oils.</li>
            <li>A bargain price for such a good product.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with unrefined African Shea Butter and together they make a good team.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even compare to this product which is much cheaper and a better quality.</li>
            <li>The Jojoba oil brand I use is Dessert Essence which is found at most Trader Joe&#x27;s or Whole Foods Store.</li>
            <li>It was a different brand, and I loved it.</li>
            <li>am using this in combination with True Radiance A&amp;C Serum that is also a wonder serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money for a good product.</li>
            <li>I use/used personally and believe is a good product.</li>
            <li>It has really alleviated much of the dryness, pain, and itching</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>i like this product because it smells good unlike my recent argan oil purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face overnight once a week and wake up to nice soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more very soon.</li>
            <li>For the hair is not as good as coconut oil is, so I only recommend it for the skin.</li>
            <li>This is recommended as a true organic argan oil from the research I have done on line.</li>
            <li>love the oil, very soothing and will reuse dropper</li>
            <li>Not bad for hands and feet.</li>
            <li>This stuff is kind of amazing, and all for less than 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>(I actually believe that my acne has gotten better, with fewer cyst-type blemishes, and more clogged pores working clean while still in the &amp;#34;blackhead&amp;#34; stage.</li>
            <li>Other great less-expensive argan oil brands I&#x27;ve tried include [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This oil seems almost as rich and is absorbed just as well.  </li>
            <li>I tried this first, and it did not turn out well, so I would not recommend this use for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing</li>
            <li>It is not greasy or oily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly with no greasy feel or residue.</li>
            <li>true test for True Argan Oil is it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and has no smell.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>this oil is mild on skin too</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and hydrates so well that it balances your skin.</li>
            <li>Soaks quickly into skin.  </li>
            <li>Elma&amp;Sana absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy on my face.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly so my face doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li>scared it would make me break out and be super greasy.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly and could see a difference immediately.</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t amazing, but it went away fast and it wasn&#x27;t that intense.</li>
            <li>It really gives me an extra boost of moisture and my skin feels great after applying it overnight.</li>
            <li>I started using the brand at Sprouts (which is also good) and when I first started using this one I thought the OTHER One smelled better</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend the oil or the company more highly.</li>
            <li>I feel it is high quality and it more than does the job that I need it to do.</li>
            <li>Love this and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li>This is my second order and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty damn cheap</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>Adds a nice shine, lets you comb and brush through it really easily, and helped to smooth down split ends and stray hairs.</li>
            <li>I am new to argan oil and love its impact on my skin.</li>
            <li>For over a month, I was okay with how this new system worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>When I apply it to my hair it makes it appear more healthy and vibrant, And soft as silk.</li>
            <li>It smells very like olive oil, I am pretty sure.</li>
            <li>Got this argan oil oil to mix w/ sweet almond oil, avacado oil, rose hip seed oil, and some essential oils.  </li>
            <li>not sure) that I don&#x27;t like; otherwise good!</li>
            <li>But overall i love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 3 drops of the new bottle in my damp hair, dried it with a blow dryer, and my hair looked wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is great if you have dry skin and very hydrating for the summer.</li>
            <li>to my skin it does make my skin very smooth and soft immediately after use.  </li>
            <li>and it helps it shine and keeps the ends from flying around so much (I have fine hair).</li>
            <li>It was good stuff, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much money for a product that quickly became part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>Seriously, a little goes a looooong way, and 1oz is a great value.</li>
            <li>I apply this to my face (just a few drops) after every shower, it seems to have cleared my skin up and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated, it has a sweet smell that is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky smooth and very shiny, but not greasy looking.   </li>
            <li>After trying literally everything else out there, I decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it about three weeks as of the date of this writing which is August 8, 2011, and to be fair, it might take a bit longer to help correct very dried-out hair.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price of a bottle to see how it will work for you.</li>
            <li>and I use Tigi curlesque with some drops of golden argan oil.</li>
            <li>fresh looking.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough to re-buy, though!</li>
            <li>and I think it makes may hair more shine and soft.</li>
            <li>Smells nice enough too.  </li>
            <li>Overall its nice.</li>
            <li>considering how useful it</li>
            <li>Within minutes it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li>Since I have the most sensitive skin (and it&#x27;s even managed to improve my skin)--I</li>
            <li>I have been switching to more natural beauty products.  </li>
            <li>I have found this argan oil to be wonderful for hair, for scars from burns, for and for rough skin areas such as knees, heels and elbows..</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my face but was also able to use in my hair to keep it soft.</li>
            <li>If I continue to have the success I&#x27;m having, I will be throwing out all my lotions and creams.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better, smoother or softer, even with my old standby Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li>Since my first purchase of this product the dropper has been changed and I love the new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to tame my frizzy hair and use as an oil treatment.</li>
            <li>Not thick and gummy and with a very mild odor.  </li>
            <li>I really needed something more moisturizing, particularly during the winter -</li>
            <li>So, I was excited when I saw Elma &amp; Sana argan oil for so much cheaper, while still being ecocert certified.</li>
            <li>Good deal for the size compared to other retail stores.</li>
            <li>and I was right all along about my bottle being off.</li>
            <li>It just soaks right in and makes everything feel softer right away.</li>
            <li>It is also helpful to shampoo 2x right after the treatment to get any residual out.</li>
            <li>The dropper is so convenient and helps me measure the right amount to use</li>
            <li>i use this product on the tips of my hair (leaving it overnight) and found that right after washing my hair to rinse it off, my hair feels a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li>I like this because it is certified and because the stopper allows you to get the right amount.  </li>
            <li>I need an oil, I just haven&#x27;t found the right one yet.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it on my hair because I don&#x27;t have the right hair type for oils.</li>
            <li>By rubbing about 4-6 drops of this oil into the ends of my hair when wet, I discovered that I no longer needed styling cremes, gels, smoothers, etc, and that my cut would look pretty dang good even without blow drying.</li>
            <li>lol after a little while the smell goes away!</li>
            <li>Easy to use with the dropper, no mess, no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This oil is a fantastic moisturizer and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Even my dry feet are looking better!</li>
            <li>I think the oil is nice and light; but there&#x27;s this slight smell(nutty?</li>
            <li>Works great, and as an added bonus my hair is much stronger with less breakage.</li>
            <li>It seems to absorb better, has less of a scent (which leads me to believe it&#x27;s fresher), and the bottle and dropper are better quality.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit funny at first, but the smell goes away quickly and isn&#x27;t too bothersome.</li>
            <li>My best friend, who is African American and of sensitive dry skin, loved it so much that she requested that I get her a bottle.</li>
            <li>(It is long and my stylist does an amazing job with the color).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take too long to sink in though, maybe 5 minutes after rubbing into my skin (you really kind of have to rub for a minute or else</li>
            <li>I have been using this oil after switching from the Mogador brand (which gave me great results but was more expensive) and I could not figure out why my face was breaking out.</li>
            <li>It makes both my real hair and my extensions feel so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I was using Josie Maran Argan oil but going thru the bottle quickly and the price added up fast.  </li>
            <li>Good color to it, more a thin consistency and no adverse scent.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, the product came in a nice package and a cobalt blue bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good way to add a nice shine to your hair without putting weird gunk in your hair or making it look too shiny or anything like that.</li>
            <li>High quality, clean scented oil with no chemical additives.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put very much at my roots.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li>love it , already using second bottle , my hair stay nice and straight even when its raining outside .</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and seems to reduce fine lines</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found for this oil though, is as a super effective, all-natural replacement for just about all of the hair products I&#x27;d been using previously.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, one of the best hair products I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Some fine lines have gone away and the more visible lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>So I used the Argan Oil for the first 4 days, then alternated with Neosporin.  </li>
            <li>Most RECENT review:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Which means they&#x27;re lying to sell their product, and Amazon should not be supporting this at all.</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing, it has helped me heal fast after a peeling, heal some irritated skin and blemishes, and I hope in the long run it will literally stop my ageing.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this Argan oil</li>
            <li>But it adds a pretty shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this product due to a recommendation and I&#x27;m glad that I did!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last quite a while.</li>
            <li>but my face is 99% clear and blemish free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really works!</li>
            <li>skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>this is my first bottle of argan oil</li>
            <li>First of all I purchased this oil from Amazon based on the reviews</li>
            <li>The first time I did it</li>
            <li>I decided to go all natural with my hair products and have been shampoo, conditioner and leave in product free for almost a year.</li>
            <li>This has great moisturizing property and doesn&#x27;t feel too thick on my face.</li>
            <li>Too many uses and not enough space to list, hair,skin, nails.</li>
            <li>I love luxurious products like everyone else and don&#x27;t mind spending money on things that actually work</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying and using argan oil</li>
            <li>then others I have looked into at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>First time using argan oil on my face.</li>
            <li>I love the argan oil overall.</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey for what you get,</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t thought this oil would be absorbed into my skin so fast and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I used the entire bottle--which, for me, means this oils is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I had been interested in trying the Amal oils argan oil or Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil but was daunted by the price.</li>
            <li>I almost want to try a tiny bottle of the Josie Maran to see if it can get any better.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon Prime!)</li>
            <li>I suggest using argan oil as your nighttime moisturizer when first trying it out - one to two drops is all it takes.  </li>
            <li>~ My facial skin is smoother, the pores smaller, deep spots are coming to the surface and releasing - and the oil is great in my hair too!  </li>
            <li>I use about 3 drops for the end of my hair and it make my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Within a week, I got a replacement in the mail, along with extra bottles and one free argan oil soap as gifts!</li>
            <li>I bought this about a month ago and it was my first Argan oil purchase.  </li>
            <li>My first experience with argan oil was another brand, which was also organic.  </li>
            <li>I first used this on my face (avoiding my t zone), but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to help protect and moisturize!</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I did extensive research to make sure I was getting a quality product.</li>
            <li>I finally settled on mineral oil which I would work into the ends that was ok.</li>
            <li>But I still had to use the hot iron to get it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first argan oil</li>
            <li>I use about 4 drops ( by first rubbing on my palms ) on&lt;br /&gt;wet hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time buying Argan oil from this company,.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this brand.  </li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>So... as hesitant as I am to credit an oil for making my acne go away, I really think this product did it for me!</li>
            <li>I used just three or four light “drips” from the eyedropper that comes with it instead of giving it a full squeeze and that was more than enough for my entire face AND neck.</li>
            <li>I first tried argan oil when I received a sample from a high-end, organic cosmetics brand.</li>
            <li>My face feels sooooo soft and comfortable, with none of the redness I get from most commercial products.  </li>
            <li>I will be back for more without a doubt.</li>
            <li>A single drop is a great lightweight facial moisturizer and it spreads on with a finish exactly like makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dry, fair, sensitive skin, and this product does not irritate it.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after the shower and its ready to go from there.</li>
            <li>I suspect that this use might work better for someone with thicker hair, but it is a rather heavy oil for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Very good quality oil, I put it on my face, no breakout, I have read a lot of reviews about Argan oil and some people said they have experienced the worst breakout.</li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle to give it a quick sniff test, I thought it smelled more like olive oil instead of the nutty scent that a lot of other reviewers reported.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return to normal until after a couple weeks of not using it!!</li>
            <li>I love the results as my hair is so much more softer and manageable, and I notice far less breakage.  </li>
            <li>I recently receieved a sample of Beauty Protector  - Protect &amp; Oil and it is so much lighter and has a much better smell.</li>
            <li>Less is more with this!</li>
            <li>You will see a positive difference after using this oil.  </li>
            <li>After reading the positive reviews on here, and one reviewer claiming she tried Josie Maran and said that this product was identical, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>As far as the customer service, I give it a 4 out of 5 because although there was a rough exchange between the both of us, they did end up sending me a new bottle which I am more satisfied</li>
            <li>This product has made a huge difference in the quality of my hair, I don&#x27;t get split ends as frequently, my hair is much easier to manage, and it is much shinier.</li>
            <li>So I recently ordered this product because of the cheap price, but while reading some more of the reviews, I came across one from someone who said they found out that this company is not actually Ecocert Certified.</li>
            <li>I also use it in the morning under my bare minerals makeup and it makes my skin look smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>but I was able to find a 16 oz bottle on Amazon which I ordered with the intent of pouring into this receptacle and that goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I recently bleached my hair and have been using this on my ends and love that with only a drop or two my hair is so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I pretty much just use this now after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil keeps for around 18 months, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle long before that.</li>
            <li>Other than the good feeling of using something natural</li>
            <li>the product is as good if not better in purity</li>
            <li>This is the only oil that I&#x27;ve been able to consistenely use on my sensitive skin with success.</li>
            <li>My skin has seriously changed for the better!!</li>
            <li>The differences are subtle and most consumers probably would not be able to tell the difference at all.</li>
            <li>lovely use all the time does not other my ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>give two stars only because such an obvious mistake should not be the kind of thing a reputable company would do.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my lips and cuticles, but haven&#x27;t yet on my hair because it&#x27;s more oily than dry.</li>
            <li>, you only need a drop or two on your hands and from there you can easily spread it into your beard.</li>
            <li>Relieves any itchiness, moisturizes the skin under your beard, adds a nice shine, probably helps prevent ingrown hairs, and lets you comb and shape your beard a lot easier with less snags.</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft, almost velvety.  </li>
            <li>Even oily skin can feel dry, if that makes sense, and this takes care of it without making me more oily or causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil for my hair but the bottle ran out pretty fast</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of time and the heat and chemicals make my hair even more dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>I bought this argan oil to replace my Jojoba oil regimen (as I always apply oil on my face - oil seals moisture and makes sure your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, when it dries out</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product more then once - while I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s made any difference (long term)</li>
            <li>I loved it, but it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>100% pure organic Argan oil from Morocco</li>
            <li>I have been looking for pure argan oil for a while now...</li>
            <li>This is a pure oil, not a serum.  </li>
            <li>You always want the pure oil with no scent.</li>
            <li>B0062SM296 Beta Naturals 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil]].  </li>
            <li>BEAUTYOILS.CO 100% Pure Argan Oil]] and</li>
            <li>B00502NMTO Aura Cacia Pure Argan Oil]].</li>
            <li>Despite the pure ingredients, this product does not seem to spread well through my hair like Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>This is the first oil that really makes your skin smooth, especially my feet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seemed to be working on my dry spots, but there really isn&#x27;t any more difference than what I saw before.</li>
            <li>it comes out super soft, shiny &amp; straight.</li>
            <li>It smells good (not perfumy – just natural, and slightly nutty)</li>
            <li>push down where you get more then needed, or pour the argan oil right onto your hands.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality Argan Oil at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It absorbed very quickly and left my skin soft, and the acne problems even eased up.</li>
            <li>Next time I run out I will order the larger size bottle for an even better savings!</li>
            <li>I imagine that it would be similar to using Moroccanoil treatment during the day, but my hair is too fine to handle it.</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;ve seen results in all other areas (moisture, acne, fine lines, etc) rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>While others have said it absorbs quickly, it certainly doesn&#x27;t for me when I apply too much.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair cut in a simple bob.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I bought this thinking it either wouldn’t do much of anything for my very oily skin or wouldn’t be pure argan oil at all.</li>
            <li>This would be great to mix into other beauty products or to rub into dry skin.</li>
            <li>It has very little smell, not unpleasant and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it everyday twice a day but its a great thing to use occasionally.</li>
            <li>If it really is argan oil?  </li>
            <li>It seems like the real deal and works well in my hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair and brushing it is a nightmare, until I put a bit of Argan oil in and then the brush goes through with no problems.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much and it doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy either.  </li>
            <li>I read so much about Argan oil and</li>
            <li>I really like this and</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with severe eczema for my whole life.</li>
            <li>Well after i put it on my skin, it started to smell alot like Shea butter, which is what i beleive it really in the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is really upsetting because I don&#x27;t want to put defective products on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tested out effectiveness of this oil by using it alone on my whole face.</li>
            <li>but I have also used this on my whole face.  </li>
            <li>It really works very well.</li>
            <li>The price of this product is also much lower than that of competitors.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the reasonable price makes this quite the value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any reviews here referencing its use in relation to beards, so I thought I&#x27;d chime in.</li>
            <li>shipped fast and bottle was intact and just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I really like is that both product (argan oil and shea butter) add a lot of moisture and shine to your skin or your hair without ever making it look greasy and/or feel sticky and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This company sells a certified organic version of the oil at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I put it in my hair and it made it very greasy as if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a couple days.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This way I&#x27;m not using to much or wasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t real argan oil.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim and didn&#x27;t really expect much.  </li>
            <li>But what really stuns me is the impact on my hair.  </li>
            <li>No one wants to smell like poop for any reason.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really know what to say about this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This has helped my skin so much since I have started using it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have seen so much on TV about Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>but I really like the feel of my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very silky.</li>
            <li>It arrived as advertised and moisturizers my face without making it really greasy.  </li>
            <li>I finish off with some pressed powder and feel moisturized, covered, and ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>and I use probably four drops for my whole head.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Smells like cooking oil and make me break out in places I&#x27;ve never broken out before.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how this seems to be the same thing at a fraction of the price (and free shipping-</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I will probably keep using it until the bottle is gone but not really sold on getting more at this point.</li>
            <li>It took about a couple weeks for my skin to fully adjust to using an all-natural oil straight on my face.  </li>
            <li>With all the hype on argon oil, I really wanted to try it out without spending a ton.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, people always say that I look like a 20ish girl thanks to my argan oil.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helped my cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous undee makeup instead of mousturizer &amp; is lasting forever</li>
            <li>My skin is soo much smoother.  </li>
            <li>If any left, I pat lightly on my face.</li>
            <li>I really like using this as a moisturizer for my hands</li>
            <li>I had heard so much about this stuff</li>
            <li>After using it for a month, I can tell no difference between it and straight olive oil.</li>
            <li>also have eczema, so my hair never gets very oily.</li>
            <li>It saves me so much time.</li>
            <li>I researched Argan oil very well before choosing this one to buy.</li>
            <li>It really is miraculous.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and keeps my skin moist whole day.</li>
            <li>The dropper allows you to control how much and where you wnat it.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I have not bought the product and don&#x27;t know much about it.</li>
            <li>I had heard so much about this stuff</li>
            <li>It seems like Argan is very hit and miss for acne prone skin, some people can use it and others cannot.</li>
            <li>so this one seemed like a reasonable choice.</li>
            <li>--I used it for a week straight under my moisturizer</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>The Slice of Nature and the ELMA&amp;SANA have the freshest odor of the four with the Slice of Nature having the stronger nutty scent of the two; skin application feels very soothing and calming in a quenching sensation sort of way.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, plus this product is organic and fair-trade certified.  </li>
            <li>It really does what it says and your hair will absolutely thank you for it , meet my expectations</li>
            <li>I put a few drops onto my palm, rub it between my hands to warm it up, and pat it alllll over my face.</li>
            <li>as with most products, it takes time (especially if you&#x27;re trying to heal old scars).</li>
            <li>as with most products, it takes time (especially if you&#x27;re trying to heal old scars).</li>
            <li>I bought a bunch of essential oils and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have switched back to my old Moroccan oil as my hair seem more manageable after using it.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is not pure either as the color is strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The new bottle they sent me does not smell as rancid like the first bottle.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and nicely packed and it is half the price of what I can find locally.</li>
            <li>I also use it to  detangle my daughters hair and to tame my own flyaways.</li>
            <li>This brand smells like olive oil although its labeled 100 pure argan oil and frankly this price is too low to be true.</li>
            <li>My hair is now back to being dark, it is soft and shiny, great movement and texture.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the other brand, but wanted something cheaper</li>
            <li>I saw this advertised for a lot more money in other creams.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same quality as many of the deluxe beauty products on the market, and a larger bottle for much much less than that price!</li>
            <li>This oil arrived super fast and has made a big difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Had heard about argan oil as an ingredient in other hair/skin products, but wanted a pure, organic oil that would not be mixed with other additives that might not be as effective or healthy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Keeps ya hair and skin smooth all winter long.</li>
            <li>My face also most definitely does not smell like an old pan that hasn&#x27;t been washed well --- that old greasy smell from E&amp;S argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I woke up this morning to a fabulously soft and not oily face for the first time in, well, forever.</li>
            <li>But overall, its not bad.</li>
            <li>I love how affordable this Argan oil was compared to other sellers!</li>
            <li>It absorbs much more easily with less greasiness than any other 100% pure oils I&#x27;ve tried (olive, grape, almond).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the very least, I can testify that my skin felt moisturized and, although the oil feels more heavy when you first apply (whereas Jojoba feels very light), the feeling quickly disappears after 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Felt more oily and less absorbent.</li>
            <li>It sinks in very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands or face feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I hear that argan oil is a magic oil that is the ace in the hand of dermatological products and it has been used far and wide to cure tons of skin issues.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, yet it does not feel greasy or heavy like most oils.</li>
            <li>Using in addition to my regular moisturizer definitely keeps my skin softer and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>it was mainly around my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see it hydrated and white head free.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product mainly to use as a leave in conditioner for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This Argan oil work really well, but you have to be careful with how much you use because it can make your hair super oily if you use too much.</li>
            <li>The price is decent.</li>
            <li>Lovely lightweight oil that I use as a daily facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>have used this argan oil on my face at night occasionally, but mostly add a drop or two to boost my SPF daily moisturizer in winter.</li>
            <li>A little dab will do you, it has a plunger type lid which makes it easy to put the exact amout that you want on your finger tips to put it on your face.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was highly rated and a decent price.</li>
            <li>When I shake people&#x27;s hands they always seem to linger a little longer and say that my hands are super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It seems shiny and oily when first applied but sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>Appears to be pure, slightly greasy feel that goes away within a minute and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>And the price is a fraction of what the high end stores are selling it for.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but this brand just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li>But I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone looking for Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The list price of the new Argan oil I bought was close to 50% more expensive than E&amp;S, but I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>The new Argan oil left my skin extremely soft, smooth, hydrated, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It may be better as a skin moisturizer, while for use on hair, it may be better to find a Moroccan oil that is specifically a hair product to be less heavy.</li>
            <li>I have 4 other containers of argan oil in my bathroom--some more than 3 months old.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how soft it makes my skin, and that it is not greasy at all!!  </li>
            <li>I will look for another company even if it means me spending a little more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I completely recommend this product for any skin type!!</li>
            <li>this stuff feels a little like magic.</li>
            <li>I love the little dropper that comes with it, makes it easier to apply it.</li>
            <li>I really like that it comes in a 1oz (pretty blue) glass bottle with a drip syringe top to drip just the right amount each time, VS a regular bottle where you have to turn it upside down,</li>
            <li>My hair is normally very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>However, this oil works very well with my sensitive skin and the smell does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I have dry-ish/sensitive/acne prone skin, and thus far this combo has done very well for me.  </li>
            <li>was very nervous as i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is gentle and natural and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to react in any way, it just nourishes well.  </li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t tell what it does completely for me</li>
            <li>Great alternative to move expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the benefits I&#x27;ve hread of aragon oil, and I&#x27;ve been trying to go all natural, so I went straight to the source (vs. buying a hair product with this</li>
            <li>I did not even mind running errands in the car without makeup which i normally dont do.</li>

            <li>and apply normal moisturizer on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get what I normally do from argan oil.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say that all will have success with using argan oil as we all have different skin types and reactions.  </li>
            <li>If this is normal, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed the oil almost immediately and left no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>long fine limp hair can&#x27;t take most leave in conditioners without feeling sticky (wax coated) or even more dry (silicones block out the moisture over time), but this argan oil takes the frizz out of the ends with a single drop.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazingly pure oil, with no other chemicals!</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;ve seen results in all other areas (moisture, acne, fine lines, etc) rather quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry/baby fine hair</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate adult acne with combination skin.</li>
            <li>This oil has very little to no scent, comes in a great \\&quot;medicine-dropper\\&quot; bottle, and is extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li>Like many acne sufferers I have tried numerous products for my acne with limited results.</li>
            <li>Now, after a couple of months of use, my hair is repaired, long, and super moisturized even without a new application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They promptly sent me a new bottle</li>
            <li>My biggest fear wth any new product that I use on my face is that it is going to break me out since I am acne prone (</li>
            <li>Some add a fragrance to it (innocent enough) but some contain a whole litany of ingredients and argan oil is way down on the list.plus for me.  </li>
            <li>Some add a fragrance to it (innocent enough) but some contain a whole litany of ingredients and argan oil is way down on the list.</li>
            <li>It keeps the entire 28\\&quot; length smooth and shiny, even at the ends where it&#x27;s been brushed through.  </li>
            <li>I overlooked a few initial complaints because, I know this is kind of crazy, but I WANTED this product to be perfect as the vast majority of the reviews say.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed though that if I put it on my forehead area after a shower, and then dry my hair, my bangs are super oily</li>
            <li>so my skin is very sensitive.  </li>

            <li>I have very, very sensitive skin (rosacea, excema and an allergy to the sun).  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I know this one ounce bottle will go very fast, but not necessarily all on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have such dry skin since I have gotten older and this product has helped tremendously!</li>
            <li>This brand is cheaper than others I&#x27;ve seen and the exact same stuff.</li>
            <li>I believe that the results first appear after a 3-4 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>So soft afterward!</li>
            <li>I googled it and found some other websites that said the same, so I am satisfied on that account.   </li>
            <li>It is so soft and velvety like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>My eyes burn and I see more pulling and wrinkles under my eyes than usual.</li>
            <li>I get the same exact results from this oil as from hers.  </li>
            <li>Better than all skin products I usually used.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so thick and heavy that it is definitely not the best smoothing product for my hair.</li>
            <li>Be sure to test the argan oil on a small area to see if it is compatible with your skin.  </li>
            <li>Go ahead and give argan oil a shot, but don&#x27;t buy this brand&#x27;s pretty blue bottle!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin and hair so soft!</li>
            <li>Argan oil is an all natural moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>, they sent me a free bottle, no questions asked, when I emailed them after one of my bottles had a crack in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls and boys this stuff is seriously soooo worth it</li>
            <li>The argon oil makes my hair silky smooth but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>Not greasy or even a light odor like other oils, soaks in like Jojoba but the moisture feeling lasts longer!  </li>
            <li>I have the kind of combination skin that can feel tight and dry but have an oil slick on top.</li>
            <li>From the first application it made my hair soft and shiny, never flat.</li>
            <li>You smooth some of the oil all over your hair and comb it through, and keep it on for about half an hour before shampooing--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad greasy when you put it on, but sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly nutty scent, but it&#x27;s pleasant, not strong, and doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant enough, and the Amazon price is half that charged in my local hair salon for the same product.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit oily when you first put it on face, but after you massage it into your skin and especially around the eyes, it is gentle enough to use around the eyes, it can be obsorbed by the skin and no oily feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>Great product for my thin and slightly dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry hair too, I would not recommend it for oily or thin hair though.</li>
            <li>, I have also used it on extra long bleached human hair wigs to keep the deep wave patterns nice and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I have used SO many different oils for my dry hair and this is the ONLY oil that keeps my hair moisturized for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the key to making this work is using very small amount.</li>
            <li>My skin has definitely improved in appears, fine lines, and overall health since switching from my regular cream moisturizer to this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little under a week but already my skin tone is more even, my breakouts are disappearing and my skin is glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Have been applying on my face and neck (sometimes on elbows, knees, wherever feels dry on my body) almost nightly on its own for about 2 months without any other facial product.</li>
            <li>Due to some health problems my skin is dry but also extremely sensitive to many products.  </li>
            <li>After about six weeks of using it, I realized my face had been unusually clear for a number of days.</li>
            <li>My skin is even, clear, and pimple-free now.</li>
            <li>So far this is as much as I have used it for but it was enough for me to purchase another bottle.  </li>
            <li>There are several organic argan oil products out there being sold with far too high of a markup!</li>
            <li>I have acne breakouts and this helped reduce them and keep my face clear.</li>
            <li>It is said to be a natural aphrodisiac...</li>
            <li>It did miracles for my face and for about 6 weeks cleared my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>the fact that it is all natural is a plus.</li>
            <li>As far as my wrinkles at age 38, I feel it minimizes the appearance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s part of my natural beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>so much I bought another bigger one!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smelling OLD and rancid...</li>
            <li>I recommend this brand of natural oil for hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised this worked so well.</li>
            <li>I have used this mostly around the delicate eye skin</li>
            <li>When used on my damp hair (which is naturally wavy)</li>
            <li>thought it was a miracle prouct even for sensitive skin with breakouts.</li>
            <li>i am 64 years old.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely cured.</li>
            <li>I will order this product again if it continues to work as well as it has so far.</li>
            <li>I have combination, sensitive skin with rosacea.</li>
            <li>Pay the extra money to get the real Argan oil-I&#x27;ve tried agadir brand and it did not cause breakouts/greasiness.</li>
            <li>I used way too much and had to spend extra time drying it.</li>
            <li>well, i got this product yesterday and so far i like the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have Eczema, and it does help to keep my skin soft, and I use it in my hair as well.</li>
            <li>my face feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I put a few drops onto the ends of my hair and it makes them so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Out of desperation I wanted to give Argan oil a try especially after reading so much about it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old and wish I&#x27;d known about Argan oil 50 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs well into my skin and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s feeling parched, I&#x27;ll put it on overnight over my moisturizer, or during the winter I&#x27;ll mix a drop in with my moisturizing gel and my skin feels incredibly soft and quenched.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put it on my hair and scalp over the weekend occasionally when I can put my hair up for the day and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally of oily/tzone,</li>
            <li>and I have amazingly soft skin.</li>
            <li>I use 100% natural moisturizer with a couple of drops of this then mix together and apply.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>This product really prevented my skin from totally drying up and flaking.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even my hands are wonderfully soft after rubbing it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I just use another brand I buy at walgreens which is all natural too.</li>
            <li>I guess we&#x27;ll have to wait and see if I become a wrinkle-less old lady.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented quite a bit in the last year with unnatural hair colors - which included a whole lot of bleaching and damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have young kids</li>
            <li>ladies, if you have any issues with your oil, just contact them directly.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20s</li>
            <li>My face feels soft.</li>
            <li>I wake up with soft skin, hair, and hands.</li>
            <li>After a week of usage I noticed that red spots on my face disappeared, rough areas (elbows and feet) were smoother and overall, my skin had a much better appearance.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin soft, seems to decrease pores, although I don&#x27;t know how since it&#x27;s an oil.  </li>
            <li>Not so much for deep wrinkles like brackets along side of mouth.</li>
            <li>Used a few drops in my bath every night and it was enough to make my skin flawlessly soft overtime:)</li>
            <li>Keeps the ends of my hair soft between shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I did not use much, but was left with stringy, flattened-down tresses.</li>
            <li>Wow.    </li>
            <li>Just a few drops rubbed between palms, then applied to hair, will make hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but I have asian hair, so it didn&#x27;t very do the job</li>
            <li>My hair and skin look so much better just a few weeks later.</li>
            <li>Fatty acids are necessary to maintain healthy levels of hydration and prevent signs of premature aging of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After testing different brands of argan oil at different price points, I feel that the Elma&amp; Sana golden argan oil is not 100% argan oil.</li>
            <li>It did not seem to help very much with my dry hair, but it does well on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The Slice of Nature feels a little thicker and leaves more of a barrier on my skin whereas the ELMA&amp;SANA seems to absorb in better and be less noticeable upon touch and less sheen reflection.  </li>
            <li>waste money on Josie Maran type things, really all you need is right here for under 10.00.</li>
            <li>And after I wash it, I have to spend a ton of time with a flat iron or large curling iron to get the hair looking silky.</li>
            <li>I have seen Argan oil on many other webs and they were much more expensive.</li>
            <li>Every once in awhile I get pretty dry under my eyes...</li>
            <li>I apply it on my AA 4b/C hair with coconut, sweet almond, mayo (yes mayo) and Jamaican black castor oil for a pre-wash mask.</li>
            <li>It quickly and easily absorbs into the skin and hair without any tacky or sticky residue left behind.</li>
            <li>B005BYOVQO Moroccan Beauty Golden Argan Oil, 100% Pure, Organic, Cold Pressed, for Professional Use, 1oz-30ml]]Like the eye dropper - makes it easy to carry in makeup bag and to use anywhere.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The second bottle of this that I bought smelled very different than the first one--rather like olive oil--and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li>I used this consistently and thought my facial skin actually worsened.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a month, so I am not sure if I am in love with the results.</li>
            <li>The first time, I used way too much (about 9-10 drops), and my hair was heavy and oily all day.  </li>
            <li>(increased) acne and some of the fine lines around my eyes are definitely smoother and less pronounced.  </li>
            <li>I have long naturally curly hair argan oil really brings the BOUNCE into bouncy curls while also nourishing and protecting the hair.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other products that are the same thing-this product is significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li>(they get very dry), face (very sensitive skin), and hair (tends to be very frizzy).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially if your skin is acne prone and nothing seems to work!</li>
            <li>Overall, seems to be high quality product.</li>
            <li>That is major and life changing in itself!  </li>
            <li>I have also used it on my hands, which are normally very dry and it leaves them looking quite smooth, with no high shine.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my hair (at the ends when I need some real deep conditioning that my other favorite products will not give me the desired results) and on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will be oily all day long.</li>
            <li>A few more drops for specific coverage (elbows, feet, hands) provided enough coverage for everything else.</li>
            <li>my hair is wet, it has pretty curls.</li>
            <li>I realized it had to be the Argan oil as i have added nothing else to my current regimen, and in fact, my back has broken out while my face looks good</li>
            <li>I put some in my hair when the ends are looking dry, sparingly right out of the shower, or in larger quantities as an overnight treatment.</li>
            <li>B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil]] may take a little getting used to if you have a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>The big problem is that it just doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as the other brand does, and despite feeling oilier, it actually has left my skin much drier.</li>
            <li>It really helps moisturize my dry winter skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If that wasn&#x27;t gross enough, it made my hair very oily.</li>
            <li>Really softens up dead ends and has hair feeling much softer and looking healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li>You only really need a tiny bit to cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use argan and tamanu oil with various essential oils as my main facial oil, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than high end brands.  </li>
            <li>It adds a nice shine, and a little weight to keep my hair tame.</li>
            <li>I mean, it doesn&#x27;t reek, but I&#x27;m very unfamiliar to how fresh Argan oil is supposed to smell.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not sure it is any better than the Jojoba oil I was using, so I probably won&#x27;t get this again as it is more expensive.</li>
            <li>I use this on my hair as well and just half a dropperful for really long hair makes it silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Most likely this is not Argan oil or if it is, it&#x27;s a very small amount and diluted with another oil.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is extremely rich in essential fatty acids - Omega 3, 6 and 9.</li>
            <li>You will pay a LOT more money other places for Argan Oil, and you will have wasted your money.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my fine but thick spiral curly hair which has been damaged from coloring.  </li>
            <li>This oil also sits on the skin, not absorbing as pure argan oil does.</li>
            <li>I have very problematic skin, oily in some places, very dry in others and acne prone all over.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is a little hard to find in my neck of the woods, and I thought the price was pretty good, compared to what little I have to compare to in the stores.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this product as long as the quality stays high.</li>
            <li>Have not used long enough to notice much else.</li>
            <li>Vitamin E is usually the primary benefit attributed to argan oil and it seems that every supposed benefit of vitamin E over the years has eventually been debunked by further research.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t gotten to use this oil too extensively, however I have put a dab on my hair and face and am planning on continuing!  </li>
            <li>for my face i had to go back to the old brand.</li>
            <li>Next time, I scaled WAY back and only used a couple of drops, but then didn&#x27;t feel like I saw much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>i barely used any benzoyl peroxide during this</li>
            <li>It makes my skin glow and soft, especially during winter.</li>
            <li>Be careful to not apply too much, otherwise your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week and the results have completely blown me away.</li>
            <li>Until I decided to finally use it, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed up with this as a moisturizer after using my Clairsonic Mia 2 and boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li>Put it on bare lips and let it absorb then applied lipstick and my lips healed in a week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to buy and use lotions from stores like Victoria&#x27;s Secret or Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>It absorbed in a couple minutes, no greasy, heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>butter (the raw, unprocessed kind) by itself is just a bit too hard to dissolve in hands, so I melt some shea butter in a bowl (for that I do not use microwave, I prefer placing the bowl in the pot of hot water).&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I mix a few drops of jojoba oil in my conditioner when I condition my hair, but the argan oil restores my hair to a whole new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You would think putting an oil on your face in the morning would be crazy, but this absorbs so quickly and really hydrates my face without causing it to get oily or greasy right then or even later in the day.  </li>
            <li>I have discovered argan oil several years ago, and have been using it ever since both as skin and hair moisturizer... either as a stand alone, or better yet, combined with raw unprocessed shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Shea</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering another bottle today( since I spilled half of my first bottle ).</li>
            <li>The other brand was 5 times the price for the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>And for the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t have to use irons or curlers to get all the strands to go the same direction and cooperate with each other.</li>
            <li>The bottle that arrived yesterday has a mild smell compared to my usual sesame seed oil, but it smells like rancid cooking oil.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing as it contains high levels of Vitamin E and essential fatty acids.  </li>
            <li>Other companies charge three times as much.  </li>
            <li>a little to early to really comment on how i feel its working for my skin  </li>
            <li>I like to mix it up with other oils (the combo with rosehip oil is a killer for an overnight skin rejuvenation), but you can also use it straight up.</li>
            <li>is that it somehow is not benefiting the native women as much as these other brands.</li>
            <li>I discovered argan oil when I received a sample of HSI Professional Argan Oil when I bought a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a daily facial moisturizer and my skin is soft and seldom get blemishes.</li>
            <li>I only tried one night but it leaves my skin very soft and same in the next morning.</li>
            <li>It does smell a little funny</li>
            <li>but the watts a little higher</li>
            <li>It did feel nice on my elbows and other rough patches, but I don&#x27;t prefer it to ordinary lotion.</li>
            <li>After being curious about it since it has become all the rage lately, I highly recommend Argan oil for is multi-purpose use &amp; results.</li>
            <li>Dry spots, and as a diaper rash preventer for my one year old!</li>
            <li>It seems more thick oily and has a slight different odor almost like old olive oil.</li>
            <li>In winter, I&#x27;m also prone to periodic bouts with something called \\&quot;peri-oral dermatitis\\&quot;...resembles eczema that first shows up as a little dry patch near the mouth.  </li>
            <li>little bit really does go a long long way, I&#x27;ve only seen positive results from</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way with this product and it&#x27;s really worth the money.</li>
            <li>The bottle is made of glass and the bottle is a dark navy so little light enters to deteriorate the product.</li>
            <li>cannot wear this with my hair down because my hair has fine texture so it is too heavy for it.  </li>
            <li>it was definitely oilier than anything i&#x27;ve tried (normal moisturizer, jojoba oil) which is BAD because it was way oilier than after i put on the argon oil, which means that my skin was producing more oil than normal during my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Argan oil came, I noticed that it had an unpleasant smell, kind of like really old vegetable oil.  </li>
            <li>So far, I wouldn&#x27;t count on this oil alone to take care of extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally dry and sensitive during the winter but it is a combination during the summer.</li>
            <li>Helps my face be less oily and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>my skin is dry and extremely sensitive, and I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li>I use this oil in my hair, on my cuticles, on sensitive skin, after shaving, when I get dry skin around my nose...</li>
            <li>All natural and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a little bit oilier than JM, as another reviewer said her oil is more of a dry oil, and the smell is a little bit different.</li>
            <li>I have recently started straightening my naturally wavy hair, and have a friend who swears by Moroccan oil for dry ends.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my skin type is mixed -- oily at the \\&quot;T\\&quot; while dry on the cheeks.</li>
            <li>, I did the routine after shower while my hair is near dry and damp, i don&#x27;t know if it moisture enough</li>
            <li>When there&#x27;s hardly any left, I lightly rub some on my hair ends (while dry) or where ever needed, and comb through.</li>
            <li>the other brand of Argan oil came, I immediately noticed that it smelled FRESH, the smell is hard to describe, but reminiscent of a bottle of high quality EVOO.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend buying this despite other reviews as I now have a mostly full bottle of a waste on money.  </li>
            <li>help me a lot with my  very dry skin , It works for me so far.</li>
            <li>The 100% argan oil seems to be a little too much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Why would anyone pay so much for so little elsewhere?  </li>

            <li> Very nice product ....</li>
            <li> I also use it as a primer for my mineral makeup and it works very nicely.  </li>
            <li> very honest answer is</li>
            <li> amazing !  </li>
            <li> product is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  </li>
            <li> This oil is so amazing!</li>
            <li> and this oil does amazing things with it!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I even use it in my own shorter hair for styling!  </li>
            <li> And best of all for the first time in my life I have overheard people commenting on how beautiful my hair is!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value for the money, fair trade, and you&#x27;re getting 100% argon oil.</li>
            <li> This is every bit as good; it&#x27;s organic; and it&#x27;s a great price.  </li>
            <li> Also, I use the ROSE WATER from this seller and it has also done wonders!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and I will buy more of it.</li>
            <li> I love this and fully expect I will use it always :D</li>
            <li> Love this mix, feels great on the skin!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses or anything pleasant, but rather nutty.</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as desired but it serves it&#x27;s purpose and portable bottle</li>
            <li> How do I know if the argan oil is any good?  </li>
            <li> good for winter elbows</li>
            <li> how good it is for your skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The good review is that it felt good on my skin...</li>
            <li> I bought one bottle loved it</li>
            <li> I also think the oil is a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought  this oil because the price was really good</li>
            <li> a try because the price was good.</li>
            <li> I did not expect it to be so good.</li>
            <li> good for hydrating skin...</li>
            <li> I found this one and it was a good price, so I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Good quality.  </li>
            <li> Looks good under my makeup (gives my skin a glow) and</li>
            <li> For the price, it is good .</li>
            <li> Good price for quality oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as a night moisturizer,but I think it would leave face way too oily for daytime use.</li>
            <li> But read lots of information on Argan oil and how good it is for your skin, hair, you name it...</li>
            <li> Good quality oil.  </li>
            <li> does a good job.need to use a lot of it [on my hair anyway].not greasy.</li>
            <li> I think that rule of \\&quot;too much of a good thing\\&quot; applies here.</li>
            <li> Good for:&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li> It is extremely light and makes my skin feel absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> But I did have good results on speeding up the healing on a cut, and shrinking a pimple breakout on my husband.   </li>
            <li> But this argan oil would probably be good to use on the face or to mix in with cosmetics or creams.</li>
            <li> Listen to all the good reviews on here about this oil.</li>
            <li> I make my own shampoo and conditioner and this has been a welcome addition to my products.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great, it absorbs into my skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> I read about this being good for my skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> Also have used it in my hair and seems good for both.</li>
            <li> but I like using it, and it feels good.  </li>
            <li> I also added a good amount into my drugstore (loreal) morrocan hair oil.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil and am interested in purchasing the best at the best price</li>
            <li> Excellent price, comparable to Josie Maran, Argan oil, and so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> This is a great value too since the immitators cost more.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not the greatest for wearing eye makeup and having my face look fresh.</li>
            <li> My hair looks very healthy.</li>
            <li> Very very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using 2-4 drops am and pm in combination with the Jurlique Calendula Cream and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> like it alot- great and compares to 40$ a bottle or more. would buy again definitely.&lt;br /&gt;smoother</li>
            <li> and though it feels very light, it hydrates well!</li>
            <li> I loved how hydrating hers was and that it soaked into my skin nicely with no oily appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try and what a buy at $8.99 and free shipping!!!  </li>
            <li> 100% pure virgin argan oil is one of the best products I have ever used, and this one is superior.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> but I love the way it feels!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve colored my hair for more than 20 years (started turning gray at 19!)</li>
            <li> and I love it!.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>

            <li> LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> The seller was outstanding!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this oil!  </li>
            <li> And you get LOTS more!</li>
            <li> I found that it works best for me when I first get out of the shower</li>

            <li> Great for shining hair and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing oil.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> The results have been amazing.  </li>
            <li> My face is just amazing using</li>
            <li> but it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> it in- and put on my face and its amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product also NEVER broke me out, which is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes nicely but don&#x27;t expect to see any miracles.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is excellent for everyday skin maintenance and it is also wonderful for hair.  </li>
            <li> It is also a nice hair treatment.</li>
            <li> and I love that I&#x27;m getting it at a good price.</li>
            <li> I liked this alot.</li>
            <li> Really nice oil that is drt and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.  </li>
            <li> Soaks into skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know what makes this so effective</li>
            <li> and have always had a problem keeping it moisturized and looking nice.  </li>
            <li> I tried another brand and liked it</li>
            <li> This works nicely.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face at night and it glides on nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought this 1 oz bottle to try more and loved it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I liked how this felt when I used it on my hands and elbows</li>
            <li> wonderful, the real thing...</li>
            <li> to create my own argan oil products and use it undiluted on my face, cuticles and lips.</li>
            <li> This is a nice oil because it is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Especially useful for damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> It is good for your hair, nails, and most of all for making your skin moist.  </li>
            <li> For blemishes I apply coconut with it at night and by morning I have a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on argan oil, but I am an expert on my own face.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no fragrance, which is nice, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Also nice for around eyes and mouth and neck.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil did, but no one liked the smell.</li>
            <li> It just gives it a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be a nice softening, smoothing treatment that I now do every week or so.</li>
            <li> Nothing else had been so effective.</li>
            <li> This is nice argan oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of nutty...</li>
            <li> , I have used this particular brand of the oil and find it of a very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> this is wonderful and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommended - best buy indeed.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> All the great things that have been said about argan oil are true when it comes to moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks for this great product!</li>
            <li> The Oil came nicely packaged and comes in a nice bottle with a dropper unlike most of the oils I got.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with that because I don’t think I’ll be going through this bottle quickly, even with nightly use.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and very easy to breakout, however, I have been using this oil as moisturizer for a week and experience no breakout.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and very effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 5 days and so far it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I love the nice glow it gives my face afterward also.</li>
            <li> I most the rose water on my face then apply the Argan oil and moisturizer mixture.</li>
            <li> However, the fact that it&#x27;s a Fair Trade product and rather strictly distributed is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> The bottle was packages nicely and the oil comes in a nice glass bottle, which is awesome if you are trying to avoid plastic as much as possible.</li>
            <li> I was reading a book on inexpensive beauty luxuries and buying your own argan oil was top of the recommendations.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is by far the best \\&quot;eye cream\\</li>
            <li> Use on your hair,  face and neck, but I especially love for nails, makes the cuticle so soft.</li>
            <li> I will say that my hair, from using those god-awful curling irons, was not in the best of shape because of the damage those styling tools can cause, and that the argan oil might work better on normal hair.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited after reading all the nice reviews about Elma&amp;Sana argan oil</li>
            <li> It is very light and absorbs very easily.</li>
            <li> Love organics argan oil is very good leaves your skin very supple</li>
            <li> I liked this it works very well, a great moisturizer for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> great to use on hair, face and body even nails.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the difference even after just first use.</li>
            <li> They say if things seem too good to be true, then they probably are.</li>
            <li> It also seems to work easing fine lines!</li>
            <li> Its very light.</li>
            <li> Very light</li>
            <li> use Argan oil on my face as my moisturizer and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> But I was so impressed with the oil put on an open finger wound.  </li>
            <li> I may still use it more sparingly in my hair, or maybe just on my cracked skin on my fingers/toes.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Both my hair and skin looked healthy after using it</li>
            <li> and I enjoyed how</li>
            <li> It is cheap and it makes my unruly, frizzy, curly/wavy (depends on the day!)</li>
            <li> My skin just looks better period.</li>
            <li> My makeup also goes on so much better and quicker without all the zit covering up and doctoring.  </li>
            <li> and my skin looks better than it has in years (literally).  </li>
            <li> I had read so many reviews and articles that said Argan oil has a nutty smell and taste</li>
            <li> Having said that I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not too sure about the face, just rubbed two drops on after cleansing at night</li>
            <li> But this oil is not greasy at all, just makes my skin look really healthy &amp; radiant after I take my make-up off at night.</li>
            <li> So glad I took a chance &amp; wasn&#x27;t scared off by the lower price of this brand.</li>
            <li> my hair had more shine and felt a lot softer.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, my skin has NEVER BEEN BETTER.</li>
            <li> I love this site.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is all the rage and in so many products now.</li>
            <li> I have doubt if this product do any better to my hair.</li>
            <li> and I keep getting carded for wine :).  </li>
            <li> Such a great oil !</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> it might do a better job on skin, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if the Josie Maran argan oil was worth the price, and I ended up returning the Josie Maran because the Elma &amp; Sana oil is just as good.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly at night, alone or underneath a cream.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my eczema is much better as well, almost cleared up.</li>
            <li> I have not tried them, but I can&#x27;t imagine they work better than this.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heal my split ends (not even God can fix split ends), but it does hydrate the hair and make it shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a miracle, but it was the best experiment that I&#x27;ve had with a simple product.    </li>
            <li> It is fragrance free which is an added bonus!  </li>
            <li> so I decided I would use this oil for my hair which works better.</li>
            <li> My hands have never been softer nor my nails in better condition.</li>
            <li> I do not have many wrinkles, so I cannot commend on the Anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li> Works great as a moisturizer, really does the job, and sometimes I notice it gives me a rosy glow.</li>
            <li> Awesome product overall.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure you are going to love it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels better in just 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I wish it&#x27;d absorb into my skin much better</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> yet I received many remarks about how much better I looked and what was I doing.......</li>
            <li> most companies sell it, but argan oil is like the 6th product listed on the bottle...</li>
            <li> Family members have commented on how healthy, shiny and thicker my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I particularly am enjoying using it on my nails/cuticles.</li>
            <li> Why couldn&#x27;t I have had this hair in my teens and twenties?  :-)</li>
            <li> I love using Argan oil on my face.</li>
            <li> This oil has dramatically evened out my skin tone, reduced bags under my eyes, and even made my lips look better.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use any type of product on my face except medication.  </li>
            <li> I love the argon oil.</li>
            <li> I love it ...</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil.</li>
            <li> I like the way it absorbs better than the coconut oil I was using.</li>
            <li> -- in this circumstance, why would you pay 10x more?</li>
            <li> I used to pay a lot more to buy this oil from another brand.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and psoriasis, so I cannot express enough how wonderful of a find this argan oil has been.</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> But, I was satisfied</li>
            <li> and I wanted to make sure</li>
            <li> I got the best quality I could possibly get.</li>
            <li> so use it appropriately, but you will notice a difference when you do.  </li>
            <li> Love Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair and use as a serum for my face at night.</li>
            <li> I believe that my skin looks plumper and feels better, and my acne has not increased in frequency or severity.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m allergic to most face products.  </li>
            <li> more thing:</li>
            <li> One more thing:</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> do LOVE the softness I get from it though.  </li>
            <li> An insert would make it   better telling you how to use it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, although I wouldn&#x27;t call it miraculous, just yet.</li>
            <li> I love it for my face.</li>
            <li> I even put body lotion on top of it without a problem.  </li>
            <li> and I find myself using this more and more.</li>
            <li> One thing for sure though</li>
            <li> I used to love it and order it all the time</li>
            <li> Maybe someone else will have more advantage of using this product.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s certified organic, too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picking up some more to give out as gifts to family members.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they will take care of you.</li>
            <li> I had bought another brand of Argan oil and that felt better on face.</li>
            <li> Lotions and most soaps break my skin out in a rash where ever I apply the product.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my face mostly and to the ends of my hair since it&#x27;s organic and safe for anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> OK... it&#x27;s still produces the moistureizing effect I am looking for</li>
            <li> My nails are in better condition and growing.</li>
            <li> I get more results using coconut and castor oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the lightweight feeling of this product.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I do intend to try a better sourced Argan Oil product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have used so many essential oils and carrier oils, this is among the best oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still figuring out all the things you can do with Argan oil, but I already know I love it.</li>
            <li> I recommend adding some to your favorite body moisturizer to boost the benefits.</li>
            <li> hope it works as purported, but I&#x27;m sure it takes a while to see effects, and I haven&#x27;t seen anything drastic yet.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil yet have this scent that reminds me olive oil</li>
            <li> and I mix it into my tinted sun screen for a better consistency.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I really love the way this oil makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> it produces more oil</li>
            <li> and I love the scent, so</li>
            <li> Like many others, I bought this as a sort of dupe for the Josie Maran Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the strength of will to resist the brainwashing, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar for the designer brands out there</li>
            <li> This may have increased the results I got from it more than just using it before lipstick.  </li>
            <li> Love this oil.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to purchase the four organic ones offered on Amazon that interest me the most.</li>
            <li> I am not addressing a skin condition just wanting to maintain healthy skin with a youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also makes a great and unique home made gift for any girlfriend on your list, and I have reaped success with a gift like that repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very Pricey but very effective.</li>
            <li> hair look clean, neat, nicely bunched up/curled, and healthy.</li>
            <li> I like this brand because unlike the HSI brand, this is 100% organic argan oil, &amp; it works wonderful with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly helpful for someone that has experienced a lot of sun.</li>
            <li> Works great for me and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is awesome at sealing out humidity and making my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Also, bottle is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin around eyes</li>
            <li> I find that I get my best results with this product when I use it with a bit of water - if my hair is wet from the shower for example, as it better prevents fly-aways.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the price was good and there were several good recommendations.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product: it is made in Morocco for American company.</li>
            <li> It make both their hair much more manageable and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The Argan Oil helps manage frizziness and keeps my hair looking healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is always soft, silky, shiny with no frizz or fly away but lots of body.  </li>
            <li> Quality oil and great natural nutty smell.  </li>
            <li> I have better luck on my skin with the Neutrogena Light Sesame Oil product I bought at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I put it in my palm, then smooth it over my brows and eyelids, on the corners of my eyes, top of my lips and neck.</li>
            <li> Word of caution from someone who battled acne for 7+ years and just got it cleared out within the last 4 years: if you still have moderate/severe acne, it&#x27;s best to keep your skin moisturized (and this oil is a good option - it may seem counterintuitive to put more oil on oily skin, that&#x27;s the only way to prevent your body from making even more oil),</li>
            <li> The best part is that it won&#x27;t build up like silicones do, but it makes the dry ends just as shiny and smooth as any anti-frizz silicone balm or spray on the market.  </li>
            <li> The best for me is 3 drops every other day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any other moisturizer for my face or hair - it&#x27;s awesome!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same great quality of the name brand without the huge mark up in price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil was delivered to the house very quickly.  </li>
            <li> They also delivered very quickly...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to over do it and make it look oily.</li>
            <li> This seller ships very quickly and</li>
            <li> And the bottle cap comes with a dropper, which makes it easy to measure and use.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and does not leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I require more drops to moisturize my face and it feels like it just sits on top of my skin, rather than being absorbed.</li>
            <li> Gifted to a family friend, and she swears by it for lovely , silky, shiny hair, and easily absorbed into skin without being greasy and without break outs.</li>
            <li> It soaks into my skin very quickly and once it does it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> and I would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I noticed the strong smell of olive oil.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, it has a nice feel to it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how my skin will take it in the hot summer months, but right now, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty nice too.</li>
            <li> I add argan oil (sometimes also raw organic coconut and/or avocado oil) and a hint of organic lavender oil to create the best natural skin and hair product I have experienced so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also helps alot with fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It also smoothes the fine lines I&#x27;m getting around my eyes and makes my skin almost glow.</li>
            <li> , I usually have to switch up moisturizers a lot because my skin stops looking as good, but this argan oil has given me consistently great effects.</li>
            <li> I put a couple of drops on my face at night after I cleanse with Cetiphil face wash and message the oil into my fine lines around my mouth and eyes and the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> But for now, this will do me just fine.</li>
            <li> It makes those fine lines from dryness disappear.</li>
            <li> If I put it on my hair after I&#x27;ve shampooed, it makes my fine hair look oily,</li>
            <li> and it seems to help any fine lines practically disappear.  </li>
            <li> but this works better and soaks into my skin really quickly.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly into the roots of my hair and makes them look lovely without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause my very sensitive skin to break out so a good product in my book.</li>
            <li> It feels nice, great packaging and easy to just get the couple of drops that you need without making  a mess or wasting product.</li>
            <li> Good natural product!</li>
            <li> it was iligeble for super free shipping :)</li>
            <li> I bought another full bottle of that other brand through sephora and was very happy with it, except for the fact</li>
            <li> Being a picky person myself, I have always looked for the best quality products for my hair and body that contains little or no synthetic ingredients.</li>
            <li> it has helped my hair become very healthy, I have no more split ends or dryness / fly aways.</li>
            <li> Went back to the Mogador brand and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels smooth and moisturized.    </li>
            <li> Service was excellent and arrived within a few days.</li>
            <li> &quot; free.</li>
            <li> This oil goes on smooth and does not have a noticible odor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great used daily.</li>
            <li> I had been resistant to trying an oil based moisturizer, but got a free sample of argan oil through sephora.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Estee&#x27; Lauder advanced night time eye repair for years.  </li>
            <li> I love Golden Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> I use it to smooth frizz and protect from heat styling tools, but my sister swears by it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now, my skin is softer, my hair is shiny and silky, overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> After it is massaged in, I lightly brush it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complexion is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> After I wash my face, I use 2-3 drops and lightly pat it on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and non-greasy with no odor whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My face has never been so smooth.</li>
            <li> and I know you will receive the same great</li>
            <li> (Loreal&#x27;s sulfate free) which helped.  </li>
            <li> Its FANTASTIC and well work the price.</li>
            <li> Goes on light, dries almost matte on the skin and is non-greasy (oily).</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so smooth in my life</li>
            <li> For the price and the amount used its a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> The most damaged parts of my hair feel like they&#x27;ve been freshly</li>
            <li> I have light eczema, and tried it on some irritated patches, without miraculous results.</li>
            <li> The argan oil has a light, nutty scent and comes with a mini-dropper to prevent over use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it on my body and a tiny bit on my face, and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Or before blow drying/flat ironing, I apply it lightly</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> it is smooth and&lt;br /&gt;not oily.</li>
            <li> I use it for my cuticles primarily but you could use for your hair or skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin silky smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> In comparison to the Agadir argon oil , I just felt as though it didnt smooth out my hair .</li>
            <li> Worth the price, my favorite all purpose oil.</li>
            <li> The fact that is virgin and organic is also a necessary item for good oils to add to one&#x27;s beauty regiment.  :-)</li>
            <li> I am adding this oil to my hair conditioner and it has tamed and moisturized my color-treated, dry, frizzy hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the price is lower than many other brands out there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While my hair isn&#x27;t perfect, I&#x27;m positive if I keep using the argan oil, and perhaps a bit more frequently, my hair will feel soft and be healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin.........absorbs quickly and easily</li>
            <li> This is a great quality product, absorbs quickly, feels good on the skin, and it&#x27;s very affordable compared to some other brands.</li>
            <li> B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil]] is a good cheap alternative to other more reputable brands like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but I like this one a lot better now, plus its half the price, which is great.</li>
            <li> The package claims that the oil can reduce the appearance of wrinkles/fine lines, but I have not seen anything significant on my face...</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was quite excited when m Argan Oil arrived.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this oil since it&#x27;s cheaper than the Josie Maran brand and also it claimed to be ECOCERT cerfitied.</li>
            <li> I immediately fell in love with this oil after the first time using it.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d see if I could find a quality Argan Oil at a better price, read the reviews on this Elma &amp; Sana and bought my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> I always think oil is a better moisturizer than lotion or cream, it is much easier for oil to be absorbed by skin than any lotion and cream and had a better result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not shy to say this one is a top contender.</li>
            <li> first it seemed to be ok.</li>
            <li> when I put a drop in with my normal moisturizer as I applied it, the cream helped it to absorb and it felt nice.</li>
            <li> It also gives my skin a really pretty healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> I also found that it works to heal small eczema patches wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed into skin and hair!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to use on my face.  </li>
            <li> I received it yesterday and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> it smells great and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, but it also stays greasy for a long time (staining my pillow at night).  </li>
            <li> Great as a shine serum on dry hair too.</li>
            <li> I use a combination of oils to clean my face, and I use this Argan oil to moisturize afterward.</li>
            <li> I mix it with coco butter and put on my clean face.</li>
            <li> It goes on light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Everything stated is 100% truthful and my own personal views.</li>
            <li> This oil is so clean on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I have rather dry skin, and my skin soaks it up and feels great.  </li>
            <li> , it is also good to use it on hands and body, I used oil on my legs, because no lotion or cream can do a better job on moisturizing my super dry legs in winter.</li>
            <li> One has curly hair like me and the other has fine hair that get frizzy and fly away.  </li>
            <li> As for prescription meds, try antibiotics first (personally my skin cleared after years of acne with Doryx, but regular doxycycline should be just fine), avoid sugar and dairy, eat healthy, and best of luck!</li>
            <li> This product is nothing special.</li>
            <li> It has no odor, which is very nice and seems to work well on my dry skin over night.</li>
            <li> Super healing and smells good too unlike many other oils.</li>
            <li> A bargain price for such a good product.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with unrefined African Shea Butter and together they make a good team.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even compare to this product which is much cheaper and a better quality.</li>
            <li> The Jojoba oil brand I use is Dessert Essence which is found at most Trader Joe&#x27;s or Whole Foods Store.</li>
            <li> It was a different brand, and I loved it.</li>
            <li> am using this in combination with True Radiance A&amp;C Serum that is also a wonder serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money for a good product.</li>
            <li> I use/used personally and believe is a good product.</li>
            <li> It has really alleviated much of the dryness, pain, and itching</li>
            <li> Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> i like this product because it smells good unlike my recent argan oil purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face overnight once a week and wake up to nice soft skin.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more very soon.</li>
            <li> For the hair is not as good as coconut oil is, so I only recommend it for the skin.</li>
            <li> This is recommended as a true organic argan oil from the research I have done on line.</li>
            <li> love the oil, very soothing and will reuse dropper</li>
            <li> Not bad for hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This stuff is kind of amazing, and all for less than 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> (I actually believe that my acne has gotten better, with fewer cyst-type blemishes, and more clogged pores working clean while still in the &amp;#34;blackhead&amp;#34; stage.</li>
            <li> Other great less-expensive argan oil brands I&#x27;ve tried include [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This oil seems almost as rich and is absorbed just as well.  </li>
            <li> I tried this first, and it did not turn out well, so I would not recommend this use for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or oily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly with no greasy feel or residue.</li>
            <li> true test for True Argan Oil is it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and has no smell.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> this oil is mild on skin too</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and hydrates so well that it balances your skin.</li>
            <li> Soaks quickly into skin.  </li>
            <li> Elma&amp;Sana absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy on my face.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly so my face doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> scared it would make me break out and be super greasy.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and could see a difference immediately.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t amazing, but it went away fast and it wasn&#x27;t that intense.</li>
            <li> It really gives me an extra boost of moisture and my skin feels great after applying it overnight.</li>
            <li> I started using the brand at Sprouts (which is also good) and when I first started using this one I thought the OTHER One smelled better</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend the oil or the company more highly.</li>
            <li> I feel it is high quality and it more than does the job that I need it to do.</li>
            <li> Love this and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li> This is my second order and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty damn cheap</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Adds a nice shine, lets you comb and brush through it really easily, and helped to smooth down split ends and stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I am new to argan oil and love its impact on my skin.</li>
            <li> For over a month, I was okay with how this new system worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> When I apply it to my hair it makes it appear more healthy and vibrant, And soft as silk.</li>
            <li> It smells very like olive oil, I am pretty sure.</li>
            <li> Got this argan oil oil to mix w/ sweet almond oil, avacado oil, rose hip seed oil, and some essential oils.  </li>
            <li> not sure) that I don&#x27;t like; otherwise good!</li>
            <li> But overall i love this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 3 drops of the new bottle in my damp hair, dried it with a blow dryer, and my hair looked wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is great if you have dry skin and very hydrating for the summer.</li>
            <li> to my skin it does make my skin very smooth and soft immediately after use.  </li>
            <li> and it helps it shine and keeps the ends from flying around so much (I have fine hair).</li>
            <li> It was good stuff, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much money for a product that quickly became part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Seriously, a little goes a looooong way, and 1oz is a great value.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my face (just a few drops) after every shower, it seems to have cleared my skin up and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated, it has a sweet smell that is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky smooth and very shiny, but not greasy looking.   </li>
            <li> After trying literally everything else out there, I decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it about three weeks as of the date of this writing which is August 8, 2011, and to be fair, it might take a bit longer to help correct very dried-out hair.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the price of a bottle to see how it will work for you.</li>
            <li> and I use Tigi curlesque with some drops of golden argan oil.</li>
            <li> fresh looking.</li>
            <li> I liked it enough to re-buy, though!</li>
            <li> and I think it makes may hair more shine and soft.</li>
            <li> Smells nice enough too.  </li>
            <li> Overall its nice.</li>
            <li> considering how useful it</li>
            <li> Within minutes it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li> Since I have the most sensitive skin (and it&#x27;s even managed to improve my skin)--I</li>
            <li> I have been switching to more natural beauty products.  </li>
            <li> I have found this argan oil to be wonderful for hair, for scars from burns, for and for rough skin areas such as knees, heels and elbows..</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face but was also able to use in my hair to keep it soft.</li>
            <li> If I continue to have the success I&#x27;m having, I will be throwing out all my lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better, smoother or softer, even with my old standby Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> Since my first purchase of this product the dropper has been changed and I love the new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to tame my frizzy hair and use as an oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Not thick and gummy and with a very mild odor.  </li>
            <li> I really needed something more moisturizing, particularly during the winter -</li>
            <li> So, I was excited when I saw Elma &amp; Sana argan oil for so much cheaper, while still being ecocert certified.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the size compared to other retail stores.</li>
            <li> and I was right all along about my bottle being off.</li>
            <li> It just soaks right in and makes everything feel softer right away.</li>
            <li> It is also helpful to shampoo 2x right after the treatment to get any residual out.</li>
            <li> The dropper is so convenient and helps me measure the right amount to use</li>
            <li> i use this product on the tips of my hair (leaving it overnight) and found that right after washing my hair to rinse it off, my hair feels a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is certified and because the stopper allows you to get the right amount.  </li>
            <li> I need an oil, I just haven&#x27;t found the right one yet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it on my hair because I don&#x27;t have the right hair type for oils.</li>
            <li> By rubbing about 4-6 drops of this oil into the ends of my hair when wet, I discovered that I no longer needed styling cremes, gels, smoothers, etc, and that my cut would look pretty dang good even without blow drying.</li>
            <li> lol after a little while the smell goes away!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with the dropper, no mess, no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This oil is a fantastic moisturizer and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Even my dry feet are looking better!</li>
            <li> I think the oil is nice and light; but there&#x27;s this slight smell(nutty?</li>
            <li> Works great, and as an added bonus my hair is much stronger with less breakage.</li>
            <li> It seems to absorb better, has less of a scent (which leads me to believe it&#x27;s fresher), and the bottle and dropper are better quality.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit funny at first, but the smell goes away quickly and isn&#x27;t too bothersome.</li>
            <li> My best friend, who is African American and of sensitive dry skin, loved it so much that she requested that I get her a bottle.</li>
            <li> (It is long and my stylist does an amazing job with the color).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take too long to sink in though, maybe 5 minutes after rubbing into my skin (you really kind of have to rub for a minute or else</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil after switching from the Mogador brand (which gave me great results but was more expensive) and I could not figure out why my face was breaking out.</li>
            <li> It makes both my real hair and my extensions feel so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was using Josie Maran Argan oil but going thru the bottle quickly and the price added up fast.  </li>
            <li> Good color to it, more a thin consistency and no adverse scent.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, the product came in a nice package and a cobalt blue bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good way to add a nice shine to your hair without putting weird gunk in your hair or making it look too shiny or anything like that.</li>
            <li> High quality, clean scented oil with no chemical additives.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put very much at my roots.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li> love it , already using second bottle , my hair stay nice and straight even when its raining outside .</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and seems to reduce fine lines</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found for this oil though, is as a super effective, all-natural replacement for just about all of the hair products I&#x27;d been using previously.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, one of the best hair products I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Some fine lines have gone away and the more visible lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> So I used the Argan Oil for the first 4 days, then alternated with Neosporin.  </li>
            <li> Most RECENT review:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Which means they&#x27;re lying to sell their product, and Amazon should not be supporting this at all.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing, it has helped me heal fast after a peeling, heal some irritated skin and blemishes, and I hope in the long run it will literally stop my ageing.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this Argan oil</li>
            <li> But it adds a pretty shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to a recommendation and I&#x27;m glad that I did!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last quite a while.</li>
            <li> but my face is 99% clear and blemish free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really works!</li>
            <li> skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> this is my first bottle of argan oil</li>
            <li> First of all I purchased this oil from Amazon based on the reviews</li>
            <li> The first time I did it</li>
            <li> I decided to go all natural with my hair products and have been shampoo, conditioner and leave in product free for almost a year.</li>
            <li> This has great moisturizing property and doesn&#x27;t feel too thick on my face.</li>
            <li> Too many uses and not enough space to list, hair,skin, nails.</li>
            <li> I love luxurious products like everyone else and don&#x27;t mind spending money on things that actually work</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying and using argan oil</li>
            <li> then others I have looked into at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> First time using argan oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the argan oil overall.</li>
            <li> Pretty pricey for what you get,</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t thought this oil would be absorbed into my skin so fast and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle--which, for me, means this oils is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I had been interested in trying the Amal oils argan oil or Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil but was daunted by the price.</li>
            <li> I almost want to try a tiny bottle of the Josie Maran to see if it can get any better.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon Prime!)</li>
            <li> I suggest using argan oil as your nighttime moisturizer when first trying it out - one to two drops is all it takes.  </li>
            <li> ~ My facial skin is smoother, the pores smaller, deep spots are coming to the surface and releasing - and the oil is great in my hair too!  </li>
            <li> I use about 3 drops for the end of my hair and it make my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Within a week, I got a replacement in the mail, along with extra bottles and one free argan oil soap as gifts!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and it was my first Argan oil purchase.  </li>
            <li> My first experience with argan oil was another brand, which was also organic.  </li>
            <li> I first used this on my face (avoiding my t zone), but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes.  </li>
            <li> It really seems to help protect and moisturize!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I did extensive research to make sure I was getting a quality product.</li>
            <li> I finally settled on mineral oil which I would work into the ends that was ok.</li>
            <li> But I still had to use the hot iron to get it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first argan oil</li>
            <li> I use about 4 drops ( by first rubbing on my palms ) on&lt;br /&gt;wet hair.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time buying Argan oil from this company,.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this brand.  </li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> So... as hesitant as I am to credit an oil for making my acne go away, I really think this product did it for me!</li>
            <li> I used just three or four light “drips” from the eyedropper that comes with it instead of giving it a full squeeze and that was more than enough for my entire face AND neck.</li>
            <li> I first tried argan oil when I received a sample from a high-end, organic cosmetics brand.</li>
            <li> My face feels sooooo soft and comfortable, with none of the redness I get from most commercial products.  </li>
            <li> I will be back for more without a doubt.</li>
            <li> A single drop is a great lightweight facial moisturizer and it spreads on with a finish exactly like makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry, fair, sensitive skin, and this product does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> I put it on right after the shower and its ready to go from there.</li>
            <li> I suspect that this use might work better for someone with thicker hair, but it is a rather heavy oil for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil, I put it on my face, no breakout, I have read a lot of reviews about Argan oil and some people said they have experienced the worst breakout.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle to give it a quick sniff test, I thought it smelled more like olive oil instead of the nutty scent that a lot of other reviewers reported.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return to normal until after a couple weeks of not using it!!</li>
            <li> I love the results as my hair is so much more softer and manageable, and I notice far less breakage.  </li>
            <li> I recently receieved a sample of Beauty Protector  - Protect &amp; Oil and it is so much lighter and has a much better smell.</li>
            <li> Less is more with this!</li>
            <li> You will see a positive difference after using this oil.  </li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews on here, and one reviewer claiming she tried Josie Maran and said that this product was identical, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> As far as the customer service, I give it a 4 out of 5 because although there was a rough exchange between the both of us, they did end up sending me a new bottle which I am more satisfied</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in the quality of my hair, I don&#x27;t get split ends as frequently, my hair is much easier to manage, and it is much shinier.</li>
            <li> So I recently ordered this product because of the cheap price, but while reading some more of the reviews, I came across one from someone who said they found out that this company is not actually Ecocert Certified.</li>
            <li> I also use it in the morning under my bare minerals makeup and it makes my skin look smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> but I was able to find a 16 oz bottle on Amazon which I ordered with the intent of pouring into this receptacle and that goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I recently bleached my hair and have been using this on my ends and love that with only a drop or two my hair is so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I pretty much just use this now after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil keeps for around 18 months, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle long before that.</li>
            <li> Other than the good feeling of using something natural</li>
            <li> the product is as good if not better in purity</li>
            <li> This is the only oil that I&#x27;ve been able to consistenely use on my sensitive skin with success.</li>
            <li> My skin has seriously changed for the better!!</li>
            <li> The differences are subtle and most consumers probably would not be able to tell the difference at all.</li>
            <li> lovely use all the time does not other my ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> give two stars only because such an obvious mistake should not be the kind of thing a reputable company would do.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my lips and cuticles, but haven&#x27;t yet on my hair because it&#x27;s more oily than dry.</li>
            <li> , you only need a drop or two on your hands and from there you can easily spread it into your beard.</li>
            <li> Relieves any itchiness, moisturizes the skin under your beard, adds a nice shine, probably helps prevent ingrown hairs, and lets you comb and shape your beard a lot easier with less snags.</li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft, almost velvety.  </li>
            <li> Even oily skin can feel dry, if that makes sense, and this takes care of it without making me more oily or causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil for my hair but the bottle ran out pretty fast</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of time and the heat and chemicals make my hair even more dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I bought this argan oil to replace my Jojoba oil regimen (as I always apply oil on my face - oil seals moisture and makes sure your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, when it dries out</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product more then once - while I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s made any difference (long term)</li>
            <li> I loved it, but it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> 100% pure organic Argan oil from Morocco</li>
            <li> I have been looking for pure argan oil for a while now...</li>
            <li> This is a pure oil, not a serum.  </li>
            <li> You always want the pure oil with no scent.</li>
            <li> B0062SM296 Beta Naturals 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil]].  </li>
            <li> BEAUTYOILS.CO 100% Pure Argan Oil]] and</li>
            <li> B00502NMTO Aura Cacia Pure Argan Oil]].</li>
            <li> Despite the pure ingredients, this product does not seem to spread well through my hair like Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> This is the first oil that really makes your skin smooth, especially my feet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seemed to be working on my dry spots, but there really isn&#x27;t any more difference than what I saw before.</li>
            <li> it comes out super soft, shiny &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> It smells good (not perfumy – just natural, and slightly nutty)</li>
            <li> push down where you get more then needed, or pour the argan oil right onto your hands.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality Argan Oil at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It absorbed very quickly and left my skin soft, and the acne problems even eased up.</li>
            <li> Next time I run out I will order the larger size bottle for an even better savings!</li>
            <li> I imagine that it would be similar to using Moroccanoil treatment during the day, but my hair is too fine to handle it.</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;ve seen results in all other areas (moisture, acne, fine lines, etc) rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> While others have said it absorbs quickly, it certainly doesn&#x27;t for me when I apply too much.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair cut in a simple bob.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I bought this thinking it either wouldn’t do much of anything for my very oily skin or wouldn’t be pure argan oil at all.</li>
            <li> This would be great to mix into other beauty products or to rub into dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has very little smell, not unpleasant and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it everyday twice a day but its a great thing to use occasionally.</li>
            <li> If it really is argan oil?  </li>
            <li> It seems like the real deal and works well in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair and brushing it is a nightmare, until I put a bit of Argan oil in and then the brush goes through with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much and it doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy either.  </li>
            <li> I read so much about Argan oil and</li>
            <li> I really like this and</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with severe eczema for my whole life.</li>
            <li> Well after i put it on my skin, it started to smell alot like Shea butter, which is what i beleive it really in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is really upsetting because I don&#x27;t want to put defective products on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tested out effectiveness of this oil by using it alone on my whole face.</li>
            <li> but I have also used this on my whole face.  </li>
            <li> It really works very well.</li>
            <li> The price of this product is also much lower than that of competitors.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the reasonable price makes this quite the value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any reviews here referencing its use in relation to beards, so I thought I&#x27;d chime in.</li>
            <li> shipped fast and bottle was intact and just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I really like is that both product (argan oil and shea butter) add a lot of moisture and shine to your skin or your hair without ever making it look greasy and/or feel sticky and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This company sells a certified organic version of the oil at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I put it in my hair and it made it very greasy as if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a couple days.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This way I&#x27;m not using to much or wasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t real argan oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and didn&#x27;t really expect much.  </li>
            <li> But what really stuns me is the impact on my hair.  </li>
            <li> No one wants to smell like poop for any reason.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really know what to say about this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin so much since I have started using it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have seen so much on TV about Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> but I really like the feel of my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very silky.</li>
            <li> It arrived as advertised and moisturizers my face without making it really greasy.  </li>
            <li> I finish off with some pressed powder and feel moisturized, covered, and ready for the day.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> and I use probably four drops for my whole head.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Smells like cooking oil and make me break out in places I&#x27;ve never broken out before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this seems to be the same thing at a fraction of the price (and free shipping-</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I will probably keep using it until the bottle is gone but not really sold on getting more at this point.</li>
            <li> It took about a couple weeks for my skin to fully adjust to using an all-natural oil straight on my face.  </li>
            <li> With all the hype on argon oil, I really wanted to try it out without spending a ton.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, people always say that I look like a 20ish girl thanks to my argan oil.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really helped my cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous undee makeup instead of mousturizer &amp; is lasting forever</li>
            <li> My skin is soo much smoother.  </li>
            <li> If any left, I pat lightly on my face.</li>
            <li> I really like using this as a moisturizer for my hands</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about this stuff</li>
            <li> After using it for a month, I can tell no difference between it and straight olive oil.</li>
            <li> also have eczema, so my hair never gets very oily.</li>
            <li> It saves me so much time.</li>
            <li> I researched Argan oil very well before choosing this one to buy.</li>
            <li> It really is miraculous.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and keeps my skin moist whole day.</li>
            <li> The dropper allows you to control how much and where you wnat it.  </li>
            <li> I really like it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have not bought the product and don&#x27;t know much about it.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about this stuff</li>
            <li> It seems like Argan is very hit and miss for acne prone skin, some people can use it and others cannot.</li>
            <li> so this one seemed like a reasonable choice.</li>
            <li> --I used it for a week straight under my moisturizer</li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> The Slice of Nature and the ELMA&amp;SANA have the freshest odor of the four with the Slice of Nature having the stronger nutty scent of the two; skin application feels very soothing and calming in a quenching sensation sort of way.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, plus this product is organic and fair-trade certified.  </li>
            <li> It really does what it says and your hair will absolutely thank you for it , meet my expectations</li>
            <li> I put a few drops onto my palm, rub it between my hands to warm it up, and pat it alllll over my face.</li>
            <li> as with most products, it takes time (especially if you&#x27;re trying to heal old scars).</li>
            <li> as with most products, it takes time (especially if you&#x27;re trying to heal old scars).</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of essential oils and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have switched back to my old Moroccan oil as my hair seem more manageable after using it.</li>
            <li> I am sure it is not pure either as the color is strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The new bottle they sent me does not smell as rancid like the first bottle.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and nicely packed and it is half the price of what I can find locally.</li>
            <li> I also use it to  detangle my daughters hair and to tame my own flyaways.</li>
            <li> This brand smells like olive oil although its labeled 100 pure argan oil and frankly this price is too low to be true.</li>
            <li> My hair is now back to being dark, it is soft and shiny, great movement and texture.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the other brand, but wanted something cheaper</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised for a lot more money in other creams.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same quality as many of the deluxe beauty products on the market, and a larger bottle for much much less than that price!</li>
            <li> This oil arrived super fast and has made a big difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Had heard about argan oil as an ingredient in other hair/skin products, but wanted a pure, organic oil that would not be mixed with other additives that might not be as effective or healthy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Keeps ya hair and skin smooth all winter long.</li>
            <li> My face also most definitely does not smell like an old pan that hasn&#x27;t been washed well --- that old greasy smell from E&amp;S argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I woke up this morning to a fabulously soft and not oily face for the first time in, well, forever.</li>
            <li> But overall, its not bad.</li>
            <li> I love how affordable this Argan oil was compared to other sellers!</li>
            <li> It absorbs much more easily with less greasiness than any other 100% pure oils I&#x27;ve tried (olive, grape, almond).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the very least, I can testify that my skin felt moisturized and, although the oil feels more heavy when you first apply (whereas Jojoba feels very light), the feeling quickly disappears after 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Felt more oily and less absorbent.</li>
            <li> It sinks in very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands or face feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I hear that argan oil is a magic oil that is the ace in the hand of dermatological products and it has been used far and wide to cure tons of skin issues.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, yet it does not feel greasy or heavy like most oils.</li>
            <li> Using in addition to my regular moisturizer definitely keeps my skin softer and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> it was mainly around my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see it hydrated and white head free.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly to use as a leave in conditioner for my hair.  </li>
            <li> This Argan oil work really well, but you have to be careful with how much you use because it can make your hair super oily if you use too much.</li>
            <li> The price is decent.</li>
            <li> Lovely lightweight oil that I use as a daily facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> have used this argan oil on my face at night occasionally, but mostly add a drop or two to boost my SPF daily moisturizer in winter.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do you, it has a plunger type lid which makes it easy to put the exact amout that you want on your finger tips to put it on your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was highly rated and a decent price.</li>
            <li> When I shake people&#x27;s hands they always seem to linger a little longer and say that my hands are super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It seems shiny and oily when first applied but sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> Appears to be pure, slightly greasy feel that goes away within a minute and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> And the price is a fraction of what the high end stores are selling it for.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but this brand just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> But I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone looking for Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The list price of the new Argan oil I bought was close to 50% more expensive than E&amp;S, but I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> The new Argan oil left my skin extremely soft, smooth, hydrated, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It may be better as a skin moisturizer, while for use on hair, it may be better to find a Moroccan oil that is specifically a hair product to be less heavy.</li>
            <li> I have 4 other containers of argan oil in my bathroom--some more than 3 months old.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how soft it makes my skin, and that it is not greasy at all!!  </li>
            <li> I will look for another company even if it means me spending a little more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I completely recommend this product for any skin type!!</li>
            <li> this stuff feels a little like magic.</li>
            <li> I love the little dropper that comes with it, makes it easier to apply it.</li>
            <li> I really like that it comes in a 1oz (pretty blue) glass bottle with a drip syringe top to drip just the right amount each time, VS a regular bottle where you have to turn it upside down,</li>
            <li> My hair is normally very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> However, this oil works very well with my sensitive skin and the smell does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I have dry-ish/sensitive/acne prone skin, and thus far this combo has done very well for me.  </li>
            <li> was very nervous as i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is gentle and natural and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to react in any way, it just nourishes well.  </li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t tell what it does completely for me</li>
            <li> Great alternative to move expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the benefits I&#x27;ve hread of aragon oil, and I&#x27;ve been trying to go all natural, so I went straight to the source (vs. buying a hair product with this</li>
            <li> I did not even mind running errands in the car without makeup which i normally dont do.</li>
            <li> I still get a few pimples but not as many and the ones I do get seem to heal faster.</li>
            <li> oily t zone and normal cheeks.</li>
            <li> and apply normal moisturizer on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get what I normally do from argan oil.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say that all will have success with using argan oil as we all have different skin types and reactions.  </li>
            <li> If this is normal, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed the oil almost immediately and left no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> long fine limp hair can&#x27;t take most leave in conditioners without feeling sticky (wax coated) or even more dry (silicones block out the moisture over time), but this argan oil takes the frizz out of the ends with a single drop.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazingly pure oil, with no other chemicals!</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;ve seen results in all other areas (moisture, acne, fine lines, etc) rather quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry/baby fine hair</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate adult acne with combination skin.</li>
            <li> This oil has very little to no scent, comes in a great \\&quot;medicine-dropper\\&quot; bottle, and is extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li> Like many acne sufferers I have tried numerous products for my acne with limited results.</li>
            <li> Now, after a couple of months of use, my hair is repaired, long, and super moisturized even without a new application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They promptly sent me a new bottle</li>
            <li> My biggest fear wth any new product that I use on my face is that it is going to break me out since I am acne prone (</li>
            <li> Some add a fragrance to it (innocent enough) but some contain a whole litany of ingredients and argan oil is way down on the list.plus for me.  </li>
            <li> Some add a fragrance to it (innocent enough) but some contain a whole litany of ingredients and argan oil is way down on the list.</li>
            <li> It keeps the entire 28\\&quot; length smooth and shiny, even at the ends where it&#x27;s been brushed through.  </li>
            <li> I overlooked a few initial complaints because, I know this is kind of crazy, but I WANTED this product to be perfect as the vast majority of the reviews say.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed though that if I put it on my forehead area after a shower, and then dry my hair, my bangs are super oily</li>
            <li> so my skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive skin (rosacea, excema and an allergy to the sun).  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I know this one ounce bottle will go very fast, but not necessarily all on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have such dry skin since I have gotten older and this product has helped tremendously!</li>
            <li> This brand is cheaper than others I&#x27;ve seen and the exact same stuff.</li>
            <li> I believe that the results first appear after a 3-4 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> So soft afterward!</li>
            <li> I googled it and found some other websites that said the same, so I am satisfied on that account.   </li>
            <li> It is so soft and velvety like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> My eyes burn and I see more pulling and wrinkles under my eyes than usual.</li>
            <li> I get the same exact results from this oil as from hers.  </li>
            <li> Better than all skin products I usually used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick and heavy that it is definitely not the best smoothing product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Be sure to test the argan oil on a small area to see if it is compatible with your skin.  </li>
            <li> Go ahead and give argan oil a shot, but don&#x27;t buy this brand&#x27;s pretty blue bottle!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin and hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is an all natural moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> , they sent me a free bottle, no questions asked, when I emailed them after one of my bottles had a crack in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls and boys this stuff is seriously soooo worth it</li>
            <li> The argon oil makes my hair silky smooth but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or even a light odor like other oils, soaks in like Jojoba but the moisture feeling lasts longer!  </li>
            <li> I have the kind of combination skin that can feel tight and dry but have an oil slick on top.</li>
            <li> From the first application it made my hair soft and shiny, never flat.</li>
            <li> You smooth some of the oil all over your hair and comb it through, and keep it on for about half an hour before shampooing--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad greasy when you put it on, but sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly nutty scent, but it&#x27;s pleasant, not strong, and doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant enough, and the Amazon price is half that charged in my local hair salon for the same product.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit oily when you first put it on face, but after you massage it into your skin and especially around the eyes, it is gentle enough to use around the eyes, it can be obsorbed by the skin and no oily feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great product for my thin and slightly dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry hair too, I would not recommend it for oily or thin hair though.</li>
            <li> , I have also used it on extra long bleached human hair wigs to keep the deep wave patterns nice and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I have used SO many different oils for my dry hair and this is the ONLY oil that keeps my hair moisturized for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the key to making this work is using very small amount.</li>
            <li> My skin has definitely improved in appears, fine lines, and overall health since switching from my regular cream moisturizer to this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little under a week but already my skin tone is more even, my breakouts are disappearing and my skin is glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Have been applying on my face and neck (sometimes on elbows, knees, wherever feels dry on my body) almost nightly on its own for about 2 months without any other facial product.</li>
            <li> Due to some health problems my skin is dry but also extremely sensitive to many products.  </li>
            <li> After about six weeks of using it, I realized my face had been unusually clear for a number of days.</li>
            <li> My skin is even, clear, and pimple-free now.</li>
            <li> So far this is as much as I have used it for but it was enough for me to purchase another bottle.  </li>
            <li> There are several organic argan oil products out there being sold with far too high of a markup!</li>
            <li> I have acne breakouts and this helped reduce them and keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> It is said to be a natural aphrodisiac...</li>
            <li> It did miracles for my face and for about 6 weeks cleared my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> the fact that it is all natural is a plus.</li>
            <li> As far as my wrinkles at age 38, I feel it minimizes the appearance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of my natural beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> so much I bought another bigger one!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smelling OLD and rancid...</li>
            <li> I recommend this brand of natural oil for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised this worked so well.</li>
            <li> I have used this mostly around the delicate eye skin</li>
            <li> When used on my damp hair (which is naturally wavy)</li>
            <li> thought it was a miracle prouct even for sensitive skin with breakouts.</li>
            <li> i am 64 years old.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely cured.</li>
            <li> I will order this product again if it continues to work as well as it has so far.</li>
            <li> I have combination, sensitive skin with rosacea.</li>
            <li> Pay the extra money to get the real Argan oil-I&#x27;ve tried agadir brand and it did not cause breakouts/greasiness.</li>
            <li> I used way too much and had to spend extra time drying it.</li>
            <li> well, i got this product yesterday and so far i like the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have Eczema, and it does help to keep my skin soft, and I use it in my hair as well.</li>
            <li> my face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I put a few drops onto the ends of my hair and it makes them so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Out of desperation I wanted to give Argan oil a try especially after reading so much about it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old and wish I&#x27;d known about Argan oil 50 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs well into my skin and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s feeling parched, I&#x27;ll put it on overnight over my moisturizer, or during the winter I&#x27;ll mix a drop in with my moisturizing gel and my skin feels incredibly soft and quenched.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put it on my hair and scalp over the weekend occasionally when I can put my hair up for the day and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally of oily/tzone,</li>
            <li> and I have amazingly soft skin.</li>
            <li> I use 100% natural moisturizer with a couple of drops of this then mix together and apply.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> This product really prevented my skin from totally drying up and flaking.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Even my hands are wonderfully soft after rubbing it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I just use another brand I buy at walgreens which is all natural too.</li>
            <li> I guess we&#x27;ll have to wait and see if I become a wrinkle-less old lady.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented quite a bit in the last year with unnatural hair colors - which included a whole lot of bleaching and damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have young kids</li>
            <li> ladies, if you have any issues with your oil, just contact them directly.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s</li>
            <li> My face feels soft.</li>
            <li> I wake up with soft skin, hair, and hands.</li>
            <li> After a week of usage I noticed that red spots on my face disappeared, rough areas (elbows and feet) were smoother and overall, my skin had a much better appearance.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin soft, seems to decrease pores, although I don&#x27;t know how since it&#x27;s an oil.  </li>
            <li> Not so much for deep wrinkles like brackets along side of mouth.</li>
            <li> Used a few drops in my bath every night and it was enough to make my skin flawlessly soft overtime:)</li>
            <li> Keeps the ends of my hair soft between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I did not use much, but was left with stringy, flattened-down tresses.</li>
            <li> Wow.    </li>
            <li> Just a few drops rubbed between palms, then applied to hair, will make hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I have asian hair, so it didn&#x27;t very do the job</li>
            <li> My hair and skin look so much better just a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> Fatty acids are necessary to maintain healthy levels of hydration and prevent signs of premature aging of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After testing different brands of argan oil at different price points, I feel that the Elma&amp; Sana golden argan oil is not 100% argan oil.</li>
            <li> It did not seem to help very much with my dry hair, but it does well on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The Slice of Nature feels a little thicker and leaves more of a barrier on my skin whereas the ELMA&amp;SANA seems to absorb in better and be less noticeable upon touch and less sheen reflection.  </li>
            <li> waste money on Josie Maran type things, really all you need is right here for under 10.00.</li>
            <li> And after I wash it, I have to spend a ton of time with a flat iron or large curling iron to get the hair looking silky.</li>
            <li> I have seen Argan oil on many other webs and they were much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Every once in awhile I get pretty dry under my eyes...</li>
            <li> I apply it on my AA 4b/C hair with coconut, sweet almond, mayo (yes mayo) and Jamaican black castor oil for a pre-wash mask.</li>
            <li> It quickly and easily absorbs into the skin and hair without any tacky or sticky residue left behind.</li>
            <li> B005BYOVQO Moroccan Beauty Golden Argan Oil, 100% Pure, Organic, Cold Pressed, for Professional Use, 1oz-30ml]]Like the eye dropper - makes it easy to carry in makeup bag and to use anywhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The second bottle of this that I bought smelled very different than the first one--rather like olive oil--and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li> I used this consistently and thought my facial skin actually worsened.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a month, so I am not sure if I am in love with the results.</li>
            <li> The first time, I used way too much (about 9-10 drops), and my hair was heavy and oily all day.  </li>
            <li> (increased) acne and some of the fine lines around my eyes are definitely smoother and less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair argan oil really brings the BOUNCE into bouncy curls while also nourishing and protecting the hair.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other products that are the same thing-this product is significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li> (they get very dry), face (very sensitive skin), and hair (tends to be very frizzy).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially if your skin is acne prone and nothing seems to work!</li>
            <li> Overall, seems to be high quality product.</li>
            <li> That is major and life changing in itself!  </li>
            <li> I have also used it on my hands, which are normally very dry and it leaves them looking quite smooth, with no high shine.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my hair (at the ends when I need some real deep conditioning that my other favorite products will not give me the desired results) and on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will be oily all day long.</li>
            <li> A few more drops for specific coverage (elbows, feet, hands) provided enough coverage for everything else.</li>
            <li> my hair is wet, it has pretty curls.</li>
            <li> I realized it had to be the Argan oil as i have added nothing else to my current regimen, and in fact, my back has broken out while my face looks good</li>
            <li> I put some in my hair when the ends are looking dry, sparingly right out of the shower, or in larger quantities as an overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil]] may take a little getting used to if you have a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> The big problem is that it just doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as the other brand does, and despite feeling oilier, it actually has left my skin much drier.</li>
            <li> It really helps moisturize my dry winter skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If that wasn&#x27;t gross enough, it made my hair very oily.</li>
            <li> Really softens up dead ends and has hair feeling much softer and looking healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li> You only really need a tiny bit to cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use argan and tamanu oil with various essential oils as my main facial oil, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than high end brands.  </li>
            <li> It adds a nice shine, and a little weight to keep my hair tame.</li>
            <li> I mean, it doesn&#x27;t reek, but I&#x27;m very unfamiliar to how fresh Argan oil is supposed to smell.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure it is any better than the Jojoba oil I was using, so I probably won&#x27;t get this again as it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair as well and just half a dropperful for really long hair makes it silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Most likely this is not Argan oil or if it is, it&#x27;s a very small amount and diluted with another oil.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is extremely rich in essential fatty acids - Omega 3, 6 and 9.</li>
            <li> You will pay a LOT more money other places for Argan Oil, and you will have wasted your money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my fine but thick spiral curly hair which has been damaged from coloring.  </li>
            <li> This oil also sits on the skin, not absorbing as pure argan oil does.</li>
            <li> I have very problematic skin, oily in some places, very dry in others and acne prone all over.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is a little hard to find in my neck of the woods, and I thought the price was pretty good, compared to what little I have to compare to in the stores.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product as long as the quality stays high.</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough to notice much else.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E is usually the primary benefit attributed to argan oil and it seems that every supposed benefit of vitamin E over the years has eventually been debunked by further research.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t gotten to use this oil too extensively, however I have put a dab on my hair and face and am planning on continuing!  </li>
            <li> for my face i had to go back to the old brand.</li>
            <li> Next time, I scaled WAY back and only used a couple of drops, but then didn&#x27;t feel like I saw much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> i barely used any benzoyl peroxide during this</li>
            <li> It makes my skin glow and soft, especially during winter.</li>
            <li> Be careful to not apply too much, otherwise your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week and the results have completely blown me away.</li>
            <li> Until I decided to finally use it, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed up with this as a moisturizer after using my Clairsonic Mia 2 and boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li> Put it on bare lips and let it absorb then applied lipstick and my lips healed in a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to buy and use lotions from stores like Victoria&#x27;s Secret or Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> It absorbed in a couple minutes, no greasy, heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> butter (the raw, unprocessed kind) by itself is just a bit too hard to dissolve in hands, so I melt some shea butter in a bowl (for that I do not use microwave, I prefer placing the bowl in the pot of hot water).&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of jojoba oil in my conditioner when I condition my hair, but the argan oil restores my hair to a whole new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You would think putting an oil on your face in the morning would be crazy, but this absorbs so quickly and really hydrates my face without causing it to get oily or greasy right then or even later in the day.  </li>
            <li> I have discovered argan oil several years ago, and have been using it ever since both as skin and hair moisturizer... either as a stand alone, or better yet, combined with raw unprocessed shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Shea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering another bottle today( since I spilled half of my first bottle ).</li>
            <li> The other brand was 5 times the price for the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> And for the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t have to use irons or curlers to get all the strands to go the same direction and cooperate with each other.</li>
            <li> The bottle that arrived yesterday has a mild smell compared to my usual sesame seed oil, but it smells like rancid cooking oil.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing as it contains high levels of Vitamin E and essential fatty acids.  </li>
            <li> Other companies charge three times as much.  </li>
            <li> a little to early to really comment on how i feel its working for my skin  </li>
            <li> I like to mix it up with other oils (the combo with rosehip oil is a killer for an overnight skin rejuvenation), but you can also use it straight up.</li>
            <li> is that it somehow is not benefiting the native women as much as these other brands.</li>
            <li> I discovered argan oil when I received a sample of HSI Professional Argan Oil when I bought a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a daily facial moisturizer and my skin is soft and seldom get blemishes.</li>
            <li> I only tried one night but it leaves my skin very soft and same in the next morning.</li>
            <li> It does smell a little funny</li>
            <li> but the watts a little higher</li>
            <li> It did feel nice on my elbows and other rough patches, but I don&#x27;t prefer it to ordinary lotion.</li>
            <li> After being curious about it since it has become all the rage lately, I highly recommend Argan oil for is multi-purpose use &amp; results.</li>
            <li> Dry spots, and as a diaper rash preventer for my one year old!</li>
            <li> It seems more thick oily and has a slight different odor almost like old olive oil.</li>
            <li> In winter, I&#x27;m also prone to periodic bouts with something called \\&quot;peri-oral dermatitis\\&quot;...resembles eczema that first shows up as a little dry patch near the mouth.  </li>
            <li> little bit really does go a long long way, I&#x27;ve only seen positive results from</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product and it&#x27;s really worth the money.</li>
            <li> The bottle is made of glass and the bottle is a dark navy so little light enters to deteriorate the product.</li>
            <li> cannot wear this with my hair down because my hair has fine texture so it is too heavy for it.  </li>
            <li> it was definitely oilier than anything i&#x27;ve tried (normal moisturizer, jojoba oil) which is BAD because it was way oilier than after i put on the argon oil, which means that my skin was producing more oil than normal during my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Argan oil came, I noticed that it had an unpleasant smell, kind of like really old vegetable oil.  </li>
            <li> So far, I wouldn&#x27;t count on this oil alone to take care of extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally dry and sensitive during the winter but it is a combination during the summer.</li>
            <li> Helps my face be less oily and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> my skin is dry and extremely sensitive, and I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my hair, on my cuticles, on sensitive skin, after shaving, when I get dry skin around my nose...</li>
            <li> All natural and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a little bit oilier than JM, as another reviewer said her oil is more of a dry oil, and the smell is a little bit different.</li>
            <li> I have recently started straightening my naturally wavy hair, and have a friend who swears by Moroccan oil for dry ends.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my skin type is mixed -- oily at the \\&quot;T\\&quot; while dry on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> , I did the routine after shower while my hair is near dry and damp, i don&#x27;t know if it moisture enough</li>
            <li> When there&#x27;s hardly any left, I lightly rub some on my hair ends (while dry) or where ever needed, and comb through.</li>
            <li> the other brand of Argan oil came, I immediately noticed that it smelled FRESH, the smell is hard to describe, but reminiscent of a bottle of high quality EVOO.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying this despite other reviews as I now have a mostly full bottle of a waste on money.  </li>
            <li> help me a lot with my  very dry skin , It works for me so far.</li>
            <li> The 100% argan oil seems to be a little too much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone pay so much for so little elsewhere?  </li>
            <li> : Is it normal for the oil to smell slightly... rancid?</li>
            <li> Now, like a normal person, I can just wash my hair, put a little product in, and go out in public, instead of planning my schedule around when I&#x27;ll have time to use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> not sure it&#x27;s pure, but it works...</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and still getting acne (!), but this oil seems to have an anti-inflammatory property that not only doesnt make me break out worse, but seems to soothe the redness and heals the breakout much sooner.</li>
            <li> Within 2 or 3 days after starting to use this product, my face became irritated, dry and red.</li>
            <li> But with no complaints, and a low enough price to liberally cover my scalp to my dry heels without breaking the bank-</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am prone to random &#x27;attacks&#x27;, this does help in treating mild eczema/irritation on the face.</li>
            <li> but I usually have very oily skin</li>
            <li> (I just opened the bottle lately and it smelled funny.)</li>
            <li> Although almost discouraged by the first impression, I decided to try it on my skin, for at least a week before I made any conclusions about it.</li>
            <li> I want to avoid that as long as possible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a one ounce bottle, but of used just on your face it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing and actually heals some minor imperfections of the skin.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as you only need about a drop each time you apply it.</li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s 100% Argan Oil, I definitely recommend you buy it.</li>
            <li> To top it off this %100 cold pressed organic oil is less expensive from this seller than other sellers on this site who may not be selling such a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Really hydrating - with only a couple drops on the face during the cold seasons, my skin perks right up.</li>
            <li> and I think my oily facial skin is just a little too sensitive for it.</li>
            <li> One bottle will last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For my face I only need 1-2 drops, also depending on how dry it is.</li>
            <li> i haqve such dry skin</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, which gets extremely dry in winter and on my feet daily for dryness.</li>
            <li> (I have dry skin and only used 4-5 drops as directed).  </li>
            <li> I modified my regimen and started to apply this oil, then another facial moisturizing cream, to prevent the dry patches of skin situation.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try another brand when I run out of a serum that I am currently using on my dry patches.  </li>
            <li> I added this to my skin care lotion to see if it would assist with constant dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin especially in the winter when the heater is on</li>
            <li> I thiught maybe it was something wrong with me since some of the reviews said it smelled strong but sort of like olive oil</li>
            <li> Usually every cream or lotion or moisturizer I try on my face breaks me out and leaves me VERY oily and does nothing for the dry parts of my face.</li>
            <li> For my normal to dry face, after I wash with Dr Bronners, I apply a few drops.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The skin on my face feels tight and lacking of hydration so far with this product.</li>
            <li> Over the last few years i&#x27;ve bought several bottles of argan oil from several different companies.</li>
            <li> It looks and smells quite different than the other brand, which is no big problem in itself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every other week, I use roughly 1-2 full droppers on my shoulder length, medium thick hair and massage it from root to ends.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as with all natural oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m highly suggestible, and \\&quot;argan\\&quot; has been the big buzzword in the beauty world lately.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t know better I&#x27;d have thought someone was frying chicken.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first , but pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> After I placed the order, I was curious to see if this was actually the case</li>
            <li> At this point I am still unsure of how I feel about the product as I&#x27;ve not really seen anything specific about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete waste of money you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> She was surprised her skin didn&#x27;t break out with this and found that it started looking tighter after a few weeks&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and don&#x27;t react well to harsh creams or facewashes.</li>
            <li> The bottle i received is marked and will expire in a few months.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, about mid-back</li>
            <li> Be careful guys, it could do the same to you.</li>
            <li> but it want stay for long</li>
            <li> Usually this gets much worse before it gets better, but after about a week of the oil...</li>
            <li> I initially was mixing one drop with my regular moisturizer but slowly phased out my old moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that can be very unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Instead of multiple types of cleansers and moisturizers, I&#x27;m down to one moisturizer, one cleanser, and one occasional exfoliating treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It completely takes care of any dry patches I have on my face within a few days, and controls how oily my face is.</li>
            <li> This is the only source I buy it from because many other places because it is cold pressed--which means that this process keeps the nutrients the oil is meant to give the consumer.</li>
            <li> I used only a tiny amount and my hair dried looking as flat and oily as it would have if it hadn&#x27;t been washed for a week.</li>
            <li> The only reason I stopped doing this was because it took a little while for it to sink in enough for me to use a foundation over it, and I usually didn&#x27;t wake up early enough before my classes to deal with that!</li>
            <li> (have long curly hair which also tends to be dry).  </li>
            <li> I started using a little in my hair after I showered though, and that has really helped my ends and kept frizz down!  </li>
            <li> I actually can not detect any smell at all as some other users have stated.  </li>
            <li> but if does for them what it does for my face the world of other skin care products is in for a big shock.  </li>
            <li> I have a flaky part of my scalp due to eczema, it looks gross, but after diligently applying this on that part, it disappeared!</li>
            <li> side, probably due to an allergy or sensitivity rather than it actually clogging pores.</li>
            <li> (I sometimes use almond oil the same way to soften and brighten skin, and have had no problems with that) and my skin broke out, so I discontinued using it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other suggested use is as a hair treatment.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad skin, lots of breakouts, very oily and dry at the same time from using medicine for the breakouts.</li>
            <li> My usual and less expensive moisturizer worked far better.  </li>
            <li> Every other product I&#x27;ve tried on dry wig hair tends to attract dirt and dust (leaving it feeling gritty soon after washing), but this oil doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Also, love the relatively low price of this brand, but perhaps this is a bad sign?</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face which tends to be dry</li>
            <li> I used this on my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> it improved my dry spots.</li>
            <li> It helped cure some really dry areas around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I put three drops in just after I wash and three drops after I dry.  </li>
            <li> Whenever my skin gets dry</li>
            <li> It states you should put it in your hair after showering, but doesn&#x27;t state if the hair should be dry or not.</li>
            <li> is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> It helps with my eczema and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60s and have dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my legs that just seem to be so dry all the time.  </li>
            <li> and before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have veryyyy dry colored hair and this oil smoothes it out without deeling too greasy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had problem with clogged pores, blackheads, dry cheeks, and oily nose.</li>
            <li> It has transformed my dry hair, skin, and nails.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind my skin is dry and may be absorving excess oil.</li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t blow dry ) and</li>
            <li> it tends to dry my skin</li>
            <li> However, I had a dry patch on my skin from a product and it improved within a day after applying argan oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing that it healed my dry and chapped lips.</li>
            <li> but I was suffering of dry lips since I&#x27;ve been on dental braces</li>
            <li> so I put it on after I dry my hair now.</li>
            <li> I even buy it for my son who inherited my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Order arrived a few days ago, came one day later than predicted, no big deal.  </li>
            <li> My scalp has very little natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was starting to look dark brown).</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t big enough!</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY SENSITIVE skin &amp; usually break out no matter what.</li>
            <li> Like it way better than the stuff they sell at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply that has dimethicone and other artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my skin-like my hair, I also have very dry skin and the oil clears up the dry spots within minutes.  </li>
            <li> I emailed arganoilandmore to ask about this and they emailed back that this oil is raw and only the roasted or toasted oil smells nutty.</li>
            <li> then finally my skin calmed down over the winter</li>
            <li> Might seem like a very small amount at first, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be re-ordering but not too soon -- a little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it on my cuticles when they&#x27;re looking dry, and after I&#x27;ve let the oil soak in for a night, my nails and cuticles look like I&#x27;ve just had a manicure!</li>
            <li> so I always had to have a lotion by my side of the bed, now i don&#x27;t have to because my skin doesn&#x27;t get dry anymore since i started used this product!</li>
            <li> The container may be small, but I only use 2-3 drops to moisturize my entire face</li>
            <li> I can tell it will last forever too because you only have to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I use it when my hair is still wet before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I tried it on wet hair, dry hair  and in the shampoos &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li> I had previously ordered another brand of Argan oil but after reading the reviews for this I went ahead and ordered the ELMA and SANA Argan oil as I do like to try out with different brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few hours since I put it on, no dry patches of flaking skin all over my face.  </li>
            <li> patted on my very dry skin and massaged it into my scalp at night</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter and after I cleanse my face, I put a drop of this and pat it into my skin...</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry</li>
            <li> I like to mix a little in with my regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> a little goes an entire mile!!!!</li>
            <li> just a little drop put inside your palm and just apply it to the entire face for the night.</li>
            <li> I wanted a little extra moisture on my face during the winter.</li>
            <li> It was of a similar color as E&amp;S, but a little ligher.  </li>
            <li> It is odorless, with an eyedropper in the bottle, so it takes only a little bit.</li>
            <li> I had patches that were extremely greasy, and patches that were dry.</li>
            <li> Other products moist your lips temporarily and after a while they get dry and chapped again.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this oil is the smell!I only apply it at night because at first when i apply it, it smells like some sort of cheese!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for an insane value.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few drops of this Argan oil in my facial and body moisturizer for a couple days now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and already I can tell my skin is improving.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my thin curly hair.  </li>
            <li> so I am careful with which products I use...</li>
            <li> i am using it at night on my face and neck, maybe i&#x27;ll be back in a few months for an update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a few days</li>
            <li> Look at the ingredients carefully.</li>
            <li> Look at the ingredients carefully.</li>
            <li> I only put a dime size amount in my hand, rubbed my hands together, then applied it to just the ends of my hair and it immediatly felt heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> so I expected comparable product quality.  </li>
            <li> and I have not really used it a lot to tell yet.</li>
            <li> Did not really work for me.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops.</li>
            <li> Only a few drops are needed to avoid it being too greasy.</li>
            <li> i also mix a few drops with body lotion for entire body.</li>
            <li> By 5-6 my hair was wet and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> bottle lasts for months because it only takes a few drops.  </li>
            <li> I added it to everything, from my deep conditioner to just everyday moisture.  </li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair and the argan oil</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t controlled any acne, but I notice that a few acne scars have faded and no new ones have come up, even after a few major breakouts.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product during the winter season because my skin was getting unbelievably dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Usually during the dry season, putting on facial lotion stings a bit after you wash your face.</li>
            <li> also use this on my face as a moisturizer once in a while, but have to be careful because my face turns into a pimple mess if I use any oil for too long.</li>
            <li> face is a combination of dry and oily and very sensitive and this argan oil did wonders for smoothing out faint crow&#x27;s feet lines, soothing red spots and brightening my complexion.</li>
            <li> The Watts Beauty has a slight deodorized odor about it and increases my heart rate slightly upon application to my skin and appears to engage my immune system as my neck glands will swell shortly after application.</li>
            <li> Also If my hair is a little scraggly (especially if I wash and night and go to sleep with wet hair), just a couple drops in your hand and rub palms together and rub through hair - makes it shiny and less bed-heady.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makeup primer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Barely detectable, slightly like raw almonds</li>
            <li> However, I have found that it is not good for Asian hair as it makes Asian hair stick together and look oily.</li>
            <li> I was dealing with a serious acne outbreak before I started using this and that has almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> Slightly nutty, a little off, but definitely should NOT smell</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I also find that with this product a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I would suggest experimenting with other sellers due to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use small amounts of argan oil on my hair-fingertip brushing with what&#x27;s left over on my hands-</li>
            <li> prefer argan oil over any other oils, including jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!)</li>
            <li> I usually use it in the evening, especially after derma-rolling when I don&#x27;t want anything synthetic on my skin.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed:)</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> however, after changing a bunch of products and using bb cream, i started getting multiple pimples (not cystic) for the past year.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this on my hair or other parts of my skin</li>
            <li> There are probably a million other uses for this</li>
            <li> I used this for my hair and it was extremely moisturized.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other products, but this has done wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I noticed the oil is darker in color and thinner than the 5 other brands of argan oil I sampled.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy like other oils.  </li>
            <li> Once every other week, I use an exfoliating mitt (hammam mitt) and put oil on my body in the shower and scrub away.</li>
            <li> Try mixing it with your other products so you can gradually become accustomed to the texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried almond oil, coconut oil, olive oil, and other moisturizer based sprays/balms/creams and none of them feel like this in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is the small size container</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please read all the other reviews and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have ordered and used other argan oils before..</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer, I wound up throwing mine away.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not to mention I ordered this small bottle in Feb and it just ran out last week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try on my frizzy hair, I will probably never have to use any other product.</li>
            <li> other so called &amp;#34;certification&amp;#34; refers also to &amp;#34;Argan Oil from Unroasted Almonds&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this also mixes well with other oil and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> The other recommended use was as a pre-shampoo treatment, which is the one use that did work for me.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference in quality between this brand and the other except that Elma&amp;Sana is a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rub a little every morning and every night onto any and all dry patches or plaques.</li>
            <li> I started using a little on my thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I will occassionally used it for an especially dry spot my face or body also.</li>
            <li> I will also combine a few drops with my body lotion as it is helpful with eczema and dry patches.  </li>
            <li> little dry patch all gone!   </li>
            <li> I usually apply it to wet hair after showering and then after I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use only a small amount (less than a dime size in the palm of my hand) then rub my hands together and apply it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to mess around with other products or even my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to waste the purchase, I have started to use it on my hair: applying a few drops towards the ends of my long hair seems to improve the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> It last me 2 months at least.</li>
            <li> Not a fresh look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have JM&#x27;s oil and found that given the price difference, it&#x27;s just not worth purchasing anymore.</li>
            <li> and I expect it to last at least two months.</li>
            <li> I use it around my eyes as well and my dark circles have been helped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve usually been very skeptical of such products but this has been a rare find.</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with a pat of thick, creamy Cetaphil after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny and dosnt weigh down my thin hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil quality has been going down hill, smells rancid and sour like puke.</li>
            <li> you can tell by ingredients label, the color of bottle must be dark and the feel is soft, subtle and not greasing!  </li>
            <li> What it doesn&#x27;t do is weigh it down or give it the unwashed look.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve paired down my skin routine quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I also felt like my hair clumped together and weighed down after use.</li>
            <li> Unlike any other lotion I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to spend $48 on such a small amount!</li>
            <li> This seems to penetrate my skin well, but is a little &#x27;thinner&#x27; than other argan oils I have used.</li>
            <li> The other thing was the thickness of this product, it felt heavy and sat on my skin for hours</li>
            <li> However it was not a pleasant experience, as soon as you open the bottle you can make out the sharp olive oil smell.</li>
            <li> review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this oil for 2 nights in a row and have seen a slight difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smells slightly nutty, but that isn&#x27;t bothersome to me, and it goes away within a couple minutes of application.</li>
            <li> but this one has a slight smell and the watts one doesnt...</li>
            <li> This may be an oil, but it doesn&#x27;t apply like your typical skin/hair oil.</li>
            <li> previously using tarte oil, got as a gift and when it was time to refill</li>
            <li> They typically think that I&#x27;m 19-23.</li>
            <li> and I had it within less than a week.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think putting oil on your face would cause less break-outs, but in this case it does.</li>
            <li> Seriously: TWO drops moisturizes my entire face.</li>
            <li> Maybe less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has even made my whites/grays less resistant to color because it has softened them so.</li>
            <li> I purchased this argan oil based on the reviews but with slight hesitation.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t notice my split ends and my hair looks 10x less &#x27;ratty.&#x27;</li>
            <li> My skin is less shiny, and just because of the acne effect</li>
            <li> It also as a slight nutty smell to it</li>
            <li> and I use less at a time than the Watts oil.</li>
            <li> The AAA SHEA butter has a slightly musky / musty odor.</li>
            <li> This oil and doing these sorts of long oil soaks is what have taken my hair from scary dry, to mildly dry, but strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The previous band had a pump bottle that leaked down the sides and was messy.  </li>
            <li> It was a mess.  </li>
            <li> We live in a cold (-20C) and dry (&amp;#60;30% humidity) climate.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and long, but I find just 3-5 drops work fine, depending on how bad my hair is.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is pricier than others, so it would have been helpful if the bottle dropper would dispense less oil each time, so as to avoid waste.</li>
            <li> I rub a little into their hair and comb it through after washing it.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little suspicious about what I may have been getting.</li>
            <li> It took a little time to find the correct \\&quot;dosage\\&quot; for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this little guy a couple of weeks ago and use it morning and night.  </li>
            <li> One pump does the job to cover my face, neck and a little in my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled a little &#x27;off&#x27; as I was putting it in my hair</li>
            <li> It is a little too oily for me but</li>
            <li> i used it on my face and sometimes a little on my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this oil on the ends of my hair and a little throughout</li>
            <li> so it is a little too shiny for daytime use</li>
            <li> I put a little on in the morning and it lasts me throughout the day.</li>
            <li> you just need a little.</li>
            <li> I broke out a little</li>
            <li> I also thought that it was getting lighter (I have very dark hair</li>
            <li> , a few drops on my eczema-inflamed and flaking skin and it calms it down!  </li>
            <li> I also use a few drops to moisturize my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> I used all of it because i wasnt going to waste my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try and give an update on that in a few months).</li>
            <li> If I uses it everyday after washing my hair, it is too oily.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops of Argan oil does the trick.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy on my skin as olive oil, yet it provides twice the vitamin E power...</li>
            <li> I add a few drops into my lotion.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dried out from this summer&#x27;s ombre experiment and this oil makes it manageable.  </li>
            <li> I got this product a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I have used a few brands of argan oil.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin heavily or leave your skin looking shiny.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops applied to the ends of your hair is plenty.</li>
            <li> And then I started adding a few drops of argan oil.  </li>
            <li> and this product does its job well without leaving the skin feeling heavy, and greasy.</li>
            <li> If you want to save a few bucks and don&#x27;t mind smelling like a KFC grease trap, go for it otherwise, look elsewhere</li>
            <li> I just put a few drops on my hands, spread it through the ends of my hair, and wrap it in a bun overnight.</li>
            <li> I wear knee socks everyday at work and it just drys the skin out by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few drops under my reg.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into the skin in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend talked me into trying it, and it has worked wonders in this exceptionally harsh winter.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face a few times, but my skin is prone to breakouts with everything</li>
            <li> so a bottle lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> Like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a few days.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops.  </li>
            <li> hair, man I have a few uses.</li>
            <li> I apply it liberally a few times a day.</li>
            <li> I have put it on my face a few times at night</li>
            <li> Then a few days ago I knocked over the  bottle onto the table.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to waste it I applied the spilled oil to my hands, arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I could never get it to stay looking that way when it dried though.</li>
            <li> It is rather cloudy and heavy</li>
            <li> This oil has saved me from severe scarring on a few occasions.</li>
            <li> A poured some in my conditioner and a few drops in my lotion.</li>
            <li> My skin is typically pretty well-moisturized, so I use this on my eye area and at the base of my nose (where I get a little dry).</li>
            <li> I hated waking up in the morning with my face feeling super tight and dry.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure, Raw, Cold pressed.</li>
            <li> have a dry spot on my cheek that hasn&#x27;t been going away thanks to the crazy weather we&#x27;re experiencing here in California!</li>
            <li> I will be filing a complaint with amazon and also returning this product and seeing if they are actually ecocert certified which other reviewers have researched and said they are not and falsely claiming this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell right, either.</li>
            <li> OR I apply it to maintain my hairstyles to add moisture and tame</li>
            <li> but I think this one actually makes my skin feel softer and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> Over the past few years however, it has gotten out of hand.</li>
            <li> The bottle is heavy and small.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can replace my very expensive face lotion with this much cheaper and organic product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to think of a downside to the oil and the only thing I can think of is it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I have thin and dry hair.</li>
            <li> And this is coming from a girl that usually has to mess around with her hair for at least 30 mins a day.</li>
            <li> Need very little at a time.</li>
            <li> Too oily for my taste, I tried using very little at times also.</li>
            <li> It is not a pleasant smell, but I use other products on my hair along with the argan oil and the smell is not noticable once applied.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical by the small size of the bottle (one ounce) but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week</li>
            <li> It never make my hair looking thinner even if I am lazy to wash my hair in morning when I put two drops in the night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if makes any diference to use Tigi with and without this oil...</li>
            <li> Tried the oil (just a few drops!  </li>
            <li> Added this to my hair conditioner and no more straw like hair.</li>
            <li> I used this oil as a leave in treatment...put some in 30 min before I got in the shower, shampoo and condition as usual and</li>
            <li> i usually break out on my t-zone.</li>
            <li> usually 1-2 zits at any given time since puberty.</li>
            <li> but not my t-zone, where i usually get pimples.</li>
            <li> so maybe i could try just applying to my t-zone, where i usually get zits.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re weary, get a small trial/travel size.</li>
            <li> Start with SMALL amounts and work your way up.</li>
            <li> I am not sure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ve probably already heard the benefits of argan oil if you&#x27;re researching this on amazon, so click the expensive tiny bottle out of your cart and check this out!</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t have time to do reviews.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with one of the bottles I purchased a while ago</li>
            <li> I usually put it on at night since I can put a lot on and take my time letting it absorb.</li>
            <li> Has a slight nutty smell but its quite subtle.</li>
            <li> If you, like me, are unable to afford Josie Maran, this is a solid substitution.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was afraid that it would react to the oil, but it did not at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure about quality control.</li>
            <li> The small size is convenient for purse and travel.</li>
            <li> This one is likely fake.</li>
            <li> I wanted some Argan oil after purchasing a small sample of Josie Maran&#x27;s on a whim at Sephora.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I usually have to use a lot of chemicals and conditioners to get a comb through it.</li>
            <li> the past, I&#x27;ve added olive oil which helped somewhat but made me smell like a salad.</li>
            <li> (usually I get breakouts the week before my period).</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try it because it was organic, and wound up not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially on cold winter days.</li>
            <li> The weird thing was, a few hours after applying this oil, when my face stopped shining, I notice dry patches of flaking skin all over my face.  </li>
            <li> People always compliment the way that I smell due to my oil mixture (the secret of the scent is in the grapeseed oil and coconut oil).</li>
            <li> I am really shocked that I only found one other review that mentioned that this oil smells like poop.  </li>
            <li> I had been noticing that my hair looked dull and not as shiny as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to say that this product made my acne go away, but it&#x27;s hard not to give it credit.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused about the directions.</li>
            <li> Age spots fading and a very nasty burn scar has become a shadow of it&#x27;s former self after applying this daily for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> The oil i got smells old, like when vegetable oil goes bad.  </li>
            <li> packaging smelled like it was stored in a cage filled with goat, the liquid smelled horrible when i opened the container.</li>
            <li> /&gt;oh, and did I mention I put it on my nasty, creaking door hinges and now they don&#x27;t make a sound?</li>
            <li> It (surprise surprise) left my hair looking oily, but like dirty oily.</li>
            <li> I keep one jar at home in the medicine cabinet and carry another in my purse for late in the day touch ups.  </li>
            <li> It would be too thick for me for my hair</li>
            <li> too thick and for hair it doesnt work well...</li>
            <li> and I know that a lot of the time, cheaper products don&#x27;t necessarily mean they are any different or of poor quality as compared to the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> and I mean NOTHING worked for me.</li>
            <li> I believe I was allergic to the ingredients, but I&#x27;m not sure!</li>
            <li> organic argan oil is not cheap!!</li>
            <li> and I mean cracked lips.</li>
            <li> I find alot of companies are using these fancy squeeze tops to make the product appear expensive, this was not worth my money.</li>
            <li> Beware: when you use this as a hair treatment you need much less than you think you do!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, believe the hype about this.</li>
            <li> I believe it is diluted with a less expensive carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Jojoba is less expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m appalled that the Elma &amp; Sana brand would make such false claims and needless to say, I won&#x27;t be keeping this product nor buying any of their products in the future.    </li>
            <li> so...i might just buy the watts one next time even though the smell isnt too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I just got a bad apple from E&amp;S, and this is not representative of their overall quality.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally out of control frizzy, dry, curly, insane, difficult, brittle and nappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s back. :(</li>
            <li> I have purchased expensive oil in the past.</li>
            <li> I contacted this seller and had an exchange informing them that I was not happy with their product and believed it to be defective.</li>
            <li> My husband is from Morocco, he said it&#x27;s not uncommon for vendors to mix olive oil into the argan oil.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product a 5 if it would have taken away my frizzies, but alas, this was not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very mean to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it before shower because it does have slight unpleasant sent.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t seen dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> So if you hate dry, flakey skin in the winter this can be of help.</li>
            <li> Just received product today, and the bottle clearly says the product EXPIRED 12/2013!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It smells awful and rancid.  </li>
            <li> I just recently ordered this product after reading all the reviews and can honestly Im very disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t worked for me,  at all.</li>
            <li> believe that you can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the ewww-level frankness.)</li>
            <li> checked out the Josie Maran line and concluded that it was WAY too expensive.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately with this oil my skin still broke out.    </li>
            <li> It is sad how they trick you into buying this item.</li>
            <li> Even though Josie Maran is expensive, it just works for me</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will probably order this again.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too oily; in the morning my face looks as well as if I had used an expensive night cream.</li>
            <li> If it does or doesn&#x27;t, this product isn&#x27;t too expensive, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive argan oil before</li>
            <li> I was instantly skeptical.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> and I usually breakout very badly during my period.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is organic and cold pressed.  </li>
            <li> We have been having a bitterly cold winter and moisture</li>
            <li> I have tried the product over 10 times hoping that my hair would get used to it, but it just looks dirty and greasy everytime.</li>
            <li> Certified Organic Cold Pressed Argan Nut Oil for Hair &amp; Body - Morocco]]</li>
            <li> B000GS8T0Y 100% Cold Pressed Organic Argan Oil 100 ml BY AAA Shea Butter]]&lt;br /&gt;and</li>

            <li> They tried to tell me there was nothing wrong with their product and didn&#x27;t try to resolve the issue until I told them how disappointed I was in their product AND their customer service.</li>
            <li> scare its going to smell cheesy!</li>
            <li> Literally it stinks, it smelled so bad I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I noticed some reviewers stated some of the Argan oils had a bad smell.  </li>
            <li> not too bad tho, about 1-2 again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 and still prone to acne, so putting oil on my skin seemed like a bad idea.</li>
            <li> after a month, my friend told me, it&#x27;s gotta be the oil, and told me to stop using it because it looked as bad as the pimples &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed this time around and do not intend to buy again.</li>
            <li> I will definately buy this again, im almost out :(</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the bottle i bought from Amazon and already I am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> very unhappy</li>
            <li> and it smelled like crap.</li>
            <li> I thought this product wouldn&#x27;t leave the skin annoyingly oily.</li>
            <li> ALSO i hated how oily my face felt in the morning when i woke up.</li>
            <li> Also very disappointed that Amazon allows these counterfeits to be sold on their website.</li>
            <li> anyway it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> was having issues with my bottle of argan oil which smelled awful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> i have acne prone skin and is not making it worst.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just nasty.</li>
            <li> I know this affects the quality of the oil and my face smells horrible!</li>
            <li> NEVER buy this crap!</li>
            <li> This oil smells horrible.</li>
            <li> It is the worst smelling beauty product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but it smells AWFUL.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the oil it smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a vicious cycle.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product very much, it has a nice feel to it and I would re-order in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil after switching from the Mogador brand (which gave me great results but was more expensive) and I could not figure out why my face was breaking out. Finally realized it happened after I switched brands of Argan oil. Went back to the Mogador brand and my skin looks great. I will be filing a complaint with amazon and also returning this product and seeing if they are actually ecocert certified which other reviewers have researched and said they are not and falsely claiming this. Most likely this is not Argan oil or if it is, it&#x27;s a very small amount and diluted with another oil. I believe this company is a scam.  Don&#x27;t buy this oil.</li>
            <li> As I have never used argan oil before, I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s supposed to smell.  The bottle that arrived yesterday has a mild smell compared to my usual sesame seed oil, but it smells like rancid cooking oil.  How do I know if the argan oil is any good?  If it really is argan oil?  Also, love the relatively low price of this brand, but perhaps this is a bad sign?</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer.  I put it in my hair overnight and wash it out in the morning.  I also put it on my cuticles and feet.  This brand is cheaper than others I&#x27;ve seen and the exact same stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair &amp; face!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Argan Oil from 3 different companies now (the first was Josie Maran, which is outrageously expensive) and all three products are exactly the same from what I can tell.  I see no difference between this and the more expensive brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Argan oil on my face as my moisturizer and I love the results.  My skin has definitely improved in appears, fine lines, and overall health since switching from my regular cream moisturizer to this.  You would think putting an oil on your face in the morning would be crazy, but this absorbs so quickly and really hydrates my face without causing it to get oily or greasy right then or even later in the day.  I love it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I have used a few drops of this Argan oil in my facial and body moisturizer for a couple days now.  I notice a difference already.  I will update in a month.</li>
            <li> It seems like the real deal and works well in my hair.  This is a great value too since the immitators cost more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for around  a month now. I see no difference in my skin. It moisturizes nicely but don&#x27;t expect to see any miracles.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Argan oil because of its benefits to people with rosecea which I have been a chronic suffer of. I used it in conjunction with sulfur soap. The sulfur soap has a drying effect on the skin so the argan oil helps with that. It does its job well. I hear that argan oil is a magic oil that is the ace in the hand of dermatological products and it has been used far and wide to cure tons of skin issues. It is said to be a natural aphrodisiac... I can&#x27;t vouch for that though. It has done wonders for my skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this since lotions make my skin sting and turn red after shaving.  I used to use olive oil but this works better and soaks into my skin really quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my daughters, they use it on their face. They said its the best and they also use it to remove their eye makeup. Very nice product</li>
            <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> This argan oil is organic and cold pressed.  Other companies charge three times as much.  I have rosacea so my skin is very sensitive.  I love this oil!  I am amazed at how soft it makes my skin, and that it is not greasy at all!!  It does have an initial nutty smell but the scent goes away within a minute or two.  I highly recommend this.  I also use a few drops to moisturize my arms and legs.  Great deal for a great product!</li>
            <li> good for winter elbows</li>
            <li> A bargain price for such a good product. The package claims that the oil can reduce the appearance of wrinkles/fine lines, but I have not seen anything significant on my face... but I have only used it for a week. I believe that the results first appear after a 3-4 weeks of daily use. Very moisturizing as it contains high levels of Vitamin E and essential fatty acids.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was quite excited when m Argan Oil arrived.  It did miracles for my face and for about 6 weeks cleared my adult acne.  Now, it&#x27;s back. :( But I was so impressed with the oil put on an open finger wound.  I should have had stitches, but there wasn&#x27;t enough skin to stitch.  So I used the Argan Oil for the first 4 days, then alternated with Neosporin.  The Dr. said I&#x27;d have a scar...and I don&#x27;t!!  I attribute it to Argan Oil.  It also helps alot with fine lines.  I&#x27;m ordering a second bottle.</li>
            <li> This oil has very little to no scent, comes in a great \\&quot;medicine-dropper\\&quot; bottle, and is extremely hydrating. However, I have found that it is not good for Asian hair as it makes Asian hair stick together and look oily. Perhaps it works for different kinds of hair. I may still use it more sparingly in my hair, or maybe just on my cracked skin on my fingers/toes. The 100% argan oil seems to be a little too much for my hair. My hair is normally very shiny and soft. This would be great to mix into other beauty products or to rub into dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this oil since it&#x27;s cheaper than the Josie Maran brand and also it claimed to be ECOCERT cerfitied. After I placed the order, I was curious to see if this was actually the case so I emailed ECOCERT ([...]) to verify this, and 2 emails later, I have been told that this product is in fact NOT certified by ECOCERT in cosmetic or organic farming! I&#x27;m appalled that the Elma &amp; Sana brand would make such false claims and needless to say, I won&#x27;t be keeping this product nor buying any of their products in the future.    Also very disappointed that Amazon allows these counterfeits to be sold on their website.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is excellent for everyday skin maintenance and it is also wonderful for hair.  My daughter has very curly hair and brushing it is a nightmare, until I put a bit of Argan oil in and then the brush goes through with no problems.  I don&#x27;t use much and it doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy either.  I even use it in my own shorter hair for styling!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Works excellent on face and hair.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin and hair. Both my hair and skin looked healthy after using it</li>
            <li> Very nice product ....a little goes a long way! I use it on my hair overnight and my face and body! So soft afterward! Even my dry feet are looking better!</li>
            <li> I read so much about Argan oil and how good it is for your skin and wrinkles. This is an oil, so I would recommend using it at night. It is great if you have dry skin and very hydrating for the summer. I have seen Argan oil on many other webs and they were much more expensive. Like all skincare there is mo miracle for wrinkles and aging unless you have botox or surgery. I want to avoid that as long as possible. I really like this and the fact that it is all natural is a plus. As far as my wrinkles at age 38, I feel it minimizes the appearance.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it as a daily facial moisturizer and my skin is soft and seldom get blemishes. It&#x27;s also great on your hair!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well argan oil works on both my hair and skin.  It does smell a little funny but the smell dissipates after a short time.  I have thick naturally curly hair and the argan oil makes it noticeably smoother and softer.  I like to mix a little in with my regular conditioner.  I also use it on my face which tends to be dry and my skin feels smooth and moisturized.    I have also been using it on my kids&#x27; hair.  One has curly hair like me and the other has fine hair that get frizzy and fly away.  I rub a little into their hair and comb it through after washing it.  It make both their hair much more manageable and smooth.  It also works great to heal and soothe their chapped skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of my natural beauty routine.  I like it well enough.</li>
            <li> I used this on my dry winter skin. Super healing and smells good too unlike many other oils. This is a great product and worth the money. You only need one drop</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with severe eczema for my whole life. Over the past few years however, it has gotten out of hand. After some research my friend did, she suggested I try Argan Oil in hopes to finding a solution to my problem. After trying literally everything else out there, I decided it was worth a try. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and already I can tell my skin is improving. I use this in conjunction with unrefined African Shea Butter and together they make a good team. For someone who has tried everything on the market for eczema like I have, I defiantly suggest you give this product a try!</li>
            <li> It did not seem to help very much with my dry hair, but it does well on the skin.  I will say that my hair, from using those god-awful curling irons, was not in the best of shape because of the damage those styling tools can cause, and that the argan oil might work better on normal hair.  I have only been using it about three weeks as of the date of this writing which is August 8, 2011, and to be fair, it might take a bit longer to help correct very dried-out hair.  When applied to the hair and/or skin it does not leave it feeling greasy or oily--my skin looked well hydrated. It is worth the price of a bottle to see how it will work for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price.  I have purchased this several times for family members and myself.  Everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a one ounce bottle, but of used just on your face it will last a long time. I did use it on my body and I enjoyed how &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34; my skin appeared. It is also a nice hair treatment. I will probably just stay with my olive and coconut oils though-much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 8oz bottle i believe...anyway it smells horrible. packaging smelled like it was stored in a cage filled with goat, the liquid smelled horrible when i opened the container. I was so pissed because I read that argan doesnt have a smell. Well after i put it on my skin, it started to smell alot like Shea butter, which is what i beleive it really in the bottle. I find alot of companies are using these fancy squeeze tops to make the product appear expensive, this was not worth my money. I used all of it because i wasnt going to waste my money. The good review is that it felt good on my skin...i added it to my spf moisturizer and that did the trick, i would also put it on my face before bed n it improved my dry spots. I couldve bought shea butter for $5 in harlem for that though.</li>
            <li> I bought one bottle loved it so much I bought another bigger one!  Great stuff for hair and skin! Service was excellent and arrived within a few days. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Most RECENT review:&lt;br /&gt;I was having issues with my bottle of argan oil which smelled awful. I contacted this seller and had an exchange informing them that I was not happy with their product and believed it to be defective. They tried to tell me there was nothing wrong with their product and didn&#x27;t try to resolve the issue until I told them how disappointed I was in their product AND their customer service. They promptly sent me a new bottle and I was right all along about my bottle being off. The new bottle they sent me does not smell as rancid like the first bottle. It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses or anything pleasant, but rather nutty. It does still smell a bit off, but I&#x27;m going to just assume this is the way it is supposed to smell. Slightly nutty, a little off, but definitely should NOT smell rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 3 drops of the new bottle in my damp hair, dried it with a blow dryer, and my hair looked wonderful. As far as the customer service, I give it a 4 out of 5 because although there was a rough exchange between the both of us, they did end up sending me a new bottle which I am more satisfied with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd review:&lt;br /&gt;Hmm, I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week and I can&#x27;t get over the smell of it. It&#x27;s smelling OLD and rancid... This is really upsetting because I don&#x27;t want to put defective products on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to be working on my dry spots, but there really isn&#x27;t any more difference than what I saw before. I would suggest experimenting with other sellers due to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this oil for 2 nights in a row and have seen a slight difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a dry spot on my cheek that hasn&#x27;t been going away thanks to the crazy weather we&#x27;re experiencing here in California! I tested out effectiveness of this oil by using it alone on my whole face. So far, I wouldn&#x27;t count on this oil alone to take care of extremely dry skin. I&#x27;m seeing some improvement such as softness, but no miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 1 question to any Argan oil aficionado: Is it normal for the oil to smell slightly... rancid? I mean, it doesn&#x27;t reek, but I&#x27;m very unfamiliar to how fresh Argan oil is supposed to smell. So please let me know what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Great for shining hair and smooth skin.  All natural and long lasting.  I recommend this brand of natural oil for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a godsend! It is cheap and it makes my unruly, frizzy, curly/wavy (depends on the day!) hair look clean, neat, nicely bunched up/curled, and healthy. I put it on right after the shower and its ready to go from there. I don&#x27;t have to mess around with other products or even my blow dryer. I literally just brush my hair, put this oil on, and walk out the door. And this is coming from a girl that usually has to mess around with her hair for at least 30 mins a day. When I do decide to straighten my hair, I&#x27;m \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot; free. I don&#x27;t know how else to tell you to buy this!</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate adult acne with combination skin. Upon reading about all the benefits of Argan oil for a myriad of skin conditions, I  decided to try it for my acne as well as for anti-aging purposes. After about six weeks of using it, I realized my face had been unusually clear for a number of days. I did not even mind running errands in the car without makeup which i normally dont do. I still get a few pimples but not as many and the ones I do get seem to heal faster. My skin just looks better period. When i look in the mirror I can see me and not the acne. My makeup also goes on so much better and quicker without all the zit covering up and doctoring.  I realized it had to be the Argan oil as i have added nothing else to my current regimen, and in fact, my back has broken out while my face looks good (I plan to try the oil on my back next. I&#x27;ll try and give an update on that in a few months). So in total it has been about eight weeks now that I have been using the Argan oil and my skin looks better than it has in years (literally).  All I do is add three to four drops of the argan oil to my mouisterizer morning and night. My biggest fear wth any new product that I use on my face is that it is going to break me out since I am acne prone (especially an oil!)--but that did not happen at all. Like many acne sufferers I have tried numerous products for my acne with limited results. I am really surprised this worked so well. I totally did not expect it.  I also think the oil is a good price. After two months I am still not out of the one ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought a much more expensive argan oil at a well know health food grocery store. It doesn&#x27;t even compare to this product which is much cheaper and a better quality. I&#x27;m buying my second bottle and use it on my face twice a day. I have stopped buying face and eye moisturizer. Works great for me and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I guess to some people this is odorless but it smells like motor oil to me. I had read so many reviews and articles that said Argan oil has a nutty smell and taste so I was a little suspicious about what I may have been getting. I emailed arganoilandmore to ask about this and they emailed back that this oil is raw and only the roasted or toasted oil smells nutty. I googled it and found some other websites that said the same, so I am satisfied on that account.   Having said that I love the way it feels on my skin. It is very light and absorbs very easily. I am 50 years old and still getting acne (!), but this oil seems to have an anti-inflammatory property that not only doesnt make me break out worse, but seems to soothe the redness and heals the breakout much sooner. It also smoothes the fine lines I&#x27;m getting around my eyes and makes my skin almost glow. To top it off this %100 cold pressed organic oil is less expensive from this seller than other sellers on this site who may not be selling such a good quality product. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Order arrived a few days ago, came one day later than predicted, no big deal.  So far I haven&#x27;t gotten to use this oil too extensively, however I have put a dab on my hair and face and am planning on continuing!  Hair is already softer, fuller looking.  Not too sure about the face, just rubbed two drops on after cleansing at night but I love the way it feels!  Not greasy or even a light odor like other oils, soaks in like Jojoba but the moisture feeling lasts longer!  Very pleased especially considering the price.  Also, bottle is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> So I recently ordered this product because of the cheap price, but while reading some more of the reviews, I came across one from someone who said they found out that this company is not actually Ecocert Certified. Well, I decided to look into myself and went to Ecocert&#x27;s website and neither this company&#x27;s Argan oil nor the company, for that matter, are listed. Which means they&#x27;re lying to sell their product, and Amazon should not be supporting this at all.</li>
            <li> This oil goes on smooth and does not have a noticible odor.  It helped cure some really dry areas around my eyes.  I have used this mostly around the delicate eye skin but I have also used this on my whole face.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cure\\&quot; aging skin but it does help to keep it hydrated.</li>
            <li> Great product for my thin and slightly dry hair.  It took a little time to find the correct \\&quot;dosage\\&quot; for my hair.  If I uses it everyday after washing my hair, it is too oily.  The best for me is 3 drops every other day.  It makes a noticable improvement.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing oil. I have thin and dry hair. It really works very well. It never make my hair looking thinner even if I am lazy to wash my hair in morning when I put two drops in the night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for the longest time, and nothing- and I mean NOTHING worked for me. This did.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little under a week but already my skin tone is more even, my breakouts are disappearing and my skin is glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste money on Josie Maran type things, really all you need is right here for under 10.00.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair &amp; my skin! I have combination skin which is a nightmare sometimes. But this oil is not greasy at all, just makes my skin look really healthy &amp; radiant after I take my make-up off at night. When used on my damp hair (which is naturally wavy) it comes out super soft, shiny &amp; straight. Great as a shine serum on dry hair too. After being curious about it since it has become all the rage lately, I highly recommend Argan oil for is multi-purpose use &amp; results. And the price is a fraction of what the high end stores are selling it for. So glad I took a chance &amp; wasn&#x27;t scared off by the lower price of this brand.</li>
            <li> Within 2 or 3 days after starting to use this product, my face became irritated, dry and red. Not wanting to waste the purchase, I have started to use it on my hair: applying a few drops towards the ends of my long hair seems to improve the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3 days. The product is superb and already by skin feels brighter and smoother. The price of this product is also much lower than that of competitors. I highly recommend this. I&#x27;ve usually been very skeptical of such products but this has been a rare find. I use this oil in combination with Jojoba oil to control my acne. I&#x27;ve found Jojoba oil to be great at preventing acne and this oil is very good at smoothening the skin. The Jojoba oil brand I use is Dessert Essence which is found at most Trader Joe&#x27;s or Whole Foods Store.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my thin curly hair.  However, it works great on my cuticles!</li>
            <li> received my argan oil about 2 weeks ago. i make  home made whipped shea butter for my hair to help soften and seal in moisture. i wanted to add the argan oil to my mixture because its said that the oil helps retain  and hold moisture in the hair. it did just that. all i did was add about a tsp to the shea butter mix that i already had made up and after applying to my hair i could sooooooo tell a difference. my hair had more shine and felt a lot softer. i also use it on my skin. this brand comes with a dropper so i only use about 3 drops for my entire face and 1 drop  per eyelash line. a little goes an entire mile!!!! a little to early to really comment on how i feel its working for my skin  but i will say that i do have acne breakouts sometimes and using any oil can worsen the issue but no problems yet!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use a combination of oils to clean my face, and I use this Argan oil to moisturize afterward. Believe it or not, my skin has NEVER BEEN BETTER. Never. Ever. I had patches that were extremely greasy, and patches that were dry. My skin is even, clear, and pimple-free now. Just a few drops of Argan oil does the trick. Seriously, a little goes a looooong way, and 1oz is a great value. Smells slightly nutty, but that isn&#x27;t bothersome to me, and it goes away within a couple minutes of application. I started using a little on my thin, straight hair. Detangles it, but doesn&#x27;t make it greasy. BUY THIS STUFF. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil because I was about to hit the \\&quot;submit\\&quot; button on an order from a hair care company and almost paid 3x&#x27;s the amount when I remembered AMAZON. I love this site. The oil is excellent. I use it in conjunction with a couple of others for  an amazing treatment for my hair. It&#x27;s made such a difference. I am going to order a larger quantity so that I don&#x27;t run out. It&#x27;s great used daily.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is all the rage and in so many products now. I read the reviews and some people thought it was a miracle prouct even for sensitive skin with breakouts. This stuff is awful. It made me feel oily and did not absorb and I got some acne as a result of the product. I stopped using all over my face and just use a tiny amount under my eyes at night for some moisture. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very problematic skin, oily in some places, very dry in others and acne prone all over. I had been resistant to trying an oil based moisturizer, but got a free sample of argan oil through sephora. It was a different brand, and I loved it. It absorbed very quickly and left my skin soft, and the acne problems even eased up. I bought another full bottle of that other brand through sephora and was very happy with it, except for the fact it was so expensive. So, I was excited when I saw Elma &amp; Sana argan oil for so much cheaper, while still being ecocert certified. Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t worked for me,  at all. It looks and smells quite different than the other brand, which is no big problem in itself. The big problem is that it just doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as the other brand does, and despite feeling oilier, it actually has left my skin much drier. It also made me break out quite a bit. I even tried taking a break from using it for a week, and then using it again, but the acne flared back up again with it.  I had high hopes, but this brand just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. I might just try using it for my hair or as body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have doubt if this product do any better to my hair. I&#x27;m a curly woman and I use Tigi curlesque with some drops of golden argan oil. I&#x27;m not sure if makes any diference to use Tigi with and without this oil...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Estee&#x27; Lauder advanced night time eye repair for years.  It is $50 for 1/2 ounce.  I bought this little guy a couple of weeks ago and use it morning and night.  My eyes look great and I keep getting carded for wine :).  I read somewhere that argan oil was great for wrinkles/anti-aging.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try and what a buy at $8.99 and free shipping!!!  Goodbye Estee&#x27; Lauder.  This is also great for your hair.  I put three drops in just after I wash and three drops after I dry.  My hairdresser is getting all of her clients to start using this.</li>
            <li> I love Golden Argan Oil.  I mix it with coco butter and put on my clean face. I look so much younger.  i am 64 years old.</li>
            <li> Such a great oil ! Whenever my skin gets dry I put some of this on and it&#x27;s completely cured. It&#x27;s super moisturizing so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it everyday twice a day but its a great thing to use occasionally. I also mix it with my foundation make up and it keeps my makeup from caking and my skin fresh looking. I would definitely recommend this if you need a moisturizer to mix with an spf or makeup. Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, in great packaged condition, no spills or complaints. Will be using this as an ingredient in my homemade cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It has done wonders for my skin and my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great multi-purpose oil that can be used for skin and hair. I use it to smooth frizz and protect from heat styling tools, but my sister swears by it as a moisturizer. High quality, clean scented oil with no chemical additives. Love it.</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to be purchasing the most expensive argan oil, because everyone else is using it. I am on a budget and I know that a lot of the time, cheaper products don&#x27;t necessarily mean they are any different or of poor quality as compared to the expensive brands. And that was the case here. I love this oil and I love that I&#x27;m getting it at a good price.</li>
            <li> There are a lot more expensive varieties of argan oil out there, but I have personally found no difference in the way they work.  I use argan and tamanu oil with various essential oils as my main facial oil, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than high end brands.  I also use small amounts of argan oil on my hair-fingertip brushing with what&#x27;s left over on my hands- and it helps it shine and keeps the ends from flying around so much (I have fine hair).</li>
            <li> I have eczema, and things with odors tend to give me a headache. However, this oil works very well with my sensitive skin and the smell does not bother me at all. This oil is a fantastic moisturizer and I highly recommend it. Furthermore, the reasonable price makes this quite the value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;The second bottle of this that I bought smelled very different than the first one--rather like olive oil--and does not absorb well. I am quite disappointed this time around and do not intend to buy again.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  I use on my legs and arms.  It would be too thick for me for my hair and I cannot use oil on my face.  But I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy on my skin as olive oil, yet it provides twice the vitamin E power... This oil is amazing, it has helped me heal fast after a peeling, heal some irritated skin and blemishes, and I hope in the long run it will literally stop my ageing. I like to mix it up with other oils (the combo with rosehip oil is a killer for an overnight skin rejuvenation), but you can also use it straight up.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and I am very pleased with the results.  This is the first oil that really makes your skin smooth, especially my feet.  I add a few drops into my lotion.  Can&#x27;t wait to use on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly helpful for someone that has experienced a lot of sun. It&#x27;s soothing and actually heals some minor imperfections of the skin. I will buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil was delivered to the house very quickly.  It works great on my skin and hair.  Wish I had known about this product years ago.  I would highly recommend for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it to moisturize at night and it has never caused a break out (and I have acne-prone skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware: This comes in a glass bottle. I eventually knocked mine onto the tile floor and it broke. I liked it enough to re-buy, though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my hair since I purchased it (about a month now). At this point I am still unsure of how I feel about the product as I&#x27;ve not really seen anything specific about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another brand of Argan oil for over a year. From the first application it made my hair soft and shiny, never flat. The first time I used this Argan oil I used only a tiny amount and my hair dried looking as flat and oily as it would have if it hadn&#x27;t been washed for a week. Yuck. it might do a better job on skin, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if the Josie Maran argan oil was worth the price, and I ended up returning the Josie Maran because the Elma &amp; Sana oil is just as good. It is definitely a little bit oilier than JM, as another reviewer said her oil is more of a dry oil, and the smell is a little bit different. Overall, though, it still has the same moisturizing benefits. I use it mostly at night, alone or underneath a cream. I have combination/dry skin with drier skin in the winter and hormonal breakouts, and this keeps my skin from flaking. It hasn&#x27;t controlled any acne, but I notice that a few acne scars have faded and no new ones have come up, even after a few major breakouts. I also use this on my lips and cuticles, but haven&#x27;t yet on my hair because it&#x27;s more oily than dry.</li>
            <li> Guy here. This stuff is great for beards. I didn&#x27;t really see any reviews here referencing its use in relation to beards, so I thought I&#x27;d chime in. It smells good (not perfumy – just natural, and slightly nutty), you only need a drop or two on your hands and from there you can easily spread it into your beard. Relieves any itchiness, moisturizes the skin under your beard, adds a nice shine, probably helps prevent ingrown hairs, and lets you comb and shape your beard a lot easier with less snags. One bottle will last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a haircut recently, but I used this on my hair when it was substantially longer, and it does the trick as well. Adds a nice shine, lets you comb and brush through it really easily, and helped to smooth down split ends and stray hairs. It&#x27;s a good way to add a nice shine to your hair without putting weird gunk in your hair or making it look too shiny or anything like that. Doesn&#x27;t add any weight, just a healthy-looking sheen.</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price! I am adding this oil to my hair conditioner and it has tamed and moisturized my color-treated, dry, frizzy hair beautifully. Will definitely be re-ordering but not too soon -- a little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 5 days and so far it is wonderful.  I actually can not detect any smell at all as some other users have stated.  I use it on my face, around eyes and lips.  My skin feels super soft, almost velvety.  I will order this product again if it continues to work as well as it has so far.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, yet it does not feel greasy or heavy like most oils. It just soaks right in and makes everything feel softer right away. I was a little confused about the directions. It states you should put it in your hair after showering, but doesn&#x27;t state if the hair should be dry or not. I just assume it doesn&#x27;t matter. It works best for me when my hair is damp. My hair is very thick and long, but I find just 3-5 drops work fine, depending on how bad my hair is. I just drop the oil in my palm, rub my hands together, then work it through my hair. I don&#x27;t put very much at my roots. For my face I only need 1-2 drops, also depending on how dry it is. I do not recommend using under the eyes. It made a lot of sties and tiny bumps form when I tested it. Might seem like a very small amount at first, but a little goes a long way. It last me 2 months at least.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now, my skin is softer, my hair is shiny and silky, overall, this is a great product. I noticed that my eczema is much better as well, almost cleared up. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am very mean to my hair.  I try to avoid heat styling, but it is bleached white so this alone is abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every other week, I use roughly 1-2 full droppers on my shoulder length, medium thick hair and massage it from root to ends. After it is massaged in, I lightly brush it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I wrap it in a bun and let is sit in my hair for 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that sounds gross, but this is what has stopped my hair from breaking.  This oil and doing these sorts of long oil soaks is what have taken my hair from scary dry, to mildly dry, but strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer argan oil over any other oils, including jojoba oil.  I mix a few drops of jojoba oil in my conditioner when I condition my hair, but the argan oil restores my hair to a whole new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hair isn&#x27;t perfect, I&#x27;m positive if I keep using the argan oil, and perhaps a bit more frequently, my hair will feel soft and be healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot wear this with my hair down because my hair has fine texture so it is too heavy for it.  But it adds a pretty shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my face as a moisturizer once in a while, but have to be careful because my face turns into a pimple mess if I use any oil for too long.</li>
            <li> I am using it for two weeks and I think it makes may hair more shine and soft. I did not see might change in volume.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. an excellent one. very good for your face skin ! just a little drop put inside your palm and just apply it to the entire face for the night. amazing !  In Morocco where it come from the indigene use it for everything even for internally purposes.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my night time moisturizer.  Complexion is smooth and silky. Have not used long enough to notice much else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing great things about Agran oil and didn&#x27;t want to shell out the money for the Moroccan brand ones.  I have not tried them, but I can&#x27;t imagine they work better than this.  My hair was dried out from this summer&#x27;s ombre experiment and this oil makes it manageable.  It doesn&#x27;t heal my split ends (not even God can fix split ends), but it does hydrate the hair and make it shiny and healthy.  When I got it, I put it on the ends of my hair and ran my hands throughout (not at the roots) and slept overnight.  I shampooed and conditioned in the morning.  It wasn&#x27;t a miracle, but it was the best experiment that I&#x27;ve had with a simple product.    It does have an oil smell.  There are no added fragrances though.</li>
            <li> shipped fast and bottle was intact and just as advertised.  Argan oil is a little hard to find in my neck of the woods, and I thought the price was pretty good, compared to what little I have to compare to in the stores.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005BYOVQO Moroccan Beauty Golden Argan Oil, 100% Pure, Organic, Cold Pressed, for Professional Use, 1oz-30ml]]Like the eye dropper - makes it easy to carry in makeup bag and to use anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have combination, sensitive skin with rosacea. I bought this product due to a recommendation and I&#x27;m glad that I did! Granted, I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week, but my skin feels softer and smoother. It goes on light and absorbs quickly. The container may be small, but I only use 2-3 drops to moisturize my entire face so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last quite a while.</li>
            <li> i bought both watts beauty oil and this one...both are very good, awesome w/ wrinkles and moisturization but this one has a slight smell and the watts one doesnt...so...i might just buy the watts one next time even though the smell isnt too bad. i think i recommend both but the watts a little higher</li>
            <li> Use this product day and night.  Absorbs quickly and very effective. It also works well on hair and hands. Second time ordering.</li>
            <li> I liked this alot. Did not feel greasy. I like to use it at night</li>
            <li> I first bought this product during the winter season because my skin was getting unbelievably dry and uncomfortable. My skin is naturally dry and sensitive during the winter but it is a combination during the summer. Usually during the dry season, putting on facial lotion stings a bit after you wash your face. This product doesn&#x27;t give me that feeling whatsoever. I believe my skin is prone to acne too so I am careful with which products I use... but my face is 99% clear and blemish free. (Obviously it isn&#x27;t because of the Argan oil, but the point is that the Argan oil doesn&#x27;t exasperate my skin to have acne.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is absolutely amazing! After I wash my face, I use 2-3 drops and lightly pat it on my face. It&#x27;s light and non-greasy with no odor whatsoever. If you put it on before bedtime, be prepared to be amazed with the texture of your skin the next morning. It is so soft and velvety like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really works! great to use on hair, face and body even nails.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the difference even after just first use. skin is soft and smooth. hair are silky.</li>
            <li> this product does not smell. i ordered a different one once and it smelled like crap. very unhappy but this product i have purchased several times without any problems with smell. i use this on my ends of my hair and my entire face. great benefits to hair, nails and face</li>
            <li> 100% pure virgin argan oil is one of the best products I have ever used, and this one is superior. I use it on my face, my scalp, my hands and nails.  It is not greasy or oily and absorbs quickly. I like that it is in a cobalt blue bottle to protect the integrity of the product. It is fragrance free which is an added bonus!  This size is perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> I have used this before and have come back to it.  Makes my skin feel soft and seems to reduce fine lines</li>
            <li> I bought  this oil because the price was really good and I use another brand of Argan oil for my face which is costly so I thought I would give this oil  a try because the price was good. i didn&#x27;t like this brand  for my face i had to go back to the old brand. i didn&#x27;t return the product so I decided I would use this oil for my hair which works better.</li>
            <li> I immediately fell in love with this oil after the first time using it. I use it on my hair and my face. It makes both my real hair and my extensions feel so soft and healthy. And I add 2 drops of it to my face moisturizer every morning and it makes my skin feel like velvet. I can tell it will last forever too because you only have to use a small amount. I&#x27;ll be using this for the rest of my life no doubt.</li>
            <li> I have discovered argan oil several years ago, and have been using it ever since both as skin and hair moisturizer... either as a stand alone, or better yet, combined with raw unprocessed shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter (the raw, unprocessed kind) by itself is just a bit too hard to dissolve in hands, so I melt some shea butter in a bowl (for that I do not use microwave, I prefer placing the bowl in the pot of hot water).&lt;br /&gt;Then I add argan oil (sometimes also raw organic coconut and/or avocado oil) and a hint of organic lavender oil to create the best natural skin and hair product I have experienced so far.&lt;br /&gt;It also makes a great and unique home made gift for any girlfriend on your list, and I have reaped success with a gift like that repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is that both product (argan oil and shea butter) add a lot of moisture and shine to your skin or your hair without ever making it look greasy and/or feel sticky and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have used this particular brand of the oil and find it of a very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> After viewing the number of ways in which Argan Oil can be used on one of those home shopping networks that has a &amp;#34;Q&amp;#34; in their name I thought I would have to pay $48 plus shipping for a 1.7 ounce bottle of this miracle worker.  I did try their Argan Oil sticks and their scent was offensive to me.  I thought I&#x27;d see if I could find a quality Argan Oil at a better price, read the reviews on this Elma &amp; Sana and bought my first bottle.  The oil got my cuticles into shape, healed my hangnails and softened my hands.  So far this is as much as I have used it for but it was enough for me to purchase another bottle.  This is a high quality Argan Oil at a very reasonable price.  Why would anyone pay so much for so little elsewhere?  By the way, at night I rub the oil into my cuticles and then mix some in with my regular hand cream and apply cotton gloves.  My hands have never been softer nor my nails in better condition.</li>
            <li> Had heard about argan oil as an ingredient in other hair/skin products, but wanted a pure, organic oil that would not be mixed with other additives that might not be as effective or healthy on the skin.  This company sells a certified organic version of the oil at a reasonable price.  They also delivered very quickly...the oil arrived the next day.      Tried the oil (just a few drops!  A little goes a long way!) patted on my very dry skin and massaged it into my scalp at night (have long curly hair which also tends to be dry).  The results have been amazing.  My hair and skin look so much better just a few weeks later. In winter, I&#x27;m also prone to periodic bouts with something called \\&quot;peri-oral dermatitis\\&quot;...resembles eczema that first shows up as a little dry patch near the mouth.  There was a patch just developing when I received the oil.  Usually this gets much worse before it gets better, but after about a week of the oil...little dry patch all gone!   I can&#x27;t recommend the oil or the company more highly.</li>
            <li> I love how affordable this Argan oil was compared to other sellers! I have eczema, and it&#x27;s a soothing relief for my skin. I love the nice glow it gives my face afterward also. It smells a bit funny at first, but the smell goes away quickly and isn&#x27;t too bothersome.</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil, I put it on my face, no breakout, I have read a lot of reviews about Argan oil and some people said they have experienced the worst breakout. I have combination skin and very easy to breakout, however, I have been using this oil as moisturizer for a week and experience no breakout. It is a bit oily when you first put it on face, but after you massage it into your skin and especially around the eyes, it is gentle enough to use around the eyes, it can be obsorbed by the skin and no oily feeling afterwards. I do not have many wrinkles, so I cannot commend on the Anti-aging benefits. Anyway, I like it and I will purchase it again, it is also good to use it on hands and body, I used oil on my legs, because no lotion or cream can do a better job on moisturizing my super dry legs in winter. I always think oil is a better moisturizer than lotion or cream, it is much easier for oil to be absorbed by skin than any lotion and cream and had a better result.</li>
            <li> Added this to my hair conditioner and no more straw like hair. Also added to face moisturizer and skin looks healthier and supple. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Bought this in preparation for the winter. Have been applying on my face and neck (sometimes on elbows, knees, wherever feels dry on my body) almost nightly on its own for about 2 months without any other facial product. Works great as a moisturizer, really does the job, and sometimes I notice it gives me a rosy glow. I have sensitive skin and am prone to random &#x27;attacks&#x27;, this does help in treating mild eczema/irritation on the face. Easy to use with the dropper, no mess, no unpleasant smell. No cons actually. Awesome product overall.</li>
            <li> this is my first bottle of argan oil and i love it. i have acne prone skin and is not making it worst. i recomended once you try it i&#x27;m sure you are going to love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product: it is made in Morocco for American company. My skin is glowing after using it. Great for dry hair too, I would not recommend it for oily or thin hair though.</li>
            <li> I got this product a few days ago. My eyes burn and I see more pulling and wrinkles under my eyes than usual. The burning might just be me. I do find a lot of products burn my eyes and I go through a lot of Q-tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin on my face feels tight and lacking of hydration so far with this product. It&#x27;s an oil so it&#x27;s not the greatest for wearing eye makeup and having my face look fresh. I mixed it with moisturizer this morning. Same results. Not a fresh look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle came with a pump. One pump does the job to cover my face, neck and a little in my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably just try using it at night with a night cream to give it a chance. Not around my eyes anyway. Don&#x27;t like the eye burn.</li>
            <li> First of all I purchased this oil from Amazon based on the reviews I did not expect it to be so good. My face is just amazing using I also use it on my hair . Sometimes for the face I combined it with the avocado oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this in combination with True Radiance A&amp;C Serum that is also a wonder serum.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Anti-wrinkle-Exfoliating-Rejuvination-True-Radiance/dp/B0027EJIZK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG My face has never been so smooth. I will never buy another moisturizer again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried this before please do so.  Argan Oil is extremely rich in essential fatty acids - Omega 3, 6 and 9. Fatty acids are necessary to maintain healthy levels of hydration and prevent signs of premature aging of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please purchase this and give it a try.</li>
            <li> Good natural product!</li>
            <li> I have used a few brands of argan oil.My husband is from Morocco, he said it&#x27;s not uncommon for vendors to mix olive oil into the argan oil. This brand smells like olive oil although its labeled 100 pure argan oil and frankly this price is too low to be true. I put it in my hair and it made it very greasy as if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a couple days. My face broke out the day after I started using this brand. Pay the extra money to get the real Argan oil-I&#x27;ve tried agadir brand and it did not cause breakouts/greasiness. Spend the extra money for a good product.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!!! I had been noticing that my hair looked dull and not as shiny as it used to be. I also thought that it was getting lighter (I have very dark hair and it was starting to look dark brown). I used this oil as a leave in treatment...put some in 30 min before I got in the shower, shampoo and condition as usual and OMG!!! My hair is now back to being dark, it is soft and shiny, great movement and texture. I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff. Works well as a cuticle oil too. I will occassionally used it for an especially dry spot my face or body also. Every once in awhile I get pretty dry under my eyes...put a bit of this stuff on and it&#x27;s gone in no time. This may be an oil, but it doesn&#x27;t apply like your typical skin/hair oil. It soaks in quickly with no greasy feel or residue. Another bonus is that it has no noticeable odor.   Beware: when you use this as a hair treatment you need much less than you think you do!!! The first time I did it I used way too much and had to spend extra time drying it. It is also helpful to shampoo 2x right after the treatment to get any residual out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I am going to send to relatives as surprise gifts.  My skin feels better in just 2 days.  Great for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I ordered this argan oil! It is great quality and has no smell. It quickly and easily absorbs into the skin and hair without any tacky or sticky residue left behind. I use argan oil every day on my face and in my hair. It is awesome at sealing out humidity and making my hair super soft and shiny. Love it!</li>
            <li> I wish it&#x27;d absorb into my skin much better but I can&#x27;t use it during the day, it just leaves my skin too greasy. I usually use it in the evening, especially after derma-rolling when I don&#x27;t want anything synthetic on my skin. Other than the good feeling of using something natural I can&#x27;t report any glorious results.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my face (just a few drops) after every shower, it seems to have cleared my skin up and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated, it has a sweet smell that is very light and pleasant. I will definately buy this again, im almost out :(</li>
            <li> Over the last few years i&#x27;ve bought several bottles of argan oil from several different companies. I&#x27;m not shy to say this one is a top contender. I really like that it comes in a 1oz (pretty blue) glass bottle with a drip syringe top to drip just the right amount each time, VS a regular bottle where you have to turn it upside down, push down where you get more then needed, or pour the argan oil right onto your hands. This way I&#x27;m not using to much or wasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I recommend this is because it&#x27;s not overly oily. It doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin heavily or leave your skin looking shiny. When I apply it to my hair it makes it appear more healthy and vibrant, And soft as silk. What it doesn&#x27;t do is weigh it down or give it the unwashed look. Another bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t have a over powering scent so this would be great for men too in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit really does go a long long way, I&#x27;ve only seen positive results from Iso g Elms&amp;Sana 100% pure organic Argan oil from Morocco and I know you will receive the same great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item free in exchange for my honest opinion. Everything stated is 100% truthful and my own personal views. Regardless I only recommend products or services I use/used personally and believe is a good product.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t real argan oil. I will never purchase this brand again.  It&#x27;s a complete waste of money you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> I used this consistently and thought my facial skin actually worsened.  I would not recommend buying this despite other reviews as I now have a mostly full bottle of a waste on money.  It helped nothing.  My usual and less expensive moisturizer worked far better.  This was a &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; that I should not have tried.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! I use it to moisturize my hair after washing it with ghassoul clay. Just don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will be oily all day long. Just a few drops applied to the ends of your hair is plenty.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it for my hair and skin daily and it has helped a lot for my RA.</li>
            <li> smells good&lt;br /&gt;hydrates hair especially when combined to dilute hairspray&lt;br /&gt;Also good for hydrating skin...I dilute this with grapeseed oil.</li>
            <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as others I have tried. It seems more thick oily and has a slight different odor almost like old olive oil. Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  I would recommend this to anyone who would like to prevent aging or reverse the process.  The results are undeniable.  I told no one that I was using this product yet I received many remarks about how much better I looked and what was I doing.......</li>
            <li> I have been looking for pure argan oil for a while now...most companies sell it, but argan oil is like the 6th product listed on the bottle...I have very dry skin in the winter and after I cleanse my face, I put a drop of this and pat it into my skin...this is wonderful and I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed:)</li>
            <li> well, i got this product yesterday and so far i like the way it feels on my skin.  i am using it at night on my face and neck, maybe i&#x27;ll be back in a few months for an update.</li>
            <li> Really nice oil that is drt and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.  Smells nice enough too.  Soaks into skin nicely.  If you use on hair just a couple drops is needed.  I use it on hair at night before bed and then wash out in morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a year now. I decided to go all natural with my hair products and have been shampoo, conditioner and leave in product free for almost a year. My hair looks very healthy. Family members have commented on how healthy, shiny and thicker my hair looks. The Argan Oil helps manage frizziness and keeps my hair looking healthy and smooth. Just three or four drops applied to the ends after I shower is all I need.</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a month, so I am not sure if I am in love with the results. It feels nice, great packaging and easy to just get the couple of drops that you need without making  a mess or wasting product. I particularly am enjoying using it on my nails/cuticles.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair. Its very light. Leaves my hair soft and shiny and dosnt weigh down my thin hair</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and didn&#x27;t really expect much.  Vitamin E is usually the primary benefit attributed to argan oil and it seems that every supposed benefit of vitamin E over the years has eventually been debunked by further research.  So I don&#x27;t know what makes this so effective but it is amazing.  Using in addition to my regular moisturizer definitely keeps my skin softer and more hydrated.  But what really stuns me is the impact on my hair.  I&#x27;ve colored my hair for more than 20 years (started turning gray at 19!) and have always had a problem keeping it moisturized and looking nice.  I started using a leave in conditioner (Loreal&#x27;s sulfate free) which helped.  And then I started adding a few drops of argan oil.  OMG.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it makes.  Now my hair is always soft, silky, shiny with no frizz or fly away but lots of body.  And best of all for the first time in my life I have overheard people commenting on how beautiful my hair is! (It is long and my stylist does an amazing job with the color).  Sigh.  Why couldn&#x27;t I have had this hair in my teens and twenties?  :-)</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my mixture of oils for my hair, and skin. Its FANTASTIC and well work the price. A little bit goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> I love using Argan oil on my face. I have very sensitive skin and this product does its job well without leaving the skin feeling heavy, and greasy. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have recently started straightening my naturally wavy hair, and have a friend who swears by Moroccan oil for dry ends.  I found this one and it was a good price, so I ordered.  The first time, I used way too much (about 9-10 drops), and my hair was heavy and oily all day.  Next time, I scaled WAY back and only used a couple of drops, but then didn&#x27;t feel like I saw much of a difference.  This is a pure oil, not a serum.  It may be better as a skin moisturizer, while for use on hair, it may be better to find a Moroccan oil that is specifically a hair product to be less heavy.</li>
            <li> Literally it stinks, it smelled so bad I threw it out. No one wants to smell like poop for any reason.</li>
            <li> When I started using argon oil for my skin, I used the high-priced designer oils, like Josie Maren. It was good stuff, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much money for a product that quickly became part of my daily regimen. After some research I found the Elma &amp; Sana oil and have never looked back. It&#x27;s a great value for the money, fair trade, and you&#x27;re getting 100% argon oil. So I highly recommend it. No need to spend lots of money on fancy name brand argon oil ever again!</li>
            <li> I use Argan oil on my skin.  I have Eczema, and it does help to keep my skin soft, and I use it in my hair as well.</li>
            <li> I thought this product wouldn&#x27;t leave the skin annoyingly oily. After a while of using it, it works well for the hair. Also, my fingernails look healthier, but personally I dont like using it in my face. Overall its nice.</li>
            <li> My mother and I have very different skin -- her&#x27;s is prone to break-outs and mine is extremely dry.  She was surprised her skin didn&#x27;t break out with this and found that it started looking tighter after a few weeks&#x27; use. This oil has dramatically evened out my skin tone, reduced bags under my eyes, and even made my lips look better.  I cannot imagine using another moisturizer after trying out a bottle of this!</li>
            <li> No smell.  I noticed some reviewers stated some of the Argan oils had a bad smell.  This wasn&#x27;t the case with the Elma &amp; Sam.  Great oil.  Good quality.  Love it.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> You will pay a LOT more money other places for Argan Oil, and you will have wasted your money.  This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Does wonderful things for your skin.  You will see a positive difference after using this oil.  Very pleased with it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> i am in my mid 20s, asian and have combination skin. oily t zone and normal cheeks. i usually break out on my t-zone. usually 1-2 zits at any given time since puberty. however, after changing a bunch of products and using bb cream, i started getting multiple pimples (not cystic) for the past year. then finally my skin calmed down over the winter and it went to 2-3 zits at any given time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i started using this a couple months after that, but i still wanted to get rid of all the acne for once. i also wanted to wean off my dependence on benzoyl peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I gave this oil a 1 month trial period. i applied 5 drops on my hand (just washed) and rubbed it all over my hand and them i pat my face. i barely used any benzoyl peroxide during this period!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at first it seemed to be ok. after a week of use, i stopped getting pimples! so yes it did help with my pimples.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, i got multiple oil bumps that were never there before. it was mainly around my cheeks. after a month, my friend told me, it&#x27;s gotta be the oil, and told me to stop using it because it looked as bad as the pimples &#x3D;/ i was also scared that it would be permanent! ALSO i hated how oily my face felt in the morning when i woke up. it was definitely oilier than anything i&#x27;ve tried (normal moisturizer, jojoba oil) which is BAD because it was way oilier than after i put on the argon oil, which means that my skin was producing more oil than normal during my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after 2-3 weeks of discontinued, the oil bumps are all gone but my acne is back. not too bad tho, about 1-2 again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i don&#x27;t really know what to say about this. the thing is, it gave me the bumps only around my cheeks/dryer area. but not my t-zone, where i usually get pimples. so maybe i could try just applying to my t-zone, where i usually get zits. and apply normal moisturizer on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also have tried to use this on my hair. it&#x27;s easy to over do it and make it look oily. but ihaven&#x27;t seen any excellent results after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i guess it&#x27;s not for anyone.</li>
            <li> I was watching QVC skin care product and  i came to know about Argan oil. This has great moisturizing property and doesn&#x27;t feel too thick on my face. Very light and i use it twice a day. My skin looks great and doesn&#x27;t clog pores, which might be a concern for those who have oily skin. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very very satisfied. Have been using it morning and night after I wash my face and it moisturizes so damn well. I put a few drops onto my palm, rub it between my hands to warm it up, and pat it alllll over my face. Looks good under my makeup (gives my skin a glow) and my face feels so soft. Occasionally I put a few drops onto the ends of my hair and it makes them so soft and healthy looking. I also put a drop onto each hand&#x27;s cuticles and it makes them not flake or peel. This stuff is liquid gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I usually have to switch up moisturizers a lot because my skin stops looking as good, but this argan oil has given me consistently great effects. Customer service rocks too, they sent me a free bottle, no questions asked, when I emailed them after one of my bottles had a crack in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls and boys this stuff is seriously soooo worth it and it&#x27;s pretty damn cheap considering how useful it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and did I mention I put it on my nasty, creaking door hinges and now they don&#x27;t make a sound?</li>
            <li> too thick and for hair it doesnt work well... even warming in hands first&lt;br /&gt;Plus, true test for True Argan Oil is it is absorbed.  This did not.</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive skin (rosacea, excema and an allergy to the sun).  I&#x27;m amazed at how well this oil works. I&#x27;ve never been able to use any type of product on my face except medication.  Out of desperation I wanted to give Argan oil a try especially after reading so much about it.  Well, IT WORKS!  Besides keeping my face hydrated it&#x27;s actually clearing up the redness and blotches.  I&#x27;m 61 years old and wish I&#x27;d known about Argan oil 50 years ago.  I was a bit skeptical by the small size of the bottle (one ounce) but a little goes a long way.  5 or 6 drops is all I need to cover my entire face.  I haven&#x27;t used this on my hair or other parts of my skin but if does for them what it does for my face the world of other skin care products is in for a big shock.  If the USA ever runs out of this oil I swear I&#x27;ll move to Morocco!</li>
            <li> I love the argon oil. I use as a moisturizer night and day. It absorbs well into my skin and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Too many uses and not enough space to list, hair,skin, nails. You always want the pure oil with no scent. Age spots fading and a very nasty burn scar has become a shadow of it&#x27;s former self after applying this daily for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> i love it because it has NO SMELL!!</li>
            <li> I love it ... I makes my hair finally listen to me ... highly recommended - best buy indeed. You should definitely try it if you have unruly hair!</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin so much since I have started using it. I have such dry skin since I have gotten older and this product has helped tremendously! Fast shipping. I was impressed.</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair, on my face, all over my skin. It helps with my eczema and dry skin. It&#x27;s great to tame my frizzy hair and use as an oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I have seen so much on TV about Argan oil.  I wanted to try it but did not want to spend a fortune.  I like this a lot.  I mix two drops in with my moisturizer after I wash my face in the morning and evening.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil. I put it on my face every night. It lasts a long time as you only need about a drop each time you apply it.</li>
            <li> I massage it onto my eyelids and the surrounding eye area. It moisturizes as it should. No breakouts were caused because of it. For the price, it is good .</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin around eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60s and have dry skin and hair. I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a few days but I really like the feel of my skin and hair. I put a couple of drops on my face at night after I cleanse with Cetiphil face wash and message the oil into my fine lines around my mouth and eyes and the rest of my face. Within minutes it&#x27;s absorbed. I also use it in the morning under my bare minerals makeup and it makes my skin look smooth and hydrated. I also rub a couple of drops between my hands after I shampoo and rinse my hair and rub it into the ends. No conditioner needed. The argon oil makes my hair silky smooth but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a steal for the price! There are several organic argan oil products out there being sold with far too high of a markup! I just don&#x27;t know if I have bought into the argan oil craze. My skin hasn&#x27;t seen dramatic changes. I will wait until I get through my second botle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for my hair for over a year so I know what to expect. This stuff is just nasty. I thought it smelled a little &#x27;off&#x27; as I was putting it in my hair but then once I applied heat using my straightener, it smelled like cooking oil. If I didn&#x27;t know better I&#x27;d have thought someone was frying chicken. If that wasn&#x27;t gross enough, it made my hair very oily. It looked like I had gone a couple rounds with a tub of crisco...and lost. If you want to save a few bucks and don&#x27;t mind smelling like a KFC grease trap, go for it otherwise, look elsewhere</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product and I love it!. It has become a staple of my very simple beauty routine. I like the way it absorbs better than the coconut oil I was using. I don&#x27;t need any other moisturizer for my face or hair - it&#x27;s awesome!  It arrived quickly and nicely packed and it is half the price of what I can find locally. Next time I run out I will order the larger size bottle for an even better savings!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it on my cuticles when they&#x27;re looking dry, and after I&#x27;ve let the oil soak in for a night, my nails and cuticles look like I&#x27;ve just had a manicure! I put some in my hair when the ends are looking dry, sparingly right out of the shower, or in larger quantities as an overnight treatment. Really softens up dead ends and has hair feeling much softer and looking healthier and shinier. I even use this on my oily, acne prone skin. When it&#x27;s feeling parched, I&#x27;ll put it on overnight over my moisturizer, or during the winter I&#x27;ll mix a drop in with my moisturizing gel and my skin feels incredibly soft and quenched. Unlike any other lotion I&#x27;ve used! Even oily skin can feel dry, if that makes sense, and this takes care of it without making me more oily or causing breakouts. There are probably a million other uses for this but these are mine and I love it! Have repurchased once and plan on repurchasing again when I run out!</li>
            <li> previously using tarte oil, got as a gift and when it was time to refill I was like &#x27;no no&#x27; to paying $40+ but i was already an oil convert. This is genuinely lovely, no smell to me! good consistency!! If you are an oil newb, try this!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, believe the hype about this. I also have JM&#x27;s oil and found that given the price difference, it&#x27;s just not worth purchasing anymore. I get the same exact results from this oil as from hers.  I love luxurious products like everyone else and don&#x27;t mind spending money on things that actually work -- in this circumstance, why would you pay 10x more?</li>
            <li> Have purchased several of this brand of argan.  Quality oil and great natural nutty smell.  Good price for quality oil</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product at a very good price.  I used to pay a lot more to buy this oil from another brand.  This is every bit as good; it&#x27;s organic; and it&#x27;s a great price.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very Pricey but very effective. I will purchase again. I used this for my hair and it was extremely moisturized. Organic at it&#x27;s best. The bottle is heavy and small.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a moisturizer for my face and I think my oily facial skin is just a little too sensitive for it. However, I like to use it now as an extra for my body moisturizer and as a night-time treatment for my hair. I just put a few drops on my hands, spread it through the ends of my hair, and wrap it in a bun overnight. It makes my hair very silky. I imagine that it would be similar to using Moroccanoil treatment during the day, but my hair is too fine to handle it.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my legs that just seem to be so dry all the time.  I wear knee socks everyday at work and it just drys the skin out by the end of the day.  I have used a few drops under my reg. lotion and they feel great at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying to use it on my next since that is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazingly pure oil, with no other chemicals! Since I have the most sensitive skin (and it&#x27;s even managed to improve my skin)--I believe that you can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using 2-4 drops am and pm in combination with the Jurlique Calendula Cream and am very pleased.  I have dry-ish/sensitive/acne prone skin, and thus far this combo has done very well for me.  No (increased) acne and some of the fine lines around my eyes are definitely smoother and less pronounced.  Will buy again.  And again.</li>
            <li> I have been switching to more natural beauty products.  I have read a lot of benefits and reviews of argan oils and decided to purchase this one.  It arrived as advertised and moisturizers my face without making it really greasy.  I put it on after a shower and before I put on BB Cream.  I finish off with some pressed powder and feel moisturized, covered, and ready for the day.  I will never buy another &amp;#34;face cream&amp;#34; when a simple oil does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and psoriasis, so I cannot express enough how wonderful of a find this argan oil has been. I rub a little every morning and every night onto any and all dry patches or plaques. Within just a couple of minutes it soaks in and my skin is softer and regains some elasticity. It has really alleviated much of the dryness, pain, and itching I experience.</li>
            <li> Just like all fads they come and go and I believe this to be among the fads that will soon be gone.</li>
            <li> It is a little too oily for me but its okay. I only use it at night before going to bed together with my night moisturizer..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for almost a year now. Gradually I stopped using night moisturizer, and only use this oil at night. It&#x27;s good as a night moisturizer,but I think it would leave face way too oily for daytime use. I have fairly sensitive skin and don&#x27;t react well to harsh creams or facewashes. This oil has kept my face from breaking out, it looks moisturized without looking oily. I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair, so I can&#x27;t comment how well it works for that. Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> i like this product because it smells good unlike my recent argan oil purchase. my only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t big enough! i used it on my face and sometimes a little on my hair. i would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I wanted a little extra moisture on my face during the winter. I put a drop on my face after washing, and it felt too oily for me, didn&#x27;t absorb like I was hoping. But, I was satisfied when I put a drop in with my normal moisturizer as I applied it, the cream helped it to absorb and it felt nice. For the price, I think I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this oil on the ends of my hair and a little throughout and I didn&#x27;t get what I normally do from argan oil.  I have long naturally curly hair argan oil really brings the BOUNCE into bouncy curls while also nourishing and protecting the hair.  I don&#x27;t know about the protection or nourishment, however, it didn&#x27;t not give me quality curls to my hair so I can&#x27;t say it had the quality that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the bottle i bought from Amazon and already I am quite disappointed. The bottle i received is marked and will expire in a few months. COME ON! Why give an overseas customer a product which is nearing the expiration date????</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying and using argan oil and I wanted to make sure I got the best quality I could possibly get. The argan oil is practically odorless and lightweight. I bought it to mix with some shea butter and use on my hair, skin and nails. The dropper is so convenient and helps me measure the right amount to use and I expect it to last at least two months. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and I would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> But read lots of information on Argan oil and how good it is for your skin, hair, you name it... so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It is oil so use it appropriately, but you will notice a difference when you do.  I use it on my face overnight once a week and wake up to nice soft skin.  I&#x27;ll put it on my hair and scalp over the weekend occasionally when I can put my hair up for the day and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I have found this argan oil to be wonderful for hair, for scars from burns, for and for rough skin areas such as knees, heels and elbows..</li>
            <li> I am new to argan oil and love its impact on my skin. I can&#x27;t compare it to other products, but this has done wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Great for hair and skin. Goes on light, dries almost matte on the skin and is non-greasy (oily). Love Argan oil. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair and cuticles and has helped strengthen both.  I really recommend this product.  Love it</li>
            <li> I tried another brand and liked it but I think this one actually makes my skin feel softer and is less expensive. Overall I think argan oil promotes  healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and the price is very good.  I love this for my hair and use as a serum for my face at night.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil-wonderful for aging skin! Absorbs quickly and has no smell.Better than all skin products I usually used. Thank you</li>
            <li> After testing different brands of argan oil at different price points, I feel that the Elma&amp; Sana golden argan oil is not 100% argan oil. I believe it is diluted with a less expensive carrier oil. I noticed the oil is darker in color and thinner than the 5 other brands of argan oil I sampled. This oil also sits on the skin, not absorbing as pure argan oil does. I would advise people pass on this.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is my face&#x27;s best friend! People never believe that I&#x27;m 28. They typically think that I&#x27;m 19-23. I&#x27;m naturally of oily/tzone, ACNE prone face and I am Latina. This oil is so amazing! It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. My best friend, who is African American and of sensitive dry skin, loved it so much that she requested that I get her a bottle. She felt a difference in her face. It&#x27;s great for skin and hair. I also add it to my skin concoction I made to replace my body lotions. I have mixed argan oil, with coconut oil, grapeseed oil, and olive oil together. I put it on after I shower. People always compliment the way that I smell due to my oil mixture (the secret of the scent is in the grapeseed oil and coconut oil). My skin has never felt so smooth in my life and I have amazingly soft skin. When I shake people&#x27;s hands they always seem to linger a little longer and say that my hands are super soft and smooth. I LOOOOOVE ARGAN OIL! This product is AMAZING!! This is the only source I buy it from because many other places because it is cold pressed--which means that this process keeps the nutrients the oil is meant to give the consumer. The fact that is virgin and organic is also a necessary item for good oils to add to one&#x27;s beauty regiment.  :-)</li>
            <li> I use argan oil on everything, hair and body! Great price!</li>
            <li> ow that i know about this product i will not go with out it.  i haqve such dry skin and it is working thank you</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product more then once - while I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s made any difference (long term) to my skin it does make my skin very smooth and soft immediately after use.  This seller ships very quickly and the product is as good if not better in purity then others I have looked into at a much higher price.  I will probably continue to use this but again if you are looking for that miracle in a bottle that some argon oil products promise I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s been my experience.  I will say it is soothing and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in any way...  I look the same using it or not using it....</li>
            <li> Good quality oil.  I use it as a moisterizer for my face and hair.  A little goes a long way.  Absorbs into the skin in a few minutes. Doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy like other oils.  I use it on my hair before shampooing although some people use it after.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I purchased from this company was great! So I ordered again. This time the oil is so rancid. I know this affects the quality of the oil and my face smells horrible! I will look for another company even if it means me spending a little more.</li>
            <li> does a good job.need to use a lot of it [on my hair anyway].not greasy.</li>
            <li> First time using argan oil on my face. was very nervous as i have sensitive skin. I was surprised to see it hydrated and white head free. It seems shiny and oily when first applied but sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> Less is more with this! I have EXTREMELY SENSITIVE skin &amp; usually break out no matter what. Since i have been dabbing this on my face sparingly, my face has been moisturized and i haven&#x27;t been breaking out at all! LOVE IT!  UPDATE: this is my 5th bottle! I use 100% natural moisturizer with a couple of drops of this then mix together and apply. I still find that using too much will be too heavy so that is why I like mixing  it! My skin has seriously changed for the better!! Everyone needs to try this!!! Also, I use the ROSE WATER from this seller and it has also done wonders! I most the rose water on my face then apply the Argan oil and moisturizer mixture.</li>
            <li> I use this on skin, (especially hands around nails) Also use a tiny bit to rub through hair.  Great on face too, under foundation.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> ..but I feel like it is. I&#x27;m 38 and still prone to acne, so putting oil on my skin seemed like a bad idea. My girlfriend talked me into trying it, and it has worked wonders in this exceptionally harsh winter. I believe that my skin looks plumper and feels better, and my acne has not increased in frequency or severity. (I actually believe that my acne has gotten better, with fewer cyst-type blemishes, and more clogged pores working clean while still in the &amp;#34;blackhead&amp;#34; stage. Sorry for the ewww-level frankness.) It&#x27;s also great on my hands and elbows.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to avoid paying $$$ for Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan oil. This works nicely. I use it for my face at night and it glides on nicely. Doesnt leave my face too oily and clears up my complexion.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I slather it on my face at night and have found that it has softened my skin and has reduced wrinkles. It&#x27;s wonderful and I will buy more of it. I highly recommend it.  Inexpensive and it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I was using Josie Maran Argan oil but going thru the bottle quickly and the price added up fast.  Found this on amazon and decided to give it a shot.  Good color to it, more a thin consistency and no adverse scent.  Absorbs quickly into the roots of my hair and makes them look lovely without being greasy.  I don&#x27;t use this product on my skin so I do not know how it performs in that regard.  Will repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> The seller was outstanding! The product shipped within 2 days and I had it within less than a week. I love the argan oil overall. The only detractor to it is the smell. It is not a pleasant smell, but I use other products on my hair along with the argan oil and the smell is not noticable once applied. It imparts incredible shine and protects my hair from styling tools. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Great price. No funky smell. I use on my face and hair. Helps my face be less oily and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> Just received product today, and the bottle clearly says the product EXPIRED 12/2013!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It smells awful and rancid.  NEVER buy this crap!</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to break out and I&#x27;m allergic to most face products.  This is gentle and natural and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to react in any way, it just nourishes well.  I must say that I got another argan oil when I ran out of this, and they are not all created equal, that caused my skin to break out, so I would recommend this brand and I&#x27;m guessing because it&#x27;s organic, that must make a difference.  Highly recommend this product.  You wouldn&#x27;t think putting oil on your face would cause less break-outs, but in this case it does.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve paired down my skin routine quite a bit. Instead of multiple types of cleansers and moisturizers, I&#x27;m down to one moisturizer, one cleanser, and one occasional exfoliating treatment. When I heard about Argan Oil, I had to try it. It sort of makes sense that oil would \\&quot;trick\\&quot; your skin into thinking it&#x27;s hydrated enough so that the cycle of overproduction of oil would cease. Our hormones work the same way, so why not our skin? And the idea that I could use this on my hair, nails and body was intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the Josie Maran line and concluded that it was WAY too expensive. I ended up getting this one and have been using it for about 6 months. Seriously: TWO drops moisturizes my entire face. I initially was mixing one drop with my regular moisturizer but slowly phased out my old moisturizer. I&#x27;ve had blackheads on my nose for 10 years that have never gone away until I started using argan oil. The acne scarring I did have has been greatly reduced. I use it around my eyes as well and my dark circles have been helped.&lt;br /&gt;I also combine this with my body lotion. Once every other week, I use an exfoliating mitt (hammam mitt) and put oil on my body in the shower and scrub away. When I&#x27;m done, my skin is perfectly moisturized AND exfoliated. I use it on my nails. I mix it with my conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re weary, get a small trial/travel size. Start with SMALL amounts and work your way up. Maybe you need 2-3 drops on your face. Maybe less. Try mixing it with your other products so you can gradually become accustomed to the texture. I think that rule of \\&quot;too much of a good thing\\&quot; applies here. While others have said it absorbs quickly, it certainly doesn&#x27;t for me when I apply too much. I appreciate a dewy look, but I definitely don&#x27;t want to look greasy!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to think of a downside to the oil and the only thing I can think of is it&#x27;s a little expensive. However, the fact that it&#x27;s a Fair Trade product and rather strictly distributed is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: as with most products, it takes time (especially if you&#x27;re trying to heal old scars). You&#x27;re not going to see drastic results in a month. Scars probably take the longest to heal when using any product. Although, I&#x27;ve seen results in all other areas (moisture, acne, fine lines, etc) rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE: Look at the ingredients carefully. There&#x27;s a big difference between \\&quot;100% argan oil\\&quot; and \\&quot;Contains 100% argan oil.\\&quot; If it&#x27;s truly argan oil and nothing else, it will only have one ingredient listed! I looked at a lot of argan oil products before buying this one. Some add a fragrance to it (innocent enough) but some contain a whole litany of ingredients and argan oil is way down on the list.plus for me.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this oil!  I have extremely dry/baby fine hair and this oil does amazing things with it!  I have long hair, about mid-back and I use probably four drops for my whole head.  I usually apply it to wet hair after showering and then after I dry my hair.  It makes my hair silky smooth and very shiny, but not greasy looking.   I also use it on my skin-like my hair, I also have very dry skin and the oil clears up the dry spots within minutes.  It also gives my skin a really pretty healthy glow.  I used it on my face a few times, but my skin is prone to breakouts with everything and unfortunately with this oil my skin still broke out.    For the price and the amount used its a fantastic deal. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Pretty pricey for what you get, but I like it nonetheless. I use it for my hair and skin. I also found that it works to heal small eczema patches wonderfully.</li>
            <li> i use this product on the tips of my hair (leaving it overnight) and found that right after washing my hair to rinse it off, my hair feels a bit frizzy. however, on the succeeding days, my hair feels softer and fuller than it was before applying argan oil. maybe it&#x27;s just that i don&#x27;t rinse my hair well enough to remove the oil. i will continue to use it twice a week because i feel that my hair gets nourished everytime i use this. this oil is mild on skin too</li>
            <li> Wow.  This is a great product and the price is lower than many other brands out there.  I am impressed with the quality of this oil.  I have used it on my hair (at the ends when I need some real deep conditioning that my other favorite products will not give me the desired results) and on dry skin.  This works like a charm.  We have been having a bitterly cold winter and moisture just seems to get sucked out of you in these times.  This product really prevented my skin from totally drying up and flaking. I am on my second bottle of this and I will continue to buy it.  I feel it is high quality and it more than does the job that I need it to do. So if you hate dry, flakey skin in the winter this can be of help.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick and heavy that it is definitely not the best smoothing product for my hair. I only put a dime size amount in my hand, rubbed my hands together, then applied it to just the ends of my hair and it immediatly felt heavy and greasy. I have tried the product over 10 times hoping that my hair would get used to it, but it just looks dirty and greasy everytime. I recently receieved a sample of Beauty Protector  - Protect &amp; Oil and it is so much lighter and has a much better smell.</li>
            <li> This product is a great inexpensive argan oil.  A use a couple drops on my face as a nightime moisturizer.  I have combination skin so it is a little too shiny for daytime use but sometimes I add a drop to my daytime moisturizer.  I will also combine a few drops with my body lotion as it is helpful with eczema and dry patches.  A little goes a long way so a bottle lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. I just put a drop or two in with my moisturizer -mix it in- and put on my face and its amazing. It makes the lines at the edge of your eyes disappear - and it just makes you skin feel happy. And as a person prone to breakouts who was worried about putting OIL on my face, I can tell you it does NOT make you break out. Also If my hair is a little scraggly (especially if I wash and night and go to sleep with wet hair), just a couple drops in your hand and rub palms together and rub through hair - makes it shiny and less bed-heady. I started using the brand at Sprouts (which is also good) and when I first started using this one I thought the OTHER One smelled better but I like this one a lot better now, plus its half the price, which is great.</li>
            <li> Results take awhile. I&#x27;ve used another brand that worked better/faster.</li>
            <li> Its perfect FOR. My sensitive skin I will be buying more very soon. I luv for my hair but the skin use is just what it says it will do I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t thought this oil would be absorbed into my skin so fast and not greasy. I only tried one night but it leaves my skin very soft and same in the next morning.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product a 5 if it would have taken away my frizzies, but alas, this was not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do LOVE the softness I get from it though.  Even my hands are wonderfully soft after rubbing it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has even made my whites/grays less resistant to color because it has softened them so.</li>
            <li> Good for:&lt;br /&gt;Dry hair&lt;br /&gt;Frizzy hair&lt;br /&gt;Wig hair&lt;br /&gt;Light weight non-shiny skin moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Makeup primer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Barely detectable, slightly like raw almonds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My long fine limp hair can&#x27;t take most leave in conditioners without feeling sticky (wax coated) or even more dry (silicones block out the moisture over time), but this argan oil takes the frizz out of the ends with a single drop.  I rub a drop onto my palms and fingers then run them through the ends of my towel-dried hair: no frizz, no clumping, no stringyness.  The best part is that it won&#x27;t build up like silicones do, but it makes the dry ends just as shiny and smooth as any anti-frizz silicone balm or spray on the market.  The most damaged parts of my hair feel like they&#x27;ve been freshly trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried almond oil, coconut oil, olive oil, and other moisturizer based sprays/balms/creams and none of them feel like this in my hair.  This oil absorbs into skin and hair immediately which is different. On the skin, it doesn&#x27;t even leave you shiny it absorbs so well.  A single drop is a great lightweight facial moisturizer and it spreads on with a finish exactly like makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a theatre costumer, I have also used it on extra long bleached human hair wigs to keep the deep wave patterns nice and moisturized.  It keeps the entire 28\\&quot; length smooth and shiny, even at the ends where it&#x27;s been brushed through.  Every other product I&#x27;ve tried on dry wig hair tends to attract dirt and dust (leaving it feeling gritty soon after washing), but this oil doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is sad how they trick you into buying this item. I am still waiting on miracles to happen. My brother lives in morocco and sent me some. Gosh, it is nothing like this chemically modified stuff. Well if you do not know anyone from morocco I guess this product is the closest you will get from it.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Argan oil from Sephora and was impressed with how well it works as a moisturizer. Bought this 1 oz bottle to try more and loved it. This is a great quality product, absorbs quickly, feels good on the skin, and it&#x27;s very affordable compared to some other brands. And the bottle cap comes with a dropper, which makes it easy to measure and use.</li>
            <li> like it alot- great and compares to 40$ a bottle or more. would buy again definitely.&lt;br /&gt;smoother skin.........absorbs quickly and easily</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s worked for thousands of years for people in the desert,  gotta be good for Texas!  I use it on my face at night,</li>
            <li> I really like this oil for my hair but the bottle ran out pretty fast so I just use another brand I buy at walgreens which is all natural too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with Argan oil. It (surprise surprise) left my hair looking oily, but like dirty oily. Like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a few days. It did feel nice on my elbows and other rough patches, but I don&#x27;t prefer it to ordinary lotion.</li>
            <li> I have 4 other containers of argan oil in my bathroom--some more than 3 months old. I used the entire bottle--which, for me, means this oils is phenomenal. This is the only oil that I&#x27;ve been able to consistenely use on my sensitive skin with success. It is extremely light and makes my skin feel absolutely wonderful. I will continue to order this product--at this price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> This oil arrived super fast and has made a big difference in my hair.  Many thanks for this great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly to use as a leave in conditioner for my hair.  I love the results as my hair is so much more softer and manageable, and I notice far less breakage.  I will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells like cooking oil and make me break out in places I&#x27;ve never broken out before. I adore argan oil and all of its benefits but this stuff just didn&#x27;t do its justice. Even though Josie Maran is expensive, it just works for me and I don&#x27;t mind shelling out the money for something I know is going to work.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I&#x27;ve heard that it is a very good product.  An insert would make it   better telling you how to use it.</li>
            <li> I had been interested in trying the Amal oils argan oil or Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil but was daunted by the price. After reading the positive reviews on here, and one reviewer claiming she tried Josie Maran and said that this product was identical, I gave it a try. Since then I&#x27;ve been a preacher of this product and gave it to everyone for Christmas, from my mother in law, to my baby nephew with eczema! I really love this product, although I wouldn&#x27;t call it miraculous, just yet. I guess we&#x27;ll have to wait and see if I become a wrinkle-less old lady. But I imagine I&#x27;ll be using this product until then.  I love it for my face. I have the kind of combination skin that can feel tight and dry but have an oil slick on top. This oil absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and hydrates so well that it balances your skin. I find that after using it, my skin does not get greasy, and feels balanced all day. That is major and life changing in itself!  I have light eczema, and tried it on some irritated patches, without miraculous results. But I did have good results on speeding up the healing on a cut, and shrinking a pimple breakout on my husband.   I almost want to try a tiny bottle of the Josie Maran to see if it can get any better. They say if things seem too good to be true, then they probably are. I don&#x27;t understand how this seems to be the same thing at a fraction of the price (and free shipping- Thanks, Amazon Prime!) But with no complaints, and a low enough price to liberally cover my scalp to my dry heels without breaking the bank- I think I will be sticking with the Ecocert. Is it Eco-logical, or Eco-nomical? The more expensive brands boast of buying the oil through cooperatives that benefit the native Moroccan Berber women who produce the oil-- my only explanation of this low price is that it somehow is not benefiting the native women as much as these other brands. I guess I&#x27;ll save the saving of disenfranchised peoples for a day in the future, a future without studentloans. But for now, this will do me just fine.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this at QVC, so I decided to give it a try.  This is a great product for an insane value.  Just a few drops.  Soaks quickly into skin.  Great around the eyes.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> A colleague told me about Argan Oil so I ordered this to see if it did all that she said.  To my amazement, it did.  I use it on my face, which gets extremely dry in winter and on my feet daily for dryness. I thought that it would be greasy but it is not...I even put body lotion on top of it without a problem.  The only problem is the small size container but I was able to find a 16 oz bottle on Amazon which I ordered with the intent of pouring into this receptacle and that goes a long way.  I am sold on Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this and a bottle of jojoba oil at the same time and I find myself using this more and more. The argan oil has a light, nutty scent and comes with a mini-dropper to prevent over use. I find that I get my best results with this product when I use it with a bit of water - if my hair is wet from the shower for example, as it better prevents fly-aways.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for anti-aging and to use as cuticle oil, does it work as these? I am not sure.  One thing for sure though, a few drops on my eczema-inflamed and flaking skin and it calms it down!  I have a flaky part of my scalp due to eczema, it looks gross, but after diligently applying this on that part, it disappeared!</li>
            <li> What happened to Elma brand? I used to love it and order it all the time but recently the quality is no longer good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read all the other reviews and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not organic! It claims to be Ecocert but it is not. I called and verify with Ecocert myself and they are not approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil quality has been going down hill, smells rancid and sour like puke. I am sure it is not pure either as the color is strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my face and accidentally got some on my eyes and my eye is all irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now switched to Watts and it seems a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy Watts brand here [[ASIN:B005GXVVH2 Watts Beauty ArganGoldTM 1oz/100% Certified Organic Cold Pressed Argan Nut Oil for Hair &amp; Body - Morocco]]</li>
            <li> I liked how this felt when I used it on my hands and elbows but I usually have very oily skin so I didn&#x27;t use it anywhere else. It did make my hands and elbows feel softer so that was a plus. I will probably keep using it until the bottle is gone but not really sold on getting more at this point. Maybe someone else will have more advantage of using this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and I usually breakout very badly during my period. It&#x27;s about 3 weeks, I think, that I started using this product and my skin is flawless and I haven&#x27;t breakout. For the hair is not as good as coconut oil is, so I only recommend it for the skin.</li>
            <li> All the great things that have been said about argan oil are true when it comes to moisturizing my skin.  That&#x27;s not to say that all will have success with using argan oil as we all have different skin types and reactions.  It took about a couple weeks for my skin to fully adjust to using an all-natural oil straight on my face.  I suggest using argan oil as your nighttime moisturizer when first trying it out - one to two drops is all it takes.  Be sure to test the argan oil on a small area to see if it is compatible with your skin.  The nutty smell of [[ASIN:B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil]] may take a little getting used to if you have a sensitive nose.  If it works, you should have a noticeably healthier complexion.  [[ASIN:B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil]] is a good cheap alternative to other more reputable brands like [[ASIN:B001DJ9JJU Josie Maran Argan Oil]] and [[ASIN:B0062SM296 Beta Naturals 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil]].  Other great less-expensive argan oil brands I&#x27;ve tried include [[ASIN:B0094WRUJO BEAUTYOILS.CO 100% Pure Argan Oil]] and [[ASIN:B00502NMTO Aura Cacia Pure Argan Oil]].</li>
            <li> This oil smells horrible. (No, I wasn&#x27;t using a ton of it at once.) It is the worst smelling beauty product I have ever used. Any efficacy is greatly diminished by the smell and I hesitate to use it for that reason.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about the time I refined my food intake along Paleo/Primal guidelines, so I believe the combination of those choices helped to make the changes I see ~ My facial skin is smoother, the pores smaller, deep spots are coming to the surface and releasing - and the oil is great in my hair too!  I love this and fully expect I will use it always :D Thank You!</li>
            <li> This argan oil was of a thinner consistency than I was looking for. I was looking for a thicker oil to use on the body. But this argan oil would probably be good to use on the face or to mix in with cosmetics or creams.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It&#x27;s the same quality as many of the deluxe beauty products on the market, and a larger bottle for much much less than that price! I use it alone in my hair as conditioner, and I add it to lotions to improve the moisturizing content. (For the record I have super-fine, frizzy curly hair and combination skin-- this doesn&#x27;t make me break out) I&#x27;m going to make a sugar scrub from it soon, too, and I think it&#x27;ll be excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve probably already heard the benefits of argan oil if you&#x27;re researching this on amazon, so click the expensive tiny bottle out of your cart and check this out!</li>
            <li> This was wonderful. A little dab will do you, it has a plunger type lid which makes it easy to put the exact amout that you want on your finger tips to put it on your face. I am very happy that I bought this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase. I have long, thick, wavy hair that can be very unmanageable. I use about 3 drops for the end of my hair and it make my hair so soft and smooth. I also use this on my face with great results. I have dry, fair, sensitive skin, and this product does not irritate it. I especially like to use this oil as an eye serum at night. It makes those fine lines from dryness disappear. The bottle was packages nicely and the oil comes in a nice glass bottle, which is awesome if you are trying to avoid plastic as much as possible.</li>
            <li> wonderful, the real thing... you can tell by ingredients label, the color of bottle must be dark and the feel is soft, subtle and not greasing!  Quickly absorbed into skin and hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It totally nourishes my hair , nails and face. Very good price and it shipped well. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I&#x27;ve used a similar product,  different brand, before. The other brand was 5 times the price for the exact same thing.  I will never go without this must have item.</li>
            <li> With all the hype on argon oil, I really wanted to try it out without spending a ton.  I&#x27;ve experimented quite a bit in the last year with unnatural hair colors - which included a whole lot of bleaching and damage to my hair.  It was a mess.  I got this argon oil to try out because it was inexpensive.  I put a couple drops in my hand and rubbed into my hair from the tips up, and instantly my hair feels smoother.  Now, after a couple of months of use, my hair is repaired, long, and super moisturized even without a new application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it on my body and a tiny bit on my face, and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  Love that it&#x27;s certified organic, too.  I&#x27;m picking up some more to give out as gifts to family members.</li>
            <li> I have young kids and I usually don&#x27;t have time to do reviews. But I have to do this one. I discovered Elma&amp;Sana argan oil a year ago and have been using it since. I have sensitive skin and my skin type is mixed -- oily at the \\&quot;T\\&quot; while dry on the cheeks. I used to have pimples. Elma&amp;Sana absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy on my face. It makes my skin glow and soft, especially during winter. I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, people always say that I look like a 20ish girl thanks to my argan oil. ;-) I buy Elma&amp;Sana as gifts too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I recently experienced the best customer service from Elma&amp; Sana. I was not satisfied with one of the bottles I purchased a while ago (I just opened the bottle lately and it smelled funny.) So I called Elma&amp;Sana and tried to get an explanation. Within a week, I got a replacement in the mail, along with extra bottles and one free argan oil soap as gifts! I offered to mail back the bottle I didn&#x27;t like. They told me just tossed it. I was impressed and overwhelmed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, ladies, if you have any issues with your oil, just contact them directly. I&#x27;m sure they will take care of you. (It doesn&#x27;t matter which seller you purchased from, mine was from a 3rd party seller. Just provide your order number to them.)</li>
            <li> I had bought another brand of Argan oil and that felt better on face. Similar price and packaging, so I expected comparable product quality.  But overall, its not bad.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. Lotions and most soaps break my skin out in a rash where ever I apply the product. I&#x27;ve never been able to buy and use lotions from stores like Victoria&#x27;s Secret or Bath and Body Works. I came across another brand of organic Argan Oil, Josie Maran, at Sephora for $48. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and bought the sample size bottle which is 0.5 ounces. I loved it, but it didn&#x27;t last long and I didn&#x27;t want to spend $48 on such a small amount! So, I did my research on Amazon and found Elma &amp; Sana Argan Oil. It&#x27;s the same great quality of the name brand without the huge mark up in price! And you get LOTS more! I apply it to my face mostly and to the ends of my hair since it&#x27;s organic and safe for anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> Listen to all the good reviews on here about this oil. I have pretty bad skin, lots of breakouts, very oily and dry at the same time from using medicine for the breakouts. Usually every cream or lotion or moisturizer I try on my face breaks me out and leaves me VERY oily and does nothing for the dry parts of my face. This oil is completely different. I usually put it on at night since I can put a lot on and take my time letting it absorb. It doesn&#x27;t take too long to sink in though, maybe 5 minutes after rubbing into my skin (you really kind of have to rub for a minute or else it doesn&#x27;t seem as effective)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It completely takes care of any dry patches I have on my face within a few days, and controls how oily my face is. I was using it in the morning before I applied my makeup as well, and it did not make my face oily throughout the day. The only reason I stopped doing this was because it took a little while for it to sink in enough for me to use a foundation over it, and I usually didn&#x27;t wake up early enough before my classes to deal with that! This product also NEVER broke me out, which is amazing. It also smells pretty nice too. I got the bottle a while ago, for Christmas I believe, and after using it probably 5 days a week, I still have some left! You only really need a tiny bit to cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I completely recommend this product for any skin type!!</li>
            <li> lovely use all the time does not other my ultra sensitive skin. Love organics argan oil is very good leaves your skin very supple</li>
            <li> I like this product but I really can&#x27;t tell what it does completely for me and I have not really used it a lot to tell yet.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best skin care products I have ever used. It has become my sole skin regimen for all of my needs. Will not need to look further. This does the job.</li>
            <li> La descripción del producto al momento de la compra me explico lo que iba a recibir y es eso exacto lo que me despecharon</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month it totally swelled up my face!It took 2 weeks to show. I believe I was allergic to the ingredients, but I&#x27;m not sure! Be careful guys, it could do the same to you. I didn&#x27;t return to normal until after a couple weeks of not using it!!</li>
            <li> I like this product, I use it when my hair is still wet before I blow dry. I use only a small amount (less than a dime size in the palm of my hand) then rub my hands together and apply it. Be careful to not apply too much, otherwise your hair will look greasy. It adds shine, smooths the hair and makes the hair look a lot healthier and softer.</li>
            <li> I have ordered and used other argan oils before.. this one is.. OK... it&#x27;s still produces the moistureizing effect I am looking for but it smells AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Works the same as jojoba oil.  Jojoba is less expensive so I think I&#x27;ll stick to jojoba when this is gone.</li>
            <li> I was reading a book on inexpensive beauty luxuries and buying your own argan oil was top of the recommendations. I mix it into my body lotion, conditioner, handcream, etc. to create my own argan oil products and use it undiluted on my face, cuticles and lips. Perfect for the winter and it&#x27;s really helped my cracked cuticles. It&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and it was my first Argan oil purchase.  I overlooked a few initial complaints because, I know this is kind of crazy, but I WANTED this product to be perfect as the vast majority of the reviews say.  Well, I recently purchased another brand of Argan oil on Groupon goods, and used it this morning, what a difference!  Now my initial skepticism about this product is substantiated.  Here we go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Elma &amp; Sana (E&amp;S from here on) Argan oil came, I noticed that it had an unpleasant smell, kind of like really old vegetable oil.  I had an issue with it, but overlooked it because, again, I&#x27;ve never bought Argan oil before so there&#x27;s no way to compare.  The other thing was the thickness of this product, it felt heavy and sat on my skin for hours (I have dry skin and only used 4-5 drops as directed).  The weird thing was, a few hours after applying this oil, when my face stopped shining, I notice dry patches of flaking skin all over my face.  I modified my regimen and started to apply this oil, then another facial moisturizing cream, to prevent the dry patches of skin situation.  For over a month, I was okay with how this new system worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the other brand of Argan oil came, I immediately noticed that it smelled FRESH, the smell is hard to describe, but reminiscent of a bottle of high quality EVOO.  It was of a similar color as E&amp;S, but a little ligher.  Its consistency is thinner than E&amp;S.  It absorbed in a couple minutes, no greasy, heavy feeling.  It&#x27;s been a few hours since I put it on, no dry patches of flaking skin all over my face.  The new Argan oil left my skin extremely soft, smooth, hydrated, and not greasy.  My face also most definitely does not smell like an old pan that hasn&#x27;t been washed well --- that old greasy smell from E&amp;S argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a bad apple from E&amp;S, and this is not representative of their overall quality.  The list price of the new Argan oil I bought was close to 50% more expensive than E&amp;S, but I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a high quality product.  The verdict stands: I will stay away form E&amp;S argan oil from now on.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil work really well, but you have to be careful with how much you use because it can make your hair super oily if you use too much. You have to experiment with amounts, but I&#x27;d recommend the tiniest amount to start. I found that it works best for me when I first get out of the shower and before I blow dry my hair. It adds a nice shine, and a little weight to keep my hair tame.</li>
            <li> This seems to penetrate my skin well, but is a little &#x27;thinner&#x27; than other argan oils I have used. It has no odor, which is very nice and seems to work well on my dry skin over night. I think I will order it again because it is a great price for organic argan oil.</li>
            <li> I mix this in with my hair products.  I have used SO many different oils for my dry hair and this is the ONLY oil that keeps my hair moisturized for an extended period of time.  A little goes a long way, one of the best hair products I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair! Dry spots, and as a diaper rash preventer for my one year old! For the price and being organic it&#x27;s a must try. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> My first experience with argan oil was another brand, which was also organic.  I was pleased with the other brand, but wanted something cheaper so I tried this.  I am really shocked that I only found one other review that mentioned that this oil smells like poop.  Like the other reviewer, I wound up throwing mine away.  I am going to try another brand when I run out of a serum that I am currently using on my dry patches.  Go ahead and give argan oil a shot, but don&#x27;t buy this brand&#x27;s pretty blue bottle!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my nails because they were brittle and not growing.  This is a nice oil because it is not greasy.  My nails are in better condition and growing.</li>
            <li> I first used this on my face (avoiding my t zone), but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes.  I started using a little in my hair after I showered though, and that has really helped my ends and kept frizz down!  Great alternative to move expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Did not really work for me. I get more results using coconut and castor oil on my skin. I get the glow, especially with coconut oil. This did nothing for me, except make my face feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I use it on my hair and face! Excellent price, comparable to Josie Maran, Argan oil, and so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift, haven&#x27;t heard any complaints for the user.  Good deal for the size compared to other retail stores.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous undee makeup instead of mousturizer &amp; is lasting forever</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face but was also able to use in my hair to keep it soft. It only takes a few drops. I have acne breakouts and this helped reduce them and keep my face clear. However, I&#x27;m not sure it is any better than the Jojoba oil I was using, so I probably won&#x27;t get this again as it is more expensive. But it might be gentler for some people, so if you don&#x27;t like Jojoba, I would try this.</li>
            <li> I added this to my skin care lotion to see if it would assist with constant dry skin. I could not tell any difference. When I applied it to my skin by itself, I got a rash in those areas. I would advise applying to a small area of skin first, to see if you are allergic.</li>
            <li> I just recently ordered this product after reading all the reviews and can honestly Im very disappointed with it. As soon as I opened the oil it smelled horrible. I thiught maybe it was something wrong with me since some of the reviews said it smelled strong but sort of like olive oil...but mine does not smell like that at all. I will not be repurchasing this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> I make my own shampoo and conditioner and this has been a welcome addition to my products.  Especially useful for damaged hair.  Can also be used in skincare products.</li>
            <li> I have veryyyy dry colored hair and this oil smoothes it out without deeling too greasy. Just a few drops goes a long way. I also use it to moisturize my face. Argan oil is awesome and this product is 100% pure. Has a slight nutty smell but its quite subtle. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle I&#x27;ve bought.  It is good for your hair, nails, and most of all for making your skin moist.  I use a night cream and combine the Argan Oil.  My skin is soo much smoother.  I saw this advertised for a lot more money in other creams. So I did some research and can make the same product for pennies.  Love this and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s and I&#x27;ve always had problem with clogged pores, blackheads, dry cheeks, and oily nose. Since switching from face creams to this oil my skin seems to be well balanced. I put a little on in the morning and it lasts me throughout the day. It absorbs quickly so my face doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after being introduced to Argan oil from a beauty subscription site. They gave me Josie Maran which was wonderful but too pricey for me. After searching Amazon for alternatives, I gave Elma and Sana a try and I don&#x27;t regret it. The price is decent. Compared to Josie Maran, Elma and Sana is a wee bit heavier and has a tree like smell but it gets the job done. For my normal to dry face, after I wash with Dr Bronners, I apply a few drops. Only a few drops are needed to avoid it being too greasy. My face feels soft. For blemishes I apply coconut with it at night and by morning I have a nice glow. It&#x27;s great before applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hair, man I have a few uses. I apply it on my AA 4b/C hair with coconut, sweet almond, mayo (yes mayo) and Jamaican black castor oil for a pre-wash mask. Or before blow drying/flat ironing, I apply it lightly OR I apply it to maintain my hairstyles to add moisture and tame fly always. This stuff is the best for the price range. If you, like me, are unable to afford Josie Maran, this is a solid substitution. Not to mention I ordered this small bottle in Feb and it just ran out last week. A little goes a long way as with all natural oils.</li>
            <li> I love the lightweight feeling of this product. I purchased it to complement my night skin care routine, and cannot get enough of it. I apply to my skin after my serum and to my nails, eyelashes and hair. I have sensitive skin and was afraid that it would react to the oil, but it did not at all.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  I am using it as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s great, it absorbs into my skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  I also use it as a primer for my mineral makeup and it works very nicely.  I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I had never used any sort of face oil before... scared it would make me break out and be super greasy. I really needed something more moisturizing, particularly during the winter - I hated waking up in the morning with my face feeling super tight and dry. I now spread it all over my face each night and I wake up feeling refreshed and heavenly moisturized. It&#x27;s a tad greasy when you put it on, but sinks in quickly. Zero zits/breakouts since I started using it. I don&#x27;t know how my skin will take it in the hot summer months, but right now, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> This oil works just as well as the Josie Mara Argon Oil that is THREE TIMES the price. I bought a bottle for my sister and myself and we both have noticed a difference in our hair.</li>
            <li> I read about this being good for my skin conditions.  I add it to a homemade face lotion recipe I like.  It really seems to help protect and moisturize! Love it! This is recommended as a true organic argan oil from the research I have done on line.</li>
            <li> I used Josie Maran Argan oil which is very good stuff.  I saw this on Amazon when reordering and decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did.  This oil seems almost as rich and is absorbed just as well.  Bonus:  this cost a fifth of the price as the Jose Maran Oil!  Needless to say I will probably order this again.  :)</li>
            <li> softens skin as promoted.  i use on bottom of feet, on nails and cuticles, and under my eyes.  i also mix a few drops with body lotion for entire body.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Argan oil. I did extensive research to make sure I was getting a quality product. This is. It has transformed my dry hair, skin, and nails. I&#x27;ve found this: two drops, mixed with maybe 4-6 drops of jojoba oil, mix together and rub all over my hands and nails. When there&#x27;s hardly any left, I lightly rub some on my hair ends (while dry) or where ever needed, and comb through. If any left, I pat lightly on my face. I do this at night, and it absorbs beautifully. I wake up with soft skin, hair, and hands. If I continue to have the success I&#x27;m having, I will be throwing out all my lotions and creams. Yeay!</li>
            <li> I have been using it as a night oil on my face and I have been impressed.  I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it and though it feels very light, it hydrates well!</li>
            <li> My second order. Not sure about quality control. The odor seems a bit different, but not a big problem, I like this for my hair. A bit too oily for my face, but perhaps not for someone with dryer skin. Not bad for hands and feet. The small size is convenient for purse and travel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this argan oil based on the reviews but with slight hesitation. After using if for 6 months, I am very happy with the purchase! I found that it did not fulfill all the promises made in the reviews but it came close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A drop or two provided enough coverage for my entire face. A few more drops for specific coverage (elbows, feet, hands) provided enough coverage for everything else. After a week of usage I noticed that red spots on my face disappeared, rough areas (elbows and feet) were smoother and overall, my skin had a much better appearance. I did use shea butter on my body as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is a combination of dry and oily and very sensitive and this argan oil did wonders for smoothing out faint crow&#x27;s feet lines, soothing red spots and brightening my complexion. Best part? No irritation no matter where I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can replace my very expensive face lotion with this much cheaper and organic product. Love that!</li>
            <li> I bought  this product for my hair and found it did nothing for my blonde locks. Tried 2-3 drops. Then 3-4. By 5-6 my hair was wet and greasy looking. I tried it on wet hair, dry hair  and in the shampoos &amp; conditioners. Nothing. Never tried it for my face. Might work there.</li>
            <li> The oil i got smells old, like when vegetable oil goes bad.  If this is normal, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on argan oil, but I am an expert on my own face. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week and the results have completely blown me away. I apply it liberally a few times a day. It absorbs very quickly and does not leave me feeling greasy. I also rub whatever is left on my hands after I apply it to my face into the ends of my hair. Both my hair and face look great. I was dealing with a serious acne outbreak before I started using this and that has almost completely cleared up. Some fine lines have gone away and the more visible lines are less noticeable. Even the cleft between my eyes is softening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received came from YourShop and was fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast with Amazon Prime. The Elma &amp; Sana Organic Argan Oil is just as described. It has very little smell, not unpleasant and goes on very smoothly. I have put it on my face a few times at night and it&#x27;s not too oily; in the morning my face looks as well as if I had used an expensive night cream. Keep in mind my skin is dry and may be absorving excess oil. I have also used it on my hands, which are normally very dry and it leaves them looking quite smooth, with no high shine. This Argan oil is pricier than others, so it would have been helpful if the bottle dropper would dispense less oil each time, so as to avoid waste. I know this one ounce bottle will go very fast, but not necessarily all on my skin. Otherwise, this would have been a five star review.</li>
            <li> Smells and works like the organic argan oil I purchased for 50 dollars for a bottle this size. Happy with quality. Would purchase again.  Love using argan oil on face and hair!</li>
            <li> The only brand of argan oil that I will buy. Really hydrating - with only a couple drops on the face during the cold seasons, my skin perks right up. I use this on my hair as well and just half a dropperful for really long hair makes it silky and smooth. A little goes a long way with this product and it&#x27;s really worth the money. There&#x27;s no fragrance, which is nice, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Use this instead of Frizz Ease. I place about 5-10 drops on my damp hair (only the ends) before blow drying and it makes such a difference! You don&#x27;t notice my split ends and my hair looks 10x less &#x27;ratty.&#x27; I&#x27;ve used this as well  as the Watts Beauty ArganGold brand. As long as it&#x27;s 100% Argan Oil, I definitely recommend you buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff... I did several reviews on youtube for argan oil and finally decided to try it out. I use it on my skin along with lotion and face as a moisturizer prior to using primer and foundation and of course on my hair and I can&#x27;t express how awesome this stuff is. I recently bleached my hair and have been using this on my ends and love that with only a drop or two my hair is so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. I originally bought it to use on my face.  It makes the skin soft, seems to decrease pores, although I don&#x27;t know how since it&#x27;s an oil.  Also nice for around eyes and mouth and neck. Not so much for deep wrinkles like brackets along side of mouth. Then a few days ago I knocked over the  bottle onto the table. Not wanting to waste it I applied the spilled oil to my hands, arms and legs. It&#x27;s great on my hands and arms........they look 10 years younger! I&#x27;m ordering another bottle today( since I spilled half of my first bottle ). you have to  give this a try.</li>
            <li> Compared to other products that are the same thing-this product is significantly cheaper.  But the price does not reflect the quality.  I really like using this as a moisturizer for my hands (they get very dry), face (very sensitive skin), and hair (tends to be very frizzy).  My husband even uses it on his face to prevent razor burn!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Works well for me, makes my skin softer. Also have used it in my hair and seems good for both.</li>
            <li> I think the oil is nice and light; but there&#x27;s this slight smell(nutty? not sure) that I don&#x27;t like; otherwise good!</li>
            <li> I like the feel on my skin but can&#x27;t stand the odor of it...  will try a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> I discovered argan oil when I received a sample of HSI Professional Argan Oil when I bought a flat iron.  I like this brand because unlike the HSI brand, this is 100% organic argan oil, &amp; it works wonderful with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about this stuff I had high hopes and really wanted to try it. But this has done nothing, changed nothing - it has no smell - been using it for a month ..</li>
            <li> I was not at all impressed by this product. As with others, the product I received expired within 3 months of receipt. After using it for a month, I can tell no difference between it and straight olive oil. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell right, either. Definitely a cooking oil fragrance to it. I have better luck on my skin with the Neutrogena Light Sesame Oil product I bought at the grocery store. This product is nothing special. I do intend to try a better sourced Argan Oil product. This one is likely fake.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was highly rated and a decent price. I wanted some Argan oil after purchasing a small sample of Josie Maran&#x27;s on a whim at Sephora. I loved how hydrating hers was and that it soaked into my skin nicely with no oily appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not the case for this Argan oil. I require more drops to moisturize my face and it feels like it just sits on top of my skin, rather than being absorbed. It makes my skin look oily. It still does its job, I suppose. I just use it for my hair now, instead.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally out of control frizzy, dry, curly, insane, difficult, brittle and nappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have to use a lot of chemicals and conditioners to get a comb through it. And after I wash it, I have to spend a ton of time with a flat iron or large curling iron to get the hair looking silky. It takes a lot of time and the heat and chemicals make my hair even more dry and brittle. It&#x27;s a vicious cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have eczema, so my hair never gets very oily. My scalp has very little natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;ve added olive oil which helped somewhat but made me smell like a salad. Vegetable oil didn&#x27;t work well. Jojoba oil did, but no one liked the smell. I finally settled on mineral oil which I would work into the ends that was ok. But I still had to use the hot iron to get it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair is wet, it has pretty curls. I could never get it to stay looking that way when it dried though. Then, I heard about Argan Oil and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it&#x27;s fantastic! It is great. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy and slimy. It just gives it a nice sheen. And for the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t have to use irons or curlers to get all the strands to go the same direction and cooperate with each other. It saves me so much time. Now, like a normal person, I can just wash my hair, put a little product in, and go out in public, instead of planning my schedule around when I&#x27;ll have time to use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> We live in a cold (-20C) and dry (&amp;#60;30% humidity) climate. This oil is wonderful. I put drops in the kids&#x27; bath, on our hair, cuticles... it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I am not very constant with the use of it but I can see th difference on my skin it looks mousturized all day unlike some lotions.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so silky and smooth. I also feel like it disguises my split ends. I use it after every shower, in my hair. I&#x27;ve started to add it to my deep conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the price was good and there were several good recommendations. It is rather cloudy and heavy and I did not like it for my face.</li>
            <li> I researched Argan oil very well before choosing this one to buy. It is odorless, with an eyedropper in the bottle, so it takes only a little bit. I put it in my palm, then smooth it over my brows and eyelids, on the corners of my eyes, top of my lips and neck. Then I massage it in my nails and hands and whatever is left into my arms. My skin has never looked better, smoother or softer, even with my old standby Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful! I have used so many essential oils and carrier oils, this is among the best oils I have tried. It makes my skin and hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I bought this and will purchase it again. Lots of moisture without the oily residue. I received the product quickly and could see a difference immediately. Great for hair and face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try it, after reading all the comments. It&#x27;s great, help a lot on hair and skin; don&#x27;t know in nails, because didn&#x27;t try it there.</li>
            <li> Used a few drops in my bath every night and it was enough to make my skin flawlessly soft overtime:)</li>
            <li> This oil has saved me from severe scarring on a few occasions. It really is miraculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still figuring out all the things you can do with Argan oil, but I already know I love it. My skin is typically pretty well-moisturized, so I use this on my eye area and at the base of my nose (where I get a little dry). For the price, this is by far the best \\&quot;eye cream\\&quot; I&#x27;ve ever used. In fact, it beats or ties every brand I&#x27;ve tried. If you&#x27;re toying with the idea of buying Argan oil, do it. I promise you&#x27;ll find plenty of use for it.</li>
            <li> This is my first argan oil and I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt; It isn&#x27;t greasy and keeps my skin moist whole day. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of essential oils and this is by far my favorite. The Oil came nicely packaged and comes in a nice bottle with a dropper unlike most of the oils I got. I highly recommend to anyone looking for Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first , but pleasantly surprised. I use about 4 drops ( by first rubbing on my palms ) on&lt;br /&gt;wet hair.  I have shoulder length hair. Frizziness is  almost gone  ( I don&#x27;t blow dry ) and it is smooth and&lt;br /&gt;not oily.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying Argan oil from this company,.I received it yesterday and was excited to try it. It smells very like olive oil, I am pretty sure. My fear is an amount of some sort of olive oil was added to it to increase the volume and sell cheaper than others. Please, confirm that is 100% Argan oil and nothig else!,</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan Argan now for over a month.  This is the first time I have tried this brand.  I like it because of the stopper.  The previous band had a pump bottle that leaked down the sides and was messy.  I like this because it is certified and because the stopper allows you to get the right amount.  I will purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for your skin, nails, hair!! its amazing and a great price!! organic argan oil is not cheap!! i would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Being a picky person myself, I have always looked for the best quality products for my hair and body that contains little or no synthetic ingredients. I have recently tried this Argan oil as a potential replacement for my Moroccan Oil treatment oil. Despite the pure ingredients, this product does not seem to spread well through my hair like Moroccan oil. I also felt like my hair clumped together and weighed down after use. I have switched back to my old Moroccan oil as my hair seem more manageable after using it.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel nourished, but I have to use it at night and shampoo my hair in the morning.  If I put it on my hair after I&#x27;ve shampooed, it makes my fine hair look oily,</li>
            <li> Quality argan oil with an esay to use applicator.  The dropper allows you to control how much and where you wnat it.  The bottle is made of glass and the bottle is a dark navy so little light enters to deteriorate the product. I use it for my cuticles primarily but you could use for your hair or skin.  I recommend adding some to your favorite body moisturizer to boost the benefits.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try on my frizzy hair, I will probably never have to use any other product. Works great, and as an added bonus my hair is much stronger with less breakage.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent argan oil. Not thick and gummy and with a very mild odor.  Soaks into the skin almost instantly and with no greasy residue.  Keeps the ends of my hair soft between shampoos.  Like it way better than the stuff they sell at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply that has dimethicone and other artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use this to moisturize my face, neck and hands.  It instantly smooths the skin without being greasy.  I especially like how it smooths out the lines under my eyes.  I keep one jar at home in the medicine cabinet and carry another in my purse for late in the day touch ups.  Very reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li> this stuff feels a little like magic. it&#x27;s an oil, but doesn&#x27;t feel oily. it feels like you put your skin back to the condition it should be in. you just need a little. you can use it in your hair too.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the benefits I&#x27;ve hread of aragon oil, and I&#x27;ve been trying to go all natural, so I went straight to the source (vs. buying a hair product with this added.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very honest answer is I don&#x27;t know if the oil does what it says it does, but I like using it, and it feels good.  I have used it on my hair, nails, and as a facial moisturizer.  It has a slightly nutty scent, but it&#x27;s pleasant, not strong, and doesn&#x27;t linger.  I don&#x27;t like scents (don&#x27;t wear perfume) and this scent doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works as purported, but I&#x27;m sure it takes a while to see effects, and I haven&#x27;t seen anything drastic yet.  If it does or doesn&#x27;t, this product isn&#x27;t too expensive, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil yet have this scent that reminds me olive oil but it want stay for long I would say 3 minuts and it;s gone I also use it under my mosturizer witch help me a lot with my  very dry skin , It works for me so far. I only wich it was iligeble for super free shipping :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fine but thick spiral curly hair which has been damaged from coloring.  I use about 5 drops and apply when my hair is damp.  I only put it on the ends of my hair otherwise it makes my roots look greasy (I&#x27;m predisposed to that without using this product though).  This product has made a huge difference in the quality of my hair, I don&#x27;t get split ends as frequently, my hair is much easier to manage, and it is much shinier.</li>
            <li> I had previously ordered another brand of Argan oil but after reading the reviews for this I went ahead and ordered the ELMA and SANA Argan oil as I do like to try out with different brands.However it was not a pleasant experience, as soon as you open the bottle you can make out the sharp olive oil smell. Felt more oily and less absorbent. I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> not sure it&#x27;s pure, but it works... the smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as desired but it serves it&#x27;s purpose and portable bottle</li>
            <li> Great argan oil. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product meets my needs for hair and skin. I really like it and would buy it again. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use on my face and hair.. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out and my hair is extra shiny.  Great price</li>
            <li> I bought this oil for my hair, and is been helping me.</li>
            <li> I have not bought the product and don&#x27;t know much about it. However I did notice that the certification from ecocert says &amp;#34;Argan Oil from Roasted Almonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other so called &amp;#34;certification&amp;#34; refers also to &amp;#34;Argan Oil from Unroasted Almonds&amp;#34;. Therefore I would not accept the certification for this product as being valid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give two stars only because such an obvious mistake should not be the kind of thing a reputable company would do.</li>
            <li> This oil is so clean on my skin and hair. I use it every day and I mix it into my tinted sun screen for a better consistency.&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts for months because it only takes a few drops.  Why buy something that has Argan Oil in it when you can just buy the oil.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this oil makes my skin feel. I have really dry skin especially in the winter when the heater is on it tends to dry my skin so I always had to have a lotion by my side of the bed, now i don&#x27;t have to because my skin doesn&#x27;t get dry anymore since i started used this product! My skin has also improve. And i haven had any breakouts. The only bad thing about this oil is the smell!I only apply it at night because at first when i apply it, it smells like some sort of cheese! lol after a little while the smell goes away! So i haven&#x27;t has the chance to put this oil on my hair because i am scare its going to smell cheesy! But overall i love this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I added it to everything, from my deep conditioner to just everyday moisture.  It also worked great for straightening my hair.  The smell wasn&#x27;t amazing, but it went away fast and it wasn&#x27;t that intense.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about this stuff I had high hopes and really wanted to try it. I broke out a little but that was it. No big change  in rinkes in fact no change at all.</li>
            <li> This argan oil absorbs instantly into skin, hair,and cuticles.  The smell is pleasant enough, and the Amazon price is half that charged in my local hair salon for the same product.  Some reviewers mention skin sensitivity and break-outs - my skin is dry and extremely sensitive, and I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with a pat of thick, creamy Cetaphil after I wash my face. It really helps moisturize my dry winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also taken to rubbing a drop or two through my curls after washing/conditioning/towel drying my hair. It makes my curls lustrous and very happy. I&#x27;m a repeat customer for this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to say that this product made my acne go away, but it&#x27;s hard not to give it credit. I bought this argan oil to replace my Jojoba oil regimen (as I always apply oil on my face - oil seals moisture and makes sure your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, when it dries out it produces more oil and you get an acne fest), and this was the only change in my facial care regimen. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months, and I haven&#x27;t had any acne at all (usually I get breakouts the week before my period). So... as hesitant as I am to credit an oil for making my acne go away, I really think this product did it for me! My skin is less shiny, and just because of the acne effect (nothing has done this before) I&#x27;ll keep sticking to it. At the very least, I can testify that my skin felt moisturized and, although the oil feels more heavy when you first apply (whereas Jojoba feels very light), the feeling quickly disappears after 1-2 minutes. Highly recommended, especially if your skin is acne prone and nothing seems to work! Word of caution from someone who battled acne for 7+ years and just got it cleared out within the last 4 years: if you still have moderate/severe acne, it&#x27;s best to keep your skin moisturized (and this oil is a good option - it may seem counterintuitive to put more oil on oily skin, that&#x27;s the only way to prevent your body from making even more oil), but of course the oil alone won&#x27;t be a miracle cure. As for prescription meds, try antibiotics first (personally my skin cleared after years of acne with Doryx, but regular doxycycline should be just fine), avoid sugar and dairy, eat healthy, and best of luck!</li>
            <li> Loves this stuff, so good for my hair!</li>
            <li> love the oil, very soothing and will reuse dropper</li>
            <li> love it , already using second bottle , my hair stay nice and straight even when its raining outside . Didn&#x27;t use for anything else but my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked this it works very well, a great moisturizer for hair and skin. this also mixes well with other oil and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Lovely lightweight oil that I use as a daily facial moisturizer. I also use it to  detangle my daughters hair and to tame my own flyaways. Need very little at a time. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin silky smooth and hydrated. I generously apply it on my face 20-30 min before shower. I use it before shower because it does have slight unpleasant sent.</li>
            <li> Appears to be pure, slightly greasy feel that goes away within a minute and absorbs very quickly. I love the little dropper that comes with it, makes it easier to apply it. It also as a slight nutty smell to it but that goes away as it absorbs. Overall, seems to be high quality product. I used it as a face moisturizer and it lasted me about a year. It didn&#x27;t cause my very sensitive skin to break out so a good product in my book.</li>
            <li> I was very excited after reading all the nice reviews about Elma&amp;Sana argan oil so I finally decided to give it a try. Shipping was fast, the product came in a nice package and a cobalt blue bottle. But as soon as I opened the bottle I noticed the strong smell of olive oil. I have tried expensive argan oil before and I love the scent, so in my mind I thought that this oil might have been processed to become unscented ( I don&#x27;t even want to think that I just paid about 10 bucks for 30ml of olive oil). Although almost discouraged by the first impression, I decided to try it on my skin, for at least a week before I made any conclusions about it.I really wanted it to work, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t. Actually it made my hands and face even dryer, and I smelled like a salad. Save your money and time. [...]</li>
            <li> this has done nothing, changed nothing - it has no smell - been using it for a month now..so lets c</li>
            <li> I was not a fan at all. I thought I&#x27;d try it because it was organic, and wound up not satisfied. In comparison to the Agadir argon oil , I just felt as though it didnt smooth out my hair . I&#x27;ll stick with Agadir</li>
            <li> It seems like quality product. It also seems to work easing fine lines! But, it also seems to aggravate my acne prone skin. I need an oil, I just haven&#x27;t found the right one yet. It seems like Argan is very hit and miss for acne prone skin, some people can use it and others cannot. I&#x27;m in the &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; side, probably due to an allergy or sensitivity rather than it actually clogging pores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to help me with scars but I saw zero difference in fading after using the entire bottle.  In addition, I couldnt handle the smell of it so I dreaded putting it on every morning.  However, I had a dry patch on my skin from a product and it improved within a day after applying argan oil.  I didn&#x27;t use it on my hair because I don&#x27;t have the right hair type for oils.</li>
            <li> A poured some in my conditioner and a few drops in my lotion. I also added a good amount into my drugstore (loreal) morrocan hair oil. Keeps ya hair and skin smooth all winter long.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I bought this as a sort of dupe for the Josie Maran Argan Oil. I&#x27;ll admit, I bought this thinking it either wouldn’t do much of anything for my very oily skin or wouldn’t be pure argan oil at all. When I opened the bottle to give it a quick sniff test, I thought it smelled more like olive oil instead of the nutty scent that a lot of other reviewers reported. Not rancid at all, just not what I thought to expect. I was instantly skeptical. Until I decided to finally use it, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed up with this as a moisturizer after using my Clairsonic Mia 2 and boy was I surprised. My skin absorbed the oil almost immediately and left no greasy residue. I woke up this morning to a fabulously soft and not oily face for the first time in, well, forever. I&#x27;m pretty sure the key to making this work is using very small amount. I used just three or four light “drips” from the eyedropper that comes with it instead of giving it a full squeeze and that was more than enough for my entire face AND neck. I&#x27;m happy with that because I don’t think I’ll be going through this bottle quickly, even with nightly use. When I do eventually run out, I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Too oily for my taste, I tried using very little at times also. Still not working for me. Boy does it break my skin out, I can&#x27;t even put it on my face at all. But my hair- yeah too greasy.</li>
            <li> This product it great! I apply it in the morning before makeup and at night before I go to bed.  Try a drop or two and see for yourself.  People even asked how I manage to look a lot younger!  :)  Argan oil is an all natural moisturizer!  I also apply it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to my friends, and everyone who wanted to care for their skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Just got this, opened it, and the metal sheath around the cap cut so deeply into my thumb that I&#x27;m bleeding quite profusely.  There is no metal sheath on the image of the bottle. And there is no way to take it off.  In addition, the oil smells rancid.  If it were cooking oil I would throw it out or send it back.</li>
            <li> this is awesome for hair care.  I use it after I shampoo my hair.  I use 3-5 drops and rub it into the ends of my hair.  it has helped my hair become very healthy, I have no more split ends or dryness / fly aways.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m highly suggestible, and \\&quot;argan\\&quot; has been the big buzzword in the beauty world lately. I didn&#x27;t have the strength of will to resist the brainwashing, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar for the designer brands out there so this one seemed like a reasonable choice. I can only speak to how it worked for me, so I will say that it did not agree with my skin--I used it for a week straight under my moisturizer (I sometimes use almond oil the same way to soften and brighten skin, and have had no problems with that) and my skin broke out, so I discontinued using it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other suggested use is as a hair treatment. The bottle instructions recommended using it two different ways--first, as a leave-in hair treatment. I tried this first, and it did not turn out well, so I would not recommend this use for anyone with fine hair. I did not use much, but was left with stringy, flattened-down tresses. I suspect that this use might work better for someone with thicker hair, but it is a rather heavy oil for fine hair. The other recommended use was as a pre-shampoo treatment, which is the one use that did work for me. You smooth some of the oil all over your hair and comb it through, and keep it on for about half an hour before shampooing--I&#x27;ve found this to be a nice softening, smoothing treatment that I now do every week or so. I would probably repurchase for this purpose because this brand is relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both this product and Watts Beauty Argan and prefer this one. It seems to absorb better, has less of a scent (which leads me to believe it&#x27;s fresher), and the bottle and dropper are better quality. I also find that with this product a little goes a long way and I use less at a time than the Watts oil. I will continue to purchase this product as long as the quality stays high. Since my first purchase of this product the dropper has been changed and I love the new one. I use this oil in my hair, on my cuticles, on sensitive skin, after shaving, when I get dry skin around my nose...the uses are limitless. Worth the price, my favorite all purpose oil.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle and would recommend to anyone.  Use on your hair,  face and neck, but I especially love for nails, makes the cuticle so soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Really.  It&#x27;s so moisturizing that it healed my dry and chapped lips. I didn&#x27;t buy it for that use, got it to use it on the hair but I was suffering of dry lips since I&#x27;ve been on dental braces and I put it on just to see. Put it on bare lips and let it absorb then applied lipstick and my lips healed in a week and I mean cracked lips. Nothing else had been so effective. Other products moist your lips temporarily and after a while they get dry and chapped again. I am honestly impressed. Didn&#x27;t expect that. Wow.    Edit:  I forgot to mention that I did put it on before going to sleep.  This may have increased the results I got from it more than just using it before lipstick.  Just saying.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  I pretty much just use this now after I wash my face.  I have rather dry skin, and my skin soaks it up and feels great.  I have noticed though that if I put it on my forehead area after a shower, and then dry my hair, my bangs are super oily so I put it on after I dry my hair now.</li>
            <li> Gifted to a family friend, and she swears by it for lovely , silky, shiny hair, and easily absorbed into skin without being greasy and without break outs.</li>
            <li> I first tried argan oil when I received a sample from a high-end, organic cosmetics brand. I noticed no difference in quality between this brand and the other except that Elma&amp;Sana is a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this argan oil on my face at night occasionally, but mostly add a drop or two to boost my SPF daily moisturizer in winter. It absorbs much more easily with less greasiness than any other 100% pure oils I&#x27;ve tried (olive, grape, almond).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best use I&#x27;ve found for this oil though, is as a super effective, all-natural replacement for just about all of the hair products I&#x27;d been using previously. I have fine, straight hair cut in a simple bob. By rubbing about 4-6 drops of this oil into the ends of my hair when wet, I discovered that I no longer needed styling cremes, gels, smoothers, etc, and that my cut would look pretty dang good even without blow drying. This stuff is kind of amazing, and all for less than 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> This is nice argan oil. Just a few drops rubbed between palms, then applied to hair, will make hair smooth and shiny. It is all-natural and organic, which appeals to me on several levels.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil and am interested in purchasing the best at the best price so I decided to purchase the four organic ones offered on Amazon that interest me the most. This review is comparing [[ASIN:B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml)]],&lt;br /&gt;with [[ASIN:B000GS8T0Y 100% Cold Pressed Organic Argan Oil 100 ml BY AAA Shea Butter]]&lt;br /&gt;and [[ASIN:B005GHP5UC Watts Beauty ArganGoldTM 120ml /100% Cert. Organic Cold Pressed Argan Nut Oil - Hair &amp; Body -Morocco]]&lt;br /&gt;and [[ASIN:B001PEZAHI Slice of Nature© Virgin Argan Oil. 100% Pure, Raw, Cold pressed. 100ml(3.5oz)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW I am not addressing a skin condition just wanting to maintain healthy skin with a youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing color and thickness, the oils appear the same. The only differences I noticed are slightly different odors and skin sensations with these four oils I purchased at the same time from Amazon. The AAA SHEA butter has a slightly musky / musty odor. The Watts Beauty has a slight deodorized odor about it and increases my heart rate slightly upon application to my skin and appears to engage my immune system as my neck glands will swell shortly after application. The Slice of Nature and the ELMA&amp;SANA have the freshest odor of the four with the Slice of Nature having the stronger nutty scent of the two; skin application feels very soothing and calming in a quenching sensation sort of way. The Slice of Nature feels a little thicker and leaves more of a barrier on my skin whereas the ELMA&amp;SANA seems to absorb in better and be less noticeable upon touch and less sheen reflection.  The differences are subtle and most consumers probably would not be able to tell the difference at all. I considered not posting the review since any difference was negligible, but decided there might be others out there wondering the same thing. If so, please click helpful below.</li>
            <li> Due to some health problems my skin is dry but also extremely sensitive to many products.  I&#x27;ve tried using coconut oil... it smells great and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, but it also stays greasy for a long time (staining my pillow at night).  Argan oil is a GREAT alternative.  It sinks in very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands or face feeling greasy.  The smell is kind of nutty... I don&#x27;t find it offensive at all.  Best of all, my skin is loving it!  My face feels sooooo soft and comfortable, with none of the redness I get from most commercial products.  The price is reasonable, plus this product is organic and fair-trade certified.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong.  Argan oil keeps for around 18 months, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle long before that.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says and your hair will absolutely thank you for it , meet my expectations and i will continue to use it as time goes by.  a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I have asian hair, so it didn&#x27;t very do the job, I didn&#x27;t see any change, i would take some drop, rub it between my hands, then flip my hair and apply it, I did the routine after shower while my hair is near dry and damp, i don&#x27;t know if it moisture enough</li>
            <li> Got this argan oil oil to mix w/ sweet almond oil, avacado oil, rose hip seed oil, and some essential oils.  Love this mix, feels great on the skin!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. I have purchased expensive oil in the past. This is every bit as good at an excellent price. I will be back for more without a doubt. It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially on cold winter days. It really gives me an extra boost of moisture and my skin feels great after applying it overnight.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is wonderful. It soaks into my skin very quickly and once it does it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  I use it under my moisturizer before makeup and it seems to help any fine lines practically disappear.  I even buy it for my son who inherited my dry skin.  I do not run out of this oil.  And the price is great too.</li>
