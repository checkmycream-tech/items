            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I have a son who has a brain injury and can not brush his own teeth.</li>
            <li>Now he initiates his own brushing</li>
            <li>Dentist is super happy with teeth and no cavities.</li>
            <li>Great for covering your whole tooth!</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference for my son!</li>
            <li>I love the idea</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be more advertised for those who my need help brushing teeth of love ones who can or can not.</li>
            <li>If you struggle with performing oral hygiene on another person, you will love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Third, since implementing the use of these toothbrushes my clients&#x27; dentists have been very impressed with the improvement of the cleanliness of the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Being able to use the shape of this head and brushes on both sides and top of the teeth is a godsend.  </li>
            <li>but these are definitely the best when it comes to cleaning your teeth!!!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about these but thought, what the heck.  </li>
            <li>Teeth brushing is not one of her favorite things to do, but with this toothbrush, the task has been made okay by her.</li>
            <li>Granted, I purchased these on a whim, but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love the way it cleans my teeth in a shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li>,the kids love them</li>
            <li>as well I feel the may even do a better job then</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy them again but they are ok.</li>
            <li>No gums stimulation, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>Nice it helps my little brother who really does not like brushing his teeth, it helps him brush both sides of his teeth which is a win win for me and him.</li>
            <li>Because the bristles wrap around his tooth, we are able to get all surfaces of his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>and well they brush your teeth fine</li>
            <li>and I feel like these are a most excellent addition to brushing with a normal brush, especially for kids.  </li>
            <li>this is one of the best toothbrushes for the little ones and adults alike.</li>
            <li>This brush is not designed to specifically fit around Braces.</li>
            <li>I have a developmentally disabled son and these toothbrushes are great!!</li>
            <li>Being a cheap skate, I bought them instead of Dentrust.</li>
            <li>No fuss from him, and the great thing is my younger daughter started to use them also, without the fuss!</li>
            <li>fantastic item.</li>
            <li>My children enjoy them.</li>
            <li>A great product--not only cleans teeth well but massages gums.</li>
            <li>I have a special needs son and it makes it so easy to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li>it leaves your teeth feeling totally clean.</li>
            <li>The softer bushes are gentle on one&#x27;s gums, yet sturdy enough to do an incredibly thorough job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>I ask for special care toot brush for my husband with Parkinson</li>
            <li>I work with a lot of kids and adults with special needs and also have a sister who has Angelman&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
            <li>If you care for anyone with special needs and are questioning whether or not to invest in this product, just do it.</li>
            <li>I use these for my daughter with special needs.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to apply so much pressure, literally it does magic and your teeth comes out not only feeling fresh in and out but also plaque free and sparkling!!!</li>
            <li>My husband wants to continue using a more traditional toothbrush, but after protesting, I noticed him using this one more and more.</li>
            <li>Very effective but large for smaller child.</li>
            <li>I know this is one reason why my son&#x27;s teeth have been pretty cavity free.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great for my autistic son who has sensory issues.</li>
            <li>Love that the bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li>It is sooo worth the investment.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a lot of sensory issues and this brush allows us to do a good teeth brushing in minimal time.</li>
            <li>The bristles are perfect (not to stiff, not to soft).</li>
            <li>However, the brush is not really useful fro brushing front teeth, which is why I think it works best in conjunction with a regular brush.</li>
            <li>However, my older boy with more fine motor issues has more trouble using it.  </li>
            <li>They are ok, to wide to clean teeth right</li>
            <li>I have used these toothbrushes with many of my clients and just recently purchased some for my sister.</li>
            <li>That being said, these things are pretty darn</li>
            <li>She willingly lets me brush her teeth now instead of fighting it.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are recommended for brushing the teeth of someone living with Alzheimer&#x27;s/dementias (see internationalcaregiversassociation (dot) com/dementia-care-videos.shtml and look at the first video on that page about oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>His pediatric dentist recommended this toothbrush, and it really works!  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed that it helps my kids brush near the gumline, which is a fabulous thing.</li>
            <li>My daughter that sensory issues and really hates having her teeth brushed, so these are a huge help.</li>
            <li>I have a son with multiple disabilities and this toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This brush is very helpful for me to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this were available in a softer bristle, I would definitely buy them.  </li>
            <li>This is very helpful for situations where the recipient is uncooperative.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed at how much cleaner</li>
            <li>but it makes it much easier to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing his teeth much easier.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My daughter also finds brushing to be so much easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other perio brushes that feel like they cover more area.</li>
            <li>I am able to clean both sides of his teeth with less work then a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that it brushes the full tooth and the backs and saves time...</li>
            <li>However, I found bristles were too short to adequately clean at the gum line, where many cavities form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to only those with very short teeth.</li>
            <li>More coverage in less time.</li>
            <li>I just wish they made some a tiny bit bigger, or electronic or some deeper bristles for better coverage in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>The great thing about a three sided brush is that I can get it done in less than half the time.</li>
            <li>definitely will be ordering more in the near future...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaner teeth -&amp;#62; less time in the dental chair -&amp;#62; Less emotional and physical stress on both patients and caregivers -&amp;#62; greater happiness for everyone involved.</li>
            <li>It would be cool if they put bristles on the other side of the head</li>
            <li>Works better then the regular toothbrush and takes less time</li>
            <li>The plastic is more like a hard rubber.</li>
            <li>I got these for my 8 year old son with Autism.</li>
            <li>I have a severely handicapped daughter who really doesn&#x27;t like having her teeth brushed.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old cannot brush by herself yet</li>
            <li>I have used all different motorized toothbrushes for years as I don&#x27;t care much for a stand toothbrush until I found these...</li>
            <li>The multi-sided bristles mean you can clean more effectively in much less time.  </li>
            <li>My mistake: too soft, not a good product (but CHEAP!)</li>
            <li>These are sized mainly for children &amp; still yet again I&#x27;d say, the bristles are too short for the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush heads are perfectly angled for brushing the gumline on the inside and outside faces of the teeth, areas that are sometimes hard to remember to brush due to being invisible and sometimes hard to reach.  </li>
            <li>should mention that if you buy these for someone who often bites down on the toothbrush, it may need to be replaced more often than a regular toothbrush ( like every 2-3 months) due to the damage of the head and bristles.</li>
            <li>They have soft bristles like a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Second, it is much easier to move them around the mouth to reach all the teeth (even the very back ones) since the toothbrush head is somewhat smaller than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They do cost a little but the extra cleaning that gets done on my children&#x27;s teeth are worth it.</li>
            <li>gets as far back as possible to help prevent tartar.</li>
            <li>However, the bristles are a mite too short &amp; it makes me wonder if it reaches far enough.</li>
            <li>I think I really prefer this toothbrush to the conventional design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fanatic about my son&#x27;s dental hygiene because he is special needs</li>
            <li>My daughter is special needs and its hard enough to brush her teeth.</li>

            <li> This brush is very helpful for me to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this were available in a softer bristle, I would definitely buy them.  </li>
            <li> This is very helpful for situations where the recipient is uncooperative.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at how much cleaner</li>
            <li> but it makes it much easier to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing his teeth much easier.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My daughter also finds brushing to be so much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other perio brushes that feel like they cover more area.</li>
            <li> I am able to clean both sides of his teeth with less work then a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that it brushes the full tooth and the backs and saves time...</li>
            <li> However, I found bristles were too short to adequately clean at the gum line, where many cavities form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to only those with very short teeth.</li>
            <li> More coverage in less time.</li>
            <li> I just wish they made some a tiny bit bigger, or electronic or some deeper bristles for better coverage in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> The great thing about a three sided brush is that I can get it done in less than half the time.</li>
            <li> definitely will be ordering more in the near future...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaner teeth -&amp;#62; less time in the dental chair -&amp;#62; Less emotional and physical stress on both patients and caregivers -&amp;#62; greater happiness for everyone involved.</li>
            <li> It would be cool if they put bristles on the other side of the head</li>
            <li> Works better then the regular toothbrush and takes less time</li>
            <li> The plastic is more like a hard rubber.</li>
            <li> I got these for my 8 year old son with Autism.</li>
            <li> I have a severely handicapped daughter who really doesn&#x27;t like having her teeth brushed.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old cannot brush by herself yet</li>
            <li> I have used all different motorized toothbrushes for years as I don&#x27;t care much for a stand toothbrush until I found these...</li>
            <li> The multi-sided bristles mean you can clean more effectively in much less time.  </li>
            <li> My mistake: too soft, not a good product (but CHEAP!)</li>
            <li> These are sized mainly for children &amp; still yet again I&#x27;d say, the bristles are too short for the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush heads are perfectly angled for brushing the gumline on the inside and outside faces of the teeth, areas that are sometimes hard to remember to brush due to being invisible and sometimes hard to reach.  </li>
            <li> should mention that if you buy these for someone who often bites down on the toothbrush, it may need to be replaced more often than a regular toothbrush ( like every 2-3 months) due to the damage of the head and bristles.</li>
            <li> They have soft bristles like a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Second, it is much easier to move them around the mouth to reach all the teeth (even the very back ones) since the toothbrush head is somewhat smaller than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They do cost a little but the extra cleaning that gets done on my children&#x27;s teeth are worth it.</li>
            <li> gets as far back as possible to help prevent tartar.</li>
            <li> However, the bristles are a mite too short &amp; it makes me wonder if it reaches far enough.</li>
            <li> I think I really prefer this toothbrush to the conventional design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fanatic about my son&#x27;s dental hygiene because he is special needs</li>
            <li> My daughter is special needs and its hard enough to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> Great idea but impossible for little kids there</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them for autistic children.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it is much easier to get these toothbrushes into their mouths, which are usually almost clamped shut.</li>
            <li> Like them but don&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> For kids who still have their milk teeth, this brush was still not adequate because the bristles did not seem to reach near the gums.</li>
            <li> much recommended for starting brushing on the little one you get in and out and get all sides in one round ...</li>
            <li> Definitely not soft.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old autistic son uses this toothbrush each day and night.</li>
            <li> Smaller heads than expected</li>
            <li> bristles last as long as a typical brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too small for an adult.</li>
            <li> As hard as they try to get the entire mouth with a regular toothbrush, they just don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these to replace our regular toothbrushes which were temporarily not available to ship.</li>
            <li> Its small enough for her 9 year old mouth but not so small</li>
            <li> I also find that my gums are not stimulated well enough by this brush because it lacks the depth to hit your gums past where they meet your teeth.</li>
            <li> My son is not able to properly brush his teeth on the inside of his mouth, and fights me every step of the way when I try, this brush eliminates all the struggles we use to have brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li> I came across these toothbrushes while looking at other items, and I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  </li>
            <li> other brand uses plastic &amp;#34;icicles&amp;#34; to form the brush.</li>
            <li> mouth is just two small to manuvere this big brush around .</li>
            <li> so when she bites down I don&#x27;t feel like she can chip a tooth.</li>
            <li> but a little over priced for a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using them with him for a few years.</li>
            <li> given them to a few people in the nursing home my son is in.</li>
            <li> We have a severely autistic child.  </li>
            <li> My son is disabled and hates it when I have to brush his teeth, but when I used these tooth brushes it was quicker and easier.</li>

            <li> I have 2 autistic kids</li>
            <li> less time to brush teeth!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve gotten others in the past that had sharp plastic bristles and were not good.)</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself because I wanted a toothbrush with a small head and couldn&#x27;t find one in stores.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was just my order</li>
            <li> Not safe.</li>
            <li> Read in a book that if you have a hard time getting your kid to brush try this type of toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> These are a MUST have for toddlers.  As hard as they try to get the entire mouth with a regular toothbrush, they just don&#x27;t.  With these they get EVERYTHING!  I don&#x27;t have to monitor my son while he brushes.  These were recommended by my dentist and I&#x27;m SO thankful.</li>
            <li> Brilliant!  I love the idea and I feel like these are a most excellent addition to brushing with a normal brush, especially for kids.  The brush heads are perfectly angled for brushing the gumline on the inside and outside faces of the teeth, areas that are sometimes hard to remember to brush due to being invisible and sometimes hard to reach.  However, the brush is not really useful fro brushing front teeth, which is why I think it works best in conjunction with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Read in a book that if you have a hard time getting your kid to brush try this type of toothbrush.  Worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself because I wanted a toothbrush with a small head and couldn&#x27;t find one in stores. I like the brush, but I had to buy a tongue brush. I also find that my gums are not stimulated well enough by this brush because it lacks the depth to hit your gums past where they meet your teeth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love it. I&#x27;ve used other perio brushes that feel like they cover more area.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love that the bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great for my autistic son who has sensory issues.</li>
            <li> perfect for helping someone who cant brush his own teeth!</li>
            <li> These are amazing. My daughter that sensory issues and really hates having her teeth brushed, so these are a huge help. I can get every surface of her teeth in the relatively short amount of time she cooperates.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to both my friends with dogs and my patients who have a difficult time brushing. :) Works great for both.</li>
            <li> I ask for special care toot brush for my husband with Parkinson and I got toot rush for people with braces or toddlers  with no molars I would like to get a return label and have some one pick them up thank you Fulvia</li>
            <li> This brush is not designed to specifically fit around Braces.</li>
            <li> just what the dentist ordered!</li>
            <li> I have a son with multiple disabilities and this toothbrush is fantastic.  I have been using them with him for a few years. He has oral defensive issues this helps me get them cleaner faster.  His dentist said he could tell a difference also.</li>
            <li> I have a son who has a brain injury and can not brush his own teeth. This brush is very helpful for me to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be more advertised for those who my need help brushing teeth of love ones who can or can not. I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have given them to a few people in the nursing home my son is in. They all think it was great. Thank you to the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;person who invented this helpful tool.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to be super awesome, and the concept is great.  But this is like the hardest bristle I have ever used.  Definitely not soft.  Definitely not even medium.  I used mine for a couple of days, but switched back to my spin brush type toothbrush.  This just shredded my gums.  If this were available in a softer bristle, I would definitely buy them.  Great concept, though.  Hanging on to mine as a backup brush.</li>
            <li> What a problem solver. Stops gag reflex from lagging motor skills and oral motor sensitivity</li>
            <li> much recommended for starting brushing on the little one you get in and out and get all sides in one round ... they are awesome and worth the price</li>
            <li> I got these for my 8 year old son with Autism. They have soft bristles like a regular tooth brush. (I&#x27;ve gotten others in the past that had sharp plastic bristles and were not good.) These make tooth brushing time much more pleasant!</li>
            <li> I have a developmentally disabled son and these toothbrushes are great!! My son is not able to properly brush his teeth on the inside of his mouth, and fights me every step of the way when I try, this brush eliminates all the struggles we use to have brushing his teeth. We just had a dental visit and the dentist said his teeth look great!!!</li>
            <li> If you struggle with performing oral hygiene on another person, you will love these toothbrushes.  The multi-sided bristles mean you can clean more effectively in much less time.  This is very helpful for situations where the recipient is uncooperative.  I recommend these!</li>
            <li> I work with a lot of kids and adults with special needs and also have a sister who has Angelman&#x27;s Syndrome. About 99% of the individuals I work with HATE oral care and fight against it every step of the way. I have used these toothbrushes with many of my clients and just recently purchased some for my sister. I&#x27;m so pleased with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is much easier to get these toothbrushes into their mouths, which are usually almost clamped shut. Second, it is much easier to move them around the mouth to reach all the teeth (even the very back ones) since the toothbrush head is somewhat smaller than a regular toothbrush. Third, since implementing the use of these toothbrushes my clients&#x27; dentists have been very impressed with the improvement of the cleanliness of the teeth and gums. This is very good news for people who must be both sedated and held down/put on a papoose board in order to have any dental work done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that if you buy these for someone who often bites down on the toothbrush, it may need to be replaced more often than a regular toothbrush ( like every 2-3 months) due to the damage of the head and bristles. That being said, these things are pretty darn durable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner teeth -&amp;#62; less time in the dental chair -&amp;#62; Less emotional and physical stress on both patients and caregivers -&amp;#62; greater happiness for everyone involved. If you care for anyone with special needs and are questioning whether or not to invest in this product, just do it. It is sooo worth the investment.</li>
            <li> We have a severely autistic child.  Being able to use the shape of this head and brushes on both sides and top of the teeth is a godsend.  We sent one to his autism school for his teachers to work with him too.  Our child bites, so you don&#x27;t want to get your fingers too close to the business end of those chompers.  We would call this item a must have.</li>
            <li> Best special needs toothbrush !</li>
            <li> The bristles are too hard for an infants mouth.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a lot of sensory issues and this brush allows us to do a good teeth brushing in minimal time. Dentist is super happy with teeth and no cavities.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy, durable brushes. The bristles are perfect (not to stiff, not to soft). I recommend this product to anyone. it leaves your teeth feeling totally clean.</li>
            <li> I came across these toothbrushes while looking at other items, and I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  I have a severely handicapped daughter who really doesn&#x27;t like having her teeth brushed.  The great thing about a three sided brush is that I can get it done in less than half the time.</li>
            <li> This works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other brand uses plastic &amp;#34;icicles&amp;#34; to form the brush. Onlt thing i miss about those is the sharpness of the handle (it can be used to scrape the back of the tongue) and the built in tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes are really awesome. I have a special needs son and it makes it so easy to brush his teeth. The price was good as well, ordering in bulk.</li>
            <li> Being a cheap skate, I bought them instead of Dentrust. My mistake: too soft, not a good product (but CHEAP!)</li>
            <li> My son is disabled and hates it when I have to brush his teeth, but when I used these tooth brushes it was quicker and easier. No fuss from him, and the great thing is my younger daughter started to use them also, without the fuss!</li>
            <li> ive always bought the up and coming toothbrushes that claim to be the best but these are definitely the best when it comes to cleaning your teeth!!!!</li>
            <li> Great idea but impossible for little kids there mouth is just two small to manuvere this big brush around .</li>
            <li> My 6 year old autistic son uses this toothbrush each day and night. No cavities.</li>
            <li> One of the best brush I seen before, especial for kid and people with special needed. I recommend a lot.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about these but thought, what the heck.  I am amazed at how much cleaner they get my son&#x27;s teeth.  Even his dentist was impressed! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great for covering your whole tooth!</li>
            <li> I care for my adult, mentally challenged sister, and these toothbrushes have been a God send. Teeth brushing is not one of her favorite things to do, but with this toothbrush, the task has been made okay by her. She willingly lets me brush her teeth now instead of fighting it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes get into and all around each tooth.  I know this is one reason why my son&#x27;s teeth have been pretty cavity free.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too small for an adult.</li>
            <li> These work well on my teeth and gums, but I also like to brush my tongue and the roof of my mouth. It would be cool if they put bristles on the other side of the head so you could just flip it when needed.</li>
            <li> Very effective but large for smaller child.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was just my order but the bristles kept on coming out. Not safe. I returned them without any problem from amazon.</li>
            <li> They are ok, to wide to clean teeth right</li>
            <li> I thought this would be good for my son with autism and cut his time brushing.  My 8yo Aspie loves it.  However, my older boy with more fine motor issues has more trouble using it.  We went back to a regular toothbrush for him.</li>
            <li> My son has autism and took to this brush immediately. Now he initiates his own brushing</li>
            <li> this is one of the best toothbrushes for the little ones and adults alike. gets as far back as possible to help prevent tartar.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old cannot brush by herself yet but with this brush she can get started and I can finish the job without accidentally stabbing the inside of her cheek. What a great invention. It doesn&#x27;t just save time, the teeth become like a guide for the brush and hand so it helps with getting a feel for brushing.</li>
            <li> Smaller heads than expected but it makes it much easier to brush his teeth. Using on a teenager.</li>
            <li> I Like them I just wish they made some a tiny bit bigger, or electronic or some deeper bristles for better coverage in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Nice it helps my little brother who really does not like brushing his teeth, it helps him brush both sides of his teeth which is a win win for me and him.</li>
            <li> Great to use on a child who does not like to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to replace our regular toothbrushes which were temporarily not available to ship. Granted, I purchased these on a whim, but I am so glad I did. This is a great toothbrush! Good quality materials. The softer bushes are gentle on one&#x27;s gums, yet sturdy enough to do an incredibly thorough job cleaning teeth. My husband wants to continue using a more traditional toothbrush, but after protesting, I noticed him using this one more and more. I think I really prefer this toothbrush to the conventional design. Love the way it cleans my teeth in a shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have used all different motorized toothbrushes for years as I don&#x27;t care much for a stand toothbrush until I found these...,the kids love them and I do as well I feel the may even do a better job then the electronic ones...I especially like that it brushes the full tooth and the backs and saves time...definitely will be ordering more in the near future...thank you for a great quality tooth brush</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are recommended for brushing the teeth of someone living with Alzheimer&#x27;s/dementias (see internationalcaregiversassociation (dot) com/dementia-care-videos.shtml and look at the first video on that page about oral hygiene. You will see how that brush is used properly. My husband has vascular dementia and his nurses/aids have all watched this video in training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Ethelle Lord</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied for this product.</li>
            <li> These arrived on time and well they brush your teeth fine but a little over priced for a tooth brush. I probably won&#x27;t buy them again but they are ok.</li>
            <li> my autistic grandson now loves brushing his teeth. fantastic item.</li>
            <li> Just the thing for a reluctant tooth brusher.</li>
            <li> Concept was good.  However, I found bristles were too short to adequately clean at the gum line, where many cavities form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to only those with very short teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fanatic about my son&#x27;s dental hygiene because he is special needs &amp; I&#x27;d hate for him to have toothaches or problems. My son is 7 &amp; these do what they claim to do. However, the bristles are a mite too short &amp; it makes me wonder if it reaches far enough. No gums stimulation, that&#x27;s for sure. I expect that he&#x27;d outgrow them once his baby teeth are gone. These are sized mainly for children &amp; still yet again I&#x27;d say, the bristles are too short for the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated: Amazon sent me the wrong product. They sent me the toddler ones. For kids who still have their milk teeth, this brush was still not adequate because the bristles did not seem to reach near the gums. I&#x27;ll place a review there too.</li>
            <li> My son has sensory integration disorder that makes tooth brushing difficult for him.  He constantly gags and bites on his toothbrush.  His pediatric dentist recommended this toothbrush, and it really works!  It makes brushing his teeth much easier.  Because the bristles wrap around his tooth, we are able to get all surfaces of his teeth clean.  I definitely recommend this toothbrush!  It has made a huge difference for my son!</li>
            <li> I have 2 autistic kids and these are the best ever tooth brushes for them.</li>
            <li> These brushes help to get all 3 sides of my daughters teeth. Its small enough for her 9 year old mouth but not so small it doesn&#x27;t get all the spots. Saves lots of time while brushing. My daughter is special needs and its hard enough to brush her teeth. This allows us to brush all 3 sides at once with one motion.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles last as long as a typical brush. The plastic is more like a hard rubber. This is great so when she bites down I don&#x27;t feel like she can chip a tooth.</li>
            <li> Love this for my son who has oral issues! less time to brush teeth! covers all sides of the teeth at once!</li>
            <li> Product was as described. My children enjoy them.</li>
            <li> A great product--not only cleans teeth well but massages gums.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! Great Seller!!</li>
            <li> These are incredible. Bought them for my toddler but I use one for myself too!! Amazing. I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! My son hates having his teeth brushed. Surround toothbrushes make it a faster, easier task. More coverage in less time. I highly recommend them for autistic children.</li>
            <li> I use these for my daughter with special needs. Love them</li>
            <li> Works better then the regular toothbrush and takes less time</li>
            <li> Like them but don&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes to have for my children. They do cost a little but the extra cleaning that gets done on my children&#x27;s teeth are worth it. The kids like them too.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever even for adults!!!! Omg!!! Why didn&#x27;t I see this before now!!!!! I got it for myself and It cleans so well and you don&#x27;t need to apply so much pressure, literally it does magic and your teeth comes out not only feeling fresh in and out but also plaque free and sparkling!!! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes changed our lives. My son has Autism and has some motor skill issues. Brushing his teeth has always been a challenge for him. Until last year I was still helping him brush this teeth (he&#x27;s 13). The first time he used this he exclaimed &amp;#34;This is the best invention EVER!&amp;#34;. My daughter also finds brushing to be so much easier. She says that it helps her brush the lingual side of her teeth, where that was always a bit difficult before. I have also noticed that it helps my kids brush near the gumline, which is a fabulous thing. My son is right, this may truly be one of the best inventions ever!</li>
            <li> Having a child with Autism these were a MUST I wish someone told me about them along time ago!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush for my son who has cerebral palsy.  I am able to clean both sides of his teeth with less work then a regular toothbrush.  It is hard to get the backside but this toothbrush makes that easier.</li>
            <li> As a dental hygienist it always amazes me how people always miss the tongue surfaces while brushing,  yet overbrush the outside surfaces . This is a good solution.</li>
