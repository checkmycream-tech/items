            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying an acne-free face right now, and everyone seemed to notice the difference since the last time they saw me (which is great!).</li>

            <li>Not a bad product!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I tried many many solutions (proactiv, clinique, etc...) and nothing &#x27;really&#x27; worked.</li>
            <li>This bottle was bought because I wanted to qualify for free super saver shipping- best half decision I ever made.  </li>
            <li>Worth ever penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bren buying this great cream fir a long time.</li>
            <li>It is best for whiteheads although I definitely use this on popped pimples to keep them from coming back.</li>
            <li>Quickly dries up pimples as stated.</li>
            <li>This is a great treatment for whiteheads, but it must be an open wound, or it won&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>am pregnant and I can still use the products.</li>
            <li>Says it dries out blemishes or acne bumps quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries up a blemish quickly.</li>
            <li>After suffering from seasonal breakouts for the last couple of years I thought for sure it was just something I had to deal with...until now!  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for &amp;#34;making living so easy&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li>This product was worth the money.</li>
            <li>, My forehead laugh at it, no response week one.</li>
            <li>Love Mario Badescu&#x27;s products, they work on my sometimes problematic sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and my spots were mostly on neck, which is also very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>it helps the acne and dkes exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Like the idea, acne treatment medicine with calamine lotion to calm the skin, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my pimples.</li>
            <li>Works great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The only con this product has is that it isn&#x27;t available in stores!</li>
            <li>You can really feel this stuff working!</li>
            <li>If you need help with the occasional breakout of whiteheads, this stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>I will go back to my clearsil works better.</li>
            <li>Not only that but after trying everything under the sun to relieve mosquito bite itching and swelling, this does the trick better than any recommendation I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I feel a pimple coming on and by morning the size has either significantly reduced or it is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>just dab on the problem areas at night and leave it till morning, it pretty much dries it up</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>No dramatic changes</li>
            <li>but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  </li>
            <li>I apply a dab on a pimple overnight and noticed a slight decrease in size the next morning, at best it keeps the pimple from getting bigger.</li>
            <li>n heals them much much faster.</li>
            <li>I really like this line for I</li>
            <li>Mario Badescu has a fancy skin care salon in NY; all their products seem very well formulated.</li>
            <li>Only problem the liquid dries up quickly</li>
            <li>This mostly just dried me out and made me stinky.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s essentially the same thing as Bye-Bye blemish, which is also available on Amazon and way cheaper.</li>
            <li>I used this a lot at first, every night and multiple spots.  </li>
            <li>This was the only product that got rid of my acne - and it did it fast!  </li>
            <li>The first day I received the drying lotion I put it on a pimple that was just starting to surface (at night).  </li>
            <li>Worth the price because it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have an adult acne problem.  </li>
            <li>I hope they are using it correctly and letting the product settle completely before using.</li>
            <li>and I have bought it three times so far.</li>
            <li>and it is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally, I still get one or two pimples for consuming too much fast foods or staying up late, so I dabbed the drying lotion on, and I was glad to know it still works.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works on post-menopausal breakouts and stops mine before they actually reach the surface.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll have pink polka dots on your face until it&#x27;s absorbed, but who cares what you look like while you sleep.</li>
            <li>Not good for under the skin blemishes or even most whiteheads.</li>
            <li>I went to bed with new pimples starting put the lotion on over night,</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new way to shrink pimples overnight.</li>
            <li>From the cheap packaging and the infamous maker, I hesitated to put this on my skin at first, but there was nothing to lose with my condition at the time.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and very stubborn zits, so I was amazed that it only took a few days.  </li>
            <li>The dryness leaves marks on your face much longer than other products would.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, despite reading several positive reviews from other Amazon customers.</li>
            <li>This small bottle provides numerous applications, well worth the price.  </li>

            <li> I have very oily skin and very stubborn zits, so I was amazed that it only took a few days.  </li>
            <li> The dryness leaves marks on your face much longer than other products would.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, despite reading several positive reviews from other Amazon customers.</li>
            <li> This small bottle provides numerous applications, well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> even worse and was told it is supposed to get worse before it gets better!!)</li>
            <li> so if you have acne make sure it&#x27;s because your face is oily because if your acne is caused by other things, I believe this lotion will make it worse.</li>
            <li> It gets 4 stars in my book because you cannot use this lotion outside the house (unless you don&#x27;t mind little pink dots on your face), so if a blemish shows up first thing in the morning, you are stuck without treatment until you are home for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It definitely does dry it up overnight.  </li>
            <li> Remember, this is a \\&quot;drying\\&quot; lotion, so be careful to only apply it to your actual blemish.</li>
            <li> Use a few nights in a row to completely eliminate - does not work on clogged pores or those types of skin blemishes but works fantastically on pimples!</li>
            <li> I went a little over a week with clear skin.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 24 year old son who still has a little bit of acne problems.  </li>
            <li> Any area of unaffected skin that you apply the lotion to, will probably dry out, and may flake and peel.  </li>
            <li> Will probably use other acne spot treatments in the future.</li>
            <li> Just a dab is needed to get those blemishes to dry up and disappear.  </li>
            <li> It did not meet the claims to dry up over night.</li>
            <li> No it doesn&#x27;t work every time on every single pimple.</li>
            <li> As soon as you put it on, the whole area near and on the pimple itself gets slightly numb and in the morning it is smaller and less red.</li>
            <li> Some do nothing at all, while others managed to suppress the acne for the first few weeks, then after that, the outbreak got worse and whatever I used before that suddenly became ineffective.</li>
            <li> this will last a very long time since you only use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> the pink stuff could precipitate out again.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times but the times that I have</li>
            <li> It truly does work, especially if you put it on trouble spots at bedtime.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant I broke out with such terrible acne that no other product would clear up.  </li>
            <li> I threw out my other acne medication and just use this-</li>
            <li> I am thinking about buying some of his other stuff.  </li>
            <li> Over the years he&#x27;s been to a dermatologist, tried tons of other products</li>
            <li> the only thing that calms down my occasional big and painful zits...works on regular pimples</li>
            <li> On the downside, I do notice a dark area and peeling on the pimple that goes away in a few days.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other products, it actually treated my acne outbreak, and did not make it worse upon discontinuation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days to eliminate a pimple and its not working.</li>
            <li> This looks like the pink stuff my mom put on me when I had chickenpox as a kid, and smells worse.</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried Proactive (made me breakout</li>
            <li> It will actually make it appear worse, because it will dry the skin over the pimple, making it impossible to conceal.</li>
            <li> It sucks others haven&#x27;t gotten this to work for them.</li>
            <li> I was so desperate to have my complexion back!  </li>
            <li> But that slowly waned.  </li>
            <li> Just use a Qtip and slowly dip it through the 2 layers.</li>
            <li> Expensive, so be very careful.  </li>
            <li> because when I do I&#x27;m not a happy girl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> obviously it&#x27;s pink and people might think you have chicken pox with calamine lotion on them!</li>
            <li> This product was expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I try everything for my face, expensive stuff included.  </li>
            <li> A year ago, I had a terrible acne outbreak that lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> Depending on how bad your skin is, a bottle of this stuff should about a year.</li>
            <li> just wish it didn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re every having a breakout stint put this on, it dries everything out before it gets crazy!  </li>
            <li> And some pimples just get really horrible</li>

            <li> Works great and last a long time. Have seen great results so far and will cont. to use this in the future.</li>
            <li> not that impressed...I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days to eliminate a pimple and its not working.</li>
            <li> I have an adult acne problem.  This bottle was bought because I wanted to qualify for free super saver shipping- best half decision I ever made.  I used this a lot at first, every night and multiple spots.  But that slowly waned.  I went a little over a week with clear skin.  I use it only on the weekends now, as needed.  I threw out my other acne medication and just use this- I am thinking about buying some of his other stuff.  Also, mine came shaken/mixed up, so I just let it set for about a day or two so the pink stuff could precipitate out again.</li>
            <li> Makes wonder is my forehead acne. I try this, My forehead laugh at it, no response week one.</li>
            <li> This product was expensive for what it is. It eventually dries up break outs, but doesn&#x27;t do a thing to lessen healing time. The dryness leaves marks on your face much longer than other products would.</li>
            <li> It sucks others haven&#x27;t gotten this to work for them. I hope they are using it correctly and letting the product settle completely before using. As for me, this product is hg and I have bought it three times so far. It is best for whiteheads although I definitely use this on popped pimples to keep them from coming back. I have also used this successfully on forming cystic pimples and they flattened. No it doesn&#x27;t work every time on every single pimple. And some pimples just get really horrible no matter what you use on them. But this stuff is my most reliable spot treatment for overnight, and I will keep buying forever. Only con is that in the winter when my face isn&#x27;t as oily it&#x27;s harder to wash off in the morning and can leave a pink cast if my cleanser is too gentle.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I have made it a point to never run out of this because when I do I&#x27;m not a happy girl.&lt;br /&gt;Use it before bed as soon as you feel a blemish starting and 9 times out of 10 you wake up and it is completely gone.  Sometimes you need to use it two nights in a row but most times one treatment does the trick.</li>
            <li> No dramatic changes but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  Expensive, so be very careful.  No spilling.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and my spots were mostly on neck, which is also very sensitive.  This mostly just dried me out and made me stinky.  I think if you have just a pimple or too, this could work.  But it&#x27;s essentially the same thing as Bye-Bye blemish, which is also available on Amazon and way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Worth ever penny! If you dip a q-tip in the solution this will last a very long time since you only use a very small amount. Quickly dries up pimples as stated.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  Trust me, I try everything for my face, expensive stuff included.  If you&#x27;re every having a breakout stint put this on, it dries everything out before it gets crazy!  Smells like sulfur, cuz well, it is:)</li>
            <li> A year ago, I had a terrible acne outbreak that lasted for a long time. I tried many many solutions (proactiv, clinique, etc...) and nothing &#x27;really&#x27; worked. Some do nothing at all, while others managed to suppress the acne for the first few weeks, then after that, the outbreak got worse and whatever I used before that suddenly became ineffective. A dear friend of mine felt my frustration and shipped me this product. From the cheap packaging and the infamous maker, I hesitated to put this on my skin at first, but there was nothing to lose with my condition at the time. I tried this drying lotion and it worked wonder! It worked quickly and effectively! Unlike the other products, it actually treated my acne outbreak, and did not make it worse upon discontinuation. I&#x27;m enjoying an acne-free face right now, and everyone seemed to notice the difference since the last time they saw me (which is great!). Occasionally, I still get one or two pimples for consuming too much fast foods or staying up late, so I dabbed the drying lotion on, and I was glad to know it still works. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product to my girl friends, and now everyone seems to have one of their own.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times but the times that I have I am really impressed with the results. I went to bed with new pimples starting put the lotion on over night, woke-up and it was gone. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works excellent to clear up skin blemishes quickly</li>
            <li> the only thing that calms down my occasional big and painful zits...works on regular pimples too&lt;br /&gt;I just dab on the problem areas at night and leave it till morning, it pretty much dries it up n decreases the size n heals them much much faster. Love Mario Badescu&#x27;s products, they work on my sometimes problematic sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Dries up pimples but dries up your skin as well so you basically have flaky patches that appear flakier still with concealer on!  It smells like calamine with alcohol.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant I broke out with such terrible acne that no other product would clear up.  I was so desperate to have my complexion back!  After watching a review someone on YouTube made for this product, I decided to give it a try; and I am SO GLAD that I did!  This was the only product that got rid of my acne - and it did it fast!  I&#x27;d put the product on at night and the zit would be gone within 2 days.  I have very oily skin and very stubborn zits, so I was amazed that it only took a few days.  I will continue to buy this product.  The only con this product has is that it isn&#x27;t available in stores!</li>
            <li> This is a great treatment for whiteheads, but it must be an open wound, or it won&#x27;t really do much. It definitely does dry it up overnight.  I would not put this on in the day, but if you have nowhere to go, then your good.</li>
            <li> I use this as a spot treatment overnight for blemishes and pimples. It works like a dream! I just dip a QTip into the solution all the way to the bottom and dab it on my problem areas. I wake up in the morning and it&#x27;s pretty much gone. I really enjoy this product. It&#x27;s definitely a product I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Works quick and effective for pimples and acne that pops up now and then. Only problem the liquid dries up quickly</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, despite reading several positive reviews from other Amazon customers. You can really feel this stuff working! As soon as you put it on, the whole area near and on the pimple itself gets slightly numb and in the morning it is smaller and less red. Reminds me of \\&quot;calamine lotion\\&quot; from when I was a kid and would get poison ivy. It even smells like it! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new way to shrink pimples overnight.</li>
            <li> Works really good!! Love this product!!</li>
            <li> The is a drying lotion so if you have acne make sure it&#x27;s because your face is oily because if your acne is caused by other things, I believe this lotion will make it worse.</li>
            <li> If you need help with the occasional breakout of whiteheads, this stuff is magic. As soon as you see a whitehead begin to form, put a tiny dab of drying lotion on it, and it will either be gone in the morning, or it will be visibly reduced. In my experience, this lotion does NOT work on cystic acne. It will actually make it appear worse, because it will dry the skin over the pimple, making it impossible to conceal. Remember, this is a \\&quot;drying\\&quot; lotion, so be careful to only apply it to your actual blemish. I use a Q-tip. Any area of unaffected skin that you apply the lotion to, will probably dry out, and may flake and peel.  It gets 4 stars in my book because you cannot use this lotion outside the house (unless you don&#x27;t mind little pink dots on your face), so if a blemish shows up first thing in the morning, you are stuck without treatment until you are home for the rest of the day. Other than that, it is the best $15 you can spend on acne treatment.  The 1 oz. bottle lasted me 3 years!</li>
            <li> This looks like the pink stuff my mom put on me when I had chickenpox as a kid, and smells worse. But it dramatically shrinks cystic acne overnight. I&#x27;ve had problem skin since middle school, so I have experience with many types of acne products (unfortunately). Short of prescription-level stuff, the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion is the best emergency acne treatment I&#x27;ve tried. Depending on how bad your skin is, a bottle of this stuff should about a year. So that kind of makes up for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it didn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
            <li> I really like this line for I am pregnant and I can still use the products. I only use this at night cuz obviously it&#x27;s pink and people might think you have chicken pox with calamine lotion on them! Dries pimples up well</li>
            <li> This products does work well. I apply a dab on a pimple overnight and noticed a slight decrease in size the next morning, at best it keeps the pimple from getting bigger. On the downside, I do notice a dark area and peeling on the pimple that goes away in a few days. Not a bad product!</li>
            <li> After suffering from seasonal breakouts for the last couple of years I thought for sure it was just something I had to deal with...until now!  A friend of mine recommended this product and I am so very glad I gave it a try.  In the past I have tried Proactive (made me breakout even worse and was told it is supposed to get worse before it gets better!!), several drug store brand acne medications, as well as Dermatoglist perscriptions (way to expensive to be able to maintain).  The first day I received the drying lotion I put it on a pimple that was just starting to surface (at night).  When I woke up in the morning it was virtually gone! I have been using this product anytime I feel a pimple coming on and by morning the size has either significantly reduced or it is completely gone.  Thank you MB!</li>
            <li> This small bottle provides numerous applications, well worth the price.  Just a dab is needed to get those blemishes to dry up and disappear.  Only drawback,  you&#x27;ll have pink polka dots on your face until it&#x27;s absorbed, but who cares what you look like while you sleep.</li>
            <li> Heard many accounts of how this lotion works, but was skeptical. It truly does work, especially if you put it on trouble spots at bedtime. By morning, the area looks so much better!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 24 year old son who still has a little bit of acne problems.  He loves it and uses when a blemish appears.  He says it takes care of it immediately. Over the years he&#x27;s been to a dermatologist, tried tons of other products but this one so far has worked the best for him.</li>
            <li> This definitely helps diminish blemishes.  Use a few nights in a row to completely eliminate - does not work on clogged pores or those types of skin blemishes but works fantastically on pimples!</li>
            <li> Have been buying this product for both daughters for years.  They swear by it.  Says it dries out blemishes or acne bumps quickly.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter. She says it is THE BEST product she has ever used for her adult acne.</li>
            <li> This lotion has been something I wanted to try and finally did. It did not meet the claims to dry up over night. I will go back to my clearsil works better.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on post-menopausal breakouts and stops mine before they actually reach the surface. Not only that but after trying everything under the sun to relieve mosquito bite itching and swelling, this does the trick better than any recommendation I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Dries up a blemish quickly. Worth the price because it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bren buying this great cream fir a long time. Be sure NOT to shake it. Just use a Qtip and slowly dip it through the 2 layers. Then dot it on any place you have a zit or red spot before u go to bed. In tge morning, wash it off well, and the zits are gone or smaller.  The key is to use it faithfully any time you see a red spot starting to appear. Works great for surface acne. Mario Badescu has a fancy skin care salon in NY; all their products seem very well formulated. Its nice to get the MB products on Amazon at a lower price and not even have to drive somewhere to buy it. Thanks to Amazon for &amp;#34;making living so easy&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> I used to love this as a kid, it worked great but not so much anymore. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a different formula or anything, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to. Not good for under the skin blemishes or even most whiteheads. It breaks the skin upon removing and did more damage than good for me</li>
