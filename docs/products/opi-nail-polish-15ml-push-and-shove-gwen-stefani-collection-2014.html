            <li>Great for pedicures.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because if it gets messed up</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>Nice polish.  </li>
            <li>It goes on matte but dries to a nice glossy silver.</li>
            <li>This polish is nice, but you have to follow instructions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I discovered this color at a salon and quickly ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped polish very quickly!</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery, loved the nail decals included!!</li>
            <li>Even if you put a top coat over it to try to protect the finish, it still chips off.  </li>
            <li>the nail polish itself is really different and awesome when you paint your nails.</li>
            <li>It says you can&#x27;t use top coat</li>
            <li>You do get a chrome look though I had hoped for a more mirror look, even shinier.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many bottles from this seller.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS COLOR.</li>
            <li>Also, they advise against a top coat?  </li>
            <li>Love the way this looks</li>
            <li>Looks great - Looks like real silver on my nails.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a top coat tho to help protect it and keep it from chipping off.</li>
            <li>If a top coat is applied, the finish does not look as metallic.</li>
            <li>Also, feel free to use a top coat, I didn&#x27;t think it changed the appearance by a noticeable amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as &amp;#34;mirrored&amp;#34; as they make it sound.  </li>
            <li>It is a good idea to lightly buff any imperfections from the nails prior to applying.  </li>
            <li>shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>for the shipping, it was super quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li>I like that it came with its own special base coat, and I did use a top quality topcoat and the polish stayed perfect and shiny for 3 days(which by reviews</li>
            <li>once it starts getting scratches it is not as pretty!</li>
            <li>The application can be tricky, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Arrive super fast!</li>
            <li>I have this color on right now</li>
            <li>It was the right color for the job</li>
            <li>I like the polish - had a bit of a strong odor (expected) and looked amazing on, but really it wasn&#x27;t the polish for me.</li>
            <li>Would have loved the look if it didn&#x27;t show every little imperfection.</li>
            <li>First, if there are any imperfections to your nails</li>
            <li>so I think a top coat would be necessary.</li>
            <li>The quality of this OPI is very workable and just as I was expecting!</li>
            <li>, it was pretty festive.</li>
            <li>You should also be aware that any imperfections/ridges tend to show.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be saving this for special occasions, but totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>however this really is a one day use nail polish.</li>
            <li>It was also packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li>But I really like it.  </li>
            <li>which is my normal wear for any nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Plus it was way cheaper than buying new customized emblems or getting it professionally painted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a vibrant high chrome polish.</li>
            <li>To get the best results I used the accompanying base coat &amp;#34;Lay</li>
            <li>Ive spent a ton of $ on duds and this one is by far the closest so far.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It is a very flashy, in your face, can&#x27;t ignore my nails kind of shade with a mirror or aluminum foil finish.  </li>

            <li> Disappointed.  First, if there are any imperfections to your nails it shows up (like lines) and then it lasts only for a couple of days before chipping off badly.  Even if you put a top coat over it to try to protect the finish, it still chips off.  All other polish can last me a couple of weeks.  Not this one.  Would have loved the look if it didn&#x27;t show every little imperfection.</li>
            <li> I have this color on right now and I&#x27;m always complimented. It&#x27;s such a vibrant high chrome polish. Stand out from the rest. I&#x27;m so happy I discovered this color at a salon and quickly ordered it from Amazon. Great for pedicures.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly. received as described. the nail polish itself is really different and awesome when you paint your nails. however this really is a one day use nail polish. once it starts getting scratches it is not as pretty!</li>
            <li> Yes I am a man, yes I bought this nail polish, no I did not give it to my girlfriend, and no I did not use it on my fingernails. I bought this nail polish to paint the emblems on the front and back of my car. Yes a little weird but it worked perfect. It was the right color for the job and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It&#x27;s great because if it gets messed up i can always just take it and re-do it. Plus it was way cheaper than buying new customized emblems or getting it professionally painted.</li>
            <li> This polish is truly gorgeous! I like that it came with its own special base coat, and I did use a top quality topcoat and the polish stayed perfect and shiny for 3 days(which by reviews is about a day longer than usual). I will definitely be saving this for special occasions, but totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> Not as shinny as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Nice polish.  Goes on dull but dries shiny.  It says you can&#x27;t use top coat but you can.</li>
            <li> You do get a chrome look though I had hoped for a more mirror look, even shinier.  It didn&#x27;t lasst that long so I think a top coat would be necessary.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped polish very quickly! It was also packaged very well. I have purchased many bottles from this seller. Would definitely recommend purchasing from them. OPI - Push and Shove is a Gorgeous color! The quality of this OPI is very workable and just as I was expecting! Beautiful!!</li>
            <li> Love the product! Arrive super fast! Thanks</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOR. It goes on matte but dries to a nice glossy silver.</li>
            <li> I like the polish - had a bit of a strong odor (expected) and looked amazing on, but really it wasn&#x27;t the polish for me. I&#x27;ll probably wear it again though, it was pretty festive. May just keep it around for potential theme needs. Also, feel free to use a top coat, I didn&#x27;t think it changed the appearance by a noticeable amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shipping, it was super quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as &amp;#34;mirrored&amp;#34; as they make it sound.  But my daughter still loves it.  It lasts longer than the one day they say it does.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, loved the nail decals included!!</li>
            <li> I like it.  You do get a chrome look.  The application can be tricky, but it&#x27;s worth it.  The effect lasted about two days.  I don&#x27;t mind the short term results because I change my nail polish often.  You should also be aware that any imperfections/ridges tend to show.  You may have to use a ridge filler.</li>
            <li> This polish is nice, but you have to follow instructions.  You must use the lay down base or the polish will not adhere to nail.  The instructions say it only last for one day, however, I&#x27;m on day 4, it is just starting to peel at the end of the nail.  Also, they advise against a top coat?  The delivery was fast and ahead of schedule.  Would have given 5 stars if it would last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Very good! very very good!</li>
            <li> Love the way this looks</li>
            <li> This is a tricky polish but well worth it.  To get the best results I used the accompanying base coat &amp;#34;Lay Down that Base&amp;#34;.  I then applied one coat of Push and Shove using the three strokes method with no top coat.  On me it lasted three or four days which is my normal wear for any nail polish.  On my daughter however, it started pealing badly later on the same day she put it on.  So I&#x27;m thinking body chemistry may affect how this polish wears and or it&#x27;s durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very flashy, in your face, can&#x27;t ignore my nails kind of shade with a mirror or aluminum foil finish.  But I really like it.  When I bought it I really didn&#x27;t care that it would potentially last a few days because that&#x27;s how long any nail polish lasts on me anyways.  It is a good idea to lightly buff any imperfections from the nails prior to applying.  I&#x27;m an OPI hoarder so this one is a keeper for me!  ;)</li>
            <li> Looks great - Looks like real silver on my nails. Wish there was a top coat tho to help protect it and keep it from chipping off. If a top coat is applied, the finish does not look as metallic.</li>
            <li> Kind of a boring color.  I would go with china glaze silver lining.</li>
            <li> Dont know how it works, but this is the only nail polish that actually achieves the chrome look.  Ive spent a ton of $ on duds and this one is by far the closest so far.</li>
