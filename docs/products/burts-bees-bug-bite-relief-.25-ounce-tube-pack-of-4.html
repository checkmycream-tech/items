            <li> I carry one in my purse as I live in Florida where mosquitoes are year round.  </li>

            <li> placed order for a friend because product not available locally.</li>
            <li> Other than its price, there is nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> It is quite difficult to apply and doesn&#x27;t really work as intended.</li>
            <li> I immediately apply to bites and within less than a minute, relief.  </li>
            <li> If I waited to put it on it took a little bit longer to work.</li>
            <li> We have two little kids and they are always getting mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li> It takes the itch and swelling down in minutes!</li>
            <li> It stops the itch and is not greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> The stick itself is hard, but don&#x27;t let that fool you, it works.  </li>
            <li> so things don&#x27;t get worse.</li>
            <li> The exp day is oct 2012,so angry about itÔºÅonly 3 month left!so</li>
            <li> I am using it now on our son who, in past summers, would scratch himself bloody because of the bugs.</li>
            <li> I do not think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been tortured by gnats and mosquitoes for summers now, and there was nothing we could do when bitted but scratch and be miserable.</li>
            <li> I applied the stick to one nasty gnat bite on my arm yesterday</li>
            <li> Bugs make a buffet out of us which can be miserable!</li>

            <li> Outstanding natural way of getting rid of the insect bite itch!  It&#x27;s perfect for my children and myself.  Works very well.  Must apply liberally and more than once a day, but oftentimes find immediate relief and it keeps me from scratching.  If the need to scratch a mosquito bite comes back, just reapply.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is what I expected considering the ingredients.  It is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Bugs seem to gravitate to me and I reach for Burt&#x27;s Bees tube which I have in my purse. I immediately apply to bites and within less than a minute, relief.  I am a happy camper ( not that I camp, but you know what I mean).&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome. I do not think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This thing is nothing short of miraculous. We&#x27;ve been tortured by gnats and mosquitoes for summers now, and there was nothing we could do when bitted but scratch and be miserable. I applied the stick to one nasty gnat bite on my arm yesterday (it was a fresh one) and within the hour the very spot had disappeared. No itching, no welt, no spot. I&#x27;ve never seen anything quite like this. I am using it now on our son who, in past summers, would scratch himself bloody because of the bugs. Hopefully it&#x27;s going to help him too.   Other than its price, there is nothing to complain about. The stick smells wonderful and works great. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I love all of Burt&#x27;s Bees products you just can&#x27;t go wrong with natural ingredients. This tube is perfect to keep in your purse you never know when you will need it. Easy to apply and has a pleasant smell i have given several away. It stops the itch and is not greasy or messy. I recommend to all especially children in the summer time.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this product when I was getting mosquito bites everywhere and couldn&#x27;t stop scratching them.  After I put this on, it does not make me want to scratch.  I highly recommended, at least no more scratching for sure!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I carry one in my purse as I live in Florida where mosquitoes are year round.  It takes the itch and swelling down in minutes!</li>
            <li> Product is truly magical...  Works almost immediately!  However, it&#x27;s a little pricy; that&#x27;s the only reason for the 4 stars and not 5...</li>
            <li> THis product works miracles.  It relieves itching and swelling associated with mosquito bites.  My daughter gets bit up and has a scar from scratching.  This has been a blessing.  It may take a minute for the relief to start, but it does come.  The stick itself is hard, but don&#x27;t let that fool you, it works.  The smell is strong, but I like it.  Slightly medicinal, but in a natural way if that makes sense.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.</li>
            <li> The exp day is oct 2012,so angry about itÔºÅonly 3 month left!so so so so so so so angry!I can&#x27;t use it out in the 3 month .</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well. Bugs love me and this stuff relieves the itch sometimes right away. If I waited to put it on it took a little bit longer to work. I just carry a tube with me</li>
            <li> This really seems to work.  We have two little kids and they are always getting mosquito bites.  This seems to stop the itching so things don&#x27;t get worse.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference when using this product. It is quite difficult to apply and doesn&#x27;t really work as intended.</li>

            <li> A great product to relieve those itchy bites!</li>
            <li> I had been looking in the stores in this area for some time for these and was extremely happy to find a pack of them on here.  They are an all natural alternative for bug bite relief and when I need more I will most likely order another pack.  The smell is not badly displeasing and it is not greasy after application. Almost instantly takes away the itch after getting bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going camping or hiking I highly suggest getting one for every person in your group to have on them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a LifeSaver!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both myself and my two daughters have extremely sensitive light olive skin. Bugs make a buffet out of us which can be miserable! I stumbled onto this at a natural foods store years ago and literally used the first tube until I couldn&#x27;t scrape anymore out of the plastic with a toothpick! This time, I gladly paid about $5 each to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the first sign of itching, rub this over the area, and within...realistically 2-3 minutes, life is tolerable again. The menthol creates a slight warming effect similar to a muscle rub, then soaks into the skin. Itching goes away within a couple minutes, and we usually only need to treat a bite once or twice over the next few days. We&#x27;ve also noticed that bug bites treated with this tend to heal faster and not scab or leave scars. Pleasant smell, not greasy or slimy, and soaks in fast. I will not go outside without one of these handy, and never buy anything else for bug bites!</li>
            <li> Bug Bite Relief - 0.25 oz - Balm and still feel the same way and people around jotdamyeo I&#x27;m also want to write one</li>
            <li> This is the best anti itch medicine on the market. Wish it was easier to find. It works for my entire family and it is easy to use with no mess!!!</li>
