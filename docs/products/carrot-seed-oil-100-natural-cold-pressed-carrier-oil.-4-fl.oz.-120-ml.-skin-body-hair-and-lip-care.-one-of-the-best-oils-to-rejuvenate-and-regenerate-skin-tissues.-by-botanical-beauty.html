            <li>So good for your natural skin care.</li>

            <li>I found a more reputable carrot seed oil from another company brand and vendor, who will be getting ALL of my carrier oil business when I am needing pure undiluted carrot seed oil, red raspberry seed oil, argan oil etc etc.</li>
            <li>, I mixed with my own skin care recipe.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Best skin care secret out there.  </li>

            <li>It would be cheaper to have gotten pure carrot seed oil somewhere else,</li>
            <li>I was ordering 100% pure carrot seed oil, written on webpage.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You feel you are really nourishing your skin in an organic way, and you are.</li>
            <li>gee wonder how much carrot seed oil it really has, 2&amp; 10% who knows?</li>
            <li>This may not matter to most as far as a general recipe for personal use</li>
            <li>I was excited to see this 100% pure carrot seed oil - cold pressed for the price advertised, compared to that of other suppliers, I thought it was a great deal and bought two 4 oz containers.  </li>
            <li>I was looking forward to giving this company and vendor my business, but with it too confusing to order which oils I need and want, I would be better off setting my money on fire.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must have item, it is essential to the mixtures.</li>
            <li>It is not watered down and you can feel it really working deep into your skin, but not unnecessarily oily.</li>
            <li>also like to mix this with pure emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the vitamin C in this oil, the dark spots from old acne scars have diminished by 75 percent.</li>
            <li>Buyer beware - this is not pure carrot seed oil, although the front of the label states that is it is 100% pure, ingredients also show canola and vitamin e as ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old now and tired of paying high prices for fabricated lubricants that make fantastic claims.  </li>
            <li>but I have my ingredients measured down to an exact measure by ml and my recipe that I have registered with government</li>
            <li>If we want 100% pure carrot  seed oil, I would suggest to look for some other brands.</li>

            <li> Stick to reputable suppliers ...more expensive, but at least you know what you are getting - if it matters.</li>
            <li> Not much to it</li>
            <li> This is an overall waste of money.</li>

            <li> Now that I am in my mid thirties, the acne flare ups have slowed down tremendously  (due to using black soap, coastal scents cosmetic grade coconut oil in the day and their shea butter at night.)</li>
            <li> So I thought small bottle not enough</li>
            <li> using in shampoo and liquid soaps with other oils for acne</li>

            <li> But it might have about 3-4% of carrot seed oil  (or even less) and rest is some other carrier oil.</li>
            <li> That means it  has few drops of carrot seed oil added to some other carrier oil.</li>
            <li> It is a BLEND of carrier oils, where I had been led to believe this was 100% pure cold pressed carrot seed oil.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to order this brand, and when I got it, I was hugely disappointed that carrot seed oil was just one of the ingredients, and very far down the list.</li>

            <li> if not better results</li>
            <li> essential carrot seed oils are sort of expensive oil, I usually pay about 15$ for small bottle of 10 ml oil.</li>
            <li> So excited to have something to use for my daughter that doesn&#x27;t contain all those nasty chemicals!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>

            <li> Very fast delivery. So I thought small bottle not enough, here it is bigger one  , my hair love it so do my face .Will buy again definitely.  Take advantage of that stuff  .</li>
            <li> works good as a natural sunscreen! Try it for yourself...</li>
            <li> I read over and over again all the different brands and vendors of carrot seed oil. I would put them on my wish list to research them more thoroughly. I finally decided to order this brand, and when I got it, I was hugely disappointed that carrot seed oil was just one of the ingredients, and very far down the list. It is a BLEND of carrier oils, where I had been led to believe this was 100% pure cold pressed carrot seed oil. Never going to order from this brand again. If I had wanted jojoba oil, I would have ordered that,I wanted carrot seed oil,and even though I used it, and it was nice oil in general, it was not what I had been wanting and looking for. I found a more reputable carrot seed oil from another company brand and vendor, who will be getting ALL of my carrier oil business when I am needing pure undiluted carrot seed oil, red raspberry seed oil, argan oil etc etc. I was looking forward to giving this company and vendor my business, but with it too confusing to order which oils I need and want, I would be better off setting my money on fire.</li>
            <li> using in shampoo and liquid soaps with other oils for acne</li>
            <li> I love this carrot seed oil. I mix essential oils for my face and body. This is an absolute must have item, it is essential to the mixtures. So good for your natural skin care. I would recommend this product. I liked it so much originally I purchase a 2 oz. bottle  but use it regularly so super sized to the 4 oz. size.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.Thank you</li>
            <li> I like this oil. You can you it for face or body skin, as well as for hair as a mask. I even use it when I go sun tanning because it helps to get a nicer tan. Great natural product!</li>
            <li> This is not pure carrot seed oil.  it is mixed in jojoba oil.  This information is no where listed in the description.  Although i&#x27;m quite fond of jojoba oil I have no clue what percentage of this product is actually carrot seed oil.</li>
            <li> Not 100% as advertised, purchase somewhere else</li>
            <li> This produt is not a pure carrot seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;But I m happy with the result, I mixed with my own skin care recipe.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B009I3C8P0 CARROT SEED OIL 100 % Natural Cold Pressed Carrier Oil. 2 Fl.oz.- 60 ml.

            <li> This works wonderfully in soap for psoriasis. I like the product and will continue to order. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely, authentic oil. It doesn&#x27;t smell like carrots.  It is not watered down and you can feel it really working deep into your skin, but not unnecessarily oily. There is something authentic about it beyond a greasy oil. I highly recommend! You feel you are really nourishing your skin in an organic way, and you are.</li>

I&#x27;m 50 years old now and tired of paying high prices for fabricated lubricants that make fantastic claims.  I get the very same results with Carrot Seed Oil...if not better results and I feel like I&#x27;m truly  nourishing my skin.  Best skin care secret out there.  Try it!  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Nice line of oils! Fast shipping and great customer service! Also they threw in a free serum sample which I love, I just need to figure out what it was!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this 100% pure carrot seed oil - cold pressed for the price advertised, compared to that of other suppliers, I thought it was a great deal and bought two 4 oz containers.  Buyer beware - this is not pure carrot seed oil, although the front of the label states that is it is 100% pure, ingredients also show canola and vitamin e as ingredients.  This may not matter to most as far as a general recipe for personal use but I have my ingredients measured down to an exact measure by ml and my recipe that I have registered with government does not list canola as an ingredient - therefore, as this oil is not what is claimed to be and is impure, I cannot use it in the creams that I sell.  Very disappointed.  I will use this for myself as I am sure it is probably fine...gee wonder how much carrot seed oil it really has, 2&amp; 10% who knows?....I thought I was buying 100% Carrot seed oil as shown on label and as advertised. Stick to reputable suppliers ...more expensive, but at least you know what you are getting - if it matters.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and will buy it again.  I love the mild scent and the fact that I can use it on my skin or hair.  I use full strength on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not much to it but you get what you pay for. No surprises or disappointments.  A good value for your money.</li>
            <li> This is not an essential  carrot seed oil  but is Carrot Seed Carrier Oil. That means it  has few drops of carrot seed oil added to some other carrier oil. essential carrot seed oils are sort of expensive oil, I usually pay about 15$ for small bottle of 10 ml oil. When I saw this oil I though I found a great deal on essential carrot seed oil and ordered it immediately. But it might have about 3-4% of carrot seed oil  (or even less) and rest is some other carrier oil. Their description and label in the bottle is totally misleading. Quality always costs and this is a total waste of money for those looking for 100% essential carrot seed oil.  However the oil is good in itself and I liked how my skin and hair felt using it. I am giving 3 stars as I liked how nice my skin and hair felt. If we want 100% pure carrot  seed oil, I would suggest to look for some other brands.</li>
            <li> 100% carrot seed oil. shipped in mail quickly. Product is great I use it with&lt;br /&gt;sunflowers seed oil and just a couple drops of each in my hand and then put&lt;br /&gt;on my face..carrott seed oil is so good for your skin. I mix it with sunflower seed&lt;br /&gt;oil as recommended by my facial skin specialist</li>
            <li> Perfect for homemade sunscreen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with the consistency of the product. Went to see why it was so different from my previous carrot oils and now I see that it&#x27;s NOT pure carrot seed oil. The bottle is plastic as well. This is an overall waste of money. It would be cheaper to have gotten pure carrot seed oil somewhere else, which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to return mine.</li>
            <li> I am an African American and had been battling acne for years.  Now that I am in my mid thirties, the acne flare ups have slowed down tremendously  (due to using black soap, coastal scents cosmetic grade coconut oil in the day and their shea butter at night.) I started incorporating this carrot seed oil for the skin cell turnover and my skin appears brighter and more even toned. If I do get an acne spot, I just add this oil to the infected area and it is gone within 48 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;I also like to mix this with pure emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the vitamin C in this oil, the dark spots from old acne scars have diminished by 75 percent. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell. I don&#x27;t use it as a sunblock as I had intended because it&#x27;s a blend (I didn&#x27;t realize this or even think to check when I purchased because the title of the product is a bit miss-leading). This is also why I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. My intent was to use it as a sunblock - instead I have to used it as a moisturizer, which I didn&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase, not 100%carrot seed oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about week and my skin is softer, smoother, and has a healthy glow even without makeup. I&#x27;ve used it a couple times on my hands/cuticles and this stuff just seems to soften everything it touches!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B009I3ORBS CARROT SEED OIL 100% Pure / Natural Cold Pressed Carrier Oil.

            <li> Using this as a natural sunscreen and it works great! So excited to have something to use for my daughter that doesn&#x27;t contain all those nasty chemicals!</li>
            <li> I was deceived!  Beleived I was ordering 100% pure carrot seed oil, written on webpage.  Instead I received a product containing carrot seed oil, jojoba and vitamin E.  Thie oil I received is not 100% carrot seed, not what I wanted.  Will not be ordering any other products due to co. marketing deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gini</li>
