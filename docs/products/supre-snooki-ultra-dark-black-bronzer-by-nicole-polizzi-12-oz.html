            <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for making my snooki obsession affordable :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 5 times and I love the smell</li>
            <li>And it smells PHENOMENAL after tanning.</li>
            <li>no funky smell like most tan lotions.</li>
            <li>Buy it! :)</li>
            <li>she said it had a great scent and kept skin soft and gave her a great and even tan very girly smell</li>
            <li>Cheap price for a cheap product!</li>
            <li>This bronzer really works good.</li>
            <li>I not stop touching my unbelievably soft skin, but the color I got from my 12 minute tanning session today is amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>, I won&#x27;t ever use another tanning lition( other than the snooki one I bought for legs, aLso incredible)</li>
            <li>Snooki&#x27;s tanning products live up to all the promises and more!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re pale and want to get super tan using a tanning bed, this is the best lotion.</li>
            <li>i was really happy that i didnt stink after tanning like other lotions</li>
            <li>No bad after scent, actually still smells nice after tanning..</li>
            <li>I liked that the package showed up quick, but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like it about it</li>
            <li>It was worth $27.00</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>but, the first bottle (black and gold) I loved and had no problems with.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing as well(: will be using for a long time!!</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>Lotion is not fake contrary to what some believe.</li>
            <li>Made me TAN not BURN my first time tanning in months.</li>
            <li>I would typically tan 3-4 days a week before, and this lotion is so awesome, I am now down to 3 days because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Has a pretty decent bronzer that doesn&#x27;t make your skin orangey.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan fast</li>
            <li>It has a bronzer in it, and I could tell immediately after tanning how much darker I was.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>She was very concerned about how a lotion would smell.</li>
            <li>This really progressed her tan and didn&#x27;t make her orange.</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time and for some reason the one I received is really drying out my skin</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I even compared it using a sample of the real stuff that I bought at the salon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll get dark quickly, but you&#x27;ll also lose your tan quickly if you do not tan frequently.</li>
            <li>It also made my skin feel soft and it drives fast also.  </li>
            <li>everyone would tell me i smelled like snookis new perfume and where did i buy it.</li>
            <li>Gets you dark quickly!</li>
            <li>I could tell a big difference after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It eventually exploded in my car and made a huge mess, which was my fault for leaving it in there</li>
            <li>i was a little apprehensive about buying an entire bottle of the lotion, but I had tried a sample at the tanning salon, and LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>Gives you a natural looking tan and no orange color.</li>
            <li>and I mean at all and my skin is pretty pale, but it took 3, 4 tans to get nice bronze going on which was a record for me.</li>
            <li>When I received this lotion I noticed that it&#x27;s actually not dark</li>
            <li>I can see a major difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel I get as much color as I have with other Bronzers I have purchased.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t feel I get as much color as I have with other Bronzers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I WAS MUCH DARKER THAN USUAL</li>
            <li> I walked out with one leg black and the other absolutely unchanged.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if its something in this particular bottle</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If i paid the full $62.00 original price I would have hated it.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this and any other Snooki products.</li>
            <li> I tan year round in tanning beds and try several different lotions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably try the gold bottle or the pink bottle with the tingler in it.</li>
            <li> either thats what i had thought when i read other reviews.</li>
            <li> no dying the hands like the other bronzers.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Not like all the other bronzing lotions.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s half empty.</li>
            <li> it also made me dark within 3 tanning sessions and i started off tanning at 6 mins.</li>
            <li> One leg had the fake product and one leg had the real stuff.</li>
            <li> The product I got was NOT the Snooki Ultra Black Bronzer.</li>
            <li> I think it helped me get a little darker, but I do not like lotions with bronzer</li>
            <li> Wish I could get my money back, but it&#x27;s my fault for being so dumb.</li>
            <li> It was watered down and smelled like sunscreen rather than her usual scent.</li>
            <li> but it stained pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure if i would try this one again.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way to NEVER buy tanning lotion from amazon.</li>
            <li> an had a hard time finding this an</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, not the actual snooki lotion!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> BAD BAD BAD :(  </li>
            <li> I hate how tanning lotions always smell like tanning lotion.</li>

            <li> This a good buy for the price, I&#x27;ve been tanning forever and this one is one of the best bronzers so far, with one visit I can see a major difference. Forget the name buy this for the good product that it is.</li>
            <li> Lotion is not fake contrary to what some believe. Was the same identical package and product sold In salons...love it</li>
            <li> Love t g e smell. Works great and leaves no steaks!</li>
            <li> i loooooooved this lotion. it smells great before you tan and after. i was really happy that i didnt stink after tanning like other lotions make you smell. everyone would tell me i smelled like snookis new perfume and where did i buy it. i havent smelled her perfume but you will love this lotion. it smells like a candy but a perfume. it doesnt smell like a cheat candy spray either thats what i had thought when i read other reviews. it also made me dark within 3 tanning sessions and i started off tanning at 6 mins. i will be buying more of this product!</li>
            <li> HELPS DEEPEN AN INDOOR TAN!  GREAT STUFF!! AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT, I NOTICED I WAS MUCH DARKER THAN USUAL WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE TANNING BED.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of all snooki products. Everything she makes is wonderful. It smells great! Has an amazing bronzer. I recommend this lotion to anyone! Also at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I tan year round in tanning beds and try several different lotions this one smells good and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I don&#x27;t feel I get as much color as I have with other Bronzers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This bronzer really works good. I only tanned for a week and my skin was way darker then what it was before I used this product. I get a lot of compliments and I tell them its the Snooki Bronzer that I bought at Amazon. Love it and oh the best part it smells amazing and no dying the hands like the other bronzers. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best tanning lotion I have ever used. I laid out for one hour and already was bronzing. You also don&#x27;t have to use very much. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Gets you dark quickly! Has a lot of DHA (self tanner) so you&#x27;ll get dark quickly, but you&#x27;ll also lose your tan quickly if you do not tan frequently.</li>
            <li> OMG! This is by far one of the BEST smelling tanning lotions I have ever used! I hate how tanning lotions always smell like tanning lotion. This stuff has a nice fruity smell and goes on wonderful. It&#x27;s  not too greasy feeling. I really love it. I use it along with snooki shimmering body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It smells FANTASTIC!!! And the color i get from it is great!! I will definitley be ordering this again!!!</li>
            <li> Product was on time, brand new, and it smells great! Can&#x27;t wait to see results!</li>
            <li> When I received this lotion I noticed that it&#x27;s actually not dark what so ever. It&#x27;s more creamy &amp; has no bronzes in it what so ever. I&#x27;m pissed.</li>
            <li> smells great leaves skin feeling good and tans great</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for almost two weeks now, it SMELLS GREAT. and ive noticed somewhat of a difference in darkness.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I don&#x27;t tan fast AT ALL...and I mean at all and my skin is pretty pale, but it took 3, 4 tans to get nice bronze going on which was a record for me. It smells good, you get a lot of it and it works like magic. I even applied it to my face and did NOT break out from it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it isn&#x27;t too oily on skin.  Has a pretty decent bronzer that doesn&#x27;t make your skin orangey. I will definitely get again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, saw immediate results when tanning!</li>
            <li> i was a little apprehensive about buying an entire bottle of the lotion, but I had tried a sample at the tanning salon, and LOVE IT.  It has a bronzer in it, and I could tell immediately after tanning how much darker I was.  I would typically tan 3-4 days a week before, and this lotion is so awesome, I am now down to 3 days because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;Love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you want to look darker faster then this is the lotion.  I could tell a big difference after the first time I used it.  It smells good to.  Not like all the other bronzing lotions.  It also made my skin feel soft and it drives fast also.  It did not stain my hands either which is a huge plus!!! I will definitely be buying it again!  Definitely worth the price!!!!</li>
            <li> I liked that the package showed up quick, but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like it about it the bottle popped in the bag they sent it in. Now it&#x27;s half empty. Not to thrilled about it.</li>
            <li> smells great and love the tan I get!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works just as it says it will! Snooki&#x27;s tanning products live up to all the promises and more! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I think it helped me get a little darker, but I do not like lotions with bronzer and it did leave that film on my palms.  The scent was alright but nothing to write home about.  It eventually exploded in my car and made a huge mess, which was my fault for leaving it in there but it stained pretty bad.  I still love my Snooks, though!</li>
            <li> OUCH.....I work at a tanning salon and this is my second bottle of Snooki...this one has made me ITCH BAD BAD BAD :(  Im not sure if its something in this particular bottle but, the first bottle (black and gold) I loved and had no problems with. All Snooki smells awesome though...like a piece of candy when your done tanning!</li>
            <li> GREAT SHIPPEMENT TIME</li>
            <li> she said it had a great scent and kept skin soft and gave her a great and even tan very girly smell</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, but the bronzer in it is almost like a self tanner. It stained my finger under my rings, but it still gives you a very nice brown</li>
            <li> Liked how cheap it was. If i paid the full $62.00 original price I would have hated it. It was worth $27.00 It worked well if I upgraded to stronger tanning booth everytime and that was at Hollywood Tans</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion as a gift for my boyfriends daughter. She LOVES it. She was very concerned about how a lotion would smell. I read a lot of reviews before ordering this. This really progressed her tan and didn&#x27;t make her orange.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, not the actual snooki lotion! Cheap price for a cheap product! I would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Made me TAN not BURN my first time tanning in months. Will buy again. Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;-Crystal!</li>
            <li> Nice bronzer, does what it suppose to do. No bad after scent, actually still smells nice after tanning.. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and for some reason the one I received is really drying out my skin and I never had that problem before.</li>
            <li> I have bought snooki before from a tanning salon and loved it but it is just too pricey in salons. Ordered it from this amazon dealer and it was legit, same as the salon bought snooki and way cheaper! Never buying in the salon again. Thank you for making my snooki obsession affordable :)</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It is the best tanning bed lotion, I have EVER used!!! :-)&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to a lot of fragrances, but this one smells great and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon, for making this product available!!!</li>
            <li> i love this lotion not realy for the bronzing but for the great smell and one of the best moisturizing lotions on the market.well worth the price!ive bought 2 bottles and will go on to try the maximizer.thank you the tannman y0u rock!</li>
            <li> I had ordered the Snooki after using a sample pack at the tanning salon. This lotion is great. Gives you a natural looking tan and no orange color. The smell isn&#x27;t bad either. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Authentic, great seller!!</li>
            <li> I will never buy another lotion ever again. This lotion smells so good that I don&#x27;t stink after I tan and I do get color, another plus this tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t have tingle in it so you can put it on your face .</li>
            <li> Used it one time and got awesome results! Smells amazing as well(: will be using for a long time!! Yay!</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way to NEVER buy tanning lotion from amazon. It&#x27;s cheap for a reason. The product I got was NOT the Snooki Ultra Black Bronzer. It was watered down and smelled like sunscreen rather than her usual scent. It did absolutely nothing. I even compared it using a sample of the real stuff that I bought at the salon. One leg had the fake product and one leg had the real stuff. I walked out with one leg black and the other absolutely unchanged. Wish I could get my money back, but it&#x27;s my fault for being so dumb. DON&#x27;T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels and smells as good as it bronzes. I used it once 6 hours ago and not only caN I not stop touching my unbelievably soft skin, but the color I got from my 12 minute tanning session today is amazing, I won&#x27;t ever use another tanning lition( other than the snooki one I bought for legs, aLso incredible)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 5 times and I love the smell but i&#x27;m not sure if i would try this one again. I&#x27;d probably try the gold bottle or the pink bottle with the tingler in it.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff I have try this in the pass an had a hard time finding this an now I know were to go when I want it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pale and want to get super tan using a tanning bed, this is the best lotion. The bottle lasts a long time. And it smells PHENOMENAL after tanning. I tan in the morning and leave it on all day and people ask what perfume I have on. That&#x27;s how good it smells. I definitely recommend this and any other Snooki products.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...no funky smell like most tan lotions. I highly recommend this. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and you get a generous sized bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells &amp;&amp; works amazing :)</li>
            <li> Awesome tanning lotion!!! Gives great bronze results :) And on top of that it smells sooo good! Would for sure recommend this to people! Buy it! :)</li>
