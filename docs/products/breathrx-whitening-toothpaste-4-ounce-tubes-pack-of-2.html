            <li>I love the toothpaste and the mouth wash is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>BreathRx is the best stuff I have ever used to neutralize breath odors, not cover them up with strong minty smells.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a pleasant way to insure your breath is good and avoid strong alcohol based rinses, this is the best way to go.</li>
            <li>very good ok</li>
            <li>this toothpaste is so good I use in my life and my kids too</li>
            <li>I have a tendency toward that anyway, but I thought having a whitening toothpaste was still a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I find this to be one of the best toothpastes for that completely clean feeling after brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>It is the best for every day whitening and fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>I try the results nice</li>

            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love it and will always use it.</li>
            <li>Love these products and have used them for years.  </li>
            <li>the toothpaste was a lot better</li>
            <li>The peroxide-minty burn can be overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Been using this since I was 17, I&#x27;m currently 20.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly the best tooth paste there is.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a good flavor and seems to keep my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>we lovely</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So refreshing but too pricey.</li>
            <li>Love this took paste.</li>
            <li>If you want to save 50%, try the generics ... be sure you reach the ingredients&#x27; label to be sure, as there are a multitude of products crowing the space.</li>
            <li>It whitens and has a great fresh taste that leaves your breath feeling very fresh.  </li>
            <li>Love this tooth paste, really good and pretty strong.</li>
            <li>This is perfect  - whitens fast and really shines your teeth</li>
            <li>This stuff works, bacteria control, fresh taste, clean teeth, good price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended anything from the BreathRx line, it&#x27;s all amazing!  </li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this to try and it has so far been great.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product but it doesn&#x27;t really whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>The other BreathRx products are wonderful as well.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this and really love how clean it makes my mouth feel</li>
            <li>Works even on strong garlic breath.  </li>
            <li>the mouth wash is too strong.</li>
            <li>Great price on double pack.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an credible toothpaste</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth cleaner and my breath more fresh.</li>
            <li>got two bottles of this and both were not even filled up all the way.  </li>
            <li>I wish target carried it as they have in the past, but happy with amazon!</li>
            <li>You can notice a significant difference just from using it once.  </li>
            <li>Amazing toothpaste, I have been using the last 10 yrs or more.</li>
            <li>It does feel fresh and clean after you use it, in my opinion it&#x27;s worthy!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes great and keeps your breath fresh all day long.  </li>
            <li>I buy several of the BreathRx products as they are all good for your mouth/teeth.</li>
            <li>but over all the product is not bad.</li>
            <li>Makes mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best toothpaste I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I mainly bought it for the whitening and love the fact it helps out with freshening breath.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it also lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li>I am using it for several years now and love it!</li>
            <li>but worth it ...</li>
            <li>but well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>As a teacher who leans into talk with student a fresh breath is a necessity.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and look so white, what is not to love with a product that is a miracle in a tube.</li>
            <li>and it not only tastes good, but it does do a decent job whitening.  </li>
            <li>Even after brushing my teeth at times I could still smell an odor as if I had never brushed at all, which Ive never really understood because I am good with my dental hygiene!  </li>
            <li>Then I later found the gum and mints and absolutely love them all.  </li>
            <li>:&amp;#62;)) .</li>
            <li>After the first time using the toothpaste and rinse, the smell was gone.  </li>
            <li>My dentist gave me my first tube 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands and NOTHING compares.</li>
            <li>Taste great last a very long time.</li>
            <li>The main problem is that she has a hard time finding this brand in our local; markets and was very happy that I could order thru Amazon prime and get in two days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The formula is whitening and gentle.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s too much plastic on this.</li>
            <li>This product is for my wife and she really likes to use it, because she gets the results that she wants.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>......works particularly well with electric toothbrushes....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all of the BreathRx stuff.</li>
            <li>It is insanely high prices compared to the normal over the counter stuff</li>
            <li>As far as whitening haven&#x27;t notice much difference yet.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the extra dollars.  </li>
            <li>but I can honestly say their teeth are far whiter than any of the other kids, in fact we often get compliments on how white their teeth are.  </li>
            <li>I learned about Rx with my Dentist and I like the product even though it&#x27;s not as natural as I normally go for.</li>
            <li>I really like the product, but it clearly states it is a pack of 2, and I only received one.  </li>
            <li>It is not making my teeth feel sensitive though,</li>
            <li>you can really feel the difference and at the same time whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li>After using Colgate Total for many years, I recently developed an allergy or some other sort of reaction whenever using Total.  </li>
            <li>Teeth look a little whiter and feel clean.  </li>
            <li>My wife would always complain about my bad breath all the time until I found this amazing toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>Used it for a little over 6 weeks religiously, don&#x27;t see any real improvement (not a smoker</li>
            <li>These products are more expensive than other brands, but with less unhealthful ingredients and well worth the price.</li>

            <li> Helps dry mouth from a long work day of conversating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone, but I would also say that it is a little more expensive that what people are used to paying at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I will use this for as long as I can!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a very long time and my husband</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned this toothpaste gave her dry mouth.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I always have dry mouth</li>
            <li> I always used to get annoyed of having a toothpaste that tasted the same minty flavor but this flavor I could never get bored of, its not too potent and still cleans your mouth the way it should!</li>
            <li> I was surprised because I&#x27;ve tried other brands (Crest whitening, etc etc) with little results.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money for only one tube.</li>
            <li> I went to my dentist and they ruled out any other sort of possible issue other than it being the tooth paste I was using.  </li>
            <li> I also feel like it makes my lips very dry after brushing.</li>
            <li> Its not foamy enough, minty enough, and just downright not good enough!</li>
            <li> and I certainly do not want to ingest it into my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would use it every other brushing.  </li>
            <li> (extreme gum swelling and redness).  </li>
            <li> ordered this to compare to other toothpaste like Crest or Colgate.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO OTHER PEOPLE</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other toothpaste!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste and entire product line has really helped with the bad breath.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this tooth paste for a few years now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely wasteful and I&#x27;ve complained to the company, but they don&#x27;t seem to care.</li>
            <li> Use it every day for the past few years.</li>
            <li> my dentist recommended this brand to me when I had a small case of gum disease.</li>
            <li> I removed one star for the excessive packaging.</li>
            <li> Not sure i see the difference but works well.</li>
            <li> My 8yo son has horrible breath as most kids do.  </li>
            <li> BreathRx has become a staple product in my life for the past year or so.</li>
            <li> But OMG...I was shocked when I actually read the ingredients.</li>
            <li> can be difficult to get......</li>
            <li> very disappointed in this due to spending what i did on the price.</li>
            <li> The tongue brush was a plastic disappointing seesaw.</li>
            <li> I bought it specifically for bad breath.  </li>
            <li> They both had the worst breath even after brushing their teeth and rinse.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> A friend who is a dentist recommended this. It&#x27;s quite minty and refreshing. Has all the whiting etc. very happy w it</li>
            <li> Good product makes me happy and also makes happy my family. I always is using  this product. very good ok</li>
            <li> I have used Breathr-X toothpaste for several years.  It is the best for every day whitening and fresh breath.  Hope it is around forever.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Ever since my dentist recommended BreathRx mouth rinse, I have used it all the time. Then I later found the gum and mints and absolutely love them all.  Now I found this toothpaste and discovered it works as well as the rest of their products. BreathRx is the best stuff I have ever used to neutralize breath odors, not cover them up with strong minty smells. Works even on strong garlic breath.  If you are looking for a pleasant way to insure your breath is good and avoid strong alcohol based rinses, this is the best way to go. I highly recommend all of the BreathRx stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it and will always use it.</li>
            <li> Great price on double pack.  Love these products and have used them for years.  Makes mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in most stores. Has worked wonders on my teeth. Use it every day for the past few years.</li>
            <li> Excellent !......works particularly well with electric toothbrushes....can be difficult to get......but worth it ... the &amp;#34;two-pack&amp;#34; is.a great value !</li>
            <li> I ordered this before from breathrx the toothpaste was a lot better they must have changed the formula</li>
            <li> The mouthwash and toothbrush are great.  The tongue brush was a plastic disappointing seesaw. The formula is whitening and gentle. I would use it every other brushing.  The peroxide-minty burn can be overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Title says it all. IT is a great product and recommended by the place that did my XOOM whitening! You can notice a significant difference just from using it once.  This product is a must have.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and really love how clean it makes my mouth feel</li>
            <li> Used it for a little over 6 weeks religiously, don&#x27;t see any real improvement (not a smoker and I don&#x27;t drink coffee).</li>
            <li> After using Colgate Total for many years, I recently developed an allergy or some other sort of reaction whenever using Total.  (extreme gum swelling and redness).  I went to my dentist and they ruled out any other sort of possible issue other than it being the tooth paste I was using.  I was given a sample of this to try and it has so far been great.  I have had no reaction issues with this and it not only tastes good, but it does do a decent job whitening.  I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone, but I would also say that it is a little more expensive that what people are used to paying at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I find this to be one of the best toothpastes for that completely clean feeling after brushing your teeth. [[ASIN:B001ET7KMC BreathRx Whitening Toothpaste, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> Been using this since I was 17, I&#x27;m currently 20.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly the best tooth paste there is.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It whitens and has a great fresh taste that leaves your breath feeling very fresh.  The other BreathRx products are wonderful as well.  I just wish they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s too much plastic on this. If you have arthritis you might as well get out a chainsaw to try to get the thing open. It&#x27;s extremely wasteful and I&#x27;ve complained to the company, but they don&#x27;t seem to care. The toothpaste is something that my husband insists on, so I&#x27;m paying for it ... for now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an credible toothpaste I try the results nice all my family use it item we like it I will call all my friends</li>
            <li> Been using for over a year and my dental check-ups have improved.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste. It&#x27;s got a good flavor and seems to keep my mouth feeling fresh. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, so not long enough to judge its whitening power. It is not making my teeth feel sensitive though, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with some whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging, however was overkill. It is in a plastic clamshell, inside a box. All that plastic doesn&#x27;t seem necessary for toothpaste. I removed one star for the excessive packaging.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and my dentist loves me for it. I buy several of the BreathRx products as they are all good for your mouth/teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste that my husband will use. You can no longer find it in the stores so buying it on line is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> This product is for my wife and she really likes to use it, because she gets the results that she wants. The main problem is that she has a hard time finding this brand in our local; markets and was very happy that I could order thru Amazon prime and get in two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you because if my wife is happy everyone is happy. :&amp;#62;)) .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for YEARS. I always used to get annoyed of having a toothpaste that tasted the same minty flavor but this flavor I could never get bored of, its not too potent and still cleans your mouth the way it should!</li>
            <li> Amazing toothpaste, I have been using the last 10 yrs or more.</li>
            <li> ordered this to compare to other toothpaste like Crest or Colgate. Not sure i see the difference but works well.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste is so good I use in my life and my kids too we lovely thank you bye dlb</li>
            <li> My dentist turned me on to the BreathRX family of products years ago and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since. I love the toothpaste and the mouth wash is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste, really good and pretty strong. I am using it for several years now and love it!</li>
            <li> Use this with the mouthwash to get rid of any offensive mouth odors.</li>
            <li> I like it, though after a year I will be switching to something else. We have not seen any noticeable whitening at all. I also feel like it makes my lips very dry after brushing.</li>
            <li> helps with gum disease plaque and tartar buildup. Taste great last a very long time. The best toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li> I was told about this by my dentist now that i have used it i cant go back to regular toothpaste. you can really feel the difference and at the same time whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li> My 8yo son has horrible breath as most kids do.  This toothpaste and entire product line has really helped with the bad breath.  Even after school his breath has improved.  I&#x27;m considering getting it for my husband and 5yo daughter to help.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but it doesn&#x27;t really whiten my teeth. I have been using it for over 2 months now and haven&#x27;t seen obvious result yet.</li>
            <li> Why would a toothpaste contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)? I quit using shampoos on my hair that contain SLS and I certainly do not want to ingest it into my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I think it whitened my teeth?  Yes. But OMG...I was shocked when I actually read the ingredients. No way I want to use anything (especially in my mouth) which contains SLS. Another reviewer mentioned this toothpaste gave her dry mouth. I have a tendency toward that anyway, but I thought having a whitening toothpaste was still a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of another toothpaste called &#x27;All White&#x27; with my purchase. While reading the reviews, I noticed one reviewer said it contain SLS. I thought &#x27;no way&#x27;. But that prompted me to read the label of this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an aversion to SLS like I do, then do not purchase this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended to me by a friend &amp; it is amazing! My teeth feel so clean and look so white, what is not to love with a product that is a miracle in a tube.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this tooth paste for a few years now. If you like to maintain your teeth white, you will like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over a year and will continue to do so. It really works. I use this toothpaste with the BreathRx mouthwash as well.</li>
            <li> BreathRx has become a staple product in my life for the past year or so. I love this stuff. It makes my teeth cleaner and my breath more fresh. I cant use Colgate or Crest anymore! Its not foamy enough, minty enough, and just downright not good enough! I will use this for as long as I can!</li>
            <li> My kids use the toothpaste, rinse and tongue scraper every day, twice a day.  They both had the worst breath even after brushing their teeth and rinse.  After the first time using the toothpaste and rinse, the smell was gone.  I highly recommended anything from the BreathRx line, it&#x27;s all amazing!  Even though the products are blue, I have not noticed any staining from the use of them.  We use a pre-rinse whitener (equate brand) so I couldn&#x27;t honestly state if these do infact help to whiten teeth but I can honestly say their teeth are far whiter than any of the other kids, in fact we often get compliments on how white their teeth are.  Awesome toothpaste!!!  Can&#x27;t speak highly enough about it!  It also tastes great too!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other toothpaste! I also use the BreathRX mouthwash.  These products are more expensive than other brands, but with less unhealthful ingredients and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> So refreshing but too pricey. Great if you can afford to keep buying it. Will go back to drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Only toothpaste we will use.</li>
            <li> My Teeth are whiter but I feel like I always have dry mouth, it could just be me but over all the product is not bad.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but it clearly states it is a pack of 2, and I only received one.  Not worth the money for only one tube.</li>
            <li> I learned about Rx with my Dentist and I like the product even though it&#x27;s not as natural as I normally go for. As far as whitening haven&#x27;t notice much difference yet. It does feel fresh and clean after you use it, in my opinion it&#x27;s worthy!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does the job.  It is well worth the extra dollars.  Surprisingly, it also lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste and mouthwash for several years - Despite the price I will continue to use because it works for me..</li>
            <li> Never suffer from &amp;#34;bad breath&amp;#34; again. This toothpaste tastes great and keeps your breath fresh all day long.  My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> got two bottles of this and both were not even filled up all the way.  very disappointed in this due to spending what i did on the price.</li>
            <li> Has definitely helped whiten my teeth. visible results within just weeks. I was surprised because I&#x27;ve tried other brands (Crest whitening, etc etc) with little results. I definitely recommend this to anyone trying to get whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> My wife would always complain about my bad breath all the time until I found this amazing toothpaste!  It is insanely high prices compared to the normal over the counter stuff but well worth the cost.  I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me my first tube 5 years ago. As a teacher who leans into talk with student a fresh breath is a necessity.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!  I intend to also buy mouthwash also.  I mainly bought it for the whitening and love the fact it helps out with freshening breath. I will always but this product!</li>
            <li> Love this took paste. We can&#x27;t find it anywhere else. Helps dry mouth from a long work day of conversating.</li>
            <li> Everyting´s great....</li>
            <li> A long-standing standard in our household.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO OTHER PEOPLE</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best toothpaste I have ever used.  I bought it specifically for bad breath.  Even after brushing my teeth at times I could still smell an odor as if I had never brushed at all, which Ive never really understood because I am good with my dental hygiene!  I have used many different brands and NOTHING compares. Try it and you will never go back . Promise ! I plan on ordering the mouthwash as well.</li>
            <li> This is perfect  - whitens fast and really shines your teeth</li>
            <li> the toothpaste with the strongest mint. A bit pricey but I don&#x27;t always use it. I switch it up. I like this a lot. This is the only product from breathrx i recommend. the mouth wash is too strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, bacteria control, fresh taste, clean teeth, good price. I use breathrx mouthwash as well and the price for the 32 oz bottle on Amazon is close to the price for the 16 oz at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> What can I say...it works!  Teeth look a little whiter and feel clean.  I bought the mouthwash, too. My husband tried it and says it is the best toothpaste he has ever used.  Wish they carried it in a local store.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a very long time and my husband and I really like it. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years based on dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  I like it a lot.  I use it 1 to 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> If you have to spend a lot, try Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health at 30% lower price.  If you want to save 50%, try the generics ... be sure you reach the ingredients&#x27; label to be sure, as there are a multitude of products crowing the space.</li>
