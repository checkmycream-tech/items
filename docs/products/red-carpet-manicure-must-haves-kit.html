            <li>I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li>Value was good for the price.</li>
            <li>seems to me that is not as good product</li>
            <li>I watched a couple of youtube tutorials before I started and it had some really good advice and tips.</li>
            <li>MIGHT AS WELL BUY YOUR OWN ACETONE.&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li>but I like my nails to look nice</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never done your own gel manicure/pedicure before, you might find it helpful to know that you should apply each coat sparingly.  </li>
            <li>Doing my own nails now.</li>
            <li>I did my first at home manicure and it looks gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The RCM system is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried so far in regards to gel polish.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the description and look at the amount of fl oz in each bottle before you buy.</li>
            <li>Love this, saving me tons of money on manicures</li>
            <li>I love being able to do gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>regret not spending more money and buy a better Gel Polish .</li>
            <li>I just saved myself $35 every two weeks :-)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like the at home gel manicures</li>
            <li>The top and bottom coats def work well with the lamps</li>
            <li>I ordered this after using a friend&#x27;s and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Has good colors and the right things to use.</li>
            <li>I am excited to be able to do my own gel manicures at home at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I have found some really pretty colors at a good price.</li>
            <li>Ladies this is the best gift I have received in a very long time.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic just make sure you use it with a UV lamp drier</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worked beautifully with the red carpet LED lamp I purchased.</li>
            <li>I already had a uv light &amp; wanted to try gel polish.</li>
            <li>Has everything but the uv light.</li>
            <li>The actual polish components are great though.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit along with a UV light for my sister as a gift for Christmas, the package arrived on time and packaged well, I gave it to my sister on Christmas day</li>
            <li>(I purchased it along with the led light.)  </li>
            <li>I bought five different nail colors and I am so happy with the colors.  </li>
            <li>but sure enough it still wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>I love that my natural nails continue to grow and be healthy with this polish on.  </li>
            <li>and all I really needed was the structure and brilliance top coat.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m right handed) but the set was extremely easy to use and the right hand looks as good as the left.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply it to my right hand very well</li>
            <li>The steps are easy to follow and the RC Professional light (not included) works like a charm.</li>
            <li>and so I got this because it was more economical than buying some other brands I am more familiar with.</li>
            <li>but WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li>This purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li>, I have decided to buy the same kit for myself, along with the light :)</li>
            <li>She loved the product so I guess really the only rating I could give was 5</li>
            <li>but I am thrilled that they finally did!</li>
            <li>Great for those of us who have a hard time growing out nails without them breaking off.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend got the entire kit for Xmas for me and I have to say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Be aware, this kit does not contain gel color polish, you will need to purchase it separately.  </li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about it chipping on the second day.  </li>
            <li>It seems to last 1 &amp; 1/2 to 2 weeks and looks great with a high shine the entire time.  </li>
            <li>I have found that getting too much polish on the nail causes it to seep over to the finger causing the need to clip the dried polish off when you&#x27;re done and not leaving a good seal around the edges.</li>
            <li>Granted, the bottles are small - but the price on Amazon is a good deal and you will need these items eventually.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more dollars for full size bottles.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than sallys and the whole set works</li>
            <li>was really dissapointed.</li>
            <li>This is a very convenient set, it has everything you need.</li>
            <li>but they really should be provided by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>If I want a different color, I can just put regular polish over the gel manicure and then remove it with regular nail polish and return to the gel color underneath which still looks great.  </li>
            <li>this application allows me to grow my nails out and they are strong as long as I have the nail products applied.</li>
            <li>Products are a little smaller than Gelish Mini but just as good.</li>
            <li>Everything done in less than 10 mins, I&#x27;m sure when I reapply it will take longer because it takes 20 minutes to remove the Gel</li>
            <li>I normally get my nals done every 2 weeks</li>
            <li>It has everything you could possibly need for the first timer</li>
            <li>The first time I did my nails, they were chipping and peeling 2 days later.</li>
            <li>AND THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>I had already purchased the manicure professional set and needed a refresh of the base products so this was perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>It is a little more pricey than the other kits</li>
            <li>BARELY STAYS ON FOR TWO DAYS.</li>
            <li>actually didn&#x27;t use the Red Carpet Gel polish but purchased Gelish since it was a few dollars cheaper or had free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m experimenting with different gels and so far Red Carpet passes</li>

            <li> actually didn&#x27;t use the Red Carpet Gel polish but purchased Gelish since it was a few dollars cheaper or had free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experimenting with different gels and so far Red Carpet passes</li>
            <li> I have used it about 6 times already and it looks like it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> My only complain is that there are very limited directions.  </li>
            <li> You can also get much bigger bottles of acetone, 90% alcohol, and cuticle oil at your local beauty supply for less.</li>
            <li> The acetone and alcohol can be bought at Sally&#x27;s for way cheaper than these tiny little bottles that don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Woulda waited 3 weeks if I knew it was going to go down a third in price...</li>
            <li> I applied this on a Monday, during that week, I did yard work, house work and built a corn hole bean bag game (including sewing the bags... straight pins and sandpaper can wreck a manicure).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to know if it works as well.</li>
            <li> Again, the set does not have the light or the actual nail color - these are only the base products you need.</li>
            <li> anyone tried using regular nail polish with this base &amp; top coat?</li>
            <li> I will probably only reorder the prep, base and top</li>
            <li> The bottles are small but there is still enough product to do a number of applications.</li>
            <li> every other one that I have tried peels off within a couple of days ...</li>
            <li> However, I find several steps unnecessary as you might have something already that works the same (ex: the replenish is just a nail oil, and the purify is practically rubbing alcohol).</li>
            <li> Not sure why it has taken the industry so long to develop a product like this</li>
            <li> keep in mind this KIT DOES NOT come with a Gel Polish just the base and top</li>
            <li> This kit comes with EVERYTHING you need and if you order additional polishes off Amazon they are slightly cheaper than going into the store.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN DOING NAILS FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS</li>
            <li> I have used it 7-8 times now and haven&#x27;t even begun to use a small portion of supplies.</li>
            <li> IF I COULD GIVE THIS PRODUCT NEGATIVE STARS...</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this kit except the small size.</li>
            <li> Since I have really thin nails</li>
            <li> Too expensive for testers</li>
            <li> but there is nothing wrong with the function of these products.</li>
            <li> I just think they smell really bad.</li>
            <li> THE WORST THING</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T STAY ON FOR TWO WEEKS. BARELY STAYS ON FOR TWO DAYS. I HAVE BEEN DOING NAILS FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS AND THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST THING I&#x27;VE EVER TRIED ON MY NAILS! IF I COULD GIVE THIS PRODUCT NEGATIVE STARS...I WOULD. DONT RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTLES ARE TINY.&lt;br /&gt;GEL DOESN&#x27;T LAST.&lt;br /&gt;THE REMOVER TAKES FOREVER, MIGHT AS WELL BUY YOUR OWN ACETONE.&lt;br /&gt;AND THE &amp;#34;PURIFIER&amp;#34; IS NOTHING BUT RUBBING ALCOHOL....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I already had a uv light &amp; wanted to try gel polish. I applied this on a Monday, during that week, I did yard work, house work and built a corn hole bean bag game (including sewing the bags... straight pins and sandpaper can wreck a manicure). Not even a chip!!! I&#x27;m on my 10th day and I&#x27;m starting to get some wear on the tips.&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone tried using regular nail polish with this base &amp; top coat? I&#x27;m curious to know if it works as well.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend got the entire kit for Xmas for me and I have to say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. I normally get my nals done every 2 weeks and they only last 3 maybe 4 days but I like my nails to look nice I continued wasting money. Ladies this is the best gift I have received in a very long time. My nails look prefessional for a fraction of the cost. My friend has a different kit but she admits that she should have gotten the Red Carpet brand. This kit comes with EVERYTHING you need and if you order additional polishes off Amazon they are slightly cheaper than going into the store. I try buy a polish every 2 weeks and I have found some really pretty colors at a good price. Again I can&#x27;t say enough about this kit. It is a little more pricey than the other kits but WELL worth the price. HAPPY NAILS...</li>
            <li> I wanted to return this item but found out it is unreturnable. The thinnest layers of this stuff will shrink. I have a UV lamp(over 36 watts) and didn&#x27;t cure this stuff well at all. I read some of RED CARPET MANICURES Q&amp;A and found out that you can cure their polish with UV lamp.  The bottles are very tiny including the purify and erase. Make sure you read the description and look at the amount of fl oz in each bottle before you buy. I would definitely not recommend this product. Too expensive for testers</li>
            <li> This is truly a great starter kit!  It has everything you could possibly need for the first timer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Job Red Carpet</li>
            <li> Great product great value. Much cheaper than sallys and the whole set works well my nails last a week to two weeks</li>
            <li> Love this, saving me tons of money on manicures</li>
            <li> I bought this kit 21 days ago and the price already dropped $10. It&#x27;s a basic kit and all I really needed was the structure and brilliance top coat. Woulda waited 3 weeks if I knew it was going to go down a third in price...</li>
            <li> Has everything but the uv light. Has good colors and the right things to use. Cheaper than buying them separately.</li>
            <li> I love being able to do gel nails at home. This is the same product you can buy at target but cheaper</li>
            <li> I am ecstatic about this purchase, now when I reorder I do know, that I will not need 2 of the bigger bottles, just acetone and 90% rubbing alcohol. I will probably only reorder the prep, base and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked beautifully with the red carpet LED lamp I purchased. Everything done in less than 10 mins, I&#x27;m sure when I reapply it will take longer because it takes 20 minutes to remove the Gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually didn&#x27;t use the Red Carpet Gel polish but purchased Gelish since it was a few dollars cheaper or had free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also keep in mind this KIT DOES NOT come with a Gel Polish just the base and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving me $30 each time. This purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li> The RCM system is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried so far in regards to gel polish. Unfortunately, all of the liquid products in this kit can be purchased for a much better price. The acetone and alcohol can be bought at Sally&#x27;s for way cheaper than these tiny little bottles that don&#x27;t last long. The actual polish components are great though.</li>
            <li> this is called a must have kit.  well I would think.that a must have would include the polish also for thr price I paid for them. was really dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This is a very convenient set, it has everything you need. The bottles are small but there is still enough product to do a number of applications. I would purchase this set again.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit along with a UV light for my sister as a gift for Christmas, the package arrived on time and packaged well, I gave it to my sister on Christmas day, she opened it and did her nails the same night and they looked awesome, I have decided to buy the same kit for myself, along with the light :)</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  I have used it about 6 times already and it looks like it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.  If you&#x27;ve never done your own gel manicure/pedicure before, you might find it helpful to know that you should apply each coat sparingly.  I have found that getting too much polish on the nail causes it to seep over to the finger causing the need to clip the dried polish off when you&#x27;re done and not leaving a good seal around the edges.</li>
            <li> Like the product states, it is a &#x27;must have&#x27; set for those who are into the Red Carpet ecosystem. You get everything you need to for prep and for cleaning. Granted, the bottles are small - but the price on Amazon is a good deal and you will need these items eventually.</li>
            <li> Products are a little smaller than Gelish Mini but just as good. I&#x27;m experimenting with different gels and so far Red Carpet passes</li>
            <li> Great product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> She loved the product so I guess really the only rating I could give was 5*. Will consider purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this kit except the small size. Spend a few more dollars for full size bottles. You can also get much bigger bottles of acetone, 90% alcohol, and cuticle oil at your local beauty supply for less. Also note that this item is not returnable to Amazon. I&#x27;m including a link to a basic kit by Gelish.    www.amazon.com/Harmony-Foundation-Base-Top Bond/dp/B007AU0FXA/ref&#x3D;pd_rhf_gw_p_t_4_WFKC</li>
            <li> This set is great for the base products of the red carpet manicure. I had already purchased the manicure professional set and needed a refresh of the base products so this was perfect for my needs. Again, the set does not have the light or the actual nail color - these are only the base products you need.</li>
            <li> I thought the bottles would be bigger but I like the way it works.  Value was good for the price.</li>
            <li> Best ever. I have found no product like it...yet</li>
            <li> is lies that lasts for three weeks. seems to me that is not as good product .opens regret not spending more money and buy a better Gel Polish .</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I was not completely satisfied so I gave it another try, but sure enough it still wasn&#x27;t good. The polishes don&#x27;t set well and no matter what I do, the color won&#x27;t stick to the ends of my nails. The first time I did my nails, they were chipping and peeling 2 days later. I prefer the Gelish kit so I&#x27;m returning this and going back to Gelish.</li>
            <li> Great price. Doing my own nails now. For what I paid for this kit I would have paid to have nails done once in a salon. I have used it 7-8 times now and haven&#x27;t even begun to use a small portion of supplies. Since I have really thin nails this application allows me to grow my nails out and they are strong as long as I have the nail products applied. Great for those of us who have a hard time growing out nails without them breaking off. Would highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> This kit has everthing you need to get that salon-finish look. The steps are easy to follow and the RC Professional light (not included) works like a charm. I just saved myself $35 every two weeks :-)</li>
            <li> This is fantastic just make sure you use it with a UV lamp drier otherwise it will NOT work.  It is unlike any nail product I have used before.  My only complain is that there are very limited directions.  I searched online and got great directions but they really should be provided by the manufacturer.  I spend about the same amount for this kit and the drier as I would for two gel manicures at a salon.  I am thrilled!  Be aware, this kit does not contain gel color polish, you will need to purchase it separately.  I love that my natural nails continue to grow and be healthy with this polish on.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about it chipping on the second day.  It seems to last 1 &amp; 1/2 to 2 weeks and looks great with a high shine the entire time.  If I want a different color, I can just put regular polish over the gel manicure and then remove it with regular nail polish and return to the gel color underneath which still looks great.  Not sure why it has taken the industry so long to develop a product like this but I am thrilled that they finally did!</li>
            <li> Great price for a starter kid! it came with everything I needed to do acrylic gel nails. I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year now and the only thing running low is the cleaner since it evaporates. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just got this set today (I purchased it along with the led light.)  I did my first at home manicure and it looks gorgeous! I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply it to my right hand very well (I&#x27;m right handed) but the set was extremely easy to use and the right hand looks as good as the left.  I bought five different nail colors and I am so happy with the colors.  I am excited to be able to do my own gel manicures at home at a fraction of the cost.  Tip: I watched a couple of youtube tutorials before I started and it had some really good advice and tips.</li>
            <li> This is the best LED manicure set... every other one that I have tried peels off within a couple of days ...if you put this on correctly it last 2+ weeks... Love it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like the at home gel manicures and so I got this because it was more economical than buying some other brands I am more familiar with. Everything works well, so if you need these products I recommend it. However, I find several steps unnecessary as you might have something already that works the same (ex: the replenish is just a nail oil, and the purify is practically rubbing alcohol). The top and bottom coats def work well with the lamps I just think they smell really bad. When I run out I will probably buy CND but there is nothing wrong with the function of these products.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I ordered this after using a friend&#x27;s and I love it.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
