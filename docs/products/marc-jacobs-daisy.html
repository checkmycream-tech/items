            <li>very sweet smell, fruity and not overbearing....</li>

            <li>love the smell, smells fresh!</li>
            <li>got it for my mom as a x-mas present - she loved it!</li>
            <li>it fades very quickly</li>
            <li>for someone who has been wearing Daisy for 5 years, its never been this strong on the alcohol smell.</li>

            <li>I believe it is not the real Daisy because it wears off super soon, the fixation isn&#x27;t as good as one bought from a department store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and fresh.</li>
            <li>and accurate ship.....</li>
            <li>Great scent although it doesn&#x27;t seem to last through the day</li>
            <li>The scent is light: flowery and feminine without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I ordered this just in time for xmas this year and it was such a great deal.</li>
            <li>The scent is so fresh and elegant.</li>
            <li>Daisy by Marc Jacobs is a light flowery scent that lasts almost all day.</li>
            <li>great smell but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift and liked it so much</li>
            <li>On Amazon it was $58 with FREE 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh, and love the look of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Good quality and the price is much better than our local high-end Department Store.</li>
            <li>,honestly the scent fades pretty quickly-</li>
            <li>It is not to strong but sweet.</li>
            <li>but since its still summer and here in texas we are still in the triple digits,I rather like this version,Ispray it on throughout the day,you really cannot overdo,love it !!!</li>
            <li>Has a very fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Came brand new out box great but thanks</li>
            <li>Also came very quickly which I loved because I had already run out of my last bottle.</li>
            <li>Working with Amazon is soo easy to find what you need, shipping very fast and easy.</li>
            <li>She was not disappointed and the value was a bonus.</li>
            <li>Original product, not diluted like others sellers may sell it.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Purchased the original Marc Jacobs from Macy&#x27;s and it was $100</li>
            <li>It was wrapped and in original packaging.</li>
            <li>I got it on Amazon because it was a significant savings.</li>
            <li>This is a rich smelling perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love the fresh, fun scent and the unique bottle.</li>
            <li>The scent is sweet and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, fresh fragrance that doesn&#x27;t scream that you are wearing perfume.</li>
            <li>Thanks for safe delivery</li>
            <li>I tried this perfume at Sephora but didn&#x27;t want to pay the full price for the 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s cool.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is just like the ones at Macy&#x60;s for a better  price,  shipping was fast than stated.</li>
            <li>Love it, delivery was fast as well</li>
            <li>This is a birthday gift - I am sure it will be very well received.</li>
            <li>Daisy is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>like the perfume, however, when I first put it on, it is a bit strong.....</li>
            <li>Really quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Quick ship, item just as described.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping/  as described</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and painless.</li>
            <li>The perfume arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It got here quickly.</li>
            <li>However, after receiving this (quickly, might I add)</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Got to me quickly.</li>
            <li>They also shipped it quick to my home.</li>
            <li>Smells just like daisy however the scent does not last more than five secs after application, therefore I do not think this is authentic.</li>
            <li>Love my new perfume, was a Xmas gift from hubby, he did a good job picking this one, it is fresh and sweet and last all day!</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous, pump works, and was actually a good deal when you price it against other stores.</li>
            <li>But it lasts all day long and men always tell me I smell good.</li>
            <li>My favorite and this was by far the cheapest around!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>It may have been the first bottle of perfume I ever finished!  </li>
            <li>Your delivery was quick and the product made a nice present.</li>
            <li>Deliscious and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary trial tester in the mail, and found myself comparing the magazine sample pages of sprays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and airy.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent and amazon has by far the cheapest price.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume so far.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of Daisy at Macy&#x27;s and it was pretty pricy, so I was excited when I found this one on Amazon for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Right out of the bottle</li>
            <li>so I grabbed it while the price was just right.</li>
            <li>The cheap prices does not mean you are skipping out on quality.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, soft and clean lovely scent with a faint, fragrant note of sweet violets blooming on a sunny day.  </li>
            <li>This was my scent before it was popular (I literally found it - only one - on the top row towards the back in a Sephora)!</li>
            <li>The box seemed fine, but after I opened the box the bottle was definately different from the original bottle.</li>
            <li>Fresh soft clean.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Item as described and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I wear this regularly and it is my favorite</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday which is exactly a month from today...</li>
            <li>She said she gets compliments all the time and really loves this perfume!</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for making this an affordable gift!</li>
            <li>This perfume isn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a try,and the bottle is pretty huge,&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li>Smells amazing,  lasts long and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this perfume since the first time I tried in a local store.</li>
            <li>I will buy more in tht future, though.</li>
            <li>So yes, authentic and lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li>I love it for Spring &amp; Summer, but you could definitely wear this in all 4 seasons if you want.</li>
            <li>Daisy is a lighter fragrance than many on the market currently.</li>
            <li>That what exactly I am thinking before.</li>
            <li>And the price is much cheaper than store!</li>
            <li>better for younger woman</li>
            <li>Love this and its a big bottle.</li>
            <li>Arrived in packaging as in photo and is the real thing!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>and I was SOOOO glad to find it online for cheaper for the exact same quality you would find in a store!</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I imagined.</li>
            <li>Its flowery and gentle, just the right scent for a teenager or anyone for that matter.</li>
            <li>Clean and pretty, not heavy or overpowering.</li>
            <li>Make sure this is the scent your particular girlfriend is interested in before buying, because they&#x27;re are plenty of different ones to choose from.</li>
            <li>I was a little perturbed because I like to have a unique scent, but I can understand why so many like it -</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I purchase at Macy&#x27;s and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>she absolutely loves it, if you are unsure about this sent go and try it out first</li>
            <li>Light, clean, fresh, slightly floral.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not strong, loud and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>not only did I receive this super super fast</li>
            <li>Classy scent (not a cheap drug store variety) and decorative bottle looks nice on the dresser!</li>
            <li>The bottle I got from Amazon smells authentic to me, but is definitely not as strong as the perfume at Sephora, so it wears off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>When i spritzed my wrist it smelled like pure alcohol.</li>
            <li>True, it costs more to buy it at a department store, but you will definitely need fewer sprays of it and it will last for the whole day.</li>
            <li>It makes the cloudiest days seem a little brighter and is an amazing value for the 3.4 oz size.  </li>
            <li>I will pay a little extra for the smaller bottle to be able to hold it more comfortably, And</li>
            <li>what i wanted , but found it much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished.  </li>
            <li>This scent is young and fresh.</li>
            <li>I really like this sent for the summer.</li>
            <li>I person I purchase this perfume for absolutely loves the fragrant.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really describe the scent.</li>
            <li>Its the real deal.</li>
            <li>There is nowhere when ordering that stated you could not return.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they were fast and I ordered the correct bottle which Im still waiting on.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I instantly realized why it was so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I took the item to a department store and the sent and color of the Daisy in the store was much stronger and darker.</li>
            <li>I got two of them, and they are very high-quality whistles.</li>
            <li>I&#x60;m very please with my order.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>it is the real perfume.</li>
            <li>But this fragrance really seems to please her.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real daisy by mac Jacobs.</li>
            <li>The product they sent me was not the real Marc Jacobs.</li>
            <li>The scent really lasts if you spray it on your clothing.  </li>
            <li>It is soft a feminine and my husband loves it too!!!</li>
            <li>Huge mistake... Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the original &amp; doesn&#x27;t last longer than a second.</li>
            <li>I love the light floral scent, but it isn&#x27;t worth the price if it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li>a hope that i smeels the same as the original one, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I keep it for special occasions but can definitely be worn either day or night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially I was a bit reserved buying perfume online but thought that because it was direct from Amazon it would be exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>, I mean not get a better deal by buying the big bottle for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>New in package - could not beat the PRICE!</li>
            <li>Loveee the smell, love that the price was almost cut in half</li>
            <li>I would recommend this particular perfume.  </li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s more yellow in color and smells different.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend it, Not Overpowering at All..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend Amazon.</li>
            <li>Smells great and isn&#x27;t fake</li>
            <li>, my significant other really likes it on me...</li>
            <li>I have finally found a signature perfume that I LOVE and plan on wearing for a long time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unusual from the usual sweet / floral options available and simply one of my favourites for night or day wear !</li>
            <li>The bottle looks absolutely adorable with the little soft daisies on the cap.</li>
            <li>Brand new and box was sealed with plastic like it was bought at the store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new scent ever since they discontinued my cologne that I always bought from the UK.  </li>
            <li>Ill recommend it to friends:)) and it smells fantastic^^</li>
            <li>It smells less clean and floral and a little more musky and formal.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle from Macy&#x27;s and the one from Amazon and they smell exactly the same!</li>
            <li>The scent is exactly the same as in the store.</li>
            <li>but the price was fantastic actually $10 less</li>
            <li>light scent, but obviously not so light that others don&#x27;t ask about it often.</li>
            <li>I made&lt;br /&gt;sure to buy mine directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 25 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>My wife was surprised....</li>
            <li>It is cheaper than the official website but absolutely the same product!</li>
            <li>Bought it to replace my old bottle.</li>
            <li>I am not a huge perfume lover but this smell is heavenly and light.</li>
            <li>Light smell, not a strong scent that makes you have a headache.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle, and that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li>So much to the point I am usually having a headache over the powerful scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s both floral and a little sweet.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting the big bottle for just a little more than I would have paid in the store for the even smaller one</li>
            <li>I will definitely re-purchase this only from Amazon in the future for as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li>Originally $89.00 at any beauty retailer such as sephora or ULTA and got it for way less here.</li>
            <li>I used to wear Marc Jacobs Daisy all the time, but had been hesitant to buy a new bottle recently because of the price.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s an EDT, it&#x27;s still pretty long lasting.</li>
            <li>I first had a small sample from Sephora, and decided I would like to invest in a real bottle.</li>
            <li>Flowery, subtle, light, fresh (not fresh in a citrusy way).</li>
            <li>A saleslady at Macy&#x27;s suggested the black bottle Daisy (parfum) and said it would be a longer lasting scent, but it was so different from the original scent</li>
            <li>different sites, and by far the price I paid for @</li>
            <li>Not only for young ladies - would appeal to any age.  </li>
            <li>Too busy too return the item but would not buy any perfume from this cellar or at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;it does not last 15 mintes afer</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same item I would have spent $90 in a department store, so for the cost of one ish ($100) I got two.</li>
            <li>There are two different scents and she like the other scent as well but seems to wear this one a little more.</li>
            <li>Some people say it fades too quick, but I actually could still smell it on me during the night after  a few sprays in the morning.</li>
            <li>I will keep using Daisy in the future and I am willing to try their other scents</li>
            <li>Before I bought this perfume I read some previous reviews and since the good ones out-weighted the bad ones I decided it was worth to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks similar enough, but the label &amp;#34;Daisy&amp;#34; is much different from on my old bottle (from Nordstrom).</li>
            <li>shipping was fast but the product was watered down.</li>
            <li>this perfume is not strong, my mom like it very much.</li>
            <li>Spend the few extra dollars and buy the real one!</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant on buying it after reading a couple reviews saying that this wasn&#x27;t the real Daisy, but I went ahead a bought it anyway.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I believe it is not the real Daisy because it wears off super soon, the fixation isn&#x27;t as good as one bought from a department store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and fresh.</li>
            <li> and accurate ship.....</li>
            <li> Great scent although it doesn&#x27;t seem to last through the day</li>
            <li> The scent is light: flowery and feminine without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I ordered this just in time for xmas this year and it was such a great deal.</li>
            <li> The scent is so fresh and elegant.</li>
            <li> Daisy by Marc Jacobs is a light flowery scent that lasts almost all day.</li>
            <li> great smell but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It is a lovely, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and liked it so much</li>
            <li> On Amazon it was $58 with FREE 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and fresh, and love the look of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Good quality and the price is much better than our local high-end Department Store.</li>
            <li> ,honestly the scent fades pretty quickly-</li>
            <li> It is not to strong but sweet.</li>
            <li> but since its still summer and here in texas we are still in the triple digits,I rather like this version,Ispray it on throughout the day,you really cannot overdo,love it !!!</li>
            <li> Has a very fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Came brand new out box great but thanks</li>
            <li> Also came very quickly which I loved because I had already run out of my last bottle.</li>
            <li> Working with Amazon is soo easy to find what you need, shipping very fast and easy.</li>
            <li> She was not disappointed and the value was a bonus.</li>
            <li> Original product, not diluted like others sellers may sell it.</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Purchased the original Marc Jacobs from Macy&#x27;s and it was $100</li>
            <li> It was wrapped and in original packaging.</li>
            <li> I got it on Amazon because it was a significant savings.</li>
            <li> This is a rich smelling perfume.  </li>
            <li> I love the fresh, fun scent and the unique bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent is sweet and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light, fresh fragrance that doesn&#x27;t scream that you are wearing perfume.</li>
            <li> Thanks for safe delivery</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume at Sephora but didn&#x27;t want to pay the full price for the 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s cool.  </li>
            <li> This perfume is just like the ones at Macy&#x60;s for a better  price,  shipping was fast than stated.</li>
            <li> Love it, delivery was fast as well</li>
            <li> This is a birthday gift - I am sure it will be very well received.</li>
            <li> Daisy is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> like the perfume, however, when I first put it on, it is a bit strong.....</li>
            <li> Really quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Quick ship, item just as described.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping/  as described</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and painless.</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It got here quickly.</li>
            <li> However, after receiving this (quickly, might I add)</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Got to me quickly.</li>
            <li> They also shipped it quick to my home.</li>
            <li> Smells just like daisy however the scent does not last more than five secs after application, therefore I do not think this is authentic.</li>
            <li> Love my new perfume, was a Xmas gift from hubby, he did a good job picking this one, it is fresh and sweet and last all day!</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous, pump works, and was actually a good deal when you price it against other stores.</li>
            <li> But it lasts all day long and men always tell me I smell good.</li>
            <li> My favorite and this was by far the cheapest around!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> It may have been the first bottle of perfume I ever finished!  </li>
            <li> Your delivery was quick and the product made a nice present.</li>
            <li> Deliscious and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary trial tester in the mail, and found myself comparing the magazine sample pages of sprays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and airy.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent and amazon has by far the cheapest price.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume so far.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of Daisy at Macy&#x27;s and it was pretty pricy, so I was excited when I found this one on Amazon for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Right out of the bottle</li>
            <li> so I grabbed it while the price was just right.</li>
            <li> The cheap prices does not mean you are skipping out on quality.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, soft and clean lovely scent with a faint, fragrant note of sweet violets blooming on a sunny day.  </li>
            <li> This was my scent before it was popular (I literally found it - only one - on the top row towards the back in a Sephora)!</li>
            <li> The box seemed fine, but after I opened the box the bottle was definately different from the original bottle.</li>
            <li> Fresh soft clean.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Item as described and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I wear this regularly and it is my favorite</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday which is exactly a month from today...</li>
            <li> She said she gets compliments all the time and really loves this perfume!</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon for making this an affordable gift!</li>
            <li> This perfume isn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try,and the bottle is pretty huge,&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li> Smells amazing,  lasts long and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with this perfume since the first time I tried in a local store.</li>
            <li> I will buy more in tht future, though.</li>
            <li> So yes, authentic and lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li> I love it for Spring &amp; Summer, but you could definitely wear this in all 4 seasons if you want.</li>
            <li> Daisy is a lighter fragrance than many on the market currently.</li>
            <li> That what exactly I am thinking before.</li>
            <li> And the price is much cheaper than store!</li>
            <li> better for younger woman</li>
            <li> Love this and its a big bottle.</li>
            <li> Arrived in packaging as in photo and is the real thing!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> and I was SOOOO glad to find it online for cheaper for the exact same quality you would find in a store!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I imagined.</li>
            <li> Its flowery and gentle, just the right scent for a teenager or anyone for that matter.</li>
            <li> Clean and pretty, not heavy or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Make sure this is the scent your particular girlfriend is interested in before buying, because they&#x27;re are plenty of different ones to choose from.</li>
            <li> I was a little perturbed because I like to have a unique scent, but I can understand why so many like it -</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I purchase at Macy&#x27;s and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> she absolutely loves it, if you are unsure about this sent go and try it out first</li>
            <li> Light, clean, fresh, slightly floral.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not strong, loud and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> not only did I receive this super super fast</li>
            <li> Classy scent (not a cheap drug store variety) and decorative bottle looks nice on the dresser!</li>
            <li> The bottle I got from Amazon smells authentic to me, but is definitely not as strong as the perfume at Sephora, so it wears off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> When i spritzed my wrist it smelled like pure alcohol.</li>
            <li> True, it costs more to buy it at a department store, but you will definitely need fewer sprays of it and it will last for the whole day.</li>
            <li> It makes the cloudiest days seem a little brighter and is an amazing value for the 3.4 oz size.  </li>
            <li> I will pay a little extra for the smaller bottle to be able to hold it more comfortably, And</li>
            <li> what i wanted , but found it much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished.  </li>
            <li> This scent is young and fresh.</li>
            <li> I really like this sent for the summer.</li>
            <li> I person I purchase this perfume for absolutely loves the fragrant.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really describe the scent.</li>
            <li> Its the real deal.</li>
            <li> There is nowhere when ordering that stated you could not return.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they were fast and I ordered the correct bottle which Im still waiting on.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I instantly realized why it was so cheap.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I took the item to a department store and the sent and color of the Daisy in the store was much stronger and darker.</li>
            <li> I got two of them, and they are very high-quality whistles.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m very please with my order.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> it is the real perfume.</li>
            <li> But this fragrance really seems to please her.  </li>
            <li> This is not the real daisy by mac Jacobs.</li>
            <li> The product they sent me was not the real Marc Jacobs.</li>
            <li> The scent really lasts if you spray it on your clothing.  </li>
            <li> It is soft a feminine and my husband loves it too!!!</li>
            <li> Huge mistake... Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the original &amp; doesn&#x27;t last longer than a second.</li>
            <li> I love the light floral scent, but it isn&#x27;t worth the price if it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> a hope that i smeels the same as the original one, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I keep it for special occasions but can definitely be worn either day or night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I was a bit reserved buying perfume online but thought that because it was direct from Amazon it would be exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> , I mean not get a better deal by buying the big bottle for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> New in package - could not beat the PRICE!</li>
            <li> Loveee the smell, love that the price was almost cut in half</li>
            <li> I would recommend this particular perfume.  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s more yellow in color and smells different.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend it, Not Overpowering at All..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells great and isn&#x27;t fake</li>
            <li> , my significant other really likes it on me...</li>
            <li> I have finally found a signature perfume that I LOVE and plan on wearing for a long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unusual from the usual sweet / floral options available and simply one of my favourites for night or day wear !</li>
            <li> The bottle looks absolutely adorable with the little soft daisies on the cap.</li>
            <li> Brand new and box was sealed with plastic like it was bought at the store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new scent ever since they discontinued my cologne that I always bought from the UK.  </li>
            <li> Ill recommend it to friends:)) and it smells fantastic^^</li>
            <li> It smells less clean and floral and a little more musky and formal.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle from Macy&#x27;s and the one from Amazon and they smell exactly the same!</li>
            <li> The scent is exactly the same as in the store.</li>
            <li> but the price was fantastic actually $10 less</li>
            <li> light scent, but obviously not so light that others don&#x27;t ask about it often.</li>
            <li> I made&lt;br /&gt;sure to buy mine directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 25 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> My wife was surprised....</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than the official website but absolutely the same product!</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace my old bottle.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge perfume lover but this smell is heavenly and light.</li>
            <li> Light smell, not a strong scent that makes you have a headache.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, and that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li> So much to the point I am usually having a headache over the powerful scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s both floral and a little sweet.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting the big bottle for just a little more than I would have paid in the store for the even smaller one</li>
            <li> I will definitely re-purchase this only from Amazon in the future for as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li> Originally $89.00 at any beauty retailer such as sephora or ULTA and got it for way less here.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Marc Jacobs Daisy all the time, but had been hesitant to buy a new bottle recently because of the price.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s an EDT, it&#x27;s still pretty long lasting.</li>
            <li> I first had a small sample from Sephora, and decided I would like to invest in a real bottle.</li>
            <li> Flowery, subtle, light, fresh (not fresh in a citrusy way).</li>
            <li> A saleslady at Macy&#x27;s suggested the black bottle Daisy (parfum) and said it would be a longer lasting scent, but it was so different from the original scent</li>
            <li> different sites, and by far the price I paid for @</li>
            <li> Not only for young ladies - would appeal to any age.  </li>
            <li> Too busy too return the item but would not buy any perfume from this cellar or at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;it does not last 15 mintes afer</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same item I would have spent $90 in a department store, so for the cost of one ish ($100) I got two.</li>
            <li> There are two different scents and she like the other scent as well but seems to wear this one a little more.</li>
            <li> Some people say it fades too quick, but I actually could still smell it on me during the night after  a few sprays in the morning.</li>
            <li> I will keep using Daisy in the future and I am willing to try their other scents</li>
            <li> Before I bought this perfume I read some previous reviews and since the good ones out-weighted the bad ones I decided it was worth to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks similar enough, but the label &amp;#34;Daisy&amp;#34; is much different from on my old bottle (from Nordstrom).</li>
            <li> shipping was fast but the product was watered down.</li>
            <li> this perfume is not strong, my mom like it very much.</li>
            <li> Spend the few extra dollars and buy the real one!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant on buying it after reading a couple reviews saying that this wasn&#x27;t the real Daisy, but I went ahead a bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> It comes in the normal black box like Sephora.</li>
            <li> Bought the wrong product really liked the other Marc Jacobs perfume.</li>
            <li> My 20 yr old, who is extremely fickle and changes her mind about everything, has been wearing this as &amp;#34;her scent&amp;#34; for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> But the only problem is that this scent just doesn&#x27;t last long enough on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh, subtle, and feminine scent that any woman can wear.</li>
            <li> Usually I buy it with retail price, however, this time that I purchased from Amazon the price was fairly reasonable.</li>
            <li> This doesnt seem to last as long as the  daisy i buy at  macys and the number is scratched on the bottom of the bottle ...</li>
            <li> For those who are complaining that it doesn&#x27;t last as long, it all depends on the the seller you got it from.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing these for years and as long as they are completed the same way.  </li>
            <li> However, the scent does not last that long on the skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, however.</li>
            <li> old stock or whatever the fragrance does not last even half hour !</li>
            <li> and i agree with her this is a perfume that does not smell like the little old lady stuff you can smell before she leaves the house</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like getting two bottles for the price of  one and is the real deal, not a cheap imitation knock-off.</li>
            <li> My wife said that the sent didnt stay on that long.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> It lasts just as long as department store bought perfume.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase Tresor but this scent is better and less expensive.</li>
            <li> The bottle is definitely not full, but not low enough to return.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a simple everyday scent that would last all day in the office.</li>
            <li> It has a long lasting scent and is half the cost of apartment stores.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed because you cannot return perfumes through Amazon because they are considered hazardous (flammable).  </li>
            <li> It barely had a scent and after a few minutes you couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;smell anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually a lot more expensive....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product some time ago and just had the chance to open the box (as I&#x27;ve been using my previous bottle).</li>
            <li> Usually I go for something different the second time around.</li>
            <li> This is a very fresh perfume and eventhough It&#x27;s an expensive one, it was cheaper than in any other place!</li>
            <li> I have spent less money on scents that last all day without having to reapply.</li>
            <li> It falls just a little bit short in these areas in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It looked like it might have been a sample and was a little short.  </li>
            <li> This perfume is so delicate and classy; never goes out of style.</li>
            <li> Daily I get asked by strangers what scent I am wearing, and although it&#x27;s not available in Canada, I tell them where to find it on the internet.  </li>
            <li> But be careful, it&#x27;s considered a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;, so you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> However the scent only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints with this product.</li>
            <li> I was a bit cautious, but the product was just as expected.</li>
            <li> Might be worth it for the price if you&#x27;re looking for something faint, or don&#x27;t mind reapplying throughout the day.</li>
            <li> product arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t wear American perfumes because the synthetic oils change scent on me.  </li>
            <li> Other companies that you buy from online let you return unopened.</li>
            <li> Wide loves the fragrance and the bottle!</li>
            <li> I found it cheaper here than on any other perfume website.</li>
            <li> It is  watered down....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean pay extra</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend, amazon has it listed for about 10 to 15 dollars less than the marc jacobs website.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this item today, and it got here in less than 5 days.</li>
            <li> It was shipped to me in less than a week.</li>
            <li> bought this awhile ago and not even half way through it.</li>
            <li> Half of the price Sephora is sell it at ( $90 if I remember correctly).</li>
            <li> I made this purchase, it was around $57 which is MUCH less than what you&#x27;d pay elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Very subtle but noticeable and classy.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order this after reading some reviews that the product received was *not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding \\&quot;the\\&quot; perfume for me.</li>
            <li> It may not be mine, but I do sneak in a few times and use it.</li>
            <li> It may be fake or really really old.</li>
            <li> Can wear day or night,  all year round.</li>
            <li> but I will wear it all year round.</li>
            <li> I will continue to wear this fragrance everyday.</li>
            <li> I prefer to wear this during the Day, since it&#x27;s not so heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Smells gross and infantile like baby powder.</li>
            <li> It was an inferior product and wanted to warn anyone else before they waste their money.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased at all , it doesn&#x27;t smell like it should.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake the smell doesn&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li> I dont usually go for &amp;</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this online because I read that sometimes the fragrances are not authentic.</li>
            <li> So I payed this amout of money on a fake parfume that doesn&#x27;t even smell the same.</li>
            <li> I bought her several other very expensive gifts along with this for Christmas</li>
            <li> , at least I think this is I like products.</li>
            <li> I am not a perfume fanatic</li>
            <li> I have not heard any negative feedback from recipient.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a daisy, like the name says.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to hold it is so big.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than in a retail store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy perfume for myself, but this time I bought another bottle!!</li>
            <li> And much less expensive than retail stores!</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending $90+ on this decided to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> i am skeptical on wether this is truly daisy</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is not the sellers fault, I ordered this perfume but it was the wrong Daisy perfume.</li>
            <li> Probably a fake.</li>
            <li> Wrong, it smells like a knockoff</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I smell this product now all I can smell is a traitorous harlot.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Which that makes me think this is a fake because when I tried the perfume at sephora the scent lasted all day</li>
            <li> that is difficult because I don&#x27;t take the bottle with me when I go out.</li>
            <li> this perfume is so expensive</li>
            <li> Bad product, bad seller bad everything.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good-but does not last-----at all:( bummer</li>
            <li> it was not the scent I paid for and was disappointed but through amazon I had no issues.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great scent although it doesn&#x27;t seem to last through the day</li>
            <li> Really quick delivery. Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so delicate and classy; never goes out of style.</li>
            <li> Stuff makes me sneeze and my nose run. Horrible.</li>
            <li> Brand new and box was sealed with plastic like it was bought at the store</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and I love it! The price was incredible compared to department stores!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! Very happy with purchase. Exactly as described and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> what i wanted , but found it much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love the smell,so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend, amazon has it listed for about 10 to 15 dollars less than the marc jacobs website.  I would recommend this particular perfume.  It&#x27;s of the highest quality, made in France.  Make sure this is the scent your particular girlfriend is interested in before buying, because they&#x27;re are plenty of different ones to choose from.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law loved this as a Christmas gift.  So excited!</li>
            <li> I was not pleased at all , it doesn&#x27;t smell like it should.</li>
            <li> very nice scent, my significant other really likes it on me... and I always get compliments every time I wear it. My only issue is that to not expect it to last longer than an hour... it fades very quickly</li>
            <li> The family recognizes this as my smell....and they all love it. No headaches, no yucky whew, just that &amp;#34;you smells beautiful!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very nice!  The package arrived quickly and the product was great!</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of Daisy at Macy&#x27;s and it was pretty pricy, so I was excited when I found this one on Amazon for a fraction of the price. I was a little hesitant on buying it after reading a couple reviews saying that this wasn&#x27;t the real Daisy, but I went ahead a bought it anyway. Huge mistake... Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the original &amp; doesn&#x27;t last longer than a second. I basically just paid for a bottle of alcohol. Spend the few extra dollars and buy the real one!</li>
            <li> this fragrance of marc jacobs would suit most women .. it&#x27;s unusual from the usual sweet / floral options available and simply one of my favourites for night or day wear !</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter who loves this perfume.  She was not disappointed and the value was a bonus.</li>
            <li> Nice price on genuine Daisy perfume by Marc Jacobs. My wife was thrilled. The scent is light: flowery and feminine without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great price bought it for my mom for Christmas it is her favorite perfume cannot beat the price</li>
            <li> Quick ship, item just as described.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I don&#x27;t know why people have posted that it smells different from the perfume you&#x27;d buy in the store.  I have a bottle from Macy&#x27;s and the one from Amazon and they smell exactly the same!</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing, and the one that I received is definitely authentic.  Great price for this lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She likes it and I like the scent that she emanates even more. Very subtle but noticeable and classy.</li>
            <li> My 19 yr old daughter loved it and got it on time for Christmas very nice fragrence...very light</li>
            <li> has a very strong alcohol smell. I am not impressed at all. for someone who has been wearing Daisy for 5 years, its never been this strong on the alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> This has a great floral scent. Shipping took about 2 weeks though. Original product, not diluted like others sellers may sell it. Besides that i love this perfume!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding \\&quot;the\\&quot; perfume for me. I used to wear Ralph Lauren Ralph, J Lo Glow, Curve, etc. None of these perfumes compare to Marc Jacobs Daisy. I have finally found a signature perfume that I LOVE and plan on wearing for a long time. It&#x27;s a light, fresh fragrance that doesn&#x27;t scream that you are wearing perfume. It&#x27;s subtle, and that&#x27;s what I love about it. I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
            <li> This purchase is actually not for me, I bought it for my 15 y/o daughter. She had droppped the hint that she wanted the perfume months ago, so my journey began. Comparison shopped @ different sites, and by far the price I paid for @ Amazon was the best. As for the product itself..It may not be mine, but I do sneak in a few times and use it. Its flowery and gentle, just the right scent for a teenager or anyone for that matter. Would buy it again in the future once she runs out. And definately from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My niece wanted this for her birthday and I looked at a lot of sites to find the best price! Amazons was the best! It was delived very quickly also!</li>
            <li> Item as described and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> Product was just as decribed. New in package - could not beat the PRICE! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly at a good price. My wife is pleased because it smells like it should.</li>
            <li> I love this light scent. I get migraines from various odors but Daisy never bothers me.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume - bought this as a gift, maybe one day I will get one for myself.  The scent is light and fresh, and love the look of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Do not buy!!  Right out of the bottle this has no scent. I wear this regularly and it is my favorite so I thought I would but it from Amazon. I wish I didn&#x27;t. It may be fake or really really old.</li>
            <li> Great summer fragrance. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh, fun scent and the unique bottle. My daughters talked me into giving Daisy a try and I am not disappointed. I was looking for a simple everyday scent that would last all day in the office. Mission accomplished.  Great product, fast Amazon Prime service.</li>
            <li> Product was great and came on time. Will be buying again</li>
            <li> Present for my granddaughter</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it!  I admit that it is my favorite scent of the many that she has tried and she goes through about a bottle a month which works out well for me.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and I love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this just in time for xmas this year and it was such a great deal. I ended up getting the big bottle for just a little more than I would have paid in the store for the even smaller one so that was awesome. This smells amazing and the bottle will be precious to display even when the perfume has run out.</li>
            <li> Thanks for safe delivery</li>
            <li> This doesnt seem to last as long as the  daisy i buy at  macys and the number is scratched on the bottom of the bottle ...i am skeptical on wether this is truly daisy</li>
            <li> Quick shipping/  as described</li>
            <li> I love it, smells sooooo good, I get compliments everytime I wear it. Has a very fresh smell.</li>
            <li> No Fragrance ! old stock or whatever the fragrance does not last even half hour !</li>
            <li> Get compliments almost daily with this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend has been hinting at this so I grabbed it while the price was just right. Cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Deliscious and fresh smelling. Shipping was quick and painless.</li>
            <li> It has been a couple of years since this perfume on the market, I love it from day one. I always get compliment when I wear it! The scent is so fresh and elegant. Usually I buy it with retail price, however, this time that I purchased from Amazon the price was fairly reasonable. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Love this light, summery scent!</li>
            <li> This scent is young and fresh. I love it! You can&#x27;t find it for a better price either~</li>
            <li> Smells fantabulous 😱😂😂😂👏🏽😈</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s very favorite perfume! She absolutly loves it and I absolutely love her! Price was very nice and delivery was perfect!</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived quickly.  I had smelled this scent on an add that came in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;I like the perfume, however, when I first put it on, it is a bit strong.....&lt;br /&gt;As time goes on, it smells better.&lt;br /&gt;Fast and accurate ship.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake the smell doesn&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new scent ever since they discontinued my cologne that I always bought from the UK.  While visiting in Vegas [...], I got a whiff of a clerk&#x27;s perfume as she walked by me....immediately, I knew it was the scent for me, so I asked her the name...she told me it was Daisy, by Marc Jacobs and the rest is history. Daily I get asked by strangers what scent I am wearing, and although it&#x27;s not available in Canada, I tell them where to find it on the internet.  Since buying it for myself, I have also ordered it for both my sisters and daughter, all of whom fell in love with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;A light scent, but obviously not so light that others don&#x27;t ask about it often.</li>
            <li> I recieved this item today, and it got here in less than 5 days. The deal was awesome. I paid $37 for the 3.4 oz, and if I would have purchased this at Macy&#x27;s it would have cost around $70. I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> Product came within 5 business days! Can&#x27;t beat the price at a store and not too mention that this perfume smells great! I&#x27;ve received many compliments!</li>
            <li> Authentic. For those who are complaining that it doesn&#x27;t last as long, it all depends on the the seller you got it from. I made&lt;br /&gt;sure to buy mine directly from Amazon. Though it&#x27;s an EDT, it&#x27;s still pretty long lasting. I absolutely love this scent, and it&#x27;s not as expensive as if I were to get it from Sephora. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time fav. scents! It&#x27;s both floral and a little sweet. It&#x27;s a very fresh scent and perfect for spring and summer days. Very lovely.</li>
            <li> beautiful soft powdery/daisy scent. best price anywhere on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Good deal.  Less expensive than in a retail store.</li>
            <li> Great product. But be careful, it&#x27;s considered a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;, so you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Good product and service</li>
            <li> Great smell!!!! Everyone loves the scent on me love it worth buying!!!!!! Came brand new out box great but thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this sent for the summer. It is soft a feminine and my husband loves it too!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this 2 nites ago and it&#x27;s already here...I purchased this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday which is exactly a month from today...not only did I receive this super super fast but the price was fantastic actually $10 less then I paid last year from a different seller... overall a great experience!!!</li>
            <li> I person I purchase this perfume for absolutely loves the fragrant.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my best friend. Sephora and Ulta sell a 1.7 ounce of this same perfume for about 50 dollars. amazon.com had a great price on this and she loves it. She said she gets compliments all the time and really loves this perfume! Thanks amazon for making this an affordable gift!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I purchase at Macy&#x27;s and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells good, perfume and fragrance everyone likes is not the same, at least I think this is I like products.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Marc Jacobs Daisy as a Christmas present. Your delivery was quick and the product made a nice present.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this scent!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this perfume I read some previous reviews and since the good ones out-weighted the bad ones I decided it was worth to give it a try. I wouldn&#x27;t say I regret it, but I will not buy it again. I believe it is not the real Daisy because it wears off super soon, the fixation isn&#x27;t as good as one bought from a department store. True, it costs more to buy it at a department store, but you will definitely need fewer sprays of it and it will last for the whole day. I use a lot of it so I can go until 1pm without the smell wearing off. If you don&#x27;t mind using a lot of perfume just to save a couple bucks, go with this one.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave 3 stars is because received Daisy Dream instead of Daisy. I just so happened to like the Daisy Dream as well.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my Girl friend for christmas she has used it before and likes the way it smells and i agree with her this is a perfume that does not smell like the little old lady stuff you can smell before she leaves the house</li>
            <li> Awesome, totally worth</li>
            <li> This perfume isn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.It has more of a grassy smell than floral so it&#x27;s not too feminine and that part I like.However the scent only lasts a few hours.My husband said he likes it but I was disapointed.While the scent is ok I prefer sunflowers for a not too sweet floral scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I am not a perfume fanatic so I can&#x27;t really describe the scent. But it lasts all day long and men always tell me I smell good.</li>
            <li> Its the real deal. It comes in the normal black box like Sephora.</li>
            <li> Smells SO fresh, clean, &amp; elegant! Love the many compliments I get when I wear it! It has a hint of sophistication.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend for her birthday. She&#x27;s stoked and I think it smells good as well!</li>
            <li> Daisy is a very nice fragrance.  I usually can&#x27;t wear American perfumes because the synthetic oils change scent on me.  These do too but the scent is still nice.  Now I have two scents to wear.</li>
            <li> First,this smells amazing,its so different,I just love it- I dont usually go for &amp;#34;toillets&amp;#34;-but I thought I would give it a try,and the bottle is pretty huge,&lt;br /&gt;well,honestly the scent fades pretty quickly- but since its still summer and here in texas we are still in the triple digits,I rather like this version,Ispray it on throughout the day,you really cannot overdo,love it !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume 6 months ago, and I have received many comments about it-everyone loves it and I do too! Daisy by Marc Jacobs is a light flowery scent that lasts almost all day. Great buy! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: It&#x27;s almost been 8 years since trying this perfume and it is still my signature scent! I even wore it on my wedding day! I love it to pieces and get tons of compliments :)</li>
            <li> Favorite Fragrance!!  And much less expensive than retail stores!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, she doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of perfume so I thought this would be a good surprise. I have to admit I like it when she wears it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!  Get compliments all the time.  Can wear day or night,  all year round.</li>
            <li> Light nice fragrance. It smells like flowers. It doesn&#x27;t last very long, however. This fragrance is good for spring but I will wear it all year round.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing,  lasts long and fast shipping.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This product was as good as described, never mind that this is her favorite sent. This choice is a winnner</li>
            <li> My favorite scent. Fresh soft clean. Love the scent and the price.</li>
            <li> Great smell all around</li>
            <li> Just from the packaging is obviously not Marc Jacobs Daisy! I have been wearing this scent for years and always purchase from Nordstrom, but saw it on Amazon for a great price and couldn&#x27;t resist. The bottle looks similar enough, but the label &amp;#34;Daisy&amp;#34; is much different from on my old bottle (from Nordstrom). Also it&#x27;s more yellow in color and smells different. WHAT A SCAM! I am really disappointed because you cannot return perfumes through Amazon because they are considered hazardous (flammable).  Totally bummed and out $55. Nothing I can do now, but throw it away.</li>
            <li> This is not the sellers fault, I ordered this perfume but it was the wrong Daisy perfume. There are more than one. I never opened it and could not return it even though it was in perfect condition which bothered me. Other companies that you buy from online let you return unopened. There is nowhere when ordering that stated you could not return.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they were fast and I ordered the correct bottle which Im still waiting on.</li>
            <li> the missus loves this smell, and I do too... have to search around for the best price per volume though</li>
            <li> Purchased the original Marc Jacobs from Macy&#x27;s and it was $100 this one was $70 I love the smell and it lasts all day!!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this perfume since the first time I tried in a local store. I finally purchased it and I love it so far. Some people say it fades too quick, but I actually could still smell it on me during the night after  a few sprays in the morning.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my girlfriend since she likes to wear perfume. Alot of it. So much to the point I am usually having a headache over the powerful scents. This one was recommended to me by a friend. The smell is light, and surprisingly pleasant. My g/f loves this one and I will be purchasing for her again in the future.</li>
            <li> It got here quickly.It&#x27;s usually a lot more expensive.... I love this perfume!!! I get compliments ALL the time when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt; Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this for girlfriend she absolutely loves it, if you are unsure about this sent go and try it out first</li>
            <li> Good I guess. Mailed it to a friend. She was ecstatic!</li>
            <li> this perfume is not strong, my mom like it very much. and this is cheaper than in store. like it.</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume at Sephora but didn&#x27;t want to pay the full price for the 3.4 oz. AMAZING!!!!! Smells divine. Stays on the hole day. I could even smell it on clothes the day after I&#x27;ve worn them. Flowery, subtle, light, fresh (not fresh in a citrusy way). I keep it for special occasions but can definitely be worn either day or night. Quite distinctive fragrance. I feel like anyone would love this. Everybody I know does.</li>
            <li> My favorite and this was by far the cheapest around!</li>
            <li> I Love This Fragrance! Highly Recommend it, Not Overpowering at All.. This is My Fragrance for The Summer!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, its my favorite of all times, and the amazon price is unbeatable,. Its truly Marc Jacobs genius fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bought the wrong product really liked the other Marc Jacobs perfume. Thought I would return and switch it out but could not return it. So stuck with a 68.00 bottle of perfume I don&#x27;t like and won&#x27;t wear.</li>
            <li> Disappointed! Does not smell like the one in store. Probably a fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my new perfume. The scent is sweet and clean. The only things I would change are the strength and longevity. It falls just a little bit short in these areas in my opinion. I will buy more in tht future, though.</li>
            <li> This perfume was a great gift.  Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years and couldn&#x27;t believe it was on Amazon for a steeply discounted price. When it arrived I instantly realized why it was so cheap.  It smelled diluted and &amp;#34;off,&amp;#34; definitely not like what I wear every day.  When i spritzed my wrist it smelled like pure alcohol. I was extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I was a bit reserved buying perfume online but thought that because it was direct from Amazon it would be exactly what I was expecting. Wrong, it smells like a knockoff and I suggest purchasing from the dept. store counter, not here.</li>
            <li> Best deal and wonderful perfume thank you!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent at a great price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. I was hesitant to purchase this online because I read that sometimes the fragrances are not authentic. It was sold and shipped by amazon so I felt a bit more comfortable. It&#x27;s real and smells wonderful. It shipped in perfect time, also. I will continue to wear this fragrance everyday. Plus the bottle looks lovely on my vanity.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary trial tester in the mail, and found myself comparing the magazine sample pages of sprays.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed Daisy the most; and, so, I bought it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I already knew that I enjoyed Daisy by Marc Jacobs. I just found it to be a very good deal getting it at a better price on Amazon than in a department store.</li>
            <li> Wonderful value and excellent service! Will purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous, pump works, and was actually a good deal when you price it against other stores.</li>
            <li> good product. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order this after reading some reviews that the product received was *not* of the same quality as Sephora or a department store, or that the scent didn&#x27;t last. However, after receiving this (quickly, might I add) I&#x27;m happy I saved the money and ordered from Amazon. It was wrapped and in original packaging. Hours after putting it on, I went to a party, and after a bit my friend said, &amp;#34;Someone in here is wearing Daisy by Marc Jacobs&amp;#34; . So yes, authentic and lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li> This product is great and my wife loves it as do I. Smells great and was here in a timely manner. Definitely will be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Aunt loved it great gift and smells great also.</li>
            <li> item as described, excellent! Great buy! would purchase from seller again. Prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle were slightly bigger, but I am very happy with the smell of this perfume. It came well packaged and on time for Christmas as promised. Of course, as with any perfume this will smell differently on different people, but for us it works great!</li>
            <li> shipping was fast but the product was watered down. My wife said that the sent didnt stay on that long. I took the item to a department store and the sent and color of the Daisy in the store was much stronger and darker.</li>
            <li> It was shipped to me in less than a week. I love this frangrance. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, soft and clean lovely scent with a faint, fragrant note of sweet violets blooming on a sunny day.  It makes the cloudiest days seem a little brighter and is an amazing value for the 3.4 oz size.  I will definitely re-purchase this only from Amazon in the future for as long as it&#x27;s available.  It&#x27;s almost like getting two bottles for the price of  one and is the real deal, not a cheap imitation knock-off.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> HAS A REALLY NICE SMELL . NOT OVER POWERING LIKE MOST . WOULD BUY AGAIN OR AS A GIFT TO FRIENDS</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.  What else can you say about a perfume?  Oh, she hates the bottle but I think it&#x27;s cool.  I mean, it&#x27;s a daisy, like the name says.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and I have purchased this item twice before so..obviously Ilove it!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  The price was great and delivery was timely.</li>
            <li> Great price for a known product</li>
            <li> Great gift for my wife. She loved it.</li>
            <li> This is perfume... it smells good.  It looked like it might have been a sample and was a little short.  The bottle is definitely not full, but not low enough to return.</li>
            <li> beautiful aroma, nice price</li>
            <li> These things are great! I got two of them, and they are very high-quality whistles. They seem to do the trick.</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVES IT. MAKES IT GREAT WITH ME.</li>
            <li> I adore this perfume! It&#x27;s a fresh, subtle, and feminine scent that any woman can wear. I love it for Spring &amp; Summer, but you could definitely wear this in all 4 seasons if you want. I prefer to wear this during the Day, since it&#x27;s not so heavy. Absolutely no complaints with this product. It came in great packaging, and it was still wrapped in the original plastic and box. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter. This is the only scent that she wears. it&#x27;s not overpowering and lasts all day. this bottle lasts well over a year.</li>
            <li> Loved this. Ordered after a individual we were helping out stayed with us and she had a bottle.</li>
            <li> Has become the favorite perfume that my wife wears.  Not strong and fades after a while but got a very pleasant floral bouquet that is great for every day use.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing these for years and as long as they are completed the same way.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> great cost, and smells awesome. Originally $89.00 at any beauty retailer such as sephora or ULTA and got it for way less here.</li>
            <li> LOVE ITLOVLOVE ITE ITLOVE ITLOVE ~~~~ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE IT~~~~LOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE REALLY LIKE THIS SMELLY, GIRLS BEST CHOICE!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 25 year old daughter. This is her favorite scent! I got it on Amazon because it was a significant savings. I bought her several other very expensive gifts along with this for Christmas but she squealed when she opened the perfume! She said she just ran out. This is her signature scent. The scent is light and girlie! Love love love this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m very please with my order. This perfume is just like the ones at Macy&#x60;s for a better  price,  shipping was fast than stated. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> great smell but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I have purchased it twice from here, and both times it has been perfect. Love it!</li>
            <li> I literally get compliments every time I wear this perfumes. It&#x27;s a great scent. I love that it&#x27;s not strong, loud and overwhelming. It smells fresh and airy. Love it!</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t durability or smell.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Wife, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!!!  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my daughter loves it also, so she is getting one for Christmas!!</li>
            <li> Daughter LOVES this perfume!</li>
            <li> Happy wife happy life</li>
            <li> Love it, delivery was fast as well</li>
            <li> Best bang for your buck</li>
            <li> My favorite scent and amazon has by far the cheapest price.</li>
            <li> Daisy is a lighter fragrance than many on the market currently. Clean and pretty, not heavy or overpowering. An incident sums it up: when I went through the check out line at a grocery store, the cashier said, &amp;#34;You smell wonderful! Thank you!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The right product at a great price and delivered when promised!  Very pleased customer!</li>
            <li> love the smell, smells fresh! That what exactly I am thinking before. And the price is much cheaper than store!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. The only thing I will change next time is the size. It is very difficult to hold it is so big. I will pay a little extra for the smaller bottle to be able to hold it more comfortably, And I don&#x27;t mean pay extra, I mean not get a better deal by buying the big bottle for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;And it is the real perfume. I was worried it would not be, being from a \\&quot;discount\\&quot; place. But it is.</li>
            <li> My son bought it for his girlfriend for Christmas.  It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Smells good!  Probably could have purchased the 1/7oz bottle.  3/4oz is more than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice bottle with nifty fake daisys on the top.</li>
            <li> got it for my mom as a x-mas present - she loved it! very sweet smell, fruity and not overbearing....better for younger woman though - 18-40</li>
            <li> Smells good-but does not last-----at all:( bummer</li>
            <li> Great deal and large bottle for the money</li>
            <li> My wife was surprised.... and I became a VERY happy man ;)</li>
            <li> Smells so great. This is my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift and she loved it. There are two different scents and she like the other scent as well but seems to wear this one a little more. The smell is great not to strong to where it is over powering but still has great lasting effect on the room when she leaves. Will buy Marc Jacobs perfume in the future</li>
            <li> Great Product and the price beats all department stores.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents of all time. It&#x27;s very light and fresh. The scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The scent is simple and splendid. Feels like I&#x27;m in love all over again when my wife puts it on.</li>
            <li> I was given this fragrance as a gift. It may have been the first bottle of perfume I ever finished!  It is a lovely, fresh scent.  I don&#x27;t usually buy perfume for myself, but this time I bought another bottle!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Valentines day, she loves it!!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Great Buy.</li>
            <li> Love this and its a big bottle. bought this awhile ago and not even half way through it. Smells great and isn&#x27;t fake</li>
            <li> When she wears it, I wanna do her</li>
            <li> My Mother and Grandmother, like many, love perfume, and my Mother is a bit of a connoisseur- Subjective, I know.  But this fragrance really seems to please her.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good gift for Mom or (Great)Grandma, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift.  I have not heard any negative feedback from recipient.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this for her side chick, she seemed to like it, but thirsty girls like anything.</li>
            <li> My 20 yr old, who is extremely fickle and changes her mind about everything, has been wearing this as &amp;#34;her scent&amp;#34; for quite awhile.  Really very nice.  Not only for young ladies - would appeal to any age.  Classy scent (not a cheap drug store variety) and decorative bottle looks nice on the dresser!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping,  arrived in great condition. And I love this perfume!  Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This is a rich smelling perfume.  I like having more than 1 good perfume so that I can vary my choice, and now I have 2.  Good quality and the price is much better than our local high-end Department Store.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this perfume.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume! And love the price!</li>
            <li> This is a birthday gift - I am sure it will be very well received.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. $50 cheaper than Macys</li>
            <li> Marc Jacobs makes my favorite perfume scents. Daisy is my absolute favorite. When it comes to ordering it online I was a bit cautious, but the product was just as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this get so many compliments it&#x27;s the real deal!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It is cheaper than the official website but absolutely the same product! Ill recommend it to friends:)) and it smells fantastic^^</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing. Bought this for my girlfriend and it made her so enticing that she was easily able to cheat on me. Unfortunately when I smell this product now all I can smell is a traitorous harlot.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; great price! Also came very quickly which I loved because I had already run out of my last bottle.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful ! Love this</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister.  Unfortunately, the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work.  I will need to exchange this... Otherwise my sister loves the scent!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and liked it so much I bought one for me too. This was priced better than in the store and didn&#x27;t have to leave my home to get it.</li>
            <li> great product...Packaged well...</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this! I use this perfume for many years and always paid retail price for it. I was tired of spending $90+ on this decided to look elsewhere. I found it on amazon and decided to give it a shot. Arrived in packaging as in photo and is the real thing! It has a long lasting scent and is half the cost of apartment stores. Will order from again soon! thank you!</li>
            <li> Everything was handled perfectly. I have done this 4 years in a row now - no complaints.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it</li>
            <li> Just as description said, delivery was prompt and product was perfect and unopened</li>
            <li> Amazing authentic product at a great value!  She LOVED it and I will use this seller again!</li>
            <li> Got to me quickly. Wide loves the fragrance and the bottle!</li>
            <li> always receive complients when i wear this.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!  I gave it to my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!</li>
            <li> This was a present for my niece so she could smell like a daisy flower. A beautiful fragrance. We love it :)</li>
            <li> I love perfume and this is one of my favorites.  I found it cheaper here than on any other perfume website.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging &amp; smells great! My daughter loves it!!</li>
            <li> It came right away &amp; abosolutely love the scent.!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume. However the scent doesn&#x27;t last. Which that makes me think this is a fake because when I tried the perfume at sephora the scent lasted all day</li>
            <li> I have gone through 2 1/2 bottles of Daisy since it came out. I absolutely love the scent- not overpowering or obnoxious- it makes me keep smelling my shirt all day! However, the scent does not last that long on the skin. If it lasted longer, I would probably use Daisy for the rest of my life. A saleslady at Macy&#x27;s suggested the black bottle Daisy (parfum) and said it would be a longer lasting scent, but it was so different from the original scent and I didn&#x27;t buy it. The regular Daisy is yummy and I have yet to find another perfume that smells as yummy as this. But, Marc Jacobs: FIND A WAY TO MAKE THE SCENT LAST LONGER! That&#x27;s the only flaw in an otherwise perfect creation.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Best perfume the smells stays with u.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for mothers day and she loved it. Very happy with this purchase and not to mention it is way cheaper on amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product some time ago and just had the chance to open the box (as I&#x27;ve been using my previous bottle). The box seemed fine, but after I opened the box the bottle was definately different from the original bottle. I spreyed the parfume ı a hope that i smeels the same as the original one, but it didn&#x27;t. So I payed this amout of money on a fake parfume that doesn&#x27;t even smell the same. Suprizingly, I contacted the seller but they didn&#x27;t even replied to my e-mail yet. Bad product, bad seller bad everything. Don&#x27;t buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is not the real daisy by mac Jacobs. It is  watered down....it&#x27;s so ooh fakes. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Get it from macy&#x27;s or Sephora at JC  penny.</li>
            <li> Smells gross and infantile like baby powder. But it&#x27;s priced well and my mother likes it.</li>
            <li> Lovely smelling perfume</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for muy daughter un Christmas and she loves it. Better price than in the store. Great  purchase.</li>
            <li> But the only problem is that this scent just doesn&#x27;t last long enough on me. I have spent less money on scents that last all day without having to reapply. This one I have to reapply every 3-4 hrs and that is difficult because I don&#x27;t take the bottle with me when I go out. I love the light floral scent, but it isn&#x27;t worth the price if it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> The only word to describe my purchase is PERFECT!</li>
            <li> This is GREAT. I truly love the smell and so does many admirers.</li>
            <li> MY FAV Been wearing it for years and just can&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by accident. But I am keeping it because it is such a beautiful scent</li>
            <li> I gave this perfume to my daughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 3.4 oz bottle before and with 2 sprays a day the bottle lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted and smells heavenly. They also shipped it quick to my home. I have had experience before with ordering perfume online n it was not the scent I paid for and was disappointed but through amazon I had no issues. I would purchase again from them.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Marc Jacobs Daisy all the time, but had been hesitant to buy a new bottle recently because of the price. I found this online and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I also got a sample at Sephora to compare. The bottle I got from Amazon smells authentic to me, but is definitely not as strong as the perfume at Sephora, so it wears off pretty quickly. Might be worth it for the price if you&#x27;re looking for something faint, or don&#x27;t mind reapplying throughout the day.</li>
            <li> So I priced this perfume at Macys. For a 3.4 oz bottle you&#x27;re looking at paying close to $100. On Amazon it was $58 with FREE 2 day shipping. The scent is exactly the same as in the store. I would definitely recommend to all. I cannot tell you how my compliments that I&#x27;ve received. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this scent. I absolutely love it. Light, clean, fresh, slightly floral. Great scent for every day.</li>
            <li> awesome! this perfume is so expensive anywhere else and I was SOOOO glad to find it online for cheaper for the exact same quality you would find in a store! definitely will be buying again and would recommend to anyone who loves this perfume!</li>
            <li> Loveee the smell, love that the price was almost cut in half</li>
            <li> Got this for a Christmas present and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Not as good smelling as the Dot or Oh Lola.  It smells less clean and floral and a little more musky and formal.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, smells great and was packaged very nice</li>
            <li> Love it this perfume.  No problem.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s one that I replace the instant I use it up.  I&#x27;ve had people ask me what cologne I&#x27;m wearing when I&#x27;m out and about.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> One of my daughters favorite scents.</li>
            <li> It is such a beautiful light perfume. I used to purchase Tresor but this scent is better and less expensive. I will keep using Daisy in the future and I am willing to try their other scents</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves it</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital close to death my nurse was wearing Daisy fell in love with her and Daisy!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume!! It smells so good and lasts all day, I can smell it on myself from the time I put it on until the end of the day! Very good price and it comes in on time and in good shape. I love it! :)</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it!</li>
            <li> The product they sent me was not the real Marc Jacobs. It barely had a scent and after a few minutes you couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;smell anything. It was an inferior product and wanted to warn anyone else before they waste their money.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price ever found on the 3.4oz for this scent. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Good price!  Love this scent.  Lasts a long time!  Fast shipment!  The scent really lasts if you spray it on your clothing.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My mother is in love with fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like the smell. It is a good perfume for summer. It is not to strong but sweet.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I first had a small sample from Sephora, and decided I would like to invest in a real bottle. Amazing smell! And what a steal! Half of the price Sephora is sell it at ( $90 if I remember correctly). Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
            <li> This is a very fresh perfume and eventhough It&#x27;s an expensive one, it was cheaper than in any other place!</li>
            <li> Perfect! It is exactly what I was looking for. Quick delivery as well!</li>
            <li> Love my new perfume, was a Xmas gift from hubby, he did a good job picking this one, it is fresh and sweet and last all day!</li>
            <li> This was my scent before it was popular (I literally found it - only one - on the top row towards the back in a Sephora)! About 2 years later, it exploded! I was a little perturbed because I like to have a unique scent, but I can understand why so many like it - it&#x27;s light and smells not too flowery, not too herbal; not too musky; and not too &amp;#34;perfumy.&amp;#34; It is nicely understated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I made this purchase, it was around $57 which is MUCH less than what you&#x27;d pay elsewhere.</li>
            <li> If you are a person that enjoys compliments.&lt;br /&gt;This one is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those Winter Days and the Summer Daze, Daisy does.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  Too busy too return the item but would not buy any perfume from this cellar or at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;it does not last 15 mintes afer I put it on.I do not want to give it any star but it would not let me submit.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace my old bottle. Usually I go for something different the second time around. Not with Daisy. I&#x27;m still in love with the clean, sweet, yet sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li> Smells just like daisy however the scent does not last more than five secs after application, therefore I do not think this is authentic.</li>
            <li> There is something about this fragrance that literally just swept me off my feet. I tried the tester in the store on several occasions, and could not stop smelling my arm where I sprayed it. Feminine, pretty, and just makes me feel good when I wear it. The bottle looks absolutely adorable with the little soft daisies on the cap. I love it!</li>
            <li> My wife loved it and Amazon had the best price on the internet.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I imagined. Great price!</li>
            <li> I love Daisy and get a lot of compliments when I wear it. It lasts just as long as department store bought perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and felt this was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Really love this perfume on my wife.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for a daughter-in-law.  Shipment  received promptly, met expectations.</li>
            <li> Great price and great delivery service!!!</li>
            <li> I love to stock up on this when it&#x27;s cheap. I did it two years ago and I was running low. The cheap prices does not mean you are skipping out on quality. This is exactly the same item I would have spent $90 in a department store, so for the cost of one ish ($100) I got two. I will buy more to stock up!</li>
            <li> I love this!!!!  I buy this often!</li>
            <li> This made my niece very happy for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Working with Amazon is soo easy to find what you need, shipping very fast and easy. I highly reccommend Amazon.</li>
            <li> My girlfriends favorite fragrance...</li>
            <li> Love this product! I am not a huge perfume lover but this smell is heavenly and light. Definitely will purchase it over and over!</li>
            <li> I love it! Light smell, not a strong scent that makes you have a headache. Strangers asked many times what type of spray I have on. Good job Daisy!</li>
            <li> product arrived as expected.  Waiting on the packaging review request though. :)</li>
