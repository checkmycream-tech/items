            <li>Excited to see my lashes after 3 months if I&#x27;m already getting great results.</li>
            <li>Many of my own lashes came out with the extensions.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.  </li>
            <li>love  it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with what I see so far. :-)</li>
            <li>I also experienced some irritation when first used</li>
            <li>First it does work and works great.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and recommend it for others.  </li>
            <li>I did use it morning and night because I didn&#x27;t have any irritation from using it, so I&#x27;m sure that helped them grow faster.</li>
            <li>so well I need to order some more.</li>
            <li>I love Babe eyelash serum.</li>
            <li>Love the results.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I like rapid lash better .</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Helps lashes to stay healthy no breakage or fall out of lashes.</li>
            <li>, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Buy you will be glad you did:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know more after 3 more months.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to apply it at night, because it can cause irritation.</li>
            <li>This is my second review on this product and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>You can use it on top of makeup.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with what I am seeing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Love this, been using it for months and get lots of compliments</li>
            <li>I really, really love the results and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li>The best product for long eye lashes.</li>
            <li>You need to use it for three months to see the perfect and long eye lashes.</li>
            <li>Good product,  my eyelashes have some falling out constantly and have more length to the most!</li>
            <li>every other night and my lashes grew beautifully!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy you just put it on your eyelid before doing your makeup every day like you would eye liner.</li>
            <li>GREATTTTTTTTTTTTT PRODUCT, easy to use, and just a tip, if your eyebrows are sparse (like mine)</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Super bummer!</li>
            <li>Works quickly!  </li>
            <li>I had major doubt before using it myself but anyone that wants longer thicker lashes should most defiantly get it!!!</li>
            <li>I am SO happy that I can see very obvious results.</li>
            <li>Heard from a lot of people that it works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product &amp; I would buy it again since the benefit outweighed the side effect of irritation for me.</li>
            <li>I use it every night after I shower, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I tried professionally applied eyelash extensions and loved the look</li>
            <li>I originally bought it from my cosmetologist--for TWICE THE COST--SAME EXACT PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li>I am familiar with this product and it works wonders, but do not buy from this seller</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant difference in length and thickness in my lashes.</li>
            <li>but my lashes are significantly longer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original package.sincerely</li>
            <li>Bought originally at a salon but found it here on amazon cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have noticed her eyelashes have gotten significantly longer.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product at my hair salon for $65.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this almost every night for three months and my lashes are longer and more full than before I got my first set of extensions.</li>
            <li>and i was right!</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed my eyes turned BRIGHT red</li>
            <li>I received this faster than expected, packaged great, and after 4-5 weeks; it&#x27;s already WORKING!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was going to work, but I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>but it does take about 4-6 weeks to get full lashes.  </li>
            <li>Received item quick and have used it for 3 days as of today.</li>
            <li>u can use the the serum on them and your brows will also grow back in faster, a double win!!</li>
            <li>Works quickly; after just a week I noticed my lashes thickening and getting longer.</li>
            <li>If you want longer lashes that look healthy and curl I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my first tube (about 3 months now) and my lashes look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>great product really works my eye lashes are super long</li>
            <li>This stuff really works !!</li>
            <li>I love it so far!</li>
            <li>I love how simple and easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li>Her results were nothing short of amazing, so I have started using it also.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was worth a try.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results that I purchased several tubes to give as Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li>I originally got this from my salon, but saw it was much cheaper on here.  </li>
            <li>Original product/packaging, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I found three times a week is right for me, now that I have the length that I want.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first :) haven&#x27;t had issues with irritation, and I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A little soreness at first, but nothing major and the results for the first month were awesome.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how thick and beautiful they were.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t use it every day, but I have super sensitive eyes, but for the normal person you will LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my eye lashes &amp; eyebrows have thinned significantly.</li>
            <li>It is quick to put on in the morning and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>I really am amazed at how well it works!  </li>
            <li>Lashes grew randomly at first but give it time and hang in there.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any irritations with using this product and will probably be buying it again very soon!</li>
            <li>They got fuller first and then longer.  </li>
            <li>I first got it from my niece, who is an aesthetician (sp.??)</li>
            <li>My first tube lasted 6 mths.</li>
            <li>The product is OK however after applying it my eyes are so red for days,</li>
            <li>Bought my first Babe Lash from her, used it faithfully every day and</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference within the first week, and within two months everyone else noticed.  </li>
            <li>Oh and this works on the bottom lashes as well ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m starting to see some results.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for anyone needing longer, healthier lashes.... :)</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>first review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a substantial difference after the first month.</li>
            <li>I just ran out of my first 2 ml after 4 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8 weeks now and my lashes have grown so much!</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing good results on a few friends who use it.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>purchased them and low and behold, 4 weeks later my lashed had doubled in length, and looked amazingly fuller.  </li>
            <li>And this product is reasonably priced</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>but now people keep asking if they are my real eye lashes.</li>
            <li>and it really stung my eyes, yet continued using it with the hope I would acclimate.</li>
            <li>People think I lie about my lashes being real - they think I have extensions</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>,Your help would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that they weren&#x27;t falling out as much when using this product.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real Mascara and Holy moly</li>
            <li>and my eyelashes started breaking but didn&#x27;t want to shell out the high cost of latisse again so tried this!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to finish up the whole tube.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference on my lashes.</li>
            <li>I have always had very thin,and sparce lashes, (</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend this product to those who don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of time (and money) getting their lashes done.</li>
            <li>But this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>But after 3 months I really notice a difference and so do others.</li>
            <li>I am really hoping this product helps</li>
            <li>This product made my eyelids swell and become very tender.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want the maintenance and the expense.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works as promised.  </li>
            <li>I have really fast growing hair</li>
            <li>so maybe this just worked faster on me than it would for others, but I really noticed a difference with just 3 weeks of use</li>
            <li>but i thought if it really did work i would be ablt to see the results without a before and after...</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>Never having that problem until now thanks to Babe Lash.</li>
            <li>I have also stopped using false lashes, so I think that it is also important to be kind to your lashes if you want them to do well with this product.</li>
            <li>After three months they were nice and long, and I only use the product once or twice a week as maintenance.</li>
            <li>My real lashes were so damaged and super short.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wear moisturizer on lids, slight dryness occurs as a result of application.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday now and I am seeing such good results.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure they are curled almost every day to keep them out of my vision, but not a problem for me and only take an extra couple minutes in the morning.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t react to much of anything and am not allergic to much, so that surprised me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and this seller as well.</li>
            <li>They were asking an incredibly high price for the conditioner serum and the mascara as a set</li>
            <li>and I high recommend it for anyone whose trying to grow out their lashes</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Half the price of the other lash serum I was using, but just as effective!</li>
            <li>and I noticed that her eyelashes looked amazingly long and full.  </li>
            <li>and I have full and long lashes</li>
            <li>I had an extreme reaction to this product which is not supposed to happen as this is &amp;#34;the most sensitive serum on the market&amp;#34; i nearly had to go to the hospital because my eyes got so swollen</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are super long now.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>My lashes have grown longer and it even seems that it works for making new lashes grow also.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are super long!</li>
            <li>PS - my eyelids did get pink and itched at first, but I continued, and have had no ill effects.</li>
            <li>My real lashes look BETTER than the fake ones with just one quick coat of any mascara.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you love full, thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised to find I already see results!  </li>
            <li>I am on the third tube but a noticeable difference in length and thickness after the first three months of use .</li>
            <li>Recommended from a reliable friend so anticipating lush lashes!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for things, but I love reading them to see what others think.</li>
            <li>but so far this seems to be working!</li>
            <li>actually bought this product from my hairdresser first and have been using it since Aug 2014.  </li>
            <li>the first several times I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using it every night for about another month or two so that I can see the full potential of results after one or two entire growth cycles of my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I especially get positive comments when I pair it with the 2-in-1 mascara/fibers.</li>
            <li>There was slight itching when I first used it (like the first week), but this subsided.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how fast it worked on others, but using it almost every night, in about 2 1/2 months I saw a significant boost in both length and thickness.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint with Babe Lash is it makes my eyes slightly itchy but not enough to deter me from using the product as I am very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>It took about a month and a half to start seeing significant results.</li>
            <li>I think there are some nights I may have put too much on because the next day my eyes are a little red and irritated, but most of the time I don&#x27;t have any irritation.</li>
            <li>Plus $40/every three months is amazing compared to those fake lashes that damage your real lashes.</li>
            <li>With this lash serum, however, I can see after about 8 weeks of applying it as directed every night that so far about 1/3 of my lashes are much longer, starting to look fuller, and even perhaps a tad darker.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes, but I do not experience any redness or irritation from this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because it really irritates my eyes</li>
            <li>My lid became sensitive and discolored.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and it really works.</li>
            <li>It really helped me get my lashes back to where I wanted them to be!I could tell a difference in about three weeks.</li>
            <li>but after about 6 weeks of daily use I started seeing real results.</li>
            <li>I have had this product for three weeks and nothing so far .</li>
            <li>so I cant say that I am sensitive.</li>
            <li>Babe Lash has considerably thickened and lengthened my lashes.</li>
            <li>and I remembered that I had seen that Amazon had the same two items at a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even noticed that they curl up naturally now</li>
            <li>and I see a major difference!</li>
            <li>I was leary, concerned that it might be expired, but the date on the bottom of the tube proved it safe for long past</li>
            <li>After desired results I use it every other day (and sometimes I forget) and my lashes are still pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference about a month later and my lashes longer, fuller and curled abit naturally!</li>
            <li>You know that problem more blessed friends talk about of how their lashes are so long they hit their sunglasses (OHHHH so sad, right).</li>
            <li>I was a little sensitive to it for the first week</li>
            <li>Your lashes get soooooooooo long and soft its UNREAL!!</li>
            <li>My lashes seemed the same one night, but the next morning, WOW!!  </li>
            <li>It generally takes approx 3 wks to see results</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin though, but this product totally works.  </li>
            <li>They barely held any mascara.</li>
            <li>Initially the results are amazing , but eventually your lashes become too long and weak and fall out.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it did cause some irritation (pink and itchy skin, very bloodshot eyes)</li>
            <li>I had a little irritation the first three days.</li>
            <li>I am a 64 yr old woman with long but thinning lashes which are now filling in</li>
            <li>It did irritate my eyes the first few weeks</li>
            <li>The first 2-3 weeks of using it, my eyes were red for about an hour or two after waking up from and they were also a little itchy, however, I kept using it</li>
            <li>My new problem is that mascara gets on the area beneath my eyes, because the lashes are so long!!!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use it everyday, otherwise the results are less than expected.</li>

            <li> Excited to see my lashes after 3 months if I&#x27;m already getting great results.</li>
            <li> Many of my own lashes came out with the extensions.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.  </li>
            <li> love  it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with what I see so far. :-)</li>
            <li> I also experienced some irritation when first used</li>
            <li> First it does work and works great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and recommend it for others.  </li>
            <li> I did use it morning and night because I didn&#x27;t have any irritation from using it, so I&#x27;m sure that helped them grow faster.</li>
            <li> so well I need to order some more.</li>
            <li> I love Babe eyelash serum.</li>
            <li> Love the results.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I like rapid lash better .</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Helps lashes to stay healthy no breakage or fall out of lashes.</li>
            <li> , I love it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Buy you will be glad you did:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know more after 3 more months.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to apply it at night, because it can cause irritation.</li>
            <li> This is my second review on this product and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> You can use it on top of makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with what I am seeing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Love this, been using it for months and get lots of compliments</li>
            <li> I really, really love the results and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li> The best product for long eye lashes.</li>
            <li> You need to use it for three months to see the perfect and long eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Good product,  my eyelashes have some falling out constantly and have more length to the most!</li>
            <li> every other night and my lashes grew beautifully!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy you just put it on your eyelid before doing your makeup every day like you would eye liner.</li>
            <li> GREATTTTTTTTTTTTT PRODUCT, easy to use, and just a tip, if your eyebrows are sparse (like mine)</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Super bummer!</li>
            <li> Works quickly!  </li>
            <li> I had major doubt before using it myself but anyone that wants longer thicker lashes should most defiantly get it!!!</li>
            <li> I am SO happy that I can see very obvious results.</li>
            <li> Heard from a lot of people that it works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product &amp; I would buy it again since the benefit outweighed the side effect of irritation for me.</li>
            <li> I use it every night after I shower, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I tried professionally applied eyelash extensions and loved the look</li>
            <li> I originally bought it from my cosmetologist--for TWICE THE COST--SAME EXACT PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I am familiar with this product and it works wonders, but do not buy from this seller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I have seen a significant difference in length and thickness in my lashes.</li>
            <li> but my lashes are significantly longer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original package.sincerely</li>
            <li> Bought originally at a salon but found it here on amazon cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have noticed her eyelashes have gotten significantly longer.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at my hair salon for $65.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost every night for three months and my lashes are longer and more full than before I got my first set of extensions.</li>
            <li> and i was right!</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed my eyes turned BRIGHT red</li>
            <li> I received this faster than expected, packaged great, and after 4-5 weeks; it&#x27;s already WORKING!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was going to work, but I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> but it does take about 4-6 weeks to get full lashes.  </li>
            <li> Received item quick and have used it for 3 days as of today.</li>
            <li> u can use the the serum on them and your brows will also grow back in faster, a double win!!</li>
            <li> Works quickly; after just a week I noticed my lashes thickening and getting longer.</li>
            <li> If you want longer lashes that look healthy and curl I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my first tube (about 3 months now) and my lashes look fantastic.  </li>
            <li> great product really works my eye lashes are super long</li>
            <li> This stuff really works !!</li>
            <li> I love it so far!</li>
            <li> I love how simple and easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li> Her results were nothing short of amazing, so I have started using it also.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results that I purchased several tubes to give as Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li> I originally got this from my salon, but saw it was much cheaper on here.  </li>
            <li> Original product/packaging, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I found three times a week is right for me, now that I have the length that I want.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a first :) haven&#x27;t had issues with irritation, and I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A little soreness at first, but nothing major and the results for the first month were awesome.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe how thick and beautiful they were.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use it every day, but I have super sensitive eyes, but for the normal person you will LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my eye lashes &amp; eyebrows have thinned significantly.</li>
            <li> It is quick to put on in the morning and dries fast.  </li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> I really am amazed at how well it works!  </li>
            <li> Lashes grew randomly at first but give it time and hang in there.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any irritations with using this product and will probably be buying it again very soon!</li>
            <li> They got fuller first and then longer.  </li>
            <li> I first got it from my niece, who is an aesthetician (sp.??)</li>
            <li> My first tube lasted 6 mths.</li>
            <li> The product is OK however after applying it my eyes are so red for days,</li>
            <li> Bought my first Babe Lash from her, used it faithfully every day and</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within the first week, and within two months everyone else noticed.  </li>
            <li> Oh and this works on the bottom lashes as well ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m starting to see some results.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for anyone needing longer, healthier lashes.... :)</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> first review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a substantial difference after the first month.</li>
            <li> I just ran out of my first 2 ml after 4 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8 weeks now and my lashes have grown so much!</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing good results on a few friends who use it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> purchased them and low and behold, 4 weeks later my lashed had doubled in length, and looked amazingly fuller.  </li>
            <li> And this product is reasonably priced</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> but now people keep asking if they are my real eye lashes.</li>
            <li> and it really stung my eyes, yet continued using it with the hope I would acclimate.</li>
            <li> People think I lie about my lashes being real - they think I have extensions</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> ,Your help would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that they weren&#x27;t falling out as much when using this product.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real Mascara and Holy moly</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes started breaking but didn&#x27;t want to shell out the high cost of latisse again so tried this!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to finish up the whole tube.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have always had very thin,and sparce lashes, (</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend this product to those who don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of time (and money) getting their lashes done.</li>
            <li> But this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> But after 3 months I really notice a difference and so do others.</li>
            <li> I am really hoping this product helps</li>
            <li> This product made my eyelids swell and become very tender.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want the maintenance and the expense.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works as promised.  </li>
            <li> I have really fast growing hair</li>
            <li> so maybe this just worked faster on me than it would for others, but I really noticed a difference with just 3 weeks of use</li>
            <li> but i thought if it really did work i would be ablt to see the results without a before and after...</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> Never having that problem until now thanks to Babe Lash.</li>
            <li> I have also stopped using false lashes, so I think that it is also important to be kind to your lashes if you want them to do well with this product.</li>
            <li> After three months they were nice and long, and I only use the product once or twice a week as maintenance.</li>
            <li> My real lashes were so damaged and super short.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wear moisturizer on lids, slight dryness occurs as a result of application.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday now and I am seeing such good results.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure they are curled almost every day to keep them out of my vision, but not a problem for me and only take an extra couple minutes in the morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t react to much of anything and am not allergic to much, so that surprised me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and this seller as well.</li>
            <li> They were asking an incredibly high price for the conditioner serum and the mascara as a set</li>
            <li> and I high recommend it for anyone whose trying to grow out their lashes</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Half the price of the other lash serum I was using, but just as effective!</li>
            <li> and I noticed that her eyelashes looked amazingly long and full.  </li>
            <li> and I have full and long lashes</li>
            <li> I had an extreme reaction to this product which is not supposed to happen as this is &amp;#34;the most sensitive serum on the market&amp;#34; i nearly had to go to the hospital because my eyes got so swollen</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are super long now.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> My lashes have grown longer and it even seems that it works for making new lashes grow also.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are super long!</li>
            <li> PS - my eyelids did get pink and itched at first, but I continued, and have had no ill effects.</li>
            <li> My real lashes look BETTER than the fake ones with just one quick coat of any mascara.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you love full, thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised to find I already see results!  </li>
            <li> I am on the third tube but a noticeable difference in length and thickness after the first three months of use .</li>
            <li> Recommended from a reliable friend so anticipating lush lashes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for things, but I love reading them to see what others think.</li>
            <li> but so far this seems to be working!</li>
            <li> actually bought this product from my hairdresser first and have been using it since Aug 2014.  </li>
            <li> the first several times I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using it every night for about another month or two so that I can see the full potential of results after one or two entire growth cycles of my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially get positive comments when I pair it with the 2-in-1 mascara/fibers.</li>
            <li> There was slight itching when I first used it (like the first week), but this subsided.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how fast it worked on others, but using it almost every night, in about 2 1/2 months I saw a significant boost in both length and thickness.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint with Babe Lash is it makes my eyes slightly itchy but not enough to deter me from using the product as I am very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> It took about a month and a half to start seeing significant results.</li>
            <li> I think there are some nights I may have put too much on because the next day my eyes are a little red and irritated, but most of the time I don&#x27;t have any irritation.</li>
            <li> Plus $40/every three months is amazing compared to those fake lashes that damage your real lashes.</li>
            <li> With this lash serum, however, I can see after about 8 weeks of applying it as directed every night that so far about 1/3 of my lashes are much longer, starting to look fuller, and even perhaps a tad darker.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes, but I do not experience any redness or irritation from this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because it really irritates my eyes</li>
            <li> My lid became sensitive and discolored.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and it really works.</li>
            <li> It really helped me get my lashes back to where I wanted them to be!I could tell a difference in about three weeks.</li>
            <li> but after about 6 weeks of daily use I started seeing real results.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for three weeks and nothing so far .</li>
            <li> so I cant say that I am sensitive.</li>
            <li> Babe Lash has considerably thickened and lengthened my lashes.</li>
            <li> and I remembered that I had seen that Amazon had the same two items at a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed that they curl up naturally now</li>
            <li> and I see a major difference!</li>
            <li> I was leary, concerned that it might be expired, but the date on the bottom of the tube proved it safe for long past</li>
            <li> After desired results I use it every other day (and sometimes I forget) and my lashes are still pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference about a month later and my lashes longer, fuller and curled abit naturally!</li>
            <li> You know that problem more blessed friends talk about of how their lashes are so long they hit their sunglasses (OHHHH so sad, right).</li>
            <li> I was a little sensitive to it for the first week</li>
            <li> Your lashes get soooooooooo long and soft its UNREAL!!</li>
            <li> My lashes seemed the same one night, but the next morning, WOW!!  </li>
            <li> It generally takes approx 3 wks to see results</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin though, but this product totally works.  </li>
            <li> They barely held any mascara.</li>
            <li> Initially the results are amazing , but eventually your lashes become too long and weak and fall out.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it did cause some irritation (pink and itchy skin, very bloodshot eyes)</li>
            <li> I had a little irritation the first three days.</li>
            <li> I am a 64 yr old woman with long but thinning lashes which are now filling in</li>
            <li> It did irritate my eyes the first few weeks</li>
            <li> The first 2-3 weeks of using it, my eyes were red for about an hour or two after waking up from and they were also a little itchy, however, I kept using it</li>
            <li> My new problem is that mascara gets on the area beneath my eyes, because the lashes are so long!!!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use it everyday, otherwise the results are less than expected.</li>
            <li> I had a little irritation, but I have learned that you really must let the product dry before fully opening your eye.  </li>
            <li> After using only a week I noticed long lashes.</li>
            <li> I have some tiny lashes growing at the corners of my eye where lashes don&#x27;t normally grow-so a little goes along way!</li>
            <li> I now have very LONG upper and lower lashes.</li>
            <li> I noticed once I reached my desired length of lashes, I used it less frequently.</li>
            <li> It took about 6 weeks for the first round to show improvement, but then, suddenly, my eyelashes are almost twice as long as they previously were.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes were really short due to the extensions but they are growing and I look forward to using this product for the next couple of months to see what happens.</li>
            <li> Before I started this my lashes were in pretty bad shape because I have been using false lashes a lot and my own lashes were short and sparse.</li>
            <li> I had visibly longer lashes after about a month, even though I&#x27;m forgetful and usually only apply it about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> One of them stopped using it, because her lashes were getting too long</li>
            <li> you have these amazingly long lashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are really long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments about my long lashes, so I figure it must be working.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes grew really long.</li>
            <li> Long.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expected time to last.  </li>
            <li> Soooo she used this and 4 weeks later HOLY COW, her lashes are so long</li>
            <li> After 6-8 weeks of using BABE, my lashes are almost as long as my extensions were!  </li>
            <li> Also there was a short period of time where some lashes were growing faster than others but they all caught up to each other.</li>
            <li> and they are getting almost too long!</li>
            <li> It took approximately 3 month to really see the final improvement...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as to whether it would work as well as LiLash, because that is the only lash lengthener I&#x27;ve ever had success with.  </li>
            <li> I had a friend who like myself, had pretty long lashes to being with but was tired of wearing falsies.</li>
            <li> It works but it made my eyelids darken and it left a dark mark on my waterline</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands of lash serums (Loreal, Revlon, etc) and never really noticed a difference in length, fullness, or anything.</li>
            <li> I received an order and my serum was dry!</li>
            <li> Slight irritation initially.</li>
            <li> They became very irritated and dry, and looked like I was a crazed, exhausted, drug addict.</li>
            <li> I also use my blow dryer on low for just a few seconds to dry the product before fully opening my eye.  </li>
            <li> and it was a little red, but just like anything that you put in your eye</li>
            <li> I am constantly asked if they are my real eyelashes or fake and what type do I use.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My eyes became red, itchy, and heavy.</li>
            <li> Used Thomas and Roth serum from Sephora about 6 months ago and saw absolutely no change at all.</li>
            <li> Only been a few days.</li>
            <li> My friend used it for years and said her eyelids were turning pink</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have grown like crazy especially after using it consistently for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results for weeks</li>
            <li> I am guilty of forgetting a lot ;-)</li>
            <li> I have used other serums before and never had sensitivity</li>
            <li> burning like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The leaflet says you need to continue use (about every other day)</li>
            <li> My skin and eyes no longer get as irritated now, just some slight pink on my eyelids some mornings.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it really works.  </li>
            <li> After letting the extensions fall out my natural lashes were sparse and thin..</li>
            <li> I do have a history of sensitive eyes - but that is not uncommon.  </li>
            <li> I have had other ladies ask and now they too are using babe lash!</li>
            <li> sometimes you get sucked into buying a product because of the claims and it turns out to be, not only disappointing, but a complete fraud....</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month and a half ago for I was considering getting eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> I ordered Babe lash and used it every other day for 4 weeks and my lash length has increased about 3/4 of a half inch!  </li>
            <li> (and they are never bright red)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had extensions and used false eye lashes and was too scared to try other serums of fear to change my eye color from blue to brown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products in the past and have never seen any growth in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I can already see my lashes are a little longer, and they seem stronger because they are not falling out when I remove my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Longer lashes and a little fuller.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ridiculous how long their lashes are.</li>
            <li> and she was having trouble wearing sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday and after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see results for a few weeks but with consistency results will come.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> However, I knew that I would have  to go in every few weeks to have a fill done.</li>
            <li> I was left with thin, sparse lashes.  </li>
            <li> In a few weeks I noticed results.  </li>
            <li> Slightly irritated the eyes, but I took a picture before and after 3 months!</li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions for a long time but eventually got tired of the upkeep.</li>
            <li> As I have aged I noticed my eyelashes were beginning to thin and there seem to be no length to them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to rate this..</li>
            <li> I had to change mascara because my lashes were too fake looking for my personal taste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually rates items I purchase, but thought I should on this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this made my daughters eyes VERY red, so she had to discontinue using after 2 applications.</li>
            <li> The questions above are irrelevant to this product.</li>
            <li> Now two and a half months later people ask me if I have fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I do use mascara because my lashes are very pale, but the length is all from Babe Lash.</li>
            <li> You have to apply it carefully as the brush is thin and made thin so you can get on your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> My lashes have grown at least 50% longer</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> My lashes look a lot longer and fuller than they have in the past!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m seeing small progress!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting or anything weird like some other brands either.</li>
            <li> Was fully gone after a few days but a total loss of $35 :(</li>
            <li> Recently I have noticed one eye feeling &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; shut in the morning like a bad allergy.  </li>
            <li> then suddenly ur lashes start growing like crazy!</li>
            <li> Con my eyes reacted to it and got red and puffy. :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to trim them and very thick.  </li>
            <li> Babe Lash is my secret weapon.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical, but figured I could at least give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Everyone thinks I have false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Seriously it works!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> For me it did sometimes cause a little irritation, but nothing painful or concerning.</li>
            <li> No need for difficult extentions.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a week of using it, my eyes got so itchy</li>
            <li> I used to get fake lashes on and it was too expensive and time consuming.</li>
            <li> but my lashes look fake now</li>
            <li> I have 4 friends that had been using it for 3 months and their eye lashes looked fake...</li>
            <li> I had very thin lashes</li>
            <li> I want my money back:( very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lashes like crazy.</li>
            <li> It got to a point where I was afraid I would lose all of my lashes.</li>
            <li> Am sad to discontinue use but an eye infection is not something to be ignored!</li>
            <li> sad day:(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to it!</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to using Babe Lash after using it once a day for 2 weeks..</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> a makeup artist and women come in all the time with lash extensions that look spidery and fake and horrible.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I work with ask me if I had fake lashes!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this after seeing good results on a few friends who use it. I have extremely sensitive eyes, but I do not experience any redness or irritation from this product. I had visibly longer lashes after about a month, even though I&#x27;m forgetful and usually only apply it about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Only been 6 weeks I cant tell yet.</li>
            <li> sometimes you get sucked into buying a product because of the claims and it turns out to be, not only disappointing, but a complete fraud....BUT this product works.  My eye lashes are 50% thicker and 25% longer (my estimates)  My new problem is that mascara gets on the area beneath my eyes, because the lashes are so long!!!  It took approximately 3 month to really see the final improvement...so it takes dedication, but the results are remarkable.  And this product is reasonably priced so I can continue using it.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know if you can use this of youre breastfeeding?</li>
            <li> It works but it made my eyelids darken and it left a dark mark on my waterline</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING and works like I&#x27;ve never seen anything else work. I have 2 friends that have been using this product for several months and it&#x27;s ridiculous how long their lashes are. One of them stopped using it, because her lashes were getting too long and she was having trouble wearing sunglasses. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because it really irritates my eyes so I can&#x27;t use it every day, but I have super sensitive eyes, but for the normal person you will LOVE this product. I will tell you it takes several weeks to see results, but then it&#x27;s like overnight you have these amazingly long lashes. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for 1 month and my eyelashes are growing.  Prior to using this product I had been getting lash extensions.  After discontinuing the extensions I started using Babe Lash.  My eyelashes were really short due to the extensions but they are growing and I look forward to using this product for the next couple of months to see what happens.</li>
            <li> It works but you can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> This really works. It took about 2 months of daily use, and I had just about given up and seemingly overnight: boom. Lashes like crazy. I estimate a 25% increase in length, maybe 15-20% increase in fullness.  My tube lasted me 4 months.  Good stuff, very happy.</li>
            <li> Really works!  Slightly irritated the eyes, but I took a picture before and after 3 months! Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time buying this product.  I absolutely love it and recommend it for others.  You have to apply it carefully as the brush is thin and made thin so you can get on your eyelashes.  I have brushed it in my eye and it was a little red, but just like anything that you put in your eye will irritate it.  My eyelashes have grown since I have started using this in December.  My friend who recommend this to me has had to Trim her Eyelashes.  I am constantly asked if they are my real eyelashes or fake and what type do I use.  I don&#x27;t use it at night because I found that when you toss and turn you can rub against the pillow or sheets and you will find your eyes irritated in the morning and possibly red.  When I first started using it I was using 2x&#x27;s a day now I only use maybe 2 or 3 times a week.  My husband says my eyelashes have grown like they are on steroids!</li>
            <li> This product really works!  I had eyelash extensions for 9 months and had to have them removed because of irritation. My real lashes were so damaged and super short. After 6-8 weeks of using BABE, my lashes are almost as long as my extensions were!  I really am amazed at how well it works!  I did use it morning and night because I didn&#x27;t have any irritation from using it, so I&#x27;m sure that helped them grow faster. Great product!</li>
            <li> Babe lashes is awesome, my packet came in at perfect timing.</li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS!!! I originally bought it from my cosmetologist--for TWICE THE COST--SAME EXACT PRODUCT!! I love it! As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my eye lashes &amp; eyebrows have thinned significantly. I saw results in about 3wks. I had younger people I work with ask me if I had fake lashes!! Proof is in the pudding!!!</li>
            <li> It actually helps! I used it everyday and after 2 weeks, i could tell that my lashes were getting darker and fuller! I use it everyday now and I am seeing such good results.</li>
            <li> Avoid this seller! I received an order and my serum was dry! No effect after a month of use. I am familiar with this product and it works wonders, but do not buy from this seller</li>
            <li> Definate results! Took about 3 months but now people keep asking if they are my real eye lashes.</li>
            <li> love  it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> I also experienced some irritation when first used but I have been using it for a year now and my lashes are amazing.  I get compliments on them all the time.  I have extremely blonde lashes and I also dye them.</li>
            <li> I like it so well I need to order some more. It has definitely made a difference in my eyelashes. They&#x27;re longer than they were before I started using it.</li>
            <li> I tried this and it really stung my eyes, yet continued using it with the hope I would acclimate. I immediately noticed my eyes turned BRIGHT red (and they are never bright red)! They became very irritated and dry, and looked like I was a crazed, exhausted, drug addict. Such a waste of money. In the trash it went. As I&#x27;m typing, my eyes are still recovering....</li>
            <li> Love it! Great results.</li>
            <li> This totally made my lashes grow but after a while the serum irritated my eyes.  I have sensitive skin though, but this product totally works.  It take about 3 months to start seeing fuller lashes.  Lashes grew randomly at first but give it time and hang in there.  It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> My lashes are definitely longer.</li>
            <li> I love it ! After 3wks I saw a difference in my lashes, they were thicker &amp; appearing longer.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments all the time. My lashes literally go beyond my eyebrows. People think I lie about my lashes being real - they think I have extensions but I don&#x27;t! Babe Lash is my secret weapon. I&#x27;ve been using it since November. I&#x27;ve had to buy it twice. It did irritate my eyes the first few weeks but I got used to it. I now only have to use it three times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about everything out there from Latisse to eyelash extensions. This stuff really works. I have seen a significant difference in length and thickness in my lashes. I even think they look shinier. I would never leave the house without mascara and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about it. You can&#x27;t beat the price and this bottle has lasted over 3 months. It took about a month and a half to start seeing significant results. Also there was a short period of time where some lashes were growing faster than others but they all caught up to each other. I would highly recommend this product if you love full, thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was going to work, but I thought I would give it a try. Pleasantly surprised to find I already see results!  Especially when I put on mascara, my eyelashes definitely look longer. I&#x27;ve even had someone say my eyelashes were noticeable. That&#x27;s a first :) haven&#x27;t had issues with irritation, and I have fairly sensitive skin. I put it on once at night before bed. I recommend this one!</li>
            <li> took a while but my lashes are significantly longer. my girlfriend ordered it and now her lashes are amazing!</li>
            <li> out of all the lash serums I&#x27;ve tried - and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all - this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Stuff really works.  No need for difficult extentions.  Just use this product.</li>
            <li> It is working really good for me.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love my babelash!! People ask me all the time if I get lash extensions!</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to using Babe Lash after using it once a day for 2 weeks.. My lid became sensitive and discolored.I would like to have the opportunity of returning the tube in it&#x27;s original package.sincerely,Your help would be appreciated. esther gordon(ezg123@aol.com)</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I had been using this product consistently for a couple of months before reviewing it, and I&#x27;m very pleased that I did because it works great! I have tried several other brands of lash serums (Loreal, Revlon, etc) and never really noticed a difference in length, fullness, or anything. With this lash serum, however, I can see after about 8 weeks of applying it as directed every night that so far about 1/3 of my lashes are much longer, starting to look fuller, and even perhaps a tad darker. I am SO happy that I can see very obvious results. I&#x27;m going to continue using it every night for about another month or two so that I can see the full potential of results after one or two entire growth cycles of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with what I see so far. :-)</li>
            <li> After reading good comments I decided to buy this product. Unfortunately, a week of using it, my eyes got so itchy so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I was skeptical at first because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results for weeks and I felt like it wasn&#x27;t working. Then about two months after using it I noticed a difference. Now two and a half months later people ask me if I have fake eyelashes! I love it!</li>
            <li> I originally got this from my salon, but saw it was much cheaper on here.  It works perfectly.  My eyelashes grew about 50% longer and fuller in 3 months.  You have to continue using it to keep them.  I also noticed that they weren&#x27;t falling out as much when using this product.  There was slight itching when I first used it (like the first week), but this subsided.  It is quick to put on in the morning and dries fast.  I wait about 30 minutes before applying eye makeup.  It does not curl your eyelashes so they get a bit unruly when they get longer.  I have to make sure they are curled almost every day to keep them out of my vision, but not a problem for me and only take an extra couple minutes in the morning.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to work, but once it does you can use it a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works !! All my life I have had short eyelashes, not anymore.</li>
            <li> I love Babe eyelash serum. I am on the third tube but a noticeable difference in length and thickness after the first three months of use . I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> 4 weeks using product every day. Ashes are no longer than before.</li>
            <li> Cannot give a good review yet, I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks nothing happens yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one month and starting to see results. I&#x27;ve used other products in the past and have never seen any growth in my lashes. My only complaint with Babe Lash is it makes my eyes slightly itchy but not enough to deter me from using the product as I am very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I received this faster than expected, packaged great, and after 4-5 weeks; it&#x27;s already WORKING!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and this seller as well.</li>
            <li> The best product for long eye lashes. Great results....the best product I have bought. Love the results. You need to use it for three months to see the perfect and long eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Caused a reaction - red eyes -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two months and I see a major difference! My lashes look a lot longer and fuller than they have in the past! I didn&#x27;t have any irritations with using this product and will probably be buying it again very soon!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Im a makeup artist and women come in all the time with lash extensions that look spidery and fake and horrible. If you want longer lashes that look healthy and curl I highly recommend this product. You will not see any results for about 6 weeks then suddenly ur lashes start growing like crazy! I was applying one swipe on the upper and lower lash line (avoid the inner corners so you don&#x27;t have hairs poking you in the eye later) every other night and my lashes grew beautifully! All of us ladies at the Benefit Counter use it and we pair it with They&#x27;re Real Mascara and Holy moly our lashes are amazing!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and it really works. I noticed once I reached my desired length of lashes, I used it less frequently. I found three times a week is right for me, now that I have the length that I want. For maintenance I only have to use it 3 times a week now. I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> Totally love this product.!</li>
            <li> Works awesome!! Stopped using latisse and my eyelashes started breaking but didn&#x27;t want to shell out the high cost of latisse again so tried this! I&#x27;ll never use anything else!!</li>
            <li> Babe Lash actually works. My eyelashes were visibly longer within a month. After three months they were nice and long, and I only use the product once or twice a week as maintenance. While it makes lashes longer, it does not make them thicker.</li>
            <li> I love it so far! I&#x27;ve not used it that it looks like my lashes changed dramatically but I&#x27;m seeing small progress! :) Can&#x27;t wait to finish up the whole tube.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly!  Only used for a couple days so I don&#x27;t know outcome of product. Recommended from a reliable friend so anticipating lush lashes!</li>
            <li> This product actually works. I had eyelash extensions for a long time but eventually got tired of the upkeep. After letting the extensions fall out my natural lashes were sparse and thin.. They barely held any mascara. I tried this stuff based on a recommendation from a friend and I&#x27;m so happy I did. You won&#x27;t see results for a few weeks but with consistency results will come. I&#x27;ve been using this almost every night for three months and my lashes are longer and more full than before I got my first set of extensions.</li>
            <li> Good product,  my eyelashes have some falling out constantly and have more length to the most!</li>
            <li> Fantastic shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I do have a history of sensitive eyes - but that is not uncommon.  After one use, one night, my eyes were red all the next day.  I discontinued use as the package directed.</li>
            <li> Works well! Not only makes lashes longer, but adds fullness.  Make sure you wear moisturizer on lids, slight dryness occurs as a result of application.</li>
            <li> This has worked great and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to make their eyelashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I like rapid lash better . caused my eye to have irritation</li>
            <li> This s great product, I noticed longer lashes within in a week!</li>
            <li> Super bummer! My eyes became red, itchy, and heavy. Am sad to discontinue use but an eye infection is not something to be ignored! sad day:(</li>
            <li> Great product! It really helped me get my lashes back to where I wanted them to be!I could tell a difference in about three weeks. They got fuller first and then longer.  For me it did sometimes cause a little irritation, but nothing painful or concerning.</li>
            <li> Lovvvvvveeee! I am guilty of forgetting a lot ;-) and I can still see a lot of growth!!!</li>
            <li> I was suspicious about the claims of this product until I saw the results on a friend of mine.  Her results were nothing short of amazing, so I have started using it also.  While my results are taking longer than my friend&#x27;s did, I am noticing results now and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are super long now. It&#x27;s amazing!!! You have to be patient because it takes about 30 days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to it!</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference on my lashes. They are definitely longer but the product must be used every day.</li>
            <li> My favorite product ever!! People constantly ask about my lashes, I&#x27;ve got friends and family who both use it regularly now.No irritation, big results within weeks.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this product!!! I first got it from my niece, who is an aesthetician (sp.??) in Jackson Hole, Wyo. She has used it for 2 years, and loves it... I tried a bottle, starting Feb(this year). The directions stated to apply am and pm. But I found after 3 nights, that it irritated my eyes, as I always rub my eyes, before I fall to sleep. So I just used it in the morming, before I applied my make-up. I have always had very thin,and sparce lashes, ( I am 64,). Just try this....I now have very LONG upper and lower lashes. Love this....!!!!!!!! My first tube lasted 6 mths.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while now. Recently got extensions off which left me with chemically melted off nubs. Thank God for this product. I now have more beautiful lashes than ever before.</li>
            <li> Original product/packaging, fast shipping.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This product is so awesome!  Everyone thinks I have false eyelashes.  I don&#x27;t they are all mine.  Longer than I have ever had!  Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> 2nd time buying this product.  It does work.  My lashes have grown longer and it even seems that it works for making new lashes grow also.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Babe Lash is worn in day time . Helps lashes to stay healthy no breakage or fall out of lashes. This product lasts along time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now and I&#x27;ve seen dramatic changes. My eyelashes are super long! I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to grow their eyelashes. I use it every night after I shower, and so far so good. Can&#x27;t wait to see the final results!</li>
            <li> I used to get fake lashes on and it was too expensive and time consuming. I could not believe the length I got with this serum! I use it once a week for up-keep and used it daily for about 4-6 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 9 months now and am incredibly happy with the length of my lashes! I still get comments. I especially get positive comments when I pair it with the 2-in-1 mascara/fibers. Absolutely recommend this product to those who don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of time (and money) getting their lashes done.</li>
            <li> Received item quick and have used it for 3 days as of today. It generally takes approx 3 wks to see results</li>
            <li> The product is OK however after applying it my eyes are so red for days,</li>
            <li> Definitely works!  I was skeptical as to whether it would work as well as LiLash, because that is the only lash lengthener I&#x27;ve ever had success with.  But this stuff really works. Love the mascara too, I will never use anything else again!  You need to give it like a month to see results as with all of them but my lashes look fake now, I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t sting or anything weird like some other brands either.</li>
            <li> I think it is working.  Heard from a lot of people that it works fantastic.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 weeks and can see you thickness.</li>
            <li> As I have aged I noticed my eyelashes were beginning to thin and there seem to be no length to them. I happened to mention this to my hairdresser and she introduced me to Babe Lash.  She had been using Babe Lash for about 2 months.  I was amazed at the length of her lashes and how nice they looked.&lt;br /&gt;She told me to faithfully follow the directions and within a month I should notice a difference.  Bought my first Babe Lash from her, used it faithfully every day and the difference in my lashes is quite noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered my second Babe Lash Serum so I can maintain my lashes.  Very happy with this product and the price is very competitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 1/2 months. It took a while but after about 6 weeks of daily use I started seeing real results. I&#x27;m at 10 weeks now and love it! I was a little sensitive to it for the first week but now it&#x27;s fine. Bought originally at a salon but found it here on amazon cheaper. Worth the money. Used Thomas and Roth serum from Sephora about 6 months ago and saw absolutely no change at all. Glad I found this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to rate this.. I have had this product for three weeks and nothing so far . Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s good can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> I used this product intermittently and still I am seeing amazing results.  The esthetician asked me if I had eyelash extensions at my last facial.  My lashes are really long.  I&#x27;ve had to trim them and very thick.  I had a little irritation, but I have learned that you really must let the product dry before fully opening your eye.  I also use my blow dryer on low for just a few seconds to dry the product before fully opening my eye.  It took about three months before I saw results, but it virtually happened overnight.  I had to change mascara because my lashes were too fake looking for my personal taste.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for things, but I love reading them to see what others think. So, thought I would give my input. This works very well. A little soreness at first, but nothing major and the results for the first month were awesome. My lashes are much longer and thicker. I have been using twice a day if I remember. One suggestion-use sparingly. I have some tiny lashes growing at the corners of my eye where lashes don&#x27;t normally grow-so a little goes along way! Buy you will be glad you did:)</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how latisse is even still on the market with a $30 option that works this well! I noticed a difference within the first week, and within two months everyone else noticed.  My husband though I was wearing my falsies and I was only wearing two coats of waterproof mascara! I can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks in another few weeks. I have started using it on my overplucked eyebrows and will update. Oh and this works on the bottom lashes as well ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works great for others. It did for my friend. For me, my eyes are blood shot. My eyelashes are falling out. Only been a few days. It was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great product for longer/thicker lashes!</li>
            <li> As of today no results;(</li>
            <li> One night of use and my eye lids were red/pink and some lumping under skin. Was fully gone after a few days but a total loss of $35 :( Discontinued use as product packaging encouraged. I have used other serums before and never had sensitivity so I cant say that I am sensitive. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Babe Lash has considerably thickened and lengthened my lashes. I have been asked if I have lash extensions. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every night for 2 months and already have longer lashes. I started to notice around 6 weeks. My friend used it for years and said her eyelids were turning pink but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No burning like other products I&#x27;ve tried. I put this on after I&#x27;ve cleaned my face and before I put on moisturizer. USE IT EVERY NIGHT!  After desired results I use it every other day (and sometimes I forget) and my lashes are still pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this. I&#x27;ve had one tube for about 3 months now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving three stars because I tried 2x&#x27;s a day and always felt like there was something in my eyes.  Had to use drops.  Went back to once at night and things improved.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m starting to see some results.  A bit longer?  I&#x27;ll know more after 3 more months.  Not thicker but a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments about my long lashes, so I figure it must be working. Be sure to apply it at night, because it can cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in about 3 weeks. But after 3 months I really notice a difference and so do others.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week but so far this seems to be working! Before I started this my lashes were in pretty bad shape because I have been using false lashes a lot and my own lashes were short and sparse. I had a little irritation the first three days. One day my eyes were red but I realized this was probably because i used it both morning and night. The directions say to use it only once a day, either morning or night. I can already see my lashes are a little longer, and they seem stronger because they are not falling out when I remove my makeup.  I am really hoping this product helps and I think it will! I have also stopped using false lashes, so I think that it is also important to be kind to your lashes if you want them to do well with this product.</li>
            <li> Really great product! Slight irritation initially.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are longer but not thicker. They say what they do. This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product made my eyelids swell and become very tender. The sellers won&#x27;t let you return it if you&#x27;ve opened the box, regardless of how it affects your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 6 weeks but already am seeing results on my non-existent lashes! I think there are some nights I may have put too much on because the next day my eyes are a little red and irritated, but most of the time I don&#x27;t have any irritation. Excited to see my lashes after 3 months if I&#x27;m already getting great results.</li>
            <li> I would give this no star if it was possible. I had an extreme reaction to this product which is not supposed to happen as this is &amp;#34;the most sensitive serum on the market&amp;#34; i nearly had to go to the hospital because my eyes got so swollen I couldn&#x27;t see</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually rates items I purchase, but thought I should on this. First it does work and works great. After using only a week I noticed long lashes. Con my eyes reacted to it and got red and puffy. :(  I don&#x27;t react to much of anything and am not allergic to much, so that surprised me. My friend got a bigger nastier reaction than I, so who knows . I would just use  with caution.</li>
            <li> great product really works my eye lashes are super long</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month and a half ago for I was considering getting eyelash extensions. However, I knew that I would have  to go in every few weeks to have a fill done. I didn&#x27;t really want the maintenance and the expense.  I saw this product at my hair salon and asked my stylist what she thought. (she does my permanent eyeliner and brows so I trust her opinion)  She loved the product, used it herself and I noticed that her eyelashes looked amazingly long and full.  They were asking an incredibly high price for the conditioner serum and the mascara as a set and I remembered that I had seen that Amazon had the same two items at a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased them and low and behold, 4 weeks later my lashed had doubled in length, and looked amazingly fuller.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone needing longer, healthier lashes.... :)</li>
            <li> My eyelashes grew really long. I absolutely loved them and received compliments from everyone. After about 4 months I started noticing about 10 lashes falling out each day.  It got to a point where I was afraid I would lose all of my lashes. I discontinued using the product and threw it away.  I advise you to beware of the after effects.  Initially the results are amazing , but eventually your lashes become too long and weak and fall out. Take it from me.</li>
            <li> It works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought this product from my hairdresser first and have been using it since Aug 2014.  Started seeing results after 1 month.  As promised, After 3 months, my eyelashes are thicker and longer. Satisfied with the results!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works as promised.  I tried professionally applied eyelash extensions and loved the look BUT the cost was unsustainable for me.  When I decided I could no longer keep up the bi-weekly fill-ins I removed the eyelash extensions.  Many of my own lashes came out with the extensions.  I was left with thin, sparse lashes.  BABE LASH came to the rescue!!!  I noticed results within 3 to 4 weeks.  I&#x27;m still using my first tube (about 3 months now) and my lashes look fantastic.  They are much longer, thicker, and even more curly!!!! than EVER before!!!!  My real lashes look BETTER than the fake ones with just one quick coat of any mascara.  And Babe Lash is actually affordable.  I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results that I purchased several tubes to give as Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 3 weeks now but I can already notice a difference. In fact my mom was out of town for that time and when she came back she pointed out that my eyelashes were longer. I have really fast growing hair so maybe this just worked faster on me than it would for others, but I really noticed a difference with just 3 weeks of use and I high recommend it for anyone whose trying to grow out their lashes</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like Lilash. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wore it for a week then my eyes started to itch so I stopped using.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping it would work for me.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff.  I have noticed her eyelashes have gotten significantly longer.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I am a 64 yr old woman with long but thinning lashes which are now filling in and they are getting almost too long! It has been just over a month since I started using it.. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this made my daughters eyes VERY red, so she had to discontinue using after 2 applications.</li>
            <li> It was so good! wish i took before and after pictures, but i thought if it really did work i would be ablt to see the results without a before and after... and i was right! I noticed a difference about a month later and my lashes longer, fuller and curled abit naturally! my family also noticed. Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> * (My lashes grew but took about 3 weeks to start to show.  I bought a 2nd time too.) first review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This is my second review on this product and it works wonderfully.  I use it every night on upper and lower lashes and I have full and long lashes but it does take about 4-6 weeks to get full lashes.  Don&#x27;t give up!!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have grown like crazy especially after using it consistently for 3 months. I love how simple and easy it is to apply. Plus $40/every three months is amazing compared to those fake lashes that damage your real lashes. I love Babe Lash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m three weeks in and still don&#x27;t see a difference. All I&#x27;ve noticed is tenderness where I have applied it every night. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it really works.  In a few weeks I noticed results.  I&#x27;m a believer now!</li>
            <li> This is my 4th month using babe lash. I noticed a substantial difference after the first month. It&#x27;s so easy you just put it on your eyelid before doing your makeup every day like you would eye liner. I just ran out of my first 2 ml after 4 months. I never write reviews but feel everyone should get this stuff! Seriously it works! I had major doubt before using it myself but anyone that wants longer thicker lashes should most defiantly get it!!!</li>
            <li> Half the price of the other lash serum I was using, but just as effective!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since Lilash was pulled and it has worked great for me.  Longer lashes and a little fuller.  Recently I have noticed one eye feeling &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; shut in the morning like a bad allergy.  I took a break while in the hospital and the problem went away, now that I&#x27;m using it again- my eye is acting up in the morning.  I have used this for almost 1 year.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! This stuff ROCKS!! Your lashes get soooooooooo long and soft its UNREAL!! I had a friend who like myself, had pretty long lashes to being with but was tired of wearing falsies. Soooo she used this and 4 weeks later HOLY COW, her lashes are so long and I couldn&#x27;t believe how thick and beautiful they were. I ordered Babe lash and used it every other day for 4 weeks and my lash length has increased about 3/4 of a half inch!  I have had other ladies ask and now they too are using babe lash! GREATTTTTTTTTTTTT PRODUCT, easy to use, and just a tip, if your eyebrows are sparse (like mine) u can use the the serum on them and your brows will also grow back in faster, a double win!!</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month and I see nothing. I want my money back:( very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have always had the straightest, shortest, sparsest lashes.  Within 3 weeks of starting to use Babe Lash there was a noticeable difference in the length of my lashes.  It has now been just over 2 months and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.  I have dreamed of having lashes like this since I was a teen and now it is like a miracle.  I do use mascara because my lashes are very pale, but the length is all from Babe Lash. Go for it!</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price. Works quickly; after just a week I noticed my lashes thickening and getting longer. Love the results.!</li>
            <li> You know that problem more blessed friends talk about of how their lashes are so long they hit their sunglasses (OHHHH so sad, right). Never having that problem until now thanks to Babe Lash. I must say I think it&#x27;s wonderful. This oroduct is the best ever. Didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes either. &amp; it&#x27;s Hello Lashes!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8 weeks now and my lashes have grown so much! I&#x27;ve even noticed that they curl up naturally now so I don&#x27;t even have to use an eyelash curler. The first 2-3 weeks of using it, my eyes were red for about an hour or two after waking up from and they were also a little itchy, however, I kept using it and now I don&#x27;t experience any type of discomfort and my lashes have almost doubled in length!</li>
            <li> The questions above are irrelevant to this product. I use it once a day and have had incredible results. One tube lasts about 3 months. I have had no eye irritation. My lashes are amazing, but you must be patient!!  It took 5 weeks for me to notice a change.  My lashes seemed the same one night, but the next morning, WOW!!  Long.  I&#x27;ve even had to trim my lashes, as they hit my glasses.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> My Mom and I both ordered this and within one week we can see the difference.  I have 4 friends that had been using it for 3 months and their eye lashes looked fake...so beautiful....so glad they told me about this beauty secret!  I&#x27;ve had extensions and used false eye lashes and was too scared to try other serums of fear to change my eye color from blue to brown but this has no side effects.  You can use it on top of makeup.  Doesn&#x27;t burn.  Works quickly!  Take a before picture of your lashes and then start using it you will be amazed in 3 weeks for sure!!!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed any difference In lash growth  and it also irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it everyday, otherwise the results are less than expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 weeks and have had some growth.  I had very thin lashes so I feel it will take a while for them to fill out.  I am pleased with what I am seeing.</li>
            <li> This product actually works quite well.  My lashes have grown at least 50% longer and I haven&#x27;t even used it every day. The only drawback is that it did cause some irritation (pink and itchy skin, very bloodshot eyes) the first several times I used it. I couldn&#x27;t use it every day because of this. My skin and eyes no longer get as irritated now, just some slight pink on my eyelids some mornings. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product &amp; I would buy it again since the benefit outweighed the side effect of irritation for me.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look amazing!  They are already to the bottom of my eyebrows in a month</li>
            <li> Been using it for over a month and have seen NO results.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at my hair salon for $65.  Decided to check Amazon, and here it was for about $28 + about $4 shipping.  I was leary, concerned that it might be expired, but the date on the bottom of the tube proved it safe for long past it&#x27;s expected time to last.  It took about 6 weeks for the first round to show improvement, but then, suddenly, my eyelashes are almost twice as long as they previously were.  The leaflet says you need to continue use (about every other day) once the length is achieved, hence my purchase from Amazon.  I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.  PS - my eyelids did get pink and itched at first, but I continued, and have had no ill effects.</li>
            <li> Loved it! After using it about 5 times/week I could see a noticeable difference in my lashes. I plan to continue to use it and recommend it to my friends. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this, been using it for months and get lots of compliments</li>
            <li> My stepmother recommended this product after using it and getting great results.  I was extremely skeptical, but figured I could at least give it a try.  Not sure how fast it worked on others, but using it almost every night, in about 2 1/2 months I saw a significant boost in both length and thickness.  Now when I use mascara people ask me if I wear falsies!  Shoot, sometimes I wonder if I have on falsies.  I really, really love the results and will continue to use.  Highly recommend.</li>
