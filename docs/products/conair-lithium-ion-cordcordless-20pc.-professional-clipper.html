            <li>It gives a nice and even cut all around.</li>

            <li>Conair really did a wonderful job designing these clippers.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Wahl corded clipper</li>
            <li>I am by no means a barber but to me these feel every bit as good as the Wahl clippers that I had for the better part of 20 years.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always shaved my own head.  </li>
            <li>And it comes with a nice zipper bag to hold all of the goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I liked how it looked.  </li>

            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of bulky for detail work, but it works well for my bald head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon has a good return policy, I will get a Wahl.</li>
            <li>the price is right, good quality, great reviews</li>

            <li>whatever your hair-cutting needs are, I highly recommend this product - go forth and do great clippings!</li>
            <li>The Conair Super Clipper has some features that make it ideal for touching up between haircuts or fine-tuning a home cut.</li>
            <li>Charges easily and cordless is good</li>
            <li>Let me preface this review by telling you that I have a used a top of the line Wahl for many years and LOVED it.....</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It will break very easily like it did on me.  </li>
            <li>Cordless with a lithium battery makes this clipper very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cutter is and motor are very strong.  </li>
            <li>He says that these are the best ones he has ever had, bar far!  </li>
            <li>Is good , it that&#x27;s the job , good price, love it, fast delivery !!</li>
            <li>This is good, not too light, not too plastic.</li>
            <li>Perfect cuts and not as loud as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Powerful machine with great battery life.</li>
            <li>I was able to cut my own hair no problem</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly and gave me a pretty darn good cut for my first time.</li>
            <li>So far he&#x27;s been very impressed.  </li>
            <li>The price is much more affordable and they&#x27;re just as effective.  </li>
            <li>A nice feature that more clipper sets need to imitate of this set is you have to push the sides together to get them on/off the clipper.</li>
            <li>Works great and is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Works very powerful and cuts really good.  </li>
            <li>The attachments are good and it is very powerful.</li>
            <li>It is great quality and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>You Tube was a great help the first time I cut my hair---took me about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>These clippers are very light compared to the corded version.</li>
            <li>I found this clipper product to be handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use it to cut my own hair - easy to do.</li>
            <li>This device charges quickly and holds its charge for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>sure this would make a good clipper for a full haircut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this, cuts my hair nice and battery lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many of the rechargeables and they just don&#x27;t work that well -</li>
            <li>I like that I am able to go chordless with it</li>
            <li>favorite feature about this product is the taper control which allows you to change the length of the blade from a 0 to about a 1 without having to add or remove any blade attachments.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Which is a shame because my last conair trimmer was the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Cuts and works better than my corded one.</li>
            <li>For years I used a corded clipper and wanted something that allowed more freedom.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>took off the one star for the slightly more plasticy feel.</li>
            <li>I wonder how many reviewed soon after the purchase ?</li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love the cordless feature.  </li>
            <li>&quot; This unit allows you to do so with the adjustment screws on the top plate.</li>
            <li>But...my favorite two features are (1) the on/off switch is out of the way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought them</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with the purchased.</li>
            <li>Seems to work OK for my use, which is to touch up a buzz cut in between trips to the salon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully this is a helpful hint to you - and if yes, please don&#x27;t forget to press the \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; vote below :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt; - cannot get better than this for the price point.</li>
            <li>so you have a better battery experience with the product).</li>
            <li>I love everything about them.</li>
            <li>Love bring able to use with our without a cord.</li>
            <li>I would say they are better than my Whaul plug in the wall clippers.</li>
            <li>After owning it for several months now I can say this is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Better that the Wahl that I had.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving my head with a #1 for many years and have had my share of both electric and rechargeable trimmers.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best one I have owned.</li>
            <li>He uses them mostly for trimming his beard a line up</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend anyone to get one of this.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it has a lithium ion battery.  </li>
            <li>It has tons of power and cuts better than the corded Wahl did.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can cut my son&#x27;s hair as he roams about (he&#x27;s two).  </li>
            <li>- I love that they are cordless.</li>
            <li>storage bag included is a nice touch, although the scissors and cape included are rather cheap.</li>
            <li>I prefer this brand over many others and decided to give this one a shot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love the cordless feature.</li>
            <li>These stay charged for ages, and cut so much better.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times since getting them and am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I am extraordinarily pleased.</li>
            <li>but I am more than pleased with their operation.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>An outstanding Haircut Kit, containing all the accessories you&#x27;ll need for a well done trimming job.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can not imagine a better clipper at any price.</li>
            <li>There are alot of attachments, most of which I  would not use.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have to tip anyone :)  </li>
            <li>I bought it more than 8 months ago</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the option of cordless or corded.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably recharge mine about 2x a year mostly because I want to.  </li>
            <li>also love not having to worry about the cord getting wrapped up in everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On/Off switch could be designed better.</li>
            <li>one more usage - it cuts through pet-hair like butter.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been giving me my cuts for years and better than any barber Ive had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can do better than this set.</li>
            <li>its dedicated power cord, my Wahl shaver and its accessories work much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can do better than this set.</li>
            <li>its dedicated power cord, my Wahl shaver and its accessories work much better.</li>
            <li>and it works great for my very close crop hair.  </li>
            <li>This works much better.  </li>
            <li>I suggest they make the button rubber so that you can grip it better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>It prevents accidental shutoff, which is important to me as I cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair clipper that I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where it could be better :</li>
            <li>A pop out edging trimmer would have been  lovely bonus.</li>
            <li>A pop out edging trimmer would have been  lovely bonus.</li>
            <li>well, I love the Conair more.</li>
            <li>Battery life is excellent and I have yet had to charge it back up.</li>
            <li>Buy it, and enjoy....as I am! :-)</li>
            <li>great so far!!!</li>
            <li>(most hair clippers are NOT like this)--this is a great feature and important for getting a consistent cut.  </li>
            <li>after researching for awhile, I picked this one up and so far, so good!  </li>
            <li>attachments come on and off perfectly in stays charged for a long time</li>
            <li>The first thing that I loved was that it came charged.</li>
            <li>The comb attachments are very good, especially the innovative ear combs.  </li>
            <li>It runs smooth, very quiet, with no electrical cord to worry about getting in the way, great !</li>
            <li>, perfect smooth cut everytime with different length guards.  </li>
            <li>It works well, no vibrating, is not overly noisey, fits the hand nicely and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Absolutely great product so far!</li>
            <li>If you have longer hair (greater than 1/4 inch), should work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>and I think that has more to do with my fine hair than the clippers (as I had this issue with my Wahl&#x27;s and the clippers in Germany as well.)  </li>
            <li>Being able to adjust the blade is huge.</li>
            <li>So far, this clipper has done a great job.</li>
            <li>The price was okay and the product arrived on time with free shipping.</li>
            <li>and he sat comfortably still for the most part.</li>
            <li>I might be exaggerating in my title, because I&#x27;m pretty sure that some barber somewhere has better clippers than these, but they&#x27;re definitely the best hair clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Works great so far and seems quality</li>
            <li>Charges fast and has good run time.</li>
            <li>very prifesional!!batrery is good</li>
            <li>Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The battery life is great and the quick charge feature definitely comes in handy.  </li>
            <li>Easy for use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The guide combs come on and off easily,</li>
            <li>They were also easily to remove. . .</li>
            <li>Most importantly: clean and lubricate the blades after each use and keep the protective cover over the blades, when in storage.</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to read, but not comprehensive.</li>
            <li>Lots of power and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep it clean and well oiled</li>
            <li>I have to say these clippers are outstanding, at full charge they are a monster and clip hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li>This trimmer cuts excellently, it does not leave ragged ends, it does not pull or bog down.</li>
            <li>Cuts just fine.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for the 2 times I used it before it died</li>
            <li>It cuts fine.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to handle without cord.  </li>
            <li>We have had this for about 1 month and it works fine, as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is a fine instrument; you can feel the quality in it.  </li>
            <li>This haircut kit works fine, just have to practice a bit</li>
            <li>Thankfully amazon does quick returns!</li>
            <li>I know it probably fit design wise, but I would of liked it right in the middle of the top of the unit instead of having to search for it in your palm region when your holding it.</li>
            <li>I found them easy to use, easy to clean, and</li>
            <li>They are smooth, quiet, strong and battery life on them in great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really a nice kit and a very decent value in my judgment.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this hair trimmer and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even more powerful than the corded clippers I&#x27;ve been using, and it is LIGHT.</li>
            <li>A good value, but they feel cheaply made and are a bit loud.</li>
            <li>Being cordless does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Not because it isn&#x27;t a great product, which it is, but because I didn&#x27;t think it would be any different than what I have already</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a solid product and seems of great quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the teeth are like running the prongs of a cheap metal fork on your head.  </li>
            <li>These are the most powerful clippers around, but they do the job.</li>
            <li>The item description led me to believe that it would shave my bald head smooth.</li>
            <li>Runs quiet, cuts great, sturdy cutter heads.  </li>
            <li>I have used a few trimmers in my years, a couple passes is an excellent performance.</li>
            <li>which is FAR superior to good old Wahl that I had to literally Duct tape in order to keep the guard on.</li>
            <li>I like how light it is and that it&#x27;s cordless.  </li>
            <li>Kit contents are kinda cheap, but what do you expect for $30.</li>
            <li>It was fairly easy to do and never had any hair get caught, cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>easy to clean</li>
            <li>I became accustomed to spending only $20-$30 on WAHL clippers and have gotten great results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CONAIR doesn&#x27;t seem to give as smooth of a cut as the WAHL clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>However there is a LED light that will flash when you have 3 min left.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Smooth cut.</li>
            <li>These clippers work great, the charge lasts for about 5 total head buzzing sessions</li>
            <li>Yes its cordless so no annoying cord always getting tangled with this.</li>
            <li>Even though the plastic clipper attachments look cheap, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them,.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand how this device has such great reviews.</li>
            <li>The noise level is not objectionable, the weight is comfortable and the grip is comfortable as well.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve always just gotten the cheapest model available and used it until it broke</li>
            <li>Can use either with cord or cord free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s a great hair cutter, it&#x27;s a bit too big and clunky to be used for any beard or mustache detail work.</li>
            <li>you can see in my video, head shaving is a precise art,</li>
            <li>comes with oil that you need in order to lubricate the blades, a cape (a must for ticklish kids!) and scissors for the detailed areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great clipper, look no further.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>The corded wahl is far superior .  </li>
            <li>SO far so good</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, with adequate power, and exceptional battery life.</li>
            <li>This has been the best so far -- motor seems to run at the right speed regardless of how much hair has to be cut.</li>
            <li>The clippers are very nice same with the attachments that go with it.  </li>
            <li>Even the barber cape was very useful to keep the hair falling to one place and not to my clothes.    </li>
            <li>Light weight, which makes it travel friendly.</li>
            <li>I was aware that  my 35 year old son cut his own hair for about 6 years and decided I&#x27;d try to cut my own also...</li>
            <li>Light and compact, Cuts clean and doesn&#x27;t snag hair.</li>
            <li>The super cheap guide combs are working just fine, but again</li>
            <li>The cut is smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>The lever adjustment is easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Every weekend I go through my hair-cutting routines to trim off before shower - very easy and fast (just need about 3 minutes</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t charged it since the original charge and have used it maybe 10 times.</li>
            <li>but I expect to be happily using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>but now I can get perfect fades from skin to the 7-guard every week without having to wait in line, pay $20 bucks plus tip and try to come up with 30 minutes of small talk for the barber.</li>
            <li>Btw, I&#x27;ve used these for years, yes I know how to clean them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for him and so far seems to be a lasting item.  </li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly without pulling hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have a job where I have to always be clean shaven</li>
            <li>It charges fast, is very sturdy yet fairly lightweight, and cuts like a champ.  </li>
            <li>This Conair clipper is built much nicer than I anticipated, the battery life is good and it cuts really well.</li>
            <li>and it was far better than what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>I could have done without the super cheap barber scissors, super cheap comb and super super cheap barber cape.  </li>
            <li>Charges fast and very light weight.</li>
            <li>great battery sounds strong and constant through out the whole hair cut.</li>
            <li>My grandson is a special needs child and he hates haircuts from a barber.</li>
            <li>The battery life is just right!</li>
            <li>When I first picked up the Clippers, I quickly noticed how light they were and questioned the quality of the set but after using them a few times, I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>they are very easy to handle and quiet for the most part.</li>
            <li>Love this, very quiet and of very good quality, would definitely buy again</li>
            <li>I used it already four times from its first, original full charge and still going strong (your mileage may vary).</li>
            <li>I really did look better.</li>
            <li>so I took that as a good sign and ended up buying this last night.</li>
            <li>Clippers also include a nice soft storage case.v</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is that the lever has a number of fixed height settings, which means it does move unless you want it to</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper than buying another wahl and it works much better for my beard.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Conair Cordless Mustache Trimmer for many years, and it has served me very well.  </li>
            <li>For the price of two or three haircuts, you can own this set that includes a plethora of attachments and offers cordless operation as well.</li>
            <li>Full accessories kit.</li>
            <li>It has many lengths to choose from and is very compact for storage.</li>
            <li>, I would definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for a good set of wireless hair clippers.</li>
            <li>A full 3 hour charge lasts for 75 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>The Superr Clipper cuts quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad for some 5 haircuts and 7 trims.</li>
            <li>The Conair HC1100AM I-Pro Professional Super Clipper is actually a pretty good clipper.</li>
            <li>Great product, value like an $80 to $100 product, i.e. huge value for half the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent trimmer, but not as good as older models.  </li>
            <li>3-hour full charge for 75 minutes of use, or 15-minute quick charge for 15 minutes of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It allows me to quickly trim what I need without worrying about any cord tangling,</li>
            <li>these charge quickly.</li>
            <li>being cordless does facilitate the process, and gives you multiple options (especially on vacation in a hotel) to choose the best and brightest location to do a cut.</li>
            <li>Clippers charge quickly and cut well.</li>
            <li>a 15-minute Quick Charge allows 15 minutes of</li>
            <li>arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice blue LED light to indicate charging.  </li>
            <li>Charges quick</li>
            <li>It works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>You can also do a 15 minute quick charge for 15 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>On my first attempt I was able to cut my hair exactly as I wanted</li>
            <li>If you are in a hurry and forgot to charge it you can charge it for 15 minutes to get a quick 15 minutes of use, or use it corded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can just tell by the weight and feel of the clippers and its components that this is a much better constructed high quality set of Clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works great, charges fast, easy to change combs and definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had to use a corded clipper (except for a few months in Japan when I had a good Philips cordless which died) which was ok since they were powerful on coarse/Asian hair, but often the cord would tangle, knock something over, limit where I could cut my hair, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>br /&gt; - battery is way better than other products that cost 3x the price (e.g. Oral-B toothbrush!!)&lt;br /&gt; - comes in handy fabric travel bag with everything you need</li>
            <li>It has a bigger case and it&#x27;s so much easier to cut my own hair with!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to finally have some that will charge quickly.  </li>
            <li>Work great, cut well, don&#x27;t get too hot, cordless is definitely a plus, especially in a place where free wall outlets are not every where, no loss in power without the cord!</li>
            <li>Compared to my old worn out clippers, these are very smooth and efficient.</li>
            <li>I it works fantastic, the machine is very strong and the battery holds the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp, no cord, easy breezy.</li>
            <li>large number of attachments and accessories that are included makes this set very useful indeed.  </li>
            <li>Works well, is light, and very adjustable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely purchase if you like to shave your own head instead of going to a hair</li>
            <li>Not that loud compared to most buzzers.</li>
            <li>Lightweight yet powerful.</li>
            <li>Always have a fresh cut with these.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This clipper is powerful and versatile.</li>
            <li>Clippers have a nice selection of lengths, the charge cable is in the back</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t designed for &amp;#34;self cuts&amp;#34; but has a solid motor and comes in a nice kit.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricy, but worth it.</li>
            <li>It feels honestly like its made of cheap plastic with a hollow cavity.</li>
            <li>Also tried my beard without the combs, and pleased with results.&lt;br /&gt;Charges much faster and holds charge much longer too.  </li>
            <li>this thing works great so far, if you just wanna keep  the short scruffy look  and not a close shave</li>
            <li>This is a neat, useful clipper that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>wow i love these....</li>
            <li>The clippers are definatly worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have an old Wahl corded trimmer that I&#x27;ve used for many years.  </li>
            <li>But for now, it is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>NOW they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised by the high quality for a low price.</li>
            <li>for several reasons ( cheaper,  much more convenient, I can give myself a full hair cut and do quick trims whenever I wanted ).</li>
            <li>but I am sure that with the right eyes and dexterity you can give yourself professional looking haircuts.</li>
            <li>Charges pretty quickly and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>I had an older model with the old type battery for many years and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sharp and battery life is good</li>
            <li>they cut just as good as any I&#x27;ve ever owned (and as a military guy who has cut his own hair for a LONG time, I&#x27;ve used a bunch of clippers).  </li>
            <li>Conair seems to have gotten it right, with all the accessories plus the blade position options.</li>
            <li>the clippers didn&#x27;t work right with the power inverters, so we bought another brand of clippers over there</li>
            <li>It charged very quickly right out of the box, I did not time it, but in just a couple of hours, it was fully charged.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the purchase after the first few uses (just recharging it now).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better these are compared to the average corded clippers found in most stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 8 years now, and this is by far the best clipper</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure these will last much longer than the Braun which felt light and flimsy compared to this.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I spent the money to upgrade to a cordless trimmer</li>
            <li>This really needs an adjustable head instead of a bag full of snap ons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying a second and third one for my brother and dad, because these are great.</li>
            <li>They idea of cordless is good but the reality is the cutting is not so good.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice to know how much charge is left in device wheb</li>
            <li>4 stars because they are a great value, minus 1 star for being loud and lacking amount of charge remaining in battery.</li>
            <li>The price now is $10.00 less than what I paid for so for those buying now, you&#x27;re getting a really good deal.</li>
            <li>Fantastic , light weight trimmer with all the necessary guards.</li>
            <li>The motor is quite powerful and does a great job with thick hair.</li>
            <li>very solid instrument, I tried it just a couple of times and seems very accurate.</li>
            <li>I paired this with the shavewell mirror which could be larger but very light and no concerns about breaking glass in the shower.</li>
            <li>Dad gets haircuts at home - he likes it very much.</li>
            <li>But i like it very much.</li>
            <li>I like this clipper very much.</li>
            <li>And it was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I had to complain, I would say that it could use a few more guides for different shave lengths, but I am still very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight, quiet, and works well.</li>
            <li>Not as good as some other clippers I&#x27;ve used, but I guess at this price you don&#x27;t really get to complain.</li>
            <li>It is much heftier than the ones that I&#x27;ve had with other brands, and allows a good cleaning of the blades.</li>
            <li>Ok trimmers, have only used a couple of times but they&#x27;re very loud even after oiling and feel slightly cheap.</li>
            <li>Normally takes me 30 minutes to cut my hair and works fine the whole time.</li>
            <li>so all I had to do was put a small washer and it was back to perfect.</li>
            <li>Works really well, and all of the pieces are useful and well-made.</li>
            <li>Its powerful and being cordless its very convenient.</li>
            <li>; which was a great idea, but it forced a near-crewcut.  </li>
            <li>I upped my rating from one star to four based on the fact that the first trimmer would not charge.</li>
            <li>on April 26, 2014]  I fully charged the hair clipper when I first received it in January, and have been using it every week ever since.  </li>
            <li>This is my first clipper.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions so let it charge for the minimum 3 hours for the first time</li>
            <li>This morning I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li>, REALLY!</li>
            <li>For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong comes with everything you need and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>Cuts hair like hot knife thru butter, works</li>
            <li>I was a bit scared, at first, but then I got to thinking. . .</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really more professional-quality construction than actually for professionas because barbers need corded clippers as they don&#x27;t have time for</li>
            <li>But the first one we received had to be returned because it would not run without a power cord.</li>
            <li>My 4 star rating is because of the defective first one.</li>
            <li>Sometimes these do-it-at-home clippers fall short in one or more ways . . .</li>
            <li>Is it your first kit and you have nothing to compare to?</li>
            <li>Washed it out after first use.</li>
            <li>(I charged the battery 15 hrs for first charge as directed)</li>
            <li>Cuts through hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>--first cut.  </li>
            <li>Cuts better than the Norelco I bought 2 years earlier.  </li>
            <li>, many attachments for different lengths.  </li>
            <li>Last night I tried out of the box (without even charging the device) and I was able to cut my hair with no problem.</li>
            <li>I am able to give my child and husband a simple hair cut</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the lithium ion battery, which means that I don&#x27;t have to worry about this shaver getting a battery memory, like my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With numerous mirrors, she was able to give herself a haircut.</li>
            <li>Did not work after first charge.</li>
            <li>A tooth on the guide piece that had the most height options broke and left a jagged edge.</li>
            <li>For those outside America, you will love this, but here, we work in inches.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, but not too loud.  </li>
            <li>VERY powerful motor, and sleek, professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the laymen, it is useful for simple trimming but you have to be brave to allow your spouse to try the other hair guides.</li>
            <li>The battery life is more than long enough once fully charged and cuts very smooth.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair every other time.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 4 or 5 cuts so far and though it&#x27;s not as powerful as a corded clipper, it&#x27;s powerful enough (and more powerful than the old one I had).  </li>
            <li>Nice  feel to this clipper, a little heavy but has good balance.  </li>
            <li>Normally I would bump it down to 4 stars, but the Super Cliper is so great, that I leave it at a solid 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Cheap, good and one of the few electronics sold on Amazon that has dual-voltage (100-240V) that works outside U.S.</li>
            <li>Okay, maybe not a professional</li>
            <li>I love how long it lasts on one charge.</li>
            <li>Today is my first time to recharge it - the battery is really holding up.  </li>
            <li>I would appreciate a case with more internal dividers but overall, this kit has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>For this reason, you pretty much have to rinse all the attachments with water to remove the hair and then wait for them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>They are made of good quality plastic material (by comparison to others I owned in the past).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s sharp, gives me a nice close shave on my head, not so close on my face without extra effort, which is fine.</li>
            <li>main clipper unit is solidly constructed (in China, of course) and is in most ways comparable to the Remington unit that I reviewed a while ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hair clippers for a very long time and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>The new plastic guides clips are of very very cheap construction and are crooked.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty quiet and light.</li>
            <li>This is the second Conair I bought, primarily because I needed a cordless trimmer, although I still have the first one.  </li>
            <li>, then I realized that it can be easily removed by simply squeeze from the side!  </li>
            <li>Does the job, easy to do it myself with all different clips it provided.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky to have three young boys to practice on</li>
            <li>The various attachments easily latch-on and slide-off</li>
            <li>The build is solid and easily handled.</li>
            <li>and more importantlydid not pull a single hair.</li>
            <li>The Conair Professional Super Clipper is very well made, sturdy and with good-quality combs included.  </li>
            <li>The little case for storage is also nice.  </li>
            <li>I will saw it doeskin sound like it moves back and forth as fast as the corded Wahl however it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or anything</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave it 5 stars so early is that I worked selling power tools when I was in college and lithium ion batteries are worth it.  </li>
            <li>&gt; The led doesn&#x27;t give much warning.</li>
            <li>Cordless convenience is a great benefit especially when you&#x27;re cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li>He does an awesome job cutting his hair and now he doesn&#x27;t have to hassle with the cord getting in the way.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to use.  </li>
            <li>Also, having the option of cord or cordless is a real plus.</li>
            <li>Much lighter and easier to handle than corded models, but these have plenty of power.</li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly !</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very ergonomic and compact.</li>
            <li>This clipper and attachments works really well.  </li>
            <li>They cut very well though I would be scared of the results of dropping them...</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s cordless and runs a reasonable amount of time for you to cut your hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these clippers!</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>Wife uses it to cut my hair and she really likes the cordless feature.</li>
            <li>If you leaving it sitting for a month, it&#x27;ll still be ready to go.</li>
            <li>well, thank you much.</li>
            <li>This cordeless edition has made hair cuts so much easier.  </li>
            <li>Hold a charge very well-</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from these clippers but they have really delivered.  </li>
            <li>Conair support were very helpful in solving that problem</li>
            <li>I real like it</li>
            <li>Because of the size of the head I can trim much quicker.</li>
            <li>I dare say that the use of the term \\&quot;professional\\&quot; is a bit much. . .</li>
            <li>My Wahl clippers are much heavier and feel \\&quot;stronger\\&quot; than the Conair. . .</li>
            <li>The blades are stainless steel, are self-sharpening, and work very efficiently.  </li>
            <li>A gentle side-to-side squeeze when attaching or detaching these guides locks them in place-</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really been adventerous with these clippers</li>
            <li>I had a corded Wahl trimmer that lasted this whole time without any real issues besides the pesky cord always tangling and in the way.</li>
            <li>has 3 more), and I tried to be careful with it each time.</li>
            <li>There is a light that tells you when the battery is getting low and the same light also can tell you when it is fully charged.</li>
            <li>The Power Head is relatively light and its Lithium battery has plenty of juice for several haircut sessions...</li>
            <li>Additionally, replacement of the blades for whatever reason could be accomplished without any tools.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the cutting ability and control.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, it absolutely blows the clippers we&#x27;ve been using out of the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this product and would not hesitate to buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to push my luck and go over and over and over the same place trying to smooth the cut.</li>
            <li>Comes with stainless steel self-sharpening blades, has high-power motor, on and off switch.  </li>
            <li>Initially the device feels cheap (maybe because of the plastic of the case)</li>
            <li>with areas for improvement this is a excellent hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li>with areas for improvement this is a excellent hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to handle.</li>
            <li>Great battery charging and life&lt;br /&gt;Great, fast, smooth cutting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in Afghanistan for a few months now and decided to cut my own hair since the barber here wasn&#x27;t cleaning his equipment properely.</li>
            <li>Having reviewed clippers before, I didn&#x27;t have really high expectations for the Conair HC1100AM I-Pro Professional Lithium Super Clipper.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been giving my self my own high and tight hair cut</li>
            <li>You can use them anywhere, since they run on a battery, they are easy to recharge, but the charge holds for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Overall 2 stars for being sharp and looking good on the picture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these a few times already and love that the power stays consistent the whole time.</li>
            <li>Love this, it cuts my hair extremely well</li>
            <li>originally purchased these to only use when traveling abroad</li>
            <li>These guides are ingeniously designed to stay in place, unlike other guides that tend to pop off during use.</li>
            <li>(I supposed it is due to the closeness of the blades)&lt;br /&gt;- more verstile as it has taper controls</li>
            <li>Although not actually \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; like true barber shop grade clippers, it still has a solid feel (and sound).</li>
            <li>I have used a variety of hair clippers over the past many years and the latest was a Wahl which performed satisfactorily for a while but died a sudden death.</li>
            <li>knew if we had a clipper that was too loud or even just once pulled the hair while trimming, it would be the last time we could get close to him with it without disguising it as a french fry or an Elmo puppet, so it was very nice to discover the Conair Super Clipper is as quiet and smooth and sharp as they come.</li>
            <li>Also the charge last a long time and comes in handy when i travel to Europe not having to worry about the voltage difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can easily see myself buying another WAHL not to far in the future.</li>
            <li>First let me say I relaize it says Professional Clipper&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be a little large for smaller hands to hold comfortably but it is contoured for easy grip.  </li>
            <li>I rarely give a full 5 stars to a product, but the Conair HC1100 Super Clipper deserves at least 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Far better and more consistent cut than my expensive corded Babyliss clippers - without the rat whip hitting ya in the chops every 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be careful because it would be easy to go overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had an older Conair that lasted about 5 yrs ...&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15 years, and have tried many brands and models over the years.  </li>
            <li>THEY CUT MUCH BETTER THAN MORE EXPENSIVE BRANDS</li>
            <li>After charging and listening to it, I quickly put it back into the box for return.</li>
            <li>One thing I really liked, which may sound silly, is the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>A very solid unit with a strong motor and very effective and fast cutting.</li>
            <li>I love it .Powerful and long lasting battery make this machine a real deal .</li>
            <li>We have purchased an old-fashioned Flowbee that we use to do the overall first cut, but were looking for something smooth and quiet to then shape and finish the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are many different attachments provided, and the various combs are easy to attach and remove, compared to other clipper models I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, everything about this shaver is high quality, even the extensions, which I don&#x27;t use since I&#x27;m bald.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Has high quality extensions&lt;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I honestly toss the carrying case and other items I don&#x27;t use, they just take up space when it will store in a much smaller area without.     </li>
            <li>I have had many corded clippers and this is definitely worth the little extra for the convenience and portability.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed that no less than 11 reviewers (and, yes, I counted!)</li>
            <li>Much easier than my old cutters with a cord.</li>
            <li>They hold a charge for a long time under use--over an hour with a full charge.</li>
            <li>They have replaced my slightly more expensive corded clippers as they are better in nearly every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>THe battery lasts SOOOOOO long and there is no worry any more of the charge giving out in the middle of a hair cut</li>
            <li>I normally buy wahl clippers but amazon didn&#x27;t have any cordless ones that ship out here that I like.  </li>
            <li>With their flimsy construction, my guess is that attachments will not last as long as those with a more substantial design.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>The accessories are what you&#x27;d find with pretty much any of the competitive units out there, and work the same.</li>
            <li>It also has 2 tapering tools, a regular comb, a clip, a nice black plastic cape, lubricating oil and a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>and I found that not only is it easy to handle, it is also reasonably quiet.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and basic enough for anyone to use.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness Amazon took it right back without hassle.</li>
            <li>Conair included several guides so that you can choose just the right length you&#x27;d like to cut your hair.  </li>
            <li>The clipper has a tapering thumb lever (takes a little practice but a nice capability that I really haven&#x27;t seen in a while, and then only on professional barber&#x27;s clippers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Long run time with quick charge times.  </li>
            <li>It says charged for a long time, and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I surmise this is the build for larger, easier handling which I don&#x27;t find it any easier than the smaller more compact Remington I used to use that was solidly built but did not cut very well.</li>
            <li>As long as this keeps up, I am happy to save money for my wife&#x27;s ridiculously overpriced salon visits.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a generic beard and just like to keep the length under control, it&#x27;ll be fine, but if you want to do any shaping or trimming you&#x27;ll need a different clipper</li>
            <li>New for me</li>
            <li>I live this thing.</li>
            <li>I contacted Conair to send a new one and they told me my model was from 2012.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get something new and what a difference these clippers</li>
            <li>Having the ability to further adjust that cut with the lever makes for a very versatile trimmer of many precise, albeit shorter lengths for trimming hair and beards, both of which I have but one a bit less than the other...     </li>
            <li>It makes cutting your hair a much more enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>My initial thought was that the wireless clippers probably weren&#x27;t as powerful as wired - but that turned out to be completely</li>
            <li>They fit better than my Wahl, and are not that difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>The brush is not long enough to clean the thicker attachments.</li>
            <li>VERY loud.  </li>
            <li>Very modern looking with LOW noise/vibration.</li>
            <li>This replacement has picked up right where the old one left off.  </li>
            <li>I do keep my hair pretty short</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to go over and over the same spot on his hair, as these cut it the first time through</li>
            <li>but this one seems to be the winner by far!</li>
            <li>so I just dial the metal adjuster back a bit and get the exact length I want.</li>
            <li>My wife has cut my hair for the entire 42 years we&#x27;ve been married.  </li>
            <li>They might work for medium hair, but are not sharp enough for either fine or coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Works good for a while, then after a few months the battery wont hold a charge long enough to trim a beard.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this product was not a bad investment at all.</li>
            <li>find that this clipper does not get as hot as my previous corded clipper, which would get so hot it would burn.</li>
            <li>the long run, these should be cheaper and better quality than any other rechargeable clipper because of its lithium ion battery and quality build.</li>
            <li>I did not think Conair would make such a high quality product, but the material is definately high quality.</li>
            <li>This thing charges in a reasonable amount of time, usually about 30 minutes or less for me (since I haven&#x27;t let the battery go to zero) and the light stops flashing to indicate full battery.</li>
            <li>Cuts OK, but a little bulky for my smaller hands.</li>
            <li>So, I rolled the dice with this CONAIR because of the cordless feature (I travel a lot) and I must say It&#x27;s good enough to keep, but bad enough to be left wishing I spent a little more money on something I could feel good about for years to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The attachments are also unique, with a single strip of plastic holding the teeth in place and a bowed back that clips onto the blade.</li>
            <li>if you are like me, it works great as a hair cutting device for, errr, \\&quot;all areas\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>its great for cutting my hair the way I always wanted to cut it</li>
            <li>I felt like a professional...</li>
            <li>The two screws holding the blade on completely came off.  </li>
            <li>I think it does a cleaner cut than his old clipper did.  </li>
            <li>Only had it about a month, but have cut my hair a couple of times and really like it.</li>
            <li>Adjustable blade very helpful for facial hair trim.</li>
            <li>Our old ones were electric and not working as well as they should.  </li>
            <li>It came with lots of accessories and a soft carrying case.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer gets nearly all within a couple passes for the length I prefer.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use my old razor.  </li>
            <li>The only downside I have is that at the lowest setting with no guard, they still leave too much hair for those of us who shave our heads.</li>
            <li>surprised this thing works as well as it does.  </li>
            <li>but I would imagine it would work very well for someone with very short hair.</li>
            <li>Also really likes the smaller trimmer.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t lose its charge like the old NiCad version.  </li>
            <li>Conair so far, I&#x27;m not too impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being loud is not just an annoyance, but it affects the quality of the cut too.</li>
            <li>You cannot do close cuts with this trimmer and if you trim the hair in sensitive parts of your skin like your chest and your underarm, it bites the skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li>Works smoothly, so far.  </li>
            <li>The cordless feature is a real convenience and the charging time is fairly short.</li>
            <li>very quiet, shape fits hand well, lithium battery holding charge very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using some old clippers for a while to keep my head and beard trimmed.</li>
            <li>all the attachments I would think you would have to become a professional just to know what to use .&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend for both home and professional use.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t vibrate nearly as much as my old clipper.</li>
            <li>Some clippers are really loud.  </li>
            <li>The case is a soft type but holds everything well.</li>
            <li>He loves it so far.</li>
            <li>It has all of the power of a corded trimmer, and yet offers the flexibility of being cordless.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I gave my 14 month old son a hair cut</li>
            <li>This Conair doesn&#x27;t feel as robust as my old Wahl, but I like it for</li>
            <li>this for my 40-year old son</li>
            <li>Either it was sitting on the shelf for years and the battery decayed or they just made a completely crappy product.</li>
            <li>Complete lack of quality control.</li>
            <li>It only needs short time for battery charging and powerful.</li>
            <li>I had tried 10yrs ago to shave my own head but was annoyed with the wired Oyster that I had bought.</li>
            <li>These are ok, but did aren&#x27;t sharp enough or powerfull enough.</li>
            <li>My husband is a professional barber and owns several high end clippers.  </li>
            <li>It is also easily brought along on trips to keep it tight as often as necessary.</li>
            <li>recharging is almost never--I only use it for small amounts of time,  charging time is a couple of hours at most --I</li>
            <li>I should have bought this Conair cordless clipper..when I first started cutting my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Most of them don&#x27;t last long and the batteries are weak and wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.the Remington mentioned above, now come with a slide button tha</li>
            <li>After  a few months one of the screws on top that hold the blade cover got loose</li>
            <li>There are eight different comb guides, plus two taper guides, one left and one right, to be used above the ears.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had to charge this 2 times, one of course is initially and  second, got it on the charger right now.</li>
            <li>which was my initial concern), lightweight and great for cutting hair on me and my son.  </li>
            <li>Much less powerful</li>
            <li>It comes with an unusual comb that is curved and has teeth on opposite sides at opposite ends of the comb.</li>
            <li>First, the blades aren&#x27;t even with the guard, so one side cuts closer than the other.  </li>
            <li>However, with this you can barely hear it over the noise!</li>
            <li>I paid a little more for them than other options</li>
            <li>is one insanely powerful beast, and completed my haircut in half the time it generally used to take on the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I do like it so far.</li>
            <li>And even at it&#x27;s closest setting, it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly close enough.  </li>
            <li>For the cutting part, I think it does a good job.</li>
            <li>My haircut was very fast, clippers were very sharp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable, clear instructions, which by the way, if you are already a clipper user just don&#x27;t bother having a look at the manual as they are just the basic stuff for maintaining and using any other clipper.</li>
            <li>More potential for giving yourself a choppy cut with these than other clippers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could tell it was underpowered, but it did work, though it didn&#x27;t live long</li>
            <li>loses edge easily, runs down quickly, not cord/cordless flexible, cheap lightweight case and/or feel, noisy, etc.  </li>
            <li>Cutting very smooth and fast.</li>
            <li>The design of the guides has been proven with time and, from my experience based on older models, the motors are well designed and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The design of the guides has been proven with time and, from my experience based on older models, the motors are well designed and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Hence we only tried the left and right ear guides - which was a pity since there were 10 hair guides for different lengths.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course there are other haircutting outfits available for less money, but would that be money</li>
            <li>and I must say it&#x27;s nice to be able to shave his head without an annoying cord in my way!</li>
            <li>It is also very quiet compared with my last 8 years old Conair beard trimmer.    </li>
            <li>The people must have received another model because this clipper was as loud as some Oreck vacuums and the lever seemed cheap and could be easily broken.</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet and doesn&#x27;t leave uncut hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I did a test to see how long the batteries would run the clippers from full power to dead and the results where 1hr.and 40min.</li>
            <li>The kit is handy but the bib is not much but a really thin piece of plastic with strings to tie.</li>
            <li>Still using because this cordless trimmer leaves way too many hairs uncut using the different levels versus my very old corded Wahl which cuts through all levels with zero issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Assuming this device lasts for a few years, the price seems very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I shave my head once a week and after the 3rd use I generally have to put the charger on it.</li>
            <li>especially for my younger child who does not want the big trimming blade or a scissor anywhere near his face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>especially for my younger child who does not want the big trimming blade or a scissor anywhere near his face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot or feel heavy to the hand.</li>
            <li>I have been cutting my own hair since the end of middle school - less of an economical reason than just a simple task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it is also much cleaner (than go to a barbershop and sharing the clippers with other people - yikes!).  </li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and it cuts it with easy.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and holds a charge for a long time I&#x27;ve had it for about half a year and only charged it once using it about once a month</li>
            <li>I had tried cordless clippers in the past and they never seemed to work right.</li>
            <li>I needed to individually zip-loc bag the items in some semblance of organization, as it&#x27;s hard to throw all this stuff into one bag with no pockets or dividers and quickly zip it up without everything falling out.</li>
            <li>is a little too large, you could squeeze 2 sets of clippers and guides in here.</li>
            <li>I have three thick haired heads to trim on a monthly basis and this new clipper handles them very well</li>
            <li>But even if I knew the screw would get loose and need to be fixed.  </li>
            <li>We bought a Conair 18 years ago and only stopped using it recently since the older model required long charge times and it wasn&#x27;t holding the charge for very long.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thin and kind of wavy, was way too long</li>
            <li>The clippers literally shuts down with a full charge.....turn them back on and the device shuts down again.</li>
            <li>My corded Wahl on the other hand is very loud and my son will protest if I use it to cut his hair.</li>
            <li>Would have preferred better quality cutting heads, but I can&#x27;t complain of it&#x27;s performance thus far.</li>

            <li> the adjustability of the clipper lengths is perfect for fading as well.</li>
            <li> basically the best clippers I have</li>
            <li> It comes with all the guides someone would need (I just use one), scissors (not the greatest, but they work), oil, cleaning brush, and a zippered case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It had a nice case and all of the accessories inside the box but the trimmer itself didn&#x27;t impress me at all.</li>
            <li> Really nice unit.</li>

            <li> Been doing my own head for years now</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so nice having these cordless.</li>
            <li> Conair really did a wonderful job designing these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I liked the Wahl corded clipper</li>
            <li> I am by no means a barber but to me these feel every bit as good as the Wahl clippers that I had for the better part of 20 years.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always shaved my own head.  </li>
            <li> And it comes with a nice zipper bag to hold all of the goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice, quality piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> I liked how it looked.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cordless clipper to cut my own hair</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of bulky for detail work, but it works well for my bald head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon has a good return policy, I will get a Wahl.</li>
            <li> the price is right, good quality, great reviews</li>
            <li> very gook item, the quality is very good, I am very satisfied with this product, would like to recommend to others.</li>
            <li> whatever your hair-cutting needs are, I highly recommend this product - go forth and do great clippings!</li>
            <li> The Conair Super Clipper has some features that make it ideal for touching up between haircuts or fine-tuning a home cut.</li>
            <li> Charges easily and cordless is good</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by telling you that I have a used a top of the line Wahl for many years and LOVED it.....</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It will break very easily like it did on me.  </li>
            <li> Cordless with a lithium battery makes this clipper very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cutter is and motor are very strong.  </li>
            <li> He says that these are the best ones he has ever had, bar far!  </li>
            <li> Is good , it that&#x27;s the job , good price, love it, fast delivery !!</li>
            <li> This is good, not too light, not too plastic.</li>
            <li> Perfect cuts and not as loud as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Powerful machine with great battery life.</li>
            <li> I was able to cut my own hair no problem</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly and gave me a pretty darn good cut for my first time.</li>
            <li> So far he&#x27;s been very impressed.  </li>
            <li> The price is much more affordable and they&#x27;re just as effective.  </li>
            <li> A nice feature that more clipper sets need to imitate of this set is you have to push the sides together to get them on/off the clipper.</li>
            <li> Works great and is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Works very powerful and cuts really good.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are good and it is very powerful.</li>
            <li> It is great quality and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> You Tube was a great help the first time I cut my hair---took me about 30 minutes</li>
            <li> These clippers are very light compared to the corded version.</li>
            <li> I found this clipper product to be handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use it to cut my own hair - easy to do.</li>
            <li> This device charges quickly and holds its charge for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> sure this would make a good clipper for a full haircut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this, cuts my hair nice and battery lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many of the rechargeables and they just don&#x27;t work that well -</li>
            <li> I like that I am able to go chordless with it</li>
            <li> favorite feature about this product is the taper control which allows you to change the length of the blade from a 0 to about a 1 without having to add or remove any blade attachments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Which is a shame because my last conair trimmer was the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Cuts and works better than my corded one.</li>
            <li> For years I used a corded clipper and wanted something that allowed more freedom.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> took off the one star for the slightly more plasticy feel.</li>
            <li> I wonder how many reviewed soon after the purchase ?</li>
            <li> Outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love the cordless feature.  </li>
            <li> &quot; This unit allows you to do so with the adjustment screws on the top plate.</li>
            <li> But...my favorite two features are (1) the on/off switch is out of the way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought them</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with the purchased.</li>
            <li> Seems to work OK for my use, which is to touch up a buzz cut in between trips to the salon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully this is a helpful hint to you - and if yes, please don&#x27;t forget to press the \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; vote below :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt; - cannot get better than this for the price point.</li>
            <li> so you have a better battery experience with the product).</li>
            <li> I love everything about them.</li>
            <li> Love bring able to use with our without a cord.</li>
            <li> I would say they are better than my Whaul plug in the wall clippers.</li>
            <li> After owning it for several months now I can say this is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Better that the Wahl that I had.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head with a #1 for many years and have had my share of both electric and rechargeable trimmers.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best one I have owned.</li>
            <li> He uses them mostly for trimming his beard a line up</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend anyone to get one of this.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has a lithium ion battery.  </li>
            <li> It has tons of power and cuts better than the corded Wahl did.</li>
            <li> and I love that I can cut my son&#x27;s hair as he roams about (he&#x27;s two).  </li>
            <li> - I love that they are cordless.</li>
            <li> storage bag included is a nice touch, although the scissors and cape included are rather cheap.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand over many others and decided to give this one a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I love the cordless feature.</li>
            <li> These stay charged for ages, and cut so much better.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times since getting them and am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I am extraordinarily pleased.</li>
            <li> but I am more than pleased with their operation.</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> An outstanding Haircut Kit, containing all the accessories you&#x27;ll need for a well done trimming job.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can not imagine a better clipper at any price.</li>
            <li> There are alot of attachments, most of which I  would not use.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have to tip anyone :)  </li>
            <li> I bought it more than 8 months ago</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the option of cordless or corded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably recharge mine about 2x a year mostly because I want to.  </li>
            <li> also love not having to worry about the cord getting wrapped up in everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On/Off switch could be designed better.</li>
            <li> one more usage - it cuts through pet-hair like butter.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been giving me my cuts for years and better than any barber Ive had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can do better than this set.</li>
            <li> its dedicated power cord, my Wahl shaver and its accessories work much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can do better than this set.</li>
            <li> its dedicated power cord, my Wahl shaver and its accessories work much better.</li>
            <li> and it works great for my very close crop hair.  </li>
            <li> This works much better.  </li>
            <li> I suggest they make the button rubber so that you can grip it better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> It prevents accidental shutoff, which is important to me as I cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair clipper that I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where it could be better :</li>
            <li> A pop out edging trimmer would have been  lovely bonus.</li>
            <li> A pop out edging trimmer would have been  lovely bonus.</li>
            <li> well, I love the Conair more.</li>
            <li> Battery life is excellent and I have yet had to charge it back up.</li>
            <li> Buy it, and enjoy....as I am! :-)</li>
            <li> great so far!!!</li>
            <li> (most hair clippers are NOT like this)--this is a great feature and important for getting a consistent cut.  </li>
            <li> after researching for awhile, I picked this one up and so far, so good!  </li>
            <li> attachments come on and off perfectly in stays charged for a long time</li>
            <li> The first thing that I loved was that it came charged.</li>
            <li> The comb attachments are very good, especially the innovative ear combs.  </li>
            <li> It runs smooth, very quiet, with no electrical cord to worry about getting in the way, great !</li>
            <li> , perfect smooth cut everytime with different length guards.  </li>
            <li> It works well, no vibrating, is not overly noisey, fits the hand nicely and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product so far!</li>
            <li> If you have longer hair (greater than 1/4 inch), should work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> and I think that has more to do with my fine hair than the clippers (as I had this issue with my Wahl&#x27;s and the clippers in Germany as well.)  </li>
            <li> Being able to adjust the blade is huge.</li>
            <li> So far, this clipper has done a great job.</li>
            <li> The price was okay and the product arrived on time with free shipping.</li>
            <li> and he sat comfortably still for the most part.</li>
            <li> I might be exaggerating in my title, because I&#x27;m pretty sure that some barber somewhere has better clippers than these, but they&#x27;re definitely the best hair clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Works great so far and seems quality</li>
            <li> Charges fast and has good run time.</li>
            <li> very prifesional!!batrery is good</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great and the quick charge feature definitely comes in handy.  </li>
            <li> Easy for use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The guide combs come on and off easily,</li>
            <li> They were also easily to remove. . .</li>
            <li> Most importantly: clean and lubricate the blades after each use and keep the protective cover over the blades, when in storage.</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to read, but not comprehensive.</li>
            <li> Lots of power and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep it clean and well oiled</li>
            <li> I have to say these clippers are outstanding, at full charge they are a monster and clip hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts excellently, it does not leave ragged ends, it does not pull or bog down.</li>
            <li> Cuts just fine.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for the 2 times I used it before it died</li>
            <li> It cuts fine.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to handle without cord.  </li>
            <li> We have had this for about 1 month and it works fine, as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a fine instrument; you can feel the quality in it.  </li>
            <li> This haircut kit works fine, just have to practice a bit</li>
            <li> Thankfully amazon does quick returns!</li>
            <li> I know it probably fit design wise, but I would of liked it right in the middle of the top of the unit instead of having to search for it in your palm region when your holding it.</li>
            <li> I found them easy to use, easy to clean, and</li>
            <li> They are smooth, quiet, strong and battery life on them in great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really a nice kit and a very decent value in my judgment.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this hair trimmer and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even more powerful than the corded clippers I&#x27;ve been using, and it is LIGHT.</li>
            <li> A good value, but they feel cheaply made and are a bit loud.</li>
            <li> Being cordless does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Not because it isn&#x27;t a great product, which it is, but because I didn&#x27;t think it would be any different than what I have already</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a solid product and seems of great quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the teeth are like running the prongs of a cheap metal fork on your head.  </li>
            <li> These are the most powerful clippers around, but they do the job.</li>
            <li> The item description led me to believe that it would shave my bald head smooth.</li>
            <li> Runs quiet, cuts great, sturdy cutter heads.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few trimmers in my years, a couple passes is an excellent performance.</li>
            <li> which is FAR superior to good old Wahl that I had to literally Duct tape in order to keep the guard on.</li>
            <li> I like how light it is and that it&#x27;s cordless.  </li>
            <li> Kit contents are kinda cheap, but what do you expect for $30.</li>
            <li> It was fairly easy to do and never had any hair get caught, cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> easy to clean</li>
            <li> I became accustomed to spending only $20-$30 on WAHL clippers and have gotten great results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONAIR doesn&#x27;t seem to give as smooth of a cut as the WAHL clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> However there is a LED light that will flash when you have 3 min left.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Smooth cut.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great, the charge lasts for about 5 total head buzzing sessions</li>
            <li> Yes its cordless so no annoying cord always getting tangled with this.</li>
            <li> Even though the plastic clipper attachments look cheap, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them,.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how this device has such great reviews.</li>
            <li> The noise level is not objectionable, the weight is comfortable and the grip is comfortable as well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve always just gotten the cheapest model available and used it until it broke</li>
            <li> Can use either with cord or cord free.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it&#x27;s a great hair cutter, it&#x27;s a bit too big and clunky to be used for any beard or mustache detail work.</li>
            <li> you can see in my video, head shaving is a precise art,</li>
            <li> comes with oil that you need in order to lubricate the blades, a cape (a must for ticklish kids!) and scissors for the detailed areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great clipper, look no further.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> The corded wahl is far superior .  </li>
            <li> SO far so good</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, with adequate power, and exceptional battery life.</li>
            <li> This has been the best so far -- motor seems to run at the right speed regardless of how much hair has to be cut.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very nice same with the attachments that go with it.  </li>
            <li> Even the barber cape was very useful to keep the hair falling to one place and not to my clothes.    </li>
            <li> Light weight, which makes it travel friendly.</li>
            <li> I was aware that  my 35 year old son cut his own hair for about 6 years and decided I&#x27;d try to cut my own also...</li>
            <li> Light and compact, Cuts clean and doesn&#x27;t snag hair.</li>
            <li> The super cheap guide combs are working just fine, but again</li>
            <li> The cut is smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> The lever adjustment is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Every weekend I go through my hair-cutting routines to trim off before shower - very easy and fast (just need about 3 minutes</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t charged it since the original charge and have used it maybe 10 times.</li>
            <li> but I expect to be happily using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> but now I can get perfect fades from skin to the 7-guard every week without having to wait in line, pay $20 bucks plus tip and try to come up with 30 minutes of small talk for the barber.</li>
            <li> Btw, I&#x27;ve used these for years, yes I know how to clean them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for him and so far seems to be a lasting item.  </li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly without pulling hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have a job where I have to always be clean shaven</li>
            <li> It charges fast, is very sturdy yet fairly lightweight, and cuts like a champ.  </li>
            <li> This Conair clipper is built much nicer than I anticipated, the battery life is good and it cuts really well.</li>
            <li> and it was far better than what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> I could have done without the super cheap barber scissors, super cheap comb and super super cheap barber cape.  </li>
            <li> Charges fast and very light weight.</li>
            <li> great battery sounds strong and constant through out the whole hair cut.</li>
            <li> My grandson is a special needs child and he hates haircuts from a barber.</li>
            <li> The battery life is just right!</li>
            <li> When I first picked up the Clippers, I quickly noticed how light they were and questioned the quality of the set but after using them a few times, I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> they are very easy to handle and quiet for the most part.</li>
            <li> Love this, very quiet and of very good quality, would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I used it already four times from its first, original full charge and still going strong (your mileage may vary).</li>
            <li> I really did look better.</li>
            <li> so I took that as a good sign and ended up buying this last night.</li>
            <li> Clippers also include a nice soft storage case.v</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is that the lever has a number of fixed height settings, which means it does move unless you want it to</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper than buying another wahl and it works much better for my beard.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Conair Cordless Mustache Trimmer for many years, and it has served me very well.  </li>
            <li> For the price of two or three haircuts, you can own this set that includes a plethora of attachments and offers cordless operation as well.</li>
            <li> Full accessories kit.</li>
            <li> It has many lengths to choose from and is very compact for storage.</li>
            <li> , I would definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for a good set of wireless hair clippers.</li>
            <li> A full 3 hour charge lasts for 75 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> The Superr Clipper cuts quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad for some 5 haircuts and 7 trims.</li>
            <li> The Conair HC1100AM I-Pro Professional Super Clipper is actually a pretty good clipper.</li>
            <li> Great product, value like an $80 to $100 product, i.e. huge value for half the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent trimmer, but not as good as older models.  </li>
            <li> 3-hour full charge for 75 minutes of use, or 15-minute quick charge for 15 minutes of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It allows me to quickly trim what I need without worrying about any cord tangling,</li>
            <li> these charge quickly.</li>
            <li> being cordless does facilitate the process, and gives you multiple options (especially on vacation in a hotel) to choose the best and brightest location to do a cut.</li>
            <li> Clippers charge quickly and cut well.</li>
            <li> a 15-minute Quick Charge allows 15 minutes of</li>
            <li> arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice blue LED light to indicate charging.  </li>
            <li> Charges quick</li>
            <li> It works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> You can also do a 15 minute quick charge for 15 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> On my first attempt I was able to cut my hair exactly as I wanted</li>
            <li> If you are in a hurry and forgot to charge it you can charge it for 15 minutes to get a quick 15 minutes of use, or use it corded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can just tell by the weight and feel of the clippers and its components that this is a much better constructed high quality set of Clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works great, charges fast, easy to change combs and definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had to use a corded clipper (except for a few months in Japan when I had a good Philips cordless which died) which was ok since they were powerful on coarse/Asian hair, but often the cord would tangle, knock something over, limit where I could cut my hair, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt; - battery is way better than other products that cost 3x the price (e.g. Oral-B toothbrush!!)&lt;br /&gt; - comes in handy fabric travel bag with everything you need</li>
            <li> It has a bigger case and it&#x27;s so much easier to cut my own hair with!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to finally have some that will charge quickly.  </li>
            <li> Work great, cut well, don&#x27;t get too hot, cordless is definitely a plus, especially in a place where free wall outlets are not every where, no loss in power without the cord!</li>
            <li> Compared to my old worn out clippers, these are very smooth and efficient.</li>
            <li> I it works fantastic, the machine is very strong and the battery holds the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, no cord, easy breezy.</li>
            <li> large number of attachments and accessories that are included makes this set very useful indeed.  </li>
            <li> Works well, is light, and very adjustable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely purchase if you like to shave your own head instead of going to a hair</li>
            <li> Not that loud compared to most buzzers.</li>
            <li> Lightweight yet powerful.</li>
            <li> Always have a fresh cut with these.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This clipper is powerful and versatile.</li>
            <li> Clippers have a nice selection of lengths, the charge cable is in the back</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t designed for &amp;#34;self cuts&amp;#34; but has a solid motor and comes in a nice kit.  </li>
            <li> A bit pricy, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It feels honestly like its made of cheap plastic with a hollow cavity.</li>
            <li> Also tried my beard without the combs, and pleased with results.&lt;br /&gt;Charges much faster and holds charge much longer too.  </li>
            <li> this thing works great so far, if you just wanna keep  the short scruffy look  and not a close shave</li>
            <li> This is a neat, useful clipper that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> wow i love these....</li>
            <li> The clippers are definatly worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have an old Wahl corded trimmer that I&#x27;ve used for many years.  </li>
            <li> But for now, it is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> NOW they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised by the high quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> for several reasons ( cheaper,  much more convenient, I can give myself a full hair cut and do quick trims whenever I wanted ).</li>
            <li> but I am sure that with the right eyes and dexterity you can give yourself professional looking haircuts.</li>
            <li> Charges pretty quickly and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> I had an older model with the old type battery for many years and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sharp and battery life is good</li>
            <li> they cut just as good as any I&#x27;ve ever owned (and as a military guy who has cut his own hair for a LONG time, I&#x27;ve used a bunch of clippers).  </li>
            <li> Conair seems to have gotten it right, with all the accessories plus the blade position options.</li>
            <li> the clippers didn&#x27;t work right with the power inverters, so we bought another brand of clippers over there</li>
            <li> It charged very quickly right out of the box, I did not time it, but in just a couple of hours, it was fully charged.  </li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase after the first few uses (just recharging it now).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better these are compared to the average corded clippers found in most stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 8 years now, and this is by far the best clipper</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure these will last much longer than the Braun which felt light and flimsy compared to this.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I spent the money to upgrade to a cordless trimmer</li>
            <li> This really needs an adjustable head instead of a bag full of snap ons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying a second and third one for my brother and dad, because these are great.</li>
            <li> They idea of cordless is good but the reality is the cutting is not so good.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice to know how much charge is left in device wheb</li>
            <li> 4 stars because they are a great value, minus 1 star for being loud and lacking amount of charge remaining in battery.</li>
            <li> The price now is $10.00 less than what I paid for so for those buying now, you&#x27;re getting a really good deal.</li>
            <li> Fantastic , light weight trimmer with all the necessary guards.</li>
            <li> The motor is quite powerful and does a great job with thick hair.</li>
            <li> very solid instrument, I tried it just a couple of times and seems very accurate.</li>
            <li> I paired this with the shavewell mirror which could be larger but very light and no concerns about breaking glass in the shower.</li>
            <li> Dad gets haircuts at home - he likes it very much.</li>
            <li> But i like it very much.</li>
            <li> I like this clipper very much.</li>
            <li> And it was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had to complain, I would say that it could use a few more guides for different shave lengths, but I am still very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight, quiet, and works well.</li>
            <li> Not as good as some other clippers I&#x27;ve used, but I guess at this price you don&#x27;t really get to complain.</li>
            <li> It is much heftier than the ones that I&#x27;ve had with other brands, and allows a good cleaning of the blades.</li>
            <li> Ok trimmers, have only used a couple of times but they&#x27;re very loud even after oiling and feel slightly cheap.</li>
            <li> Normally takes me 30 minutes to cut my hair and works fine the whole time.</li>
            <li> so all I had to do was put a small washer and it was back to perfect.</li>
            <li> Works really well, and all of the pieces are useful and well-made.</li>
            <li> Its powerful and being cordless its very convenient.</li>
            <li> ; which was a great idea, but it forced a near-crewcut.  </li>
            <li> I upped my rating from one star to four based on the fact that the first trimmer would not charge.</li>
            <li> on April 26, 2014]  I fully charged the hair clipper when I first received it in January, and have been using it every week ever since.  </li>
            <li> This is my first clipper.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions so let it charge for the minimum 3 hours for the first time</li>
            <li> This morning I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li> , REALLY!</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong comes with everything you need and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Cuts hair like hot knife thru butter, works</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared, at first, but then I got to thinking. . .</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really more professional-quality construction than actually for professionas because barbers need corded clippers as they don&#x27;t have time for</li>
            <li> But the first one we received had to be returned because it would not run without a power cord.</li>
            <li> My 4 star rating is because of the defective first one.</li>
            <li> Sometimes these do-it-at-home clippers fall short in one or more ways . . .</li>
            <li> Is it your first kit and you have nothing to compare to?</li>
            <li> Washed it out after first use.</li>
            <li> (I charged the battery 15 hrs for first charge as directed)</li>
            <li> Cuts through hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> --first cut.  </li>
            <li> Cuts better than the Norelco I bought 2 years earlier.  </li>
            <li> , many attachments for different lengths.  </li>
            <li> Last night I tried out of the box (without even charging the device) and I was able to cut my hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> I am able to give my child and husband a simple hair cut</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the lithium ion battery, which means that I don&#x27;t have to worry about this shaver getting a battery memory, like my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With numerous mirrors, she was able to give herself a haircut.</li>
            <li> Did not work after first charge.</li>
            <li> A tooth on the guide piece that had the most height options broke and left a jagged edge.</li>
            <li> For those outside America, you will love this, but here, we work in inches.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, but not too loud.  </li>
            <li> VERY powerful motor, and sleek, professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the laymen, it is useful for simple trimming but you have to be brave to allow your spouse to try the other hair guides.</li>
            <li> The battery life is more than long enough once fully charged and cuts very smooth.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair every other time.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable and battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 4 or 5 cuts so far and though it&#x27;s not as powerful as a corded clipper, it&#x27;s powerful enough (and more powerful than the old one I had).  </li>
            <li> Nice  feel to this clipper, a little heavy but has good balance.  </li>
            <li> Normally I would bump it down to 4 stars, but the Super Cliper is so great, that I leave it at a solid 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Cheap, good and one of the few electronics sold on Amazon that has dual-voltage (100-240V) that works outside U.S.</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe not a professional</li>
            <li> I love how long it lasts on one charge.</li>
            <li> Today is my first time to recharge it - the battery is really holding up.  </li>
            <li> I would appreciate a case with more internal dividers but overall, this kit has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> For this reason, you pretty much have to rinse all the attachments with water to remove the hair and then wait for them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> They are made of good quality plastic material (by comparison to others I owned in the past).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s sharp, gives me a nice close shave on my head, not so close on my face without extra effort, which is fine.</li>
            <li> main clipper unit is solidly constructed (in China, of course) and is in most ways comparable to the Remington unit that I reviewed a while ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair clippers for a very long time and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> The new plastic guides clips are of very very cheap construction and are crooked.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty quiet and light.</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair I bought, primarily because I needed a cordless trimmer, although I still have the first one.  </li>
            <li> , then I realized that it can be easily removed by simply squeeze from the side!  </li>
            <li> Does the job, easy to do it myself with all different clips it provided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky to have three young boys to practice on</li>
            <li> The various attachments easily latch-on and slide-off</li>
            <li> The build is solid and easily handled.</li>
            <li> and more importantlydid not pull a single hair.</li>
            <li> The Conair Professional Super Clipper is very well made, sturdy and with good-quality combs included.  </li>
            <li> The little case for storage is also nice.  </li>
            <li> I will saw it doeskin sound like it moves back and forth as fast as the corded Wahl however it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or anything</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it 5 stars so early is that I worked selling power tools when I was in college and lithium ion batteries are worth it.  </li>
            <li> &gt; The led doesn&#x27;t give much warning.</li>
            <li> Cordless convenience is a great benefit especially when you&#x27;re cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> He does an awesome job cutting his hair and now he doesn&#x27;t have to hassle with the cord getting in the way.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to use.  </li>
            <li> Also, having the option of cord or cordless is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Much lighter and easier to handle than corded models, but these have plenty of power.</li>
            <li> but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly !</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very ergonomic and compact.</li>
            <li> This clipper and attachments works really well.  </li>
            <li> They cut very well though I would be scared of the results of dropping them...</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s cordless and runs a reasonable amount of time for you to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these clippers!</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> Wife uses it to cut my hair and she really likes the cordless feature.</li>
            <li> If you leaving it sitting for a month, it&#x27;ll still be ready to go.</li>
            <li> well, thank you much.</li>
            <li> This cordeless edition has made hair cuts so much easier.  </li>
            <li> Hold a charge very well-</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from these clippers but they have really delivered.  </li>
            <li> Conair support were very helpful in solving that problem</li>
            <li> I real like it</li>
            <li> Because of the size of the head I can trim much quicker.</li>
            <li> I dare say that the use of the term \\&quot;professional\\&quot; is a bit much. . .</li>
            <li> My Wahl clippers are much heavier and feel \\&quot;stronger\\&quot; than the Conair. . .</li>
            <li> The blades are stainless steel, are self-sharpening, and work very efficiently.  </li>
            <li> A gentle side-to-side squeeze when attaching or detaching these guides locks them in place-</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really been adventerous with these clippers</li>
            <li> I had a corded Wahl trimmer that lasted this whole time without any real issues besides the pesky cord always tangling and in the way.</li>
            <li> has 3 more), and I tried to be careful with it each time.</li>
            <li> There is a light that tells you when the battery is getting low and the same light also can tell you when it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> The Power Head is relatively light and its Lithium battery has plenty of juice for several haircut sessions...</li>
            <li> Additionally, replacement of the blades for whatever reason could be accomplished without any tools.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the cutting ability and control.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, it absolutely blows the clippers we&#x27;ve been using out of the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like this product and would not hesitate to buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to push my luck and go over and over and over the same place trying to smooth the cut.</li>
            <li> Comes with stainless steel self-sharpening blades, has high-power motor, on and off switch.  </li>
            <li> Initially the device feels cheap (maybe because of the plastic of the case)</li>
            <li> with areas for improvement this is a excellent hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li> with areas for improvement this is a excellent hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to handle.</li>
            <li> Great battery charging and life&lt;br /&gt;Great, fast, smooth cutting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in Afghanistan for a few months now and decided to cut my own hair since the barber here wasn&#x27;t cleaning his equipment properely.</li>
            <li> Having reviewed clippers before, I didn&#x27;t have really high expectations for the Conair HC1100AM I-Pro Professional Lithium Super Clipper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving my self my own high and tight hair cut</li>
            <li> You can use them anywhere, since they run on a battery, they are easy to recharge, but the charge holds for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Overall 2 stars for being sharp and looking good on the picture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these a few times already and love that the power stays consistent the whole time.</li>
            <li> Love this, it cuts my hair extremely well</li>
            <li> originally purchased these to only use when traveling abroad</li>
            <li> These guides are ingeniously designed to stay in place, unlike other guides that tend to pop off during use.</li>
            <li> (I supposed it is due to the closeness of the blades)&lt;br /&gt;- more verstile as it has taper controls</li>
            <li> Although not actually \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; like true barber shop grade clippers, it still has a solid feel (and sound).</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of hair clippers over the past many years and the latest was a Wahl which performed satisfactorily for a while but died a sudden death.</li>
            <li> knew if we had a clipper that was too loud or even just once pulled the hair while trimming, it would be the last time we could get close to him with it without disguising it as a french fry or an Elmo puppet, so it was very nice to discover the Conair Super Clipper is as quiet and smooth and sharp as they come.</li>
            <li> Also the charge last a long time and comes in handy when i travel to Europe not having to worry about the voltage difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can easily see myself buying another WAHL not to far in the future.</li>
            <li> First let me say I relaize it says Professional Clipper&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be a little large for smaller hands to hold comfortably but it is contoured for easy grip.  </li>
            <li> I rarely give a full 5 stars to a product, but the Conair HC1100 Super Clipper deserves at least 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Far better and more consistent cut than my expensive corded Babyliss clippers - without the rat whip hitting ya in the chops every 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful because it would be easy to go overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had an older Conair that lasted about 5 yrs ...&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15 years, and have tried many brands and models over the years.  </li>
            <li> THEY CUT MUCH BETTER THAN MORE EXPENSIVE BRANDS</li>
            <li> After charging and listening to it, I quickly put it back into the box for return.</li>
            <li> One thing I really liked, which may sound silly, is the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> A very solid unit with a strong motor and very effective and fast cutting.</li>
            <li> I love it .Powerful and long lasting battery make this machine a real deal .</li>
            <li> We have purchased an old-fashioned Flowbee that we use to do the overall first cut, but were looking for something smooth and quiet to then shape and finish the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are many different attachments provided, and the various combs are easy to attach and remove, compared to other clipper models I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> , everything about this shaver is high quality, even the extensions, which I don&#x27;t use since I&#x27;m bald.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Has high quality extensions&lt;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I honestly toss the carrying case and other items I don&#x27;t use, they just take up space when it will store in a much smaller area without.     </li>
            <li> I have had many corded clippers and this is definitely worth the little extra for the convenience and portability.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed that no less than 11 reviewers (and, yes, I counted!)</li>
            <li> Much easier than my old cutters with a cord.</li>
            <li> They hold a charge for a long time under use--over an hour with a full charge.</li>
            <li> They have replaced my slightly more expensive corded clippers as they are better in nearly every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> THe battery lasts SOOOOOO long and there is no worry any more of the charge giving out in the middle of a hair cut</li>
            <li> I normally buy wahl clippers but amazon didn&#x27;t have any cordless ones that ship out here that I like.  </li>
            <li> With their flimsy construction, my guess is that attachments will not last as long as those with a more substantial design.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> The accessories are what you&#x27;d find with pretty much any of the competitive units out there, and work the same.</li>
            <li> It also has 2 tapering tools, a regular comb, a clip, a nice black plastic cape, lubricating oil and a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> and I found that not only is it easy to handle, it is also reasonably quiet.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and basic enough for anyone to use.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness Amazon took it right back without hassle.</li>
            <li> Conair included several guides so that you can choose just the right length you&#x27;d like to cut your hair.  </li>
            <li> The clipper has a tapering thumb lever (takes a little practice but a nice capability that I really haven&#x27;t seen in a while, and then only on professional barber&#x27;s clippers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long run time with quick charge times.  </li>
            <li> It says charged for a long time, and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I surmise this is the build for larger, easier handling which I don&#x27;t find it any easier than the smaller more compact Remington I used to use that was solidly built but did not cut very well.</li>
            <li> As long as this keeps up, I am happy to save money for my wife&#x27;s ridiculously overpriced salon visits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a generic beard and just like to keep the length under control, it&#x27;ll be fine, but if you want to do any shaping or trimming you&#x27;ll need a different clipper</li>
            <li> New for me</li>
            <li> I live this thing.</li>
            <li> I contacted Conair to send a new one and they told me my model was from 2012.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get something new and what a difference these clippers</li>
            <li> Having the ability to further adjust that cut with the lever makes for a very versatile trimmer of many precise, albeit shorter lengths for trimming hair and beards, both of which I have but one a bit less than the other...     </li>
            <li> It makes cutting your hair a much more enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> My initial thought was that the wireless clippers probably weren&#x27;t as powerful as wired - but that turned out to be completely</li>
            <li> They fit better than my Wahl, and are not that difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> The brush is not long enough to clean the thicker attachments.</li>
            <li> VERY loud.  </li>
            <li> Very modern looking with LOW noise/vibration.</li>
            <li> This replacement has picked up right where the old one left off.  </li>
            <li> I do keep my hair pretty short</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go over and over the same spot on his hair, as these cut it the first time through</li>
            <li> but this one seems to be the winner by far!</li>
            <li> so I just dial the metal adjuster back a bit and get the exact length I want.</li>
            <li> My wife has cut my hair for the entire 42 years we&#x27;ve been married.  </li>
            <li> They might work for medium hair, but are not sharp enough for either fine or coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Works good for a while, then after a few months the battery wont hold a charge long enough to trim a beard.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product was not a bad investment at all.</li>
            <li> find that this clipper does not get as hot as my previous corded clipper, which would get so hot it would burn.</li>
            <li> the long run, these should be cheaper and better quality than any other rechargeable clipper because of its lithium ion battery and quality build.</li>
            <li> I did not think Conair would make such a high quality product, but the material is definately high quality.</li>
            <li> This thing charges in a reasonable amount of time, usually about 30 minutes or less for me (since I haven&#x27;t let the battery go to zero) and the light stops flashing to indicate full battery.</li>
            <li> Cuts OK, but a little bulky for my smaller hands.</li>
            <li> So, I rolled the dice with this CONAIR because of the cordless feature (I travel a lot) and I must say It&#x27;s good enough to keep, but bad enough to be left wishing I spent a little more money on something I could feel good about for years to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The attachments are also unique, with a single strip of plastic holding the teeth in place and a bowed back that clips onto the blade.</li>
            <li> if you are like me, it works great as a hair cutting device for, errr, \\&quot;all areas\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> its great for cutting my hair the way I always wanted to cut it</li>
            <li> I felt like a professional...</li>
            <li> The two screws holding the blade on completely came off.  </li>
            <li> I think it does a cleaner cut than his old clipper did.  </li>
            <li> Only had it about a month, but have cut my hair a couple of times and really like it.</li>
            <li> Adjustable blade very helpful for facial hair trim.</li>
            <li> Our old ones were electric and not working as well as they should.  </li>
            <li> It came with lots of accessories and a soft carrying case.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer gets nearly all within a couple passes for the length I prefer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use my old razor.  </li>
            <li> The only downside I have is that at the lowest setting with no guard, they still leave too much hair for those of us who shave our heads.</li>
            <li> surprised this thing works as well as it does.  </li>
            <li> but I would imagine it would work very well for someone with very short hair.</li>
            <li> Also really likes the smaller trimmer.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t lose its charge like the old NiCad version.  </li>
            <li> Conair so far, I&#x27;m not too impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being loud is not just an annoyance, but it affects the quality of the cut too.</li>
            <li> You cannot do close cuts with this trimmer and if you trim the hair in sensitive parts of your skin like your chest and your underarm, it bites the skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> Works smoothly, so far.  </li>
            <li> The cordless feature is a real convenience and the charging time is fairly short.</li>
            <li> very quiet, shape fits hand well, lithium battery holding charge very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using some old clippers for a while to keep my head and beard trimmed.</li>
            <li> all the attachments I would think you would have to become a professional just to know what to use .&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend for both home and professional use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t vibrate nearly as much as my old clipper.</li>
            <li> Some clippers are really loud.  </li>
            <li> The case is a soft type but holds everything well.</li>
            <li> He loves it so far.</li>
            <li> It has all of the power of a corded trimmer, and yet offers the flexibility of being cordless.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I gave my 14 month old son a hair cut</li>
            <li> This Conair doesn&#x27;t feel as robust as my old Wahl, but I like it for</li>
            <li> this for my 40-year old son</li>
            <li> Either it was sitting on the shelf for years and the battery decayed or they just made a completely crappy product.</li>
            <li> Complete lack of quality control.</li>
            <li> It only needs short time for battery charging and powerful.</li>
            <li> I had tried 10yrs ago to shave my own head but was annoyed with the wired Oyster that I had bought.</li>
            <li> These are ok, but did aren&#x27;t sharp enough or powerfull enough.</li>
            <li> My husband is a professional barber and owns several high end clippers.  </li>
            <li> It is also easily brought along on trips to keep it tight as often as necessary.</li>
            <li> recharging is almost never--I only use it for small amounts of time,  charging time is a couple of hours at most --I</li>
            <li> I should have bought this Conair cordless clipper..when I first started cutting my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Most of them don&#x27;t last long and the batteries are weak and wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.the Remington mentioned above, now come with a slide button tha</li>
            <li> After  a few months one of the screws on top that hold the blade cover got loose</li>
            <li> There are eight different comb guides, plus two taper guides, one left and one right, to be used above the ears.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to charge this 2 times, one of course is initially and  second, got it on the charger right now.</li>
            <li> which was my initial concern), lightweight and great for cutting hair on me and my son.  </li>
            <li> Much less powerful</li>
            <li> It comes with an unusual comb that is curved and has teeth on opposite sides at opposite ends of the comb.</li>
            <li> First, the blades aren&#x27;t even with the guard, so one side cuts closer than the other.  </li>
            <li> However, with this you can barely hear it over the noise!</li>
            <li> I paid a little more for them than other options</li>
            <li> is one insanely powerful beast, and completed my haircut in half the time it generally used to take on the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I do like it so far.</li>
            <li> And even at it&#x27;s closest setting, it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly close enough.  </li>
            <li> For the cutting part, I think it does a good job.</li>
            <li> My haircut was very fast, clippers were very sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable, clear instructions, which by the way, if you are already a clipper user just don&#x27;t bother having a look at the manual as they are just the basic stuff for maintaining and using any other clipper.</li>
            <li> More potential for giving yourself a choppy cut with these than other clippers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could tell it was underpowered, but it did work, though it didn&#x27;t live long</li>
            <li> loses edge easily, runs down quickly, not cord/cordless flexible, cheap lightweight case and/or feel, noisy, etc.  </li>
            <li> Cutting very smooth and fast.</li>
            <li> The design of the guides has been proven with time and, from my experience based on older models, the motors are well designed and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The design of the guides has been proven with time and, from my experience based on older models, the motors are well designed and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Hence we only tried the left and right ear guides - which was a pity since there were 10 hair guides for different lengths.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course there are other haircutting outfits available for less money, but would that be money</li>
            <li> and I must say it&#x27;s nice to be able to shave his head without an annoying cord in my way!</li>
            <li> It is also very quiet compared with my last 8 years old Conair beard trimmer.    </li>
            <li> The people must have received another model because this clipper was as loud as some Oreck vacuums and the lever seemed cheap and could be easily broken.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet and doesn&#x27;t leave uncut hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I did a test to see how long the batteries would run the clippers from full power to dead and the results where 1hr.and 40min.</li>
            <li> The kit is handy but the bib is not much but a really thin piece of plastic with strings to tie.</li>
            <li> Still using because this cordless trimmer leaves way too many hairs uncut using the different levels versus my very old corded Wahl which cuts through all levels with zero issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Assuming this device lasts for a few years, the price seems very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I shave my head once a week and after the 3rd use I generally have to put the charger on it.</li>
            <li> especially for my younger child who does not want the big trimming blade or a scissor anywhere near his face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially for my younger child who does not want the big trimming blade or a scissor anywhere near his face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot or feel heavy to the hand.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair since the end of middle school - less of an economical reason than just a simple task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is also much cleaner (than go to a barbershop and sharing the clippers with other people - yikes!).  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and it cuts it with easy.  </li>
            <li> Powerful and holds a charge for a long time I&#x27;ve had it for about half a year and only charged it once using it about once a month</li>
            <li> I had tried cordless clippers in the past and they never seemed to work right.</li>
            <li> I needed to individually zip-loc bag the items in some semblance of organization, as it&#x27;s hard to throw all this stuff into one bag with no pockets or dividers and quickly zip it up without everything falling out.</li>
            <li> is a little too large, you could squeeze 2 sets of clippers and guides in here.</li>
            <li> I have three thick haired heads to trim on a monthly basis and this new clipper handles them very well</li>
            <li> But even if I knew the screw would get loose and need to be fixed.  </li>
            <li> We bought a Conair 18 years ago and only stopped using it recently since the older model required long charge times and it wasn&#x27;t holding the charge for very long.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and kind of wavy, was way too long</li>
            <li> The clippers literally shuts down with a full charge.....turn them back on and the device shuts down again.</li>
            <li> My corded Wahl on the other hand is very loud and my son will protest if I use it to cut his hair.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred better quality cutting heads, but I can&#x27;t complain of it&#x27;s performance thus far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are quiet, and powerful enough to cut thick hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> They are much lighter than my corded clippers (which means less arm fatigue), quiet enough, hold a charge for a long time, and of course, there is no cord!  </li>
            <li> The motor feels strong and does not bog down even when run through thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> (Vacuum Cleaner sold separately)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Other reviewers saying it&#x27;s loud must have got a defective one.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for a long time now with corded clippers and a hand mirror.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, you just have to be aware of it and be careful not to move the lever and change the closeness setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a little long compared to other brands), but other than it functions smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I-Pro Professional Supper Clipper Lithium works hard to live up to its inflated name, and maybe achieves it.  </li>
            <li> The battery also lasts far longer than we need for a couple of haircuts (since my son &amp; I typically get our hair cut on the same day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quiet and holds charge a long time.</li>
            <li> I am in the military and cut my hair at least other week and have been impressed with this trimmer, even when cutting professional-like fades and styling  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time and is very quiet.</li>
            <li> The lithium ion battery charges up in three hours flat and gives you 75 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> The plastic guides are thicker than my Wahls, and should last equally as long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was my own fault, but i dropped my clipper while my #1 gaurd was attached and my #1 gaurd is now broken.</li>
            <li> This clipper has sufficient battery power to do one adult head and one preschooler head without slowing down in the slightest, and without dragging a cord around.</li>
            <li> I usually use Wahl products, kind of skeptical at first because I&#x27;m not sure about rechargeable clippers.</li>
            <li> I hope it last a long time!</li>
            <li> This has plenty of power and smooth cutting action.  </li>
            <li> The key I have noted for all trimmers is adjusting the top plate to line up with the cutting blades without overlap or \\&quot;buck teeth\\</li>
            <li> Only complaint is you cant really go lower than a 1, maybe call it a zero.</li>
            <li> machine comes with a big kit of changeable heads which allows many types of cutting.</li>
            <li> and so you can easily switch to a marginally shorter or longer hair length and not have the machine become useless until a replacement blade</li>
            <li> After reviewing several similar products, I chose this one, which is just as what I expected.</li>
            <li> They can be used for shaving your head, shaving your beard, clipping chest hair, back hair, even nose hair if you are careful enough.  </li>
            <li> We have only used it a few times, but so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its ok i guess ill have to try other ones out there</li>
            <li> all the positive reviews are very true, until I realized that it is very difficult to take the guide comb off the clipper head!  </li>
            <li> The previous Conair we had used the same type of guide combs and not a single one broke or cracked in all the time we used it.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> It is a very tight fit and hard to remove it, as the same way I remove the guide on other brands I had.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to adjust it so that I could get the smooth shave I desired.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this product, it has met or exceeded my expectations in all areas.</li>
            <li> I expect this razor to give me long, sustained power for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These absolutely do not get close enough for a close shave.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am a verified purchaser and long time amazon user .</li>
            <li> These have a long battery life.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy from this shop as they sell inventory that&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf a long time.</li>
            <li> Owner&#x27;s Manual is in English and Spanish, and tells you everything you need to know, including all of the usual safety warnings, and a message about proper disposal of the internal Lithium Ion battery.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- fairly long charge life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used it a couple weekends ago my husband loves it battery health long to cut both sons hair.</li>
            <li> The last clippers we owned had guides that kept slipping off when you used them.  </li>
            <li> Battery is keeping is charge a long time.</li>
            <li> The tapering tools cut hair on the sides WAY TOO SHORT, unless you are getting a regulation military buzz cut.&lt;br /&gt;7)</li>
            <li> They do not appear to be designed for facial hair, but it does work well in a pinch (just not a real close shave).  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;+Battery lasts for an extremely long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same terrible buzz cut for years, and this product makes maintaining that SO EASY!!!  </li>
            <li> The clippers charge easily and hold a charge for the entire hair cutting experience.  </li>
            <li> I previously had the Conair NiCad clippers, and they would last for only one shaving.  </li>
            <li> The cordless feature is extremely convenient, especially with kids, and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The internal blade adjustment does not allow you to get close enough for a tight cut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other brands, but keep coming back to Conair!</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for the past ten years.  </li>
            <li> The design of these guide combs is different from other brands and quite genius.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint so far is the lack of organization of the plethora of attachments that come with the clipper.</li>
            <li> Only a few stray hairs left here and there</li>
            <li> This set carries a limited three-year warranty, which inspires confidence in its quality and utility.</li>
            <li> This set carries a limited three-year warranty, which inspires confidence in its quality and utility.</li>
            <li> The product comes with a limited 3 year warranty.  </li>
            <li> No more loud noise from a vibrating guards.</li>
            <li> The storage bag it comes with is a plus, it&#x27;s not to big or small and stores everything till the next time.</li>
            <li> The previous one (of a different brand)</li>
            <li> was skeptical when it first started up because it seemed like it was running too quietly.  </li>
            <li> However, a caveat applies here: all of the attachments are made of a plastic that requires flexing to attach to the clipper, it&#x27;s likely that the attachments will become brittle or fatigued and will require replacement within a relatively short period (a year, like the Remington model I have used in the past?).</li>
            <li> I am not running a barbershop, so I try to avoid making a big mess.  </li>
            <li> Also there is no indication of amount of charge left in device, just a single LED that turns green when the device is fully charged.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers who have said this is quiet must not have experience with other clippers because they&#x27;re way off!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the blade is sharp and the cutter ran for about 1 hour on a single charge.</li>
            <li> have a bad batch, may need sharper blades, may need more power.  </li>
            <li> the cutting attachment for a 1/2\\&quot; length produced an even and smooth result.</li>
            <li> Only negative and not a big one is its noisy.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve yet to suffer any pulled hairs, a common problem in our old clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No real complaints.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few month and cut about 4 heads.  </li>
            <li> Everything works as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Really not even close to being quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have preferred and expected well made guide combs.  </li>
            <li> He tries to avoid haircuts which he can&#x27;t do anymore because I&#x27;m not tethered to a cord.  </li>
            <li> well spent?</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re the predictable sort that always uses the same guard, you can dump the rest in a box somewhere and reduce the clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Only takes a few minutes to get enough of a charge to start using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use caution, but if you are a triathlete looking to get that hairless streamlined look, this little unit will do the job in about 10 seconds flat.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is that the cleaning oil is very less.</li>
            <li> No more cords to deal with, which is key.  </li>
            <li> You get a sturdy zipper bag, then the clipper, charger, scissors, other cleaning tools and oil, umpteen size combs, and even a vinyl clothing protector.</li>
            <li> I wish these clippers would take the hair as close as other clippers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I like all the adjustable lengths it comes with as well as the scissors and other accessories.  </li>
            <li> Other than saving money and time</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lightweight handset and as other reviewers pointed out, and sits well in your hand.  </li>
            <li> but he say that they work just as well as his other clippers</li>
            <li> Blades are still sharp, never had a problem.  </li>
            <li> Usually these cutters don&#x27;t last beyond a year for our family.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, and glide with ease.  </li>
            <li> Purchased due to the noise that&#x27;s generated from both of our corded &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; clippers.</li>
            <li> Did I mention it&#x27;s sharp?</li>
            <li> The case, while spacious and convenient for keeping everything together, is flimsy and does not have compartments, loops or other means of keeping the pieces from bumping or scratching each other.&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t end up with a partial Mohawk haircut by accident!  </li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift to my grandson and he has not commented on it, one way or the other, so</li>
            <li> my only gripe is that the on/off switch is plastic and hard to manipulate with one hand covered in hair.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is the on-off switch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It will die while plugged in and grab hair , which is not fun.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a 1/16th&amp;#34; attachment, but you can just use the adjusting lever to create that length.</li>
            <li> I have medium hair and an average thickness beard.</li>
            <li> I have moderately coarse hair, and like to have them cut at least once a month.  </li>
            <li> Aside from these two things, this product is average at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Conair handles my thick coarse hair with aplomb.</li>
            <li> so that you can take time and if goes down you can always plug it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to run mine down, but the power specs claim:</li>
            <li> shaves my husbands hair down to the scalp in the summer - he has a lot of hair and never a problem.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp and don&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; at your hair when trimming.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, the clippers I receieved run for a few seconds and then turn off/run out of power.  </li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp, and I adjusted them</li>
            <li> the other hand, we used a Remington for a few months [[ASIN:B004I8NO8A</li>
            <li> You can scrape yourself raw on the edges, but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> I typically cut my hair every two weeks</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time to cut his hair he plugs it in for about half an hour</li>
            <li> If the battery fails on the 2nd however, it&#x27;s going back to one star, stay that way</li>
            <li> Got to use Conair for the 1st time, previously used Braun &amp; Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My previous pair of Conair clippers lasted 8 years (they were not cordless).</li>
            <li> Our old, cheap clippers were miserable.</li>
            <li> My previous clippers were Pro grade which were Oster&#x27;s that barbers use and thie conair can&#x27;t compete with that however</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with several different guard lengths, so you have the ability to have your hair as long as you want it without futzing around with one of those annoying adjustable guards that like to adjust in the middle of a trim.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time (at least a couple haircuts at 20 mins each-</li>
            <li> First time i&#x27;ve ever used cordless for hair cutting and it does make it easier.  </li>
            <li> The guards stay on tight and don&#x27;t rattle, squeeze them to disconnect.</li>
            <li> Wish the 1/8&amp;#34; was a little closer</li>
            <li> I cut my and 3 little boys hair with it.</li>
            <li> I got it to groom my little dogs.</li>
            <li> It might be a little pricey for some consumers, but in this case I believe that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It might be a little pricey for some consumers, but in this case I believe that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Takes a little coordination and practice</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little heavier and quieter, like the clippers my barber uses.</li>
            <li> These are plastic and do require to flex a little to be clipped onto the blade.</li>
            <li> The only feature found in my previous trimmer that the present one lacks is the ability to remove the cutting blades assembly which, presumably, enabled easier cleaning.</li>
            <li> When I do a cut one of the ways I know what I&#x27;m cutting, or how much, is by listening to the blades chop into the hair.</li>
            <li> The guards  are designed in such a way that they maintain constant contact with spring like grip on the cutting head.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair cutting tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  </li>
            <li> What hair it did shave was cut unevenly and in patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say, they don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;d survive a drop completely unscathed, but i may be wrong.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying a corded Wahl icon at a local&lt;br /&gt;salon supply because I got tired of this thing dying in the middle of keeping my beard close and trimmed.</li>
            <li> The adapters are not cheaply made which is a plus.</li>
            <li> It holds its charge for a few cuts.  </li>
            <li> Had it for a few months</li>
            <li> The blade area is heavy metal and the body is sturdy plastic.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this product now for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My old clippers were corded and it was tedious managing the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and  can be on my way in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fluffy Persian cat doesn&#x27;t stand a change against this thing.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this now for a few weeks</li>
            <li> , so you have to wait a few minutes before using even if you plug it in&lt;br /&gt;-Takes</li>
            <li> some practice before you can do what I do in my video without a few scratches</li>
            <li> I got the rechargeable/cordless due to the lack of convenient outlets in my bathroom, and although I&#x27;ve never pushed it, I can get at least two cuts on one charge.</li>
            <li> I have always used the traditional wire con air clippers but then to ease the bother of having to be close to a plug I decided to give it a go to this wireless clipper and as far as I have gone with this product I have not been disappointed by its performance.</li>
            <li> The extensions are are very tight and you need some effort to put them on.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the cheapest piece of crap I have ever spent money on......</li>
            <li> at least a little battery to run</li>
            <li> I got so frustrated that I was ready to return it</li>
            <li> So, not sure whattheywere thinking</li>
            <li> With this one, I can usually shave my head 5 times before I have to recharge it.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately did not last</li>
            <li> The side-mounted taper control is metal instead of the usual plastic.</li>
            <li> It can be used corded, though for no more than 20 minutes, according to the manual.  </li>
            <li> slick.</li>
            <li> Even plowing through thick hair it doesn&#x27;t slow down noticeably.</li>
            <li> power switch in odd location, but recommend !!</li>
            <li> Cleaning behind the cutting blades is an absolute pain.</li>
            <li> , if you are not careful, while you are cutting your hair you can accidentally change the closeness adjustment lever.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is not suitable for buzz or &amp;#34;0/1/2&amp;#34; type cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also appears it would even work on 10 pound Tippy the Pampered Toy Poodle and her thick curly hair for the amateur dog groomer.</li>
            <li> There are very few really negative reviews with this model</li>
            <li> The attachments that come with it are universal, however, the machine itself will surprise you with it&#x27;s cutting strength.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 30 minutes (on and off while cutting my hair) and had no problems with the charge, although I hear it may happen in the future.</li>
            <li> and my son complained that it hurt.  </li>
            <li> I buzz cut with no guards at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> Of course there are still negative reviews</li>
            <li> Seems to hold the charge for at least 5 cuts.</li>
            <li> It seems to have the same cutting power when used on battery as when used with the cord.  </li>
            <li> I charged it once and have used it at least 6 times already</li>
            <li> The plastic blade holder that vibrates the moveable cutting blade back and forth just broke on me, and does not look fixable!!</li>
            <li> There are numerous types of attachments that allow for a generous number of cutting lengths.</li>
            <li> I have had a set of Wahl wired hair clippers since I was in the Marine Corps in the late 90s</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ordered these clippers immediately upon returning to the states in late June</li>
            <li> I was always afraid of doing my haircut by myself thinking of a possible disaster with my hair</li>
            <li> No problems going thru thick hair.</li>
            <li> Out of box failure, will not charge could not use it.</li>
            <li> Left out for the battery to die as this thing scared the crap out of me going on in the middle of the night randomly.</li>
            <li> so I did some serious shopping and settled on this Conair unit.</li>
            <li> It is not a good value for its price.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are useless for cutting coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I waited until the return window was past, before I took these out and tried them.  </li>
            <li> My thin hair was a piece of cake, but so was my sons thick hair!</li>
            <li> It has an LED charge indicator and takes a little over three hours to charge when the battery is exhausted which will give over an hour of cutting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they get worse over time.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying someone else to do it. . .</li>
            <li> have short hair and hate paying $20</li>
            <li> Always remember to put a thin coat of the supplied oil on the blades.</li>
            <li> but I was tired of paying $20-$30 every 2-3 months without having the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> allows you to pop the blade up and wash out the hair and stuff that may be stuck behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> allows you to pop the blade up and wash out the hair and stuff that may be stuck behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im usually halfway done cutting my hair when it starts flashing, and the clippers always die before I finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can hardly tell it&#x27;s cutting by listening to the motor.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t shake violently like the other brand I had to return.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to operate, hard to move and in a inconvenient location.</li>
            <li> Wasted money... :(</li>
            <li> I kept it cleaned and oiled as per the instructions, but it still failed.</li>
            <li> I purchase this to replace a wahl beard trimmer that failed.</li>
            <li> The scissors coming with the kit are just mediocre.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with the power differences (220 vs 110) and with the cost of purchasing a power converter it didn&#x27;t make sense to bring those clippers home, so....</li>
            <li> One of the things I hated about my previous corded clipper was the cord.</li>
            <li> I used it about twice a week to keep my beard trimmed close, no hair cutting.</li>
            <li> makes cutting my hair a pleasure.</li>
            <li> there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a loss of battery or cutting performance.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s cordless also facilitates your cutting.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of cutting time.</li>
            <li> These guides are sturdy and stay attached to the clippers when you&#x27;re cutting your hair.  </li>
            <li> Still, it is a quality hair cutting tool.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re follicley challenged like me and want a close shave, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time with these.</li>
            <li> I have never had anyone say something bad about my hair. . .</li>
            <li> And wrong!!</li>
            <li> No need worry about draging a stupid cord when its time to buzz your hair.</li>
            <li> Totally worthless.</li>
            <li> [I hate that].</li>
            <li> no longer have to worry about the annoying cord that used to catch on the cabinet knobs below the sink.</li>
            <li> I hate Conair now</li>
            <li> I bought another cheaper CONAIR (mistake) from a Target store about a year ago and never used it it was so horrible and was even louder.</li>
            <li> This is so disgusting!!</li>
            <li> but It didn&#x27;t come with a charger for some reason and Conair had some of the worst customer service ever.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.  </li>

            <li> I have cut my own hair &amp; my sons&#x27; hair for years and this is the best quality clipper I&#x27;ve owned yet. The cordless feature is extremely convenient, especially with kids, and the battery lasts a long time. If the battery runs out, you can still use the corded option. the adjustability of the clipper lengths is perfect for fading as well.</li>
            <li> After reviewing several similar products, I chose this one, which is just as what I expected. This is good, not too light, not too plastic. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many of the rechargeables and they just don&#x27;t work that well - and they get worse over time. This one has some muscle to it, and I love that the guards are individual pieces instead of one adjustable piece; the adjustables always seem to fail over time.</li>
            <li> Having reviewed clippers before, I didn&#x27;t have really high expectations for the Conair HC1100AM I-Pro Professional Lithium Super Clipper.  Not because it isn&#x27;t a great product, which it is, but because I didn&#x27;t think it would be any different than what I have already experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers rock.  They can be used for shaving your head, shaving your beard, clipping chest hair, back hair, even nose hair if you are careful enough.  The clippers charge easily and hold a charge for the entire hair cutting experience.  I found them easy to use, easy to clean, and basically the best clippers I have ever reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase if you like to shave your own head instead of going to a hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> Works wonderfull. I like that I am able to go chordless with it</li>
            <li> No complaints here. Cuts just fine. No snagging. Good battery life. Not that loud compared to most buzzers.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clip as closely as I interpreted in the description.  Nice set but will not shave close to give an almost bald look.</li>
            <li> Works as good as one with an AC cord.</li>
            <li> So I made the decision to start cutting my own hair and went with this product after reading the reviews.  I never cut hair before so after I got this, I watched a couple YouTube videos and started hacking away.  The results... Surprisingly good! I felt like a professional... Okay, maybe not a professional but it looked just as good to me as it does when I go to the barber.  I do keep my hair pretty short so that makes it easier to cut and fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature about this product is the taper control which allows you to change the length of the blade from a 0 to about a 1 without having to add or remove any blade attachments.  It also adds &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; sizes to all of the attachments which helps with fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with everything you need, plenty of attachments, carrying case, blade oil, instructions, etc.  The battery life is great and the quick charge feature definitely comes in handy.  Not having to deal with a wire is always nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a solid product and seems of great quality.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I think the price is great is well... I&#x27;ve already paid for the item in the amount I&#x27;ve saved from not going to the barber so I can&#x27;t complain there.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, but not too loud.  Used it about 10 times and only charged it twice.</li>
            <li> New for me but so far so good.  The reason why I gave it 5 stars so early is that I worked selling power tools when I was in college and lithium ion batteries are worth it.  I expect this razor to give me long, sustained power for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went for the cheaper, non-litium ion rechargeable clippers from Remington before buying these, and the battery (which is soldered in) died within 6 months.  I couldn&#x27;t even use it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the long run, these should be cheaper and better quality than any other rechargeable clipper because of its lithium ion battery and quality build.</li>
            <li> No real complaints. Gets 2 or 3 cuts in before needing recharge.&lt;br /&gt; The led doesn&#x27;t give much warning. Im usually halfway done cutting my hair when it starts flashing, and the clippers always die before I finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bag it comes with is a little too large, you could squeeze 2 sets of clippers and guides in here. So, not sure whattheywere thinking there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Wahl clipper guards work on it!</li>
            <li> Cuts OK, but a little bulky for my smaller hands.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not suitable for buzz or &amp;#34;0/1/2&amp;#34; type cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the teeth are like running the prongs of a cheap metal fork on your head.  Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other grips:  The internal blade adjustment does not allow you to get close enough for a tight cut.  The unit itself is way too big (I wear XL gloves and thins thing was simply too unwieldy for my palm).  What hair it did shave was cut unevenly and in patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is a shame because my last conair trimmer was the best I have ever used.  Thankfully amazon does quick returns!</li>
            <li> These cut fantastically. The battery came charged with enough to do my head too. Love it.</li>
            <li> After only two uses it won&#x27;t hold a charge. Totally worthless.</li>
            <li> Works very powerful and cuts really good.  It will break very easily like it did on me.  The two screws holding the blade on completely came off.  Plastic was stuck on them so the screws pulled out bringing the plastic with them so there is no way to repair it.</li>
            <li> Lightweight yet powerful. Cordless convenience is a great benefit especially when you&#x27;re cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair since the end of middle school - less of an economical reason than just a simple task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had to use a corded clipper (except for a few months in Japan when I had a good Philips cordless which died) which was ok since they were powerful on coarse/Asian hair, but often the cord would tangle, knock something over, limit where I could cut my hair, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always looked for a cordless trimmer but after a short-lived stint with a Philips cordless trimmer I bought in Tokyo (at Tokyu Hands in 2004 or so).  I could tell it was underpowered, but it did work, though it didn&#x27;t live long (eventually it wouldn&#x27;t take charge at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after researching for awhile, I picked this one up and so far, so good!  It comes with all the guides someone would need (I just use one), scissors (not the greatest, but they work), oil, cleaning brush, and a zippered case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 4 or 5 cuts so far and though it&#x27;s not as powerful as a corded clipper, it&#x27;s powerful enough (and more powerful than the old one I had).  It allows me to quickly trim what I need without worrying about any cord tangling, etc.  I typically cut my hair every two weeks so hopefully this holds up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to remember and update this review!</li>
            <li> I am extremely impressed with this. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 8 years now, and this is by far the best clipper, I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s even more powerful than the corded clippers I&#x27;ve been using, and it is LIGHT. Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Cuts and works better than my corded one.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and I must say it&#x27;s nice to be able to shave his head without an annoying cord in my way! It does a great job it works nice I hope it last a long time!</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers!  I bought this for my boyfriend who cuts his own hair.  It&#x27;s great!  He does an awesome job cutting his hair and now he doesn&#x27;t have to hassle with the cord getting in the way.  He said it works great and is easy to handle.  When it&#x27;s time to cut his hair he plugs it in for about half an hour and it&#x27;s ready to use.  I think it does a cleaner cut than his old clipper did.  The storage bag it comes with is a plus, it&#x27;s not to big or small and stores everything till the next time.</li>
            <li> Great hair clippers with phenomenal battery. Always have a fresh cut with these.</li>
            <li> Only had it about a month, but have cut my hair a couple of times and really like it. Only negative and not a big one is its noisy.</li>
            <li> This Conair clipper is built much nicer than I anticipated, the battery life is good and it cuts really well. Also, having the option of cord or cordless is a real plus. Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re follicley challenged like me and want a close shave, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time with these. These absolutely do not get close enough for a close shave. I tried adjusting the length of the blade and it&#x27;s just not possible to get them as short as I&#x27;d like. I will say that the kit is very nice and the trimmer is well built. If you have longer hair (greater than 1/4 inch), should work perfectly fine. Just not for me, I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: Don&#x27;t buy these if you&#x27;re bald.</li>
            <li> Nice  feel to this clipper, a little heavy but has good balance.  The only complaint is the on-off switch.  It is difficult to operate, hard to move and in a inconvenient location.</li>
            <li> I used it twice &amp; even after fully recharging it lasts about 5 seconds &amp; shuts off. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge at all.</li>
            <li> I had tried 10yrs ago to shave my own head but was annoyed with the wired Oyster that I had bought. This clipper is powerful and versatile. It is also easily brought along on trips to keep it tight as often as necessary. I paired this with the shavewell mirror which could be larger but very light and no concerns about breaking glass in the shower. I bought this on another site with a discount.</li>
            <li> Used it the same day I received it,...I really did look better.</li>
            <li> For years I used a corded clipper and wanted something that allowed more freedom. These clippers do just that! The battery life is just right!</li>
            <li> Much lighter and easier to handle than corded models, but these have plenty of power. They will also work corded if needed. Very quiet, and cut without pulling any hair [I hate that]. They hold a charge for a long time under use--over an hour with a full charge.</li>
            <li> Great clipper. Wish it cut closer but it works very well. The battery life has been good.</li>
            <li> A great Hair Cutter at a good price.  It runs smooth, very quiet, with no electrical cord to worry about getting in the way, great ! The attachments that come with it are universal, however, the machine itself will surprise you with it&#x27;s cutting strength. Recommend it highly !</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers</li>
            <li> Works well.  I love how long it lasts on one charge. I am so glad I bought it. After  a few months one of the screws on top that hold the blade cover got loose and I couldn&#x27;t tighten it anymore so all I had to do was put a small washer and it was back to perfect. But even if I knew the screw would get loose and need to be fixed.  I would still have bought because of how well they work.</li>
            <li> Its ok i guess ill have to try other ones out there</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great product..</li>
            <li> These clippers are great. They trim just like the cord clippers giving you just that short enough trim for my bread. Also the charge last a long time and comes in handy when i travel to Europe not having to worry about the voltage difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I do like it so far. It seems well built and it&#x27;s pretty quiet and light. It comes with a lot of accessories too.</li>
            <li> works great on my son and husband.</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers! Very ergonomic and compact. I&#x27;ve tried the other brands, but keep coming back to Conair!</li>
            <li> Great product! Works really well, and all of the pieces are useful and well-made. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> Cheap, good and one of the few electronics sold on Amazon that has dual-voltage (100-240V) that works outside U.S. Already bought two—one for myself, one for my dog!</li>
            <li> Dad gets haircuts at home - he likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Light and compact, Cuts clean and doesn&#x27;t snag hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed  !!! Works well and does just what I needed it for !!!</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time (at least a couple haircuts at 20 mins each- which was my initial concern), lightweight and great for cutting hair on me and my son.  First time i&#x27;ve ever used cordless for hair cutting and it does make it easier.  I will say, they don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;d survive a drop completely unscathed, but i may be wrong.  took off the one star for the slightly more plasticy feel.</li>
            <li> This clipper and attachments works really well.  The lithium battery seems to hold a charge well.  It is a good value.  There are videos online that explain how to do a basic haircut.</li>
            <li> Just got it today, don&#x27;t know how good it is.</li>
            <li> I like the layer adjust ability. Clippers have a nice selection of lengths, the charge cable is in the back so it sits on the counter nicely as it charges. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the location of the power switch. I know it probably fit design wise, but I would of liked it right in the middle of the top of the unit instead of having to search for it in your palm region when your holding it. It makes it so you have to use two hands to turn it on and off.</li>
            <li> It arrived in very good case and all the accessories are good. Only thing is that the cleaning oil is very less. but again i can order it on amazon. Just used it once. But i like it very much. Its powerful and being cordless its very convenient.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for the 2 times I used it before it died</li>
            <li> Works good for a while, then after a few months the battery wont hold a charge long enough to trim a beard. I used it about twice a week to keep my beard trimmed close, no hair cutting. Btw, I&#x27;ve used these for years, yes I know how to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;It will die while plugged in and grab hair , which is not fun. I had an older Conair that lasted about 5 yrs ...&lt;br /&gt;This thing was a good unit except for the battery, which is built in . I ended up buying a corded Wahl icon at a local&lt;br /&gt;salon supply because I got tired of this thing dying in the middle of keeping my beard close and trimmed. The corded wahl is far superior .  Yes, I am a verified purchaser and long time amazon user . It has a lot of good reviews. I wonder how many reviewed soon after the purchase ? I bought mine approx. 1 yr ago and it died out about 6 months ago .</li>
            <li> Wish the 1/8&amp;#34; was a little closer (it&#x27;s a little long compared to other brands), but other than it functions smoothly.  The adapters are not cheaply made which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Love this, very quiet and of very good quality, would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> A very solid unit with a strong motor and very effective and fast cutting. I was pleasantly suprised by the high quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> Light weight, which makes it travel friendly. Adjustable blade very helpful for facial hair trim.</li>
            <li> Really nice not having to worry about cutting the cord.  Solid product for the price.  The only weakness is that the case doesn&#x27;t have designated spots for each of the pieces.</li>
            <li> When I first picked up the Clippers, I quickly noticed how light they were and questioned the quality of the set but after using them a few times, I am very impressed. They cut very well though I would be scared of the results of dropping them...</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers to use on my husbands hair.  Our old ones were electric and not working as well as they should.  This clipper is great!  You can use them anywhere, since they run on a battery, they are easy to recharge, but the charge holds for a long time.  I don&#x27;t have to go over and over the same spot on his hair, as these cut it the first time through so they are also a time saver.  I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15 years, and have tried many brands and models over the years.  I bought clippers from $20 to $140, and I have to say these are the best I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;ll be buying a second and third one for my brother and dad, because these are great. They are smooth, quiet, strong and battery life on them in great.  I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> I tried the Philips Norelco &amp;#34;Do It Yourself&amp;#34; which was a great idea, but it forced a near-crewcut.  This isn&#x27;t designed for &amp;#34;self cuts&amp;#34; but has a solid motor and comes in a nice kit.  Happy with the purchase after the first few uses (just recharging it now).</li>
            <li> Noisy.but it&#x27;s sharp and battery life is good</li>
            <li> These wireless clippers are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have to worry about the annoying cord that used to catch on the cabinet knobs below the sink.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son in law. He really likes it. He uses the tapered attached for around the ears. Looks good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same terrible buzz cut for years, and this product makes maintaining that SO EASY!!!  No more cords to deal with, which is key.  These are the most powerful clippers around, but they do the job.</li>
            <li> The item description led me to believe that it would shave my bald head smooth. In fact, it would not. It left a fuzz. I was unable to adjust it so that I could get the smooth shave I desired. Forget Conair; I&#x27;m going back to Wahl brand. I know it will give me the shave I want.</li>
            <li> Great product, value like an $80 to $100 product, i.e. huge value for half the price.  Runs quiet, cuts great, sturdy cutter heads.  Outstanding.</li>
            <li> I got these a couple of months ago.  It came with lots of accessories and a soft carrying case.  I charged it up once and used and it did a great job on my buzz-cut hair.  I also use it with the #1 attachment for trimming my mustache and it does a great job.  I haven&#x27;t charged it since the original charge and have used it maybe 10 times. I am waiting for the battery to die again - you can use it plugged in - before recharging.  I love the cordless feature.  I have had many corded clippers and this is definitely worth the little extra for the convenience and portability.</li>
            <li> I had another unit that I didn&#x27;t care for so I did some serious shopping and settled on this Conair unit. Everything about the design works, so, if your looking for a unit to cut hair or keep your facial hair short, this would be my choice again if I lost the one I have. Beautifully designed.</li>
            <li> Just recently got and used this and it was far better than what I was expecting! For the price of a flimsly corded clipper (I was using Wahl&#x27;s $40 color coded one) you get a cordless clipper with almost all of the same amenities. It has a bigger case and it&#x27;s so much easier to cut my own hair with! I used it for about 30 minutes (on and off while cutting my hair) and had no problems with the charge, although I hear it may happen in the future. VERY powerful motor, and sleek, professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a 1/16th&amp;#34; attachment, but you can just use the adjusting lever to create that length. Absolutely great product so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ton through a lot of clippers. Most of them don&#x27;t last long and the batteries are weak and wear out quickly. This one is the one to choose. A bit pricy, but worth it. The batteries stay charged for months.</li>
            <li> These are ok, but did aren&#x27;t sharp enough or powerfull enough. I would not recommend to anyone. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> 1st trimmer: Out of box failure, will not charge could not use it. Returned.    2nd trimmer:  The key I have noted for all trimmers is adjusting the top plate to line up with the cutting blades without overlap or \\&quot;buck teeth\\&quot; This unit allows you to do so with the adjustment screws on the top plate. Having the ability to further adjust that cut with the lever makes for a very versatile trimmer of many precise, albeit shorter lengths for trimming hair and beards, both of which I have but one a bit less than the other...     This trimmer cuts excellently, it does not leave ragged ends, it does not pull or bog down. I have medium hair and an average thickness beard. I&#x27;d call this a 1 to 3 pass trimmer to achieve the desired cut. I have used a few trimmers in my years, a couple passes is an excellent performance. This trimmer gets nearly all within a couple passes for the length I prefer. As with all trimmers, the longer you are trying to keep your hair or beard the more difficult it is to maintain it with trimmers. The shorter you wish to maintain your hair or beard the easier it is to do so.     I upped my rating from one star to four based on the fact that the first trimmer would not charge. If the battery fails on the 2nd however, it&#x27;s going back to one star, stay that way and I&#x27;ll get a different brand.      Finish, detail of the trimmer: It feels honestly like its made of cheap plastic with a hollow cavity. I surmise this is the build for larger, easier handling which I don&#x27;t find it any easier than the smaller more compact Remington I used to use that was solidly built but did not cut very well. There is not a stand provided for this unit to charge in or hold all the accessories, plan on having drawer space to store it between use. I honestly toss the carrying case and other items I don&#x27;t use, they just take up space when it will store in a much smaller area without.     Overall it works excellent, trims excellent. Durability and longevity are still a question.</li>
            <li> I like this clipper very much. It gives a nice and even cut all around. It keeps the charge for a long-time. And, it is cordless.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. I like that it&#x27;s cordless and runs a reasonable amount of time for you to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> It was a pain having to get the extension cord out everytime I wanted to use my old razor.  This has plenty of power and smooth cutting action.  I have only had it a few month and cut about 4 heads.  I charged it after the 4th cut ( 2 months).  SO far so good</li>
            <li> It was a gift and the person that got it told me that he&#x27;s extremely satisfied with it, so I was very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THESE CLIPPERS. THEY CUT MUCH BETTER THAN MORE EXPENSIVE BRANDS I HAVE USED. BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT.  NICE ACCESSORIES. GREAT BUY</li>
            <li> It is not a good value for its price.  It cuts fine.  It holds its charge for a few cuts.  But it is not quiet.  The new plastic guides clips are of very very cheap construction and are crooked.  Except for being cordless, there is nothing great about it.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great for the person who cuts their own hair because you can take them wherever you need to, to cut your hair.  Charges pretty quickly and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> Got to use Conair for the 1st time, previously used Braun &amp; Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;This is one insanely powerful beast, and completed my haircut in half the time it generally used to take on the Braun.  I have moderately coarse hair, and like to have them cut at least once a month.  Also tried my beard without the combs, and pleased with results.&lt;br /&gt;Charges much faster and holds charge much longer too.  The comb attachments are very good, especially the innovative ear combs.  Good storage/ carry case to ensure they aren&#x27;t all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure these will last much longer than the Braun which felt light and flimsy compared to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these a few times already and love that the power stays consistent the whole time. After the initial charge, I&#x27;ve shaved my head 3 times without needing to recharge. Also gets a close cut. Highly recommend these clippers!</li>
            <li> For 22 years I was a Wahl customer...but never again!!!!  these clippers are awesome!  they cut just as good as any I&#x27;ve ever owned (and as a military guy who has cut his own hair for a LONG time, I&#x27;ve used a bunch of clippers).  But...my favorite two features are (1) the on/off switch is out of the way and so I don&#x27;t accidentally keep turning them off  (2) the guards click into place and to remove them, you have to actually intentionally squeeze both sides of the guard, thus releasing it....which is FAR superior to good old Wahl that I had to literally Duct tape in order to keep the guard on.</li>
            <li> I am impressed by the quality of the Clipper unit and accessories! It works great, charges fast, easy to change combs and definitely worth the money spent. My only complaint so far is the lack of organization of the plethora of attachments that come with the clipper. You get a sturdy zipper bag, then the clipper, charger, scissors, other cleaning tools and oil, umpteen size combs, and even a vinyl clothing protector. I needed to individually zip-loc bag the items in some semblance of organization, as it&#x27;s hard to throw all this stuff into one bag with no pockets or dividers and quickly zip it up without everything falling out. If you can figure out the storage aspect, then this is the unit for you and should serve you well if taken care of. Happy clipping....</li>
            <li> The guide combs are fragile. The unit itself stopped working properly after 6 months. It runs for a minute or so then just stops. I can turn it off and on and it will run for 30 seconds to a minute and stop. I kept it cleaned and oiled as per the instructions, but it still failed.</li>
            <li> this thing works great so far, if you just wanna keep  the short scruffy look  and not a close shave this is the one to buy.....</li>
            <li> My husband loves the fact that there is no court they get stuck around his neck when he was trying to shave his head.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments come on and off perfectly in stays charged for a long time</li>
            <li> I ordered these based upon customer reviews, and as always with a grain of salt/skepticism. I have to say these clippers are outstanding, at full charge they are a monster and clip hair effortlessly. The only downside I have is that at the lowest setting with no guard, they still leave too much hair for those of us who shave our heads. I wish these clippers would take the hair as close as other clippers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Cordless with a lithium battery makes this clipper very easy to use. Bought it to replace a corded model, and I am very pleased. Quiet and holds charge a long time.</li>
            <li> my dad loves them they are the best clippers he has ever had. I&#x27;m glad I bought them they are very easy to handle and quiet for the most part.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I waited until the return window was past, before I took these out and tried them.  They are GARBAGE.  First, the blades aren&#x27;t even with the guard, so one side cuts closer than the other.  And even at it&#x27;s closest setting, it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly close enough.  Wasted money... :(</li>
            <li> surprised this thing works as well as it does.  Good value</li>
            <li> does not cut close enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this, cuts my hair nice and battery lasts a very long time. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> these charge quickly. and more importantlydid not pull a single hair. i am very happy with these. makes cutting my hair a pleasure.</li>
            <li> So far, this clipper has done a great job. I like how light it is and that it&#x27;s cordless.  it doesn&#x27;t shake violently like the other brand I had to return.  I like all the adjustable lengths it comes with as well as the scissors and other accessories.  It has a nice feel to it and cuts great.  I&#x27;ve only used this for pubic hair so I can&#x27;t speak about clipping my own hair but I would imagine it would work very well for someone with very short hair.</li>
            <li> best I have ever used</li>
            <li> It feels solid and well build when you use it.  This is the second Conair I bought, primarily because I needed a cordless trimmer, although I still have the first one.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it  I am in the military and cut my hair at least other week and have been impressed with this trimmer, even when cutting professional-like fades and styling  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this product, it has met or exceeded my expectations in all areas. I got the rechargeable/cordless due to the lack of convenient outlets in my bathroom, and although I&#x27;ve never pushed it, I can get at least two cuts on one charge.</li>
            <li> As I recall, this hair clipper received some good reviews. The people must have received another model because this clipper was as loud as some Oreck vacuums and the lever seemed cheap and could be easily broken. After charging and listening to it, I quickly put it back into the box for return.</li>
            <li> Fast charging, perfect for vacation use.  I used it for travel overseas.  Since it is dual voltage, I didn&#x27;t have to buy adaptor.  The blades are very sharp., perfect smooth cut everytime with different length guards.  Used it for 5 times now, waited to see how it hold it over time.  Overall, very happy with the purchased.</li>
            <li> The clippers cut real nice and the battery lasts too. It comes with a lot of accessories which is great.</li>
            <li> Seems to work OK for my use, which is to touch up a buzz cut in between trips to the salon.  I cut my own hair every other time.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Better than expected. Wife uses it to cut my hair and she really likes the cordless feature. Also really likes the smaller trimmer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these.  They got the best reviews on Amazon for a cordless clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We upgraded from a Wahl corded set that we got at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it was a downgrade.  Much less powerful and my son complained that it hurt.  We returned it.</li>
            <li> Great clippers!  I previously had the Conair NiCad clippers, and they would last for only one shaving.  With this one, I can usually shave my head 5 times before I have to recharge it.  This one doesn&#x27;t lose its charge like the old NiCad version.  If you leaving it sitting for a month, it&#x27;ll still be ready to go.</li>
            <li> Great clipper gets the job done</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for the past ten years.  Other than saving money and time, it is also much cleaner (than go to a barbershop and sharing the clippers with other people - yikes!).  Every weekend I go through my hair-cutting routines to trim off before shower - very easy and fast (just need about 3 minutes and I am done).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a cordless hair clipper a while back but it died.  After used a corded hair clipper for a few months I really miss the convenience of the cordless one.  Thank God the Amazon provided a wonderful feedback and this one ranked very high with a great price.  I bought it and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it on - all the positive reviews are very true, until I realized that it is very difficult to take the guide comb off the clipper head!  It is a very tight fit and hard to remove it, as the same way I remove the guide on other brands I had.  I got so frustrated that I was ready to return it, then I realized that it can be easily removed by simply squeeze from the side!  The design of these guide combs is different from other brands and quite genius.  With this, I give it a solid 5-star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this is a helpful hint to you - and if yes, please don&#x27;t forget to press the \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; vote below :-) so others can benefit from this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[update on April 26, 2014]  I fully charged the hair clipper when I first received it in January, and have been using it every week ever since.  Today is my first time to recharge it - the battery is really holding up.  Would add another star if I can.</li>
            <li> Work great, cut well, don&#x27;t get too hot, cordless is definitely a plus, especially in a place where free wall outlets are not every where, no loss in power without the cord! Looks nice and comes with a carrying case.</li>
            <li> Great battery charging and life&lt;br /&gt;Great, fast, smooth cutting.  I buzz cut with no guards at least once a week.  Nice and quiet and doesn&#x27;t leave uncut hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t mind if there was a charging base.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are not careful, while you are cutting your hair you can accidentally change the closeness adjustment lever.  I&#x27;m deducting a star for that reason.  Not a huge deal, you just have to be aware of it and be careful not to move the lever and change the closeness setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/20/2016:&lt;br /&gt;The unit is still working perfectly.  I have been using it for 2 1/2 years without any issues.  there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a loss of battery or cutting performance.</li>
            <li> Perfect cuts and not as loud as I thought it would be. My cordless razor is louder than this.</li>
            <li> Powerful machine with great battery life. Cutting very smooth and fast. Easy for use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent trimmer, but not as good as older models.  Reasonably priced, with adequate power, and exceptional battery life. It does the job, but I&#x27;d probably go a different route if I had the opportunity to choose again..</li>
            <li> Battery life is great, device is well made. Kit contents are kinda cheap, but what do you expect for $30. Only complaint is you cant really go lower than a 1, maybe call it a zero. But it doesnt get as close as my barber.</li>
            <li> Is the perfect clipper for $40&lt;br /&gt; - solid design, great quality for the price&lt;br /&gt; - battery is way better than other products that cost 3x the price (e.g. Oral-B toothbrush!!)&lt;br /&gt; - comes in handy fabric travel bag with everything you need&lt;br /&gt; - dual voltage, so can use it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt; - cannot get better than this for the price point.</li>
            <li> This cordless clipper is just what i was looking for. The attachments are good and it is very powerful. I was able to cut my own hair no problem</li>
            <li> This is my first clipper. I do my research before I buy and this came up as one of the best cordless clippers to buy. Of course there are still negative reviews so I read them, see if there is any trend or might it be just a defective item or user problem. There are very few really negative reviews with this model so I took that as a good sign and ended up buying this last night. I followed the instructions so let it charge for the minimum 3 hours for the first time (good to do so you have a better battery experience with the product). This morning I used it for the first time. I have no one to do my hair so I am using this on myself. It was easy to use. Worked perfectly and gave me a pretty darn good cut for my first time. My hair is very thin and kind of wavy, was way too long and I am balding. It was fairly easy to do and never had any hair get caught, cut cleanly. It is quite quiet for what it is similar to my razor. The guide combs come on and off easily, easy to clean and I do not find them fragile. Everything works as I had expected. Anything can happen of course but I expect to be happily using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in Afghanistan for a few months now and decided to cut my own hair since the barber here wasn&#x27;t cleaning his equipment properely. I&#x27;ve been giving my self my own high and tight hair cut and it comes out perfect everytime. My only complaint was my own fault, but i dropped my clipper while my #1 gaurd was attached and my #1 gaurd is now broken. So i just roll with the bald head until this deployment is done. Other than that, this product was not a bad investment at all.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed that no less than 11 reviewers (and, yes, I counted!) wrote that this device is \\&quot;quiet\\&quot;. Absolutely amazed! This product has some positives, which I will illustrate in a moment, but one of those positives is NOT being quiet! It&#x27;s like a lawnmower compared to even the cheapest WAHL clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used WAHL clippers over the years. I became accustomed to spending only $20-$30 on WAHL clippers and have gotten great results. Conair so far, I&#x27;m not too impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives of this device: 1. being cordless does facilitate the process, and gives you multiple options (especially on vacation in a hotel) to choose the best and brightest location to do a cut. 2. it&#x27;s a lightweight handset and as other reviewers pointed out, and sits well in your hand.  Aside from these two things, this product is average at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being loud is not just an annoyance, but it affects the quality of the cut too. When I do a cut one of the ways I know what I&#x27;m cutting, or how much, is by listening to the blades chop into the hair. However, with this you can barely hear it over the noise! Other reviewers who have said this is quiet must not have experience with other clippers because they&#x27;re way off! Really not even close to being quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONAIR doesn&#x27;t seem to give as smooth of a cut as the WAHL clippers I&#x27;ve used. More potential for giving yourself a choppy cut with these than other clippers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad. I bought another cheaper CONAIR (mistake) from a Target store about a year ago and never used it it was so horrible and was even louder. So, I rolled the dice with this CONAIR because of the cordless feature (I travel a lot) and I must say It&#x27;s good enough to keep, but bad enough to be left wishing I spent a little more money on something I could feel good about for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can easily see myself buying another WAHL not to far in the future.</li>
            <li> Very good for your own hair cut. Charged battery last longer so that you can take time and if goes down you can always plug it in.</li>
            <li> Too Noisey, but works well.</li>
            <li> VERY loud.  Ok trimmers, have only used a couple of times but they&#x27;re very loud even after oiling and feel slightly cheap.</li>
            <li> Cuts great and being cordless is a great feature</li>
            <li> It works. Would have preferred better quality cutting heads, but I can&#x27;t complain of it&#x27;s performance thus far. Had it for a few months and it does what it was designed to do. Delivery and packaging was great..</li>
            <li> I go outside to Buzz my head so a rechargeable clipper is a must for me. These have a long battery life. I love everything about them. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The price was okay and the product arrived on time with free shipping. It had a nice case and all of the accessories inside the box but the trimmer itself didn&#x27;t impress me at all. You cannot do close cuts with this trimmer and if you trim the hair in sensitive parts of your skin like your chest and your underarm, it bites the skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this, it cuts my hair extremely well and it&#x27;s packaged well, thank you much.</li>
            <li> Charges fast and very light weight. Love bring able to use with our without a cord. I only use it about once a month.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight hair clipper. Charges fast and has good run time. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Really nice unit. The blades are very sharp and don&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; at your hair when trimming. It&#x27;s nice not having to worry about a cord when I&#x27;m trimming my own hair. The carrying case is a handy way to keep all the components in one place. And it was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Awsom clippers for being lithium ion. I would say they are better than my Whaul plug in the wall clippers. No need worry about draging a stupid cord when its time to buzz your hair. I did a test to see how long the batteries would run the clippers from full power to dead and the results where 1hr.and 40min. that how long the batteries last and the power is consistent all the way to dead. these clippers are the best no joke.</li>
            <li> These are perfect.  I have been getting my hair cut by my wife for years.  This cordeless edition has made hair cuts so much easier.  We have had this for over a year now and have had no issues.  Seems to hold the charge for at least 5 cuts.</li>
            <li> I live this thing. I cut my and 3 little boys hair with it. Good battery life and attachments. Probably could shave a bear with it, probably piss the bear off.</li>
            <li> This is a neat, useful clipper that gets the job done.  The fact that it&#x27;s cordless also facilitates your cutting.  Hold a charge very well- would buy again!</li>
            <li> After owning it for several months now I can say this is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. Holds a charge for a long time and is very quiet. Other reviewers saying it&#x27;s loud must have got a defective one. Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works great, good size to hold. Better that the Wahl that I had. The kit is handy but the bib is not much but a really thin piece of plastic with strings to tie.</li>
            <li> Does the job, easy to do it myself with all different clips it provided. Loved the cordless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky to have three young boys to practice on and they don&#x27;t seem to mind going to school with a haircut from Dad.  As long as this keeps up, I am happy to save money for my wife&#x27;s ridiculously overpriced salon visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair gets 4 stars because of the extras.  I could have done without the super cheap barber scissors, super cheap comb and super super cheap barber cape.  I would have preferred and expected well made guide combs.  The super cheap guide combs are working just fine, but again, REALLY! COME ON MAN!</li>
            <li> I would appreciate a case with more internal dividers but overall, this kit has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head with a #1 for many years and have had my share of both electric and rechargeable trimmers. This is simply the best one I have owned. Being able to adjust the blade is huge.</li>
            <li> I buy based on reviews, and I know others do too.  Despite the great reviews here I can echo the words of another review who said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The unit itself stopped working properly after 6 months. It runs for a minute or so then just stops. I can turn it off and on and it will run for 30 seconds to a minute and stop. I kept it cleaned and oiled as per the instructions, but it still failed.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty well sums up my experience with the thing too.  Who knew that despite having a cord the unit will not operate while plugged in either once the batteries are shot.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> My husband is a professional barber and owns several high end clippers.  He recently asked for these cordless clippers to take with him when traveling.  So far he&#x27;s been very impressed.  He uses them mostly for trimming his beard a line up but he say that they work just as well as his other clippers and he doesn&#x27;t have to hassle with a cord.  The price is much more affordable and they&#x27;re just as effective.  Definitely a great value!</li>
            <li> I usually use Wahl products, kind of skeptical at first because I&#x27;m not sure about rechargeable clippers. Soon as I opened the box they were neatly packaged. The clippers were already charged, Reading the instructions it recommends you charge it. However there is a LED light that will flash when you have 3 min left.&lt;br /&gt;  My haircut was very fast, clippers were very sharp. Very satisfied. I would recommend these to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I have always used the traditional wire con air clippers but then to ease the bother of having to be close to a plug I decided to give it a go to this wireless clipper and as far as I have gone with this product I have not been disappointed by its performance. I love it and would recommend anyone to get one of this. It&#x27;s very affordable, clear instructions, which by the way, if you are already a clipper user just don&#x27;t bother having a look at the manual as they are just the basic stuff for maintaining and using any other clipper.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong comes with everything you need and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Clippers charge quickly and cut well. It is nice to not have to deal with a cord while cutting hair. Clippers also include a nice soft storage case.v</li>
            <li> wow i love these....great so far!!!</li>
            <li> Cuts hair like hot knife thru butter, works great battery sounds strong and constant through out the whole hair cut. Normally takes me 30 minutes to cut my hair and works fine the whole time.</li>
            <li> Does the job well also good for travelling overseas where they use 220v u don&#x27;t need adapter for power.  But remember u do need plague adapter.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my son who loves it.  Works perfectly for him and so far seems to be a lasting item.  The previous one (of a different brand) we purchased at a Walmart Store unfortunately did not last but this one seems to be the winner by far!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from these clippers but they have really delivered.  They have replaced my slightly more expensive corded clippers as they are better in nearly every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased these to only use when traveling abroad--I had no problem when charging in Europe (you of course still have to use an outlet plug converter).  They are much lighter than my corded clippers (which means less arm fatigue), quiet enough, hold a charge for a long time, and of course, there is no cord!  Another nice feature is that the lever has a number of fixed height settings, which means it does move unless you want it to (most hair clippers are NOT like this)--this is a great feature and important for getting a consistent cut.  I had a an issue with a hair guide clip breaking and Conair support were very helpful in solving that problem</li>
            <li> I had an older model with the old type battery for many years and it was fantastic.  I kept it until the battery just would no longer hold a charge.  This replacement has picked up right where the old one left off.  Love the fact that it has a lithium ion battery.  Cutter is and motor are very strong.  No problems going thru thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use great product cuts great</li>
            <li> They were good it was a good bye</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now I it works fantastic, the machine is very strong and the battery holds the charge for a long time. Definitely a great product to buy.</li>
            <li> This replaced a Wahl that I used for years. I wanted something cordless this time and this Conair is great. It has tons of power and cuts better than the corded Wahl did.</li>
            <li> Smooth cut. Bought for my husband and he loves it. It comes with an extensive kit. For beard and head. The clippers are definatly worth the money. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Is good , it that&#x27;s the job , good price, love it, fast delivery !!very prifesional!!batrery is good I real like it</li>
            <li> They idea of cordless is good but the reality is the cutting is not so good.  I have an old Wahl corded trimmer that I&#x27;ve used for many years.  Still using because this cordless trimmer leaves way too many hairs uncut using the different levels versus my very old corded Wahl which cuts through all levels with zero issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May have a bad batch, may need sharper blades, may need more power.  I don&#x27;t know.  It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had over a year and used about every two weeks for one person.  Blades are still sharp, never had a problem.  Light weight and easy to handle without cord.  I like them.</li>
            <li> I just received a used shaver. Hair everywhere!! This is so disgusting!! And wrong!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned various clippers including a number from Wahl and Panasonic. This has been the best so far -- motor seems to run at the right speed regardless of how much hair has to be cut.</li>
            <li> Works smoothly, so far.  I get several cuts out of one charge and I love that I can cut my son&#x27;s hair as he roams about (he&#x27;s two).  He tries to avoid haircuts which he can&#x27;t do anymore because I&#x27;m not tethered to a cord.  It seems to have the same cutting power when used on battery as when used with the cord.  I cannot attest on it&#x27;s durability yet, however.  Usually these cutters don&#x27;t last beyond a year for our family.</li>
            <li> Very good item and excellent and flexible supplier</li>
            <li> We have only used it a few times, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;- It cuts cleanly without pulling hair.&lt;br /&gt;- The motor feels strong and does not bog down even when run through thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;- The battery went through 3 heads without showing signs of tiring.&lt;br /&gt;- Even after extended periods in a drawer it holds a charge.</li>
            <li> I purchase this to replace a wahl beard trimmer that failed. It was much cheaper than buying another wahl and it works much better for my beard. Because of the size of the head I can trim much quicker. You can also adjust the clippers along with the plastic attachment to get just about any length you want. The shortest attachment is too short so I just dial the metal adjuster back a bit and get the exact length I want. The battery seems to last forever. It also works great to trim any unwanted body hair. We also borrowed it to my sister to cut her kids hair.</li>
            <li> My previous pair of Conair clippers lasted 8 years (they were not cordless). These clippers work great, the charge lasts for about 5 total head buzzing sessions - I love that they are cordless. If the charge does run out mid-buzz they can be plugged in as well. I bought the clippers in June 2014 and they are still working like the day they arrived. Good value and work well.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Lots of power, guards work well. power switch in odd location, but recommend !!</li>
            <li> This was not what I wanted.  After I ordered it I did some research and found out it was not the one that I thought it was.  How do I return it?</li>
            <li> I dare say that the use of the term \\&quot;professional\\&quot; is a bit much. . . but. . . having said that, this is a great item for home use.  I&#x27;ve been using Wahl brand clippers for several years.  My Wahl clippers are much heavier and feel \\&quot;stronger\\&quot; than the Conair. . . but. . . they have a cord, and that&#x27;s one thing that&#x27;s always been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving the Conair clippers a good charge, and taking them for a \\&quot;test drive\\&quot;, I must say that I&#x27;m VERY pleased.  It&#x27;s SO nice not having a cord to worry with.  The blades are sharp, and glide with ease.  A very nice variety of combs which go on easily.  They were also easily to remove. . . once I found out that you have to \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; the edges when removing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15-years.  I got tired of paying someone else to do it. . . .especially when I wasn&#x27;t all that happy sometimes.  I was a bit scared, at first, but then I got to thinking. . . it&#x27;s just hair.  .. if I \\&quot;mess-up\\&quot; it will grow back out.  I use a 1\\&quot; comb all over. . . then I go back and use a #4 on the sides and back.  Then I use the \\&quot;ear combs\\&quot;. . . then no comb all around to shave my neck.  Believe it or not. . . I have never had anyone say something bad about my hair. . . and on the contrary. . . sometimes people even ask me where I got it done, because they like it! ;-)  It&#x27;s not rocket science, and you can save a TON of money!</li>
            <li> Great quality Lithium Ion powered Clippers.  The set that I had received before were by Remington and I had nothing but issues with that pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely different story with these Conairs.  THe battery lasts SOOOOOO long and there is no worry any more of the charge giving out in the middle of a hair cut (As I have had happen to me on two occasions with the Remington)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can just tell by the weight and feel of the clippers and its components that this is a much better constructed high quality set of Clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> The Conair Professional Super Clipper is very well made, sturdy and with good-quality combs included.  The blade area is heavy metal and the body is sturdy plastic.  The on-off switch works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a little large for smaller hands to hold comfortably but it is contoured for easy grip.  It has an LED charge indicator and takes a little over three hours to charge when the battery is exhausted which will give over an hour of cutting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really more professional-quality construction than actually for professionas because barbers need corded clippers as they don&#x27;t have time for recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage bag included is a nice touch, although the scissors and cape included are rather cheap.</li>
            <li> Purchased in December 2014 and stopped working after 2 months.  I contacted Conair to send a new one and they told me my model was from 2012.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy from this shop as they sell inventory that&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf a long time.</li>
            <li> looks great its a awesome product no complains here.</li>
            <li> Far better and more consistent cut than my expensive corded Babyliss clippers - without the rat whip hitting ya in the chops every 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very ergonomic and lightweight...I should have bought this unit 2 years ago when I bought the Babyliss unit.  And you can get a &amp;#60; 1 level cut - move the blades and you&#x27;ll hit a 0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy!</li>
            <li> We have had this for about 1 month and it works fine, as advertised. But the first one we received had to be returned because it would not run without a power cord. Thank goodness Amazon took it right back without hassle. My 4 star rating is because of the defective first one. Otherwise, the blade is sharp and the cutter ran for about 1 hour on a single charge. Very pleased now.</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair clippers for a very long time and this is by far my favorite! I had tried cordless clippers in the past and they never seemed to work right. I prefer this brand over many others and decided to give this one a shot. I&#x27;m glad I did. Very comfortable and battery lasts a long time. I shave my head once a week and after the 3rd use I generally have to put the charger on it.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I got it to groom my little dogs.</li>
            <li> the price is right, good quality, great reviews</li>
            <li> I normally buy wahl clippers but amazon didn&#x27;t have any cordless ones that ship out here that I like.  The clippers are very nice same with the attachments that go with it.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.  I use cordless clippers when I deploy cause the voltage is different here.  My hair is very thick and it cuts it with easy.  I hope these last while I&#x27;m overseas.  Oh and the clippers are very silent compared to what I&#x27;m use to. Great job by Conair.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Conair Cordless Mustache Trimmer for many years, and it has served me very well.  I&#x27;m happy to report that this product seems every bit as good. For the price of two or three haircuts, you can own this set that includes a plethora of attachments and offers cordless operation as well. Of course there are other haircutting outfits available for less money, but would that be money well spent? I don&#x27;t believe so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main clipper unit is solidly constructed (in China, of course) and is in most ways comparable to the Remington unit that I reviewed a while ago. The blades are stainless steel, are self-sharpening, and work very efficiently.  The side-mounted taper control is metal instead of the usual plastic. The clipper operates at one speed only, but with this unit that&#x27;s quite enough.  It can be used corded, though for no more than 20 minutes, according to the manual.  For cordless operation, a 3-hour charge provides 75 minutes of use, and a 15-minute Quick Charge allows 15 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large number of attachments and accessories that are included makes this set very useful indeed.  There are eight different comb guides, plus two taper guides, one left and one right, to be used above the ears.  These guides are ingeniously designed to stay in place, unlike other guides that tend to pop off during use. A gentle side-to-side squeeze when attaching or detaching these guides locks them in place- how kool is that? Also included are scissors, combs, a styling clip to hold hair in place, a cleaning brush, and a tube of clipper oil. You even get a barber cape to keep clippings off, and a zippered case for convenient storage. If this haircutting set doesn&#x27;t have it, you don&#x27;t need it. (Vacuum Cleaner sold separately)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Owner&#x27;s Manual is in English and Spanish, and tells you everything you need to know, including all of the usual safety warnings, and a message about proper disposal of the internal Lithium Ion battery. This set carries a limited three-year warranty, which inspires confidence in its quality and utility. It might be a little pricey for some consumers, but in this case I believe that you get what you pay for. I recommend this haircutting set without hesitation.This set carries a limited three-year warranty, which inspires confidence in its quality and utility.

            <li> My wife used the clipper to trim my hair over the weekend and she likes it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the one we had, she commented that its :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- lighter&lt;br /&gt;- blade seems smoother (I supposed it is due to the closeness of the blades)&lt;br /&gt;- more verstile as it has taper controls&lt;br /&gt;- fairly long charge life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are some simple instructions for an \\&quot;All even hair-cut\\&quot; and \\&quot;Shorter back and sides, with length on the top\\&quot; cut, there were no illustrations nor dvd to demonstrate the cuttings etc. Hence we only tried the left and right ear guides - which was a pity since there were 10 hair guides for different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion : Unless you are semi-professional or have done some form of hair-cutting or hair-styling, this will be a great product. For the laymen, it is useful for simple trimming but you have to be brave to allow your spouse to try the other hair guides.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great and I love the cordless feature. I charged it once and have used it at least 6 times already and the battery has dies yet and my husband has a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers!  Love the versatility of cordless!  Charge lasts a long time!  Conair seems to have gotten it right, with all the accessories plus the blade position options. I only wish these clippers were washable, but I guess beggars can&#x27;t be choosers!</li>
            <li> this is really good haircut</li>
            <li> Sometimes these do-it-at-home clippers fall short in one or more ways . . . loses edge easily, runs down quickly, not cord/cordless flexible, cheap lightweight case and/or feel, noisy, etc.  But that is not at all my experience with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Conair HC1100AM I-Pro Professional Supper Clipper Lithium works hard to live up to its inflated name, and maybe achieves it.  Although not actually \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; like true barber shop grade clippers, it still has a solid feel (and sound). Cuts effortlessly and seems to be retaining that quality just fine(I only have about 4 or 5 uses on mine).  Power to spare with the lithium ion battery inside - or use with the power cord attached if you&#x27;re in a rush or doing extended multiple head cuts.  I&#x27;ve yet to run mine down, but the power specs claim: 3-hour full charge for 75 minutes of use, or 15-minute quick charge for 15 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of extras like 10 assorted guide comb attachments, scissors, styling combs, cape, etc - not to mention a very nice zip-up storage case.  The clipper has a tapering thumb lever (takes a little practice but a nice capability that I really haven&#x27;t seen in a while, and then only on professional barber&#x27;s clippers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a nice kit and a very decent value in my judgment.</li>
            <li> I used this basically as a touch up tool in between haircuts and these are great for that. They come with all the clipper sizes that you would see at a saloon and does the same job. I haven&#x27;t really been adventerous with these clippers but I am sure that with the right eyes and dexterity you can give yourself professional looking haircuts.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money! Our old, cheap clippers were miserable. These stay charged for ages, and cut so much better.</li>
            <li> used it a couple weekends ago my husband loves it battery health long to cut both sons hair.</li>
            <li> The Conair HC1100AM I-Pro Professional Super Clipper is actually a pretty good clipper. I found this clipper product to be handy and easy to use. I have used it several times since getting them and am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Purchased due to the noise that&#x27;s generated from both of our corded &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; clippers. The guards  are designed in such a way that they maintain constant contact with spring like grip on the cutting head. No more loud noise from a vibrating guards. Long run time with quick charge times.  For what you get for the price, this clipper is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;Corded or cordless operation, from Pro to Household use give this one a try!</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for a long time now with corded clippers and a hand mirror. Takes a little coordination and practice but now I can get perfect fades from skin to the 7-guard every week without having to wait in line, pay $20 bucks plus tip and try to come up with 30 minutes of small talk for the barber. These clippers are very light compared to the corded version. The lever adjustment is easy and quick. The guards stay on tight and don&#x27;t rattle, squeeze them to disconnect. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Clippers are as advertised. I use them a couple times a week to keep my beard neat and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet since the initial charge about a month ago. Very happy with the purchase and would recommend them to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Have been cutting my own hair for 40 years. Always used electric clippers with cords, and always fought the cord when I cut the back of my head. This cordless is perfect and well balanced. I will probably buy another one for travelling.</li>
            <li> The plastic blade holder that vibrates the moveable cutting blade back and forth just broke on me, and does not look fixable!! I&#x27;ve only had this unit since August, and it was only getting used once a week. Now I have to try to go through the warranty return process...</li>
            <li> Yes its cordless so no annoying cord always getting tangled with this. I have a job where I have to always be clean shaven and I have had my wife shave my head every two weeks for 4 years now. I had a corded Wahl trimmer that lasted this whole time without any real issues besides the pesky cord always tangling and in the way. This was perfect, NO CORD. I will saw it doeskin sound like it moves back and forth as fast as the corded Wahl however it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or anything so makes no difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this helpful please click that you did below. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> very solid instrument, I tried it just a couple of times and seems very accurate. Full accessories kit. A great value pack</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars(for what you get for the price), but after about 4 haircuts and 5 trims one of the apron ties ripped off(but has 3 more), and I tried to be careful with it each time. Even though the plastic clipper attachments look cheap, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them,. A nice feature that more clipper sets need to imitate of this set is you have to push the sides together to get them on/off the clipper. According to the box, a 3-hour charge will last 75 minutes, but I think mine has lasted longer, or so it seems that way. I&#x27;ve only had to charge this 2 times, one of course is initially and  second, got it on the charger right now. Not bad for some 5 haircuts and 7 trims. There is a light that tells you when the battery is getting low and the same light also can tell you when it is fully charged. It doesn&#x27;t get hot or feel heavy to the hand. While I can hear it running, it&#x27;s nothing noisy and doesn&#x27;t bother me. For the cutting part, I think it does a good job. All in all, for the money, I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> love it. works great! arrived quickly. pacakaged good.</li>
            <li> why do I have to plug it in and plug it out everytime to use the coreless feature ?</li>
            <li> Works great! I use it to cut my own hair - easy to do.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product now for a few weeks. I am extraordinarily pleased. Compared to my old worn out clippers, these are very smooth and efficient. I paid a little more for them than other options but I am more than pleased with their operation.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how this device has such great reviews. Is it your first kit and you have nothing to compare to? It is the loudest trimmer I have ever owned! The on/off switch is located very low, so you can not use your thumb to turn it off, it is a two hand device!! The scissors coming with the kit are just mediocre. The extensions are are very tight and you need some effort to put them on. Overall 2 stars for being sharp and looking good on the picture.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of hair clippers over the past many years and the latest was a Wahl which performed satisfactorily for a while but died a sudden death. I had never tried Conair before so I figured it was time to give it a look. Glad I did. The cordless feature is a real convenience and the charging time is fairly short. There are numerous types of attachments that allow for a generous number of cutting lengths. There are attachments specifically designed for each ear area as well. The noise level is not objectionable, the weight is comfortable and the grip is comfortable as well. I like my hair fairly short and the cutting attachment for a 1/2\\&quot; length produced an even and smooth result. I am very satisfied with this hair trimmer and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> shaves my husbands hair down to the scalp in the summer - he has a lot of hair and never a problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! The battery life is more than long enough once fully charged and cuts very smooth.</li>
            <li> Always bought Wahl but every time I wanted to use a guard, they would not clip so I would end up taking it off and get a buzz cut.  No problem with these, they cut through the hair effortlessly even with a guard on.l</li>
            <li> An outstanding Haircut Kit, containing all the accessories you&#x27;ll need for a well done trimming job. The various attachments easily latch-on and slide-off the Power Head (read User&#x27;s Instructions). They are made of good quality plastic material (by comparison to others I owned in the past). The Power Head is relatively light and its Lithium battery has plenty of juice for several haircut sessions... I used it already four times from its first, original full charge and still going strong (your mileage may vary). The noise it produces in operation is by no means offensive and I&#x27;d define it as acceptable. The only feature found in my previous trimmer that the present one lacks is the ability to remove the cutting blades assembly which, presumably, enabled easier cleaning. Additionally, replacement of the blades for whatever reason could be accomplished without any tools. If need be, (and it shouldn&#x27;t if you take good care of it) you can use an Allen Wrench to separate the blades from the rest of the unit. Most importantly: clean and lubricate the blades after each use and keep the protective cover over the blades, when in storage. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love it .Powerful and long lasting battery make this machine a real deal .</li>
            <li> Washed it out after first use. Water got in it somehow and it kept turning on at night and eventually would not turn off. Left out for the battery to die as this thing scared the crap out of me going on in the middle of the night randomly.</li>
            <li> Charge holds for a while</li>
            <li> very quiet, shape fits hand well, lithium battery holding charge very well (I charged the battery 15 hrs for first charge as directed) I am very glad I spent the money to upgrade to a cordless trimmer</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using some old clippers for a while to keep my head and beard trimmed. I decided to get something new and what a difference these clippers make!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, being cordless, I don&#x27;t have to drape and maneuver an extension cord. My old clippers were corded and it was tedious managing the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the battery lasts forever! I charged it once and have used it a dozen times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sharp, gives me a nice close shave on my head, not so close on my face without extra effort, which is fine. Did I mention it&#x27;s sharp? You can scrape yourself raw on the edges, but that&#x27;s to be expected, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to complain, I would say that it could use a few more guides for different shave lengths, but I am still very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li> Superb Clippers.  Awesome feel in your hand.  Nice blue LED light to indicate charging.  Fit and finish is perfect for the price.  Very modern looking with LOW noise/vibration.</li>
            <li> It stopped functioning on the 3rd use.&lt;br /&gt;You turn it on, it run like 10 seconds then stop by itself.</li>
            <li> Powerful and holds a charge for a long time I&#x27;ve had it for about half a year and only charged it once using it about once a month</li>
            <li> One of the things I hated about my previous corded clipper was the cord. It gets in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having a cord is awesome. It makes cutting your hair a much more enjoyable experience. Battery life is great. I have never ran out of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this clipper does not get as hot as my previous corded clipper, which would get so hot it would burn.</li>
            <li> This is a fine instrument; you can feel the quality in it.  I only use it for touch-ups - The battery never dies, it has been months since i recharged it.  I can not imagine a better clipper at any price.</li>
            <li> This really needs an adjustable head instead of a bag full of snap ons.</li>
            <li> First let me say I relaize it says Professional Clipper&lt;br /&gt;I like this trimmer, especially since one can charge and use without a cord to get in the way. There are alot of attachments, most of which I  would not use. It works well, no vibrating, is not overly noisey, fits the hand nicely and is easy to clean.It stores in a nice case and even comes with a plastic apron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and hate paying $20+  ( I am a widow on a strict budget) for a haircut that takes about 10 minutes ( plus drive time, gas etc.) I can do my hair when I need to, I don&#x27;t have to tip anyone :)  and  can be on my way in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the attachments I would think you would have to become a professional just to know what to use .&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend for both home and professional use. If you have  several people in the family that you give hair cuts to then I think it makes sense to purchase a clipper like this ,it will pay for itself in no time.</li>
            <li> Very handy clippers.  The set comes with a lightweight barber cape and tons of accessories.  There are a variety of guide combs in varying lengths (our last set of clippers only came with 2 guides).  I&#x27;m impressed with the cutting ability and control.  The set is lightweight and cordless so that makes using it very handy.  The little case for storage is also nice.  I think these clippers are excellent and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Cuts through hair like a hot knife through butter. I can&#x27;t believe how much better these are compared to the average corded clippers found in most stores.</li>
            <li> I really like it. I bought it more than 8 months ago and I and my son use it and it proved to be excellent.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power. You can hardly tell it&#x27;s cutting by listening to the motor. Even plowing through thick hair it doesn&#x27;t slow down noticeably. Really nice to not have a cord. Plenty of cutting time. Doesn&#x27;t vibrate nearly as much as my old clipper.</li>
            <li> Only received 1 star because 0 is not an option.  Do not buy.  Clippers do not hold a charge.  Like other reviewers, the clippers I receieved run for a few seconds and then turn off/run out of power.  I charged the clipper overnight, and the issue remains.  Returning these today.</li>
            <li> It only needs short time for battery charging and powerful. I used it for self-haircut sometimes, it is quite manageable.</li>
            <li> very gook item, the quality is very good, I am very satisfied with this product, would like to recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Love it. Been doing my own head for years now and it&#x27;s so nice having these cordless. Nice and sharp, no cord, easy breezy.</li>
            <li> Needed the machine for haircuts .&lt;br /&gt;The machine comes with a big kit of changeable heads which allows many types of cutting. &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts well .</li>
            <li> Conair really did a wonderful job designing these clippers.  It fits perfectly in my hands, the grip is non-slip.  Conair included several guides so that you can choose just the right length you&#x27;d like to cut your hair.  The clippers are not too noisy.  Some clippers are really loud.  The last clippers we owned had guides that kept slipping off when you used them.  These guides are sturdy and stay attached to the clippers when you&#x27;re cutting your hair.  As I&#x27;m the designated barber in this household, I give these clippers five stars.  Power, performance, and built to last.  Excellent all around!</li>
            <li> Love the option of cordless or corded. It has many lengths to choose from and is very compact for storage.</li>
            <li> Over a year and works great</li>
            <li> I was aware that  my 35 year old son cut his own hair for about 6 years and decided I&#x27;d try to cut my own also... for several reasons ( cheaper,  much more convenient, I can give myself a full hair cut and do quick trims whenever I wanted ). For the last 2 years I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair using the Wahl corded set and that has worked well.  You Tube was a great help the first time I cut my hair---took me about 30 minutes --first cut.  My cuts now take about 10-12 minutes and trim touchups about 3 minutes---especially with this Conair cordless clipper.  The corded clipper worked great ....but I kept thinking about the cordless models. Finally jumped !  I liked the Wahl corded clipper set----but since I bought this Conair cordless clipper  Well------( NO CORDS,  recharging is almost never--I only use it for small amounts of time,  charging time is a couple of hours at most --I have a guess I&#x27;ll probably recharge mine about 2x a year mostly because I want to.  I like the way the different spacers slip on and off -so slick. I should have bought this Conair cordless clipper..when I first started cutting my own hair.  Now I need to sell my corded set .</li>
            <li> Not as good as some other clippers I&#x27;ve used, but I guess at this price you don&#x27;t really get to complain. Wouldn&#x27;t buy them again though.</li>
            <li> I have had a set of Wahl wired hair clippers since I was in the Marine Corps in the late 90s and they served me well.  However, when my wife and I moved to Germany for six months (for her job) the clippers didn&#x27;t work right with the power inverters, so we bought another brand of clippers over there so I could continue cutting my own hair.  Unfortunately with the power differences (220 vs 110) and with the cost of purchasing a power converter it didn&#x27;t make sense to bring those clippers home, so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ordered these clippers immediately upon returning to the states in late June and I&#x27;ve used them twice.  I am by no means a barber but to me these feel every bit as good as the Wahl clippers that I had for the better part of 20 years.  Only a few stray hairs left here and there and I think that has more to do with my fine hair than the clippers (as I had this issue with my Wahl&#x27;s and the clippers in Germany as well.)  You can&#x27;t beat the price and they don&#x27;t vibrate your hand off, either.  Would definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for months with this. It is great quality and easy to clean. Charges quick and I only charge every three or four uses. Much easier than my old cutters with a cord.</li>
            <li> A good value, but they feel cheaply made and are a bit loud. I was expecting something a little heavier and quieter, like the clippers my barber uses. But for the price they do the job. Also there is no indication of amount of charge left in device, just a single LED that turns green when the device is fully charged. Would be nice to know how much charge is left in device wheb I turn it on. 4 stars because they are a great value, minus 1 star for being loud and lacking amount of charge remaining in battery.</li>
            <li> Works well, is light, and very adjustable. Battery is keeping is charge a long time.</li>
            <li> These clippers are excellent when I&#x27;m able to get  them to stay on. The clippers literally shuts down with a full charge.....turn them back on and the device shuts down again.</li>
            <li> Before getting into this review, I should state that I&#x27;m not a clipper expert.  We&#x27;ve always just gotten the cheapest model available and used it until it broke down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this time around I decided to get a wireless set of clippers and this Conair model seemed like the best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, it absolutely blows the clippers we&#x27;ve been using out of the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical when it first started up because it seemed like it was running too quietly.  My initial thought was that the wireless clippers probably weren&#x27;t as powerful as wired - but that turned out to be completely untrue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are quiet, and powerful enough to cut thick hair with ease.  The battery also lasts far longer than we need for a couple of haircuts (since my son &amp; I typically get our hair cut on the same day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love not having to worry about the cord getting wrapped up in everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I would definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for a good set of wireless hair clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sported a baldy (shaved to 0 or 1) for the last 20+ years and I&#x27;ve always shaved my own head.  My previous clippers were Pro grade which were Oster&#x27;s that barbers use and thie conair can&#x27;t compete with that however, it&#x27;s close.  The battery life on this gives me 4-5 haircuts a charge which is very impressive since I take my time.  The cut is smooth and clean.  The lever which you use to control the height or depth of cut clicks into place so it never changes unless you want it to.  I do wish there was a rubber feel to some parts where you hold it as this has slipped out of my hands twice now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this product and would not hesitate to buy it again.  The price now is $10.00 less than what I paid for so for those buying now, you&#x27;re getting a really good deal.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair and this product works perfectly and saves us some $$$</li>
            <li> Being cordless does make a huge difference. On/Off switch could be designed better. Still, it is a quality hair cutting tool. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for my husband, he&#x27;s had a lot of cordless clippers.  He says that these are the best ones he has ever had, bar far!  I&#x27;m thrilled to finally have some that will charge quickly.  If and when these wear out I&#x27;ll definitely buy another pair.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent clipper.  It charges fast, is very sturdy yet fairly lightweight, and cuts like a champ.  It includes a gigantic assortment of attachments, and even has scissors, combs, and a barbers-bib.  And it comes with a nice zipper bag to hold all of the goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to do home-haircuts, this is a great kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or if you are like me, it works great as a hair cutting device for, errr, \\&quot;all areas\\&quot;.  Use caution, but if you are a triathlete looking to get that hairless streamlined look, this little unit will do the job in about 10 seconds flat.  Just be careful because it would be easy to go overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one more usage - it cuts through pet-hair like butter.  My fluffy Persian cat doesn&#x27;t stand a change against this thing.  Conair Clipper 1, Kitty 0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whatever your hair-cutting needs are, I highly recommend this product - go forth and do great clippings!</li>
            <li> My wife has been giving me my cuts for years and better than any barber Ive had. This Conair handles my thick coarse hair with aplomb. It never comes close to running out of battery charge and my wife loves it because it makes the job easier and quicker. The build is solid and easily handled.</li>
            <li> We move and travel a lot, so the prospect of a cordless trimmer was very appealing. This device charges quickly and holds its charge for a good amount of time. It can also be used with the cord attached for up to 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an attractive unit, with its sleek design and diagonal ridges on the blade and switch. It comes with an unusual comb that is curved and has teeth on opposite sides at opposite ends of the comb. The attachments are also unique, with a single strip of plastic holding the teeth in place and a bowed back that clips onto the blade. The 8 attachments decrease in 1/8 inch increments from 1 inch to 1/8 inch. It also has 2 tapering tools, a regular comb, a clip, a nice black plastic cape, lubricating oil and a cleaning brush. All of this is held neatly in a rectangular zippered canvas carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several problems with this set:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The scissors are useless for cutting coarse hair. They might work for medium hair, but are not sharp enough for either fine or coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;2) The instructions are easy to read, but not comprehensive. For example, they don&#x27;t inform you that the attachments have to be squeezed at the sides to release them from the blade.&lt;br /&gt;3) The brush is not long enough to clean the thicker attachments. For this reason, you pretty much have to rinse all the attachments with water to remove the hair and then wait for them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;4) With their flimsy construction, my guess is that attachments will not last as long as those with a more substantial design.&lt;br /&gt;5) There isn&#x27;t a brush included to flick clippings off of your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;6) The tapering tools cut hair on the sides WAY TOO SHORT, unless you are getting a regulation military buzz cut.&lt;br /&gt;7) The case, while spacious and convenient for keeping everything together, is flimsy and does not have compartments, loops or other means of keeping the pieces from bumping or scratching each other.&lt;br /&gt;8) It comes with a 3-year warranty, but you have to send $5 shipping and handling if you return the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do better than this set. Although what I have keeps me tethered to a wall socket with its dedicated power cord, my Wahl shaver and its accessories work much better. Not only that, but they are priced about the same. Next time it&#x27;s Wahl or nothing for me!r warranty, but you have to send $5 shipping and handling if you return the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do better than this set.

            <li> This is a great product. It is very light weight, quiet, and works well. The accessories are what you&#x27;d find with pretty much any of the competitive units out there, and work the same. This thing charges in a reasonable amount of time, usually about 30 minutes or less for me (since I haven&#x27;t let the battery go to zero) and the light stops flashing to indicate full battery. It&#x27;s all plastic, the chrome looking parts are plastic, but if not abused then that shouldn&#x27;t matter. The blades are very sharp, and I adjusted them so I get an even closer cut. The case is a soft type but holds everything well. One thing I really liked, which may sound silly, is the cleaning brush. It is much heftier than the ones that I&#x27;ve had with other brands, and allows a good cleaning of the blades. Always remember to put a thin coat of the supplied oil on the blades. Made in China.</li>
            <li> The Conair Super Clipper has some features that make it ideal for touching up between haircuts or fine-tuning a home cut. My grandson is a special needs child and he hates haircuts from a barber. We have purchased an old-fashioned Flowbee that we use to do the overall first cut, but were looking for something smooth and quiet to then shape and finish the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew if we had a clipper that was too loud or even just once pulled the hair while trimming, it would be the last time we could get close to him with it without disguising it as a french fry or an Elmo puppet, so it was very nice to discover the Conair Super Clipper is as quiet and smooth and sharp as they come. I don&#x27;t have to push my luck and go over and over and over the same place trying to smooth the cut. It works quickly and efficiently. And did I say quietly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this would make a good clipper for a full haircut. Maybe some day we can ditch the Flowbee and try it out from start to finish. But for now, it is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is great but It didn&#x27;t come with a charger for some reason and Conair had some of the worst customer service ever. I hate Conair now but i do like the clippers.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!  Have been using this now for a few weeks and it works great for my very close crop hair.  Was delivered on time and is everything the description states.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good clipper, plenty of accessories. Lithium Ion is a great feature. It says charged for a long time, and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> The blade was crooked and it didn&#x27;t cut as well as my corded trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  I had a latter model that wore out.  This works much better.  I like the fact that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> Works great. Have paid for themselves already.</li>
            <li> its great for cutting my hair the way I always wanted to cut it</li>
            <li> Works great and is worth the price.  Power is good and battery life is excellent.  Cuts better than the Norelco I bought 2 years earlier.  Would have given it 5 stars but my only gripe is that the on/off switch is plastic and hard to manipulate with one hand covered in hair.  I suggest they make the button rubber so that you can grip it better.</li>
            <li> Got it for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day. He loves it so far.</li>
            <li> This haircut kit works fine, just have to practice a bit so you don&#x27;t end up with a partial Mohawk haircut by accident!  Charges easily and cordless is good, many attachments for different lengths.  Decent price.</li>
            <li> Nice, quality piece of equipment. Sturdy and gets the job done as advertised.</li>
            <li> This clipper feels comfortable and well-balanced in the hand, and runs for approximately the amount of time indicated per charge (this may vary according to individual use, of course). It trims evenly, despite the fact that I&#x27;m not always able to move the clipper across my head at an ideal angle. There are many different attachments provided, and the various combs are easy to attach and remove, compared to other clipper models I&#x27;ve tried. However, a caveat applies here: all of the attachments are made of a plastic that requires flexing to attach to the clipper, it&#x27;s likely that the attachments will become brittle or fatigued and will require replacement within a relatively short period (a year, like the Remington model I have used in the past?). I guess they are considered \\&quot;consumable\\&quot; parts that need to be replaced periodically, in the same way as metal blades. Additional accessories in the package include scissors, combs, cleaning brush, oil and even a barber&#x27;s cape! Assuming this device lasts for a few years, the price seems very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I use a trimmer for my hair as well as my son&#x27;s.  The challenge I have is, the cord won&#x27;t always plug in conveniently where I want or need to cut the hair.  I am not running a barbershop, so I try to avoid making a big mess.  I have tried wireless trimmers before, with mixed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is truly amazing.  It has all of the power of a corded trimmer, and yet offers the flexibility of being cordless.  It has all of the attachments you would expect, for various hair heights and for cleaning.  It charged very quickly right out of the box, I did not time it, but in just a couple of hours, it was fully charged.  I have used it a fe times on the initial charge and noticed no decline in performance.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked how it looked.  I gave it as a gift to my grandson and he has not commented on it, one way or the other, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Cut my hair twice with this product.  I like the fact the switch is lower in the unit.  It prevents accidental shutoff, which is important to me as I cut my own hair.  Looking forward to years of use out of this!  I also appreciate the switch for changing the cut length.  It actually stays put as I maneuver the cutter around my head.</li>
            <li> I bought this cordless clipper to cut my own hair and I found that not only is it easy to handle, it is also reasonably quiet. In fact, I gave my 14 month old son a hair cut and he sat comfortably still for the most part. My corded Wahl on the other hand is very loud and my son will protest if I use it to cut his hair. This Conair doesn&#x27;t feel as robust as my old Wahl, but I like it for it&#x27;s cordless convenience and quiet operation. Hopefully it will be just as reliable as my Wahl.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Has lithium ion batteries.  Can use either with cord or cord free.  Has taper control for custom settings, 10 comb guides, instructions.  Comes with stainless steel self-sharpening blades, has high-power motor, on and off switch.  A full 3 hour charge lasts for 75 minutes of use.  You can also do a 15 minute quick charge for 15 minutes of use.  The product comes with a limited 3 year warranty.  It claims to cut all hair types.  It also comes with a storage case, blade cover, barber comb, styling comb, cleaning brush and oil, barber cape, styling clip, barber scissors -- 20 pieces in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this for my 40-year old son and he is quite happy with it. The product seems to be very good for home use.  They do not appear to be designed for facial hair, but it does work well in a pinch (just not a real close shave).  It also appears it would even work on 10 pound Tippy the Pampered Toy Poodle and her thick curly hair for the amateur dog groomer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be more happy with this product. I was always afraid of doing my haircut by myself thinking of a possible disaster with my hair but I was tired of paying $20-$30 every 2-3 months without having the results I wanted. So I finally decided to buy a haircut kit and I found this one with good reviews and the amazing price so I decided to buy this kit.    Last night I tried out of the box (without even charging the device) and I was able to cut my hair with no problem. Very easy to use, powerful and quiet. 20 piece is a LOT! Even the barber cape was very useful to keep the hair falling to one place and not to my clothes.    Initially the device feels cheap (maybe because of the plastic of the case) but when you start using it you will feel that the quality is there. It is also very quiet compared with my last 8 years old Conair beard trimmer.    On my first attempt I was able to cut my hair exactly as I wanted and I am so happy knowing that I don&#x27;t need to depend any more  on my barber and I can save that money for something else.    I used #3 on the sides and back, #4 on the top/back and #6 on the top/front and I received a lot of compliments next day at work about my haircut.</li>
            <li> None of the menfolk in my house get fancy haircuts. Once a month i line them up, let them choose the clipper length, and off goes the extra hair. This clipper has sufficient battery power to do one adult head and one preschooler head without slowing down in the slightest, and without dragging a cord around. We&#x27;ve yet to suffer any pulled hairs, a common problem in our old clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with several different guard lengths, so you have the ability to have your hair as long as you want it without futzing around with one of those annoying adjustable guards that like to adjust in the middle of a trim. And if you&#x27;re the predictable sort that always uses the same guard, you can dump the rest in a box somewhere and reduce the clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s a great hair cutter, it&#x27;s a bit too big and clunky to be used for any beard or mustache detail work. If you&#x27;ve got a generic beard and just like to keep the length under control, it&#x27;ll be fine, but if you want to do any shaping or trimming you&#x27;ll need a different clipper</li>
            <li> I really like this hair cutting tool. It is easy to use, and basic enough for anyone to use. I am able to give my child and husband a simple hair cut and it saves us tons of money to do it ourselves</li>
            <li> Fantastic , light weight trimmer with all the necessary guards. This is my favorite hair clipper that I&#x27;ve ever owned. Great seller, fast shipping, amazing product at a great price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5d669dd206eccb3b61e670f15189797]] I love these hair clippers! I might be exaggerating in my title, because I&#x27;m pretty sure that some barber somewhere has better clippers than these, but they&#x27;re definitely the best hair clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. I shave my entire head about three times a month, and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year, so I use this a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in my video, head shaving is a precise art, that requires the shaver to go into all sorts of nooks and crannies around my ears, nose, and mouth. It&#x27;s kind of bulky for detail work, but it works well for my bald head. So, it&#x27;ll definitely work for any hair or body part that you need to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, everything about this shaver is high quality, even the extensions, which I don&#x27;t use since I&#x27;m bald. I love the lithium ion battery, which means that I don&#x27;t have to worry about this shaver getting a battery memory, like my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver lasts about 5-6 head shaves before it needs to be recharged, which is about 5 times longer than my last clippers. I highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Works either with or without a cord&lt;br /&gt;+Has high quality extensions&lt;br /&gt;+Battery lasts for an extremely long time&lt;br /&gt;+Lithium Ion battery&lt;br /&gt;+Only takes a few minutes to get enough of a charge to start using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Needs at least a little battery to run, so you have to wait a few minutes before using even if you plug it in&lt;br /&gt;-Takes some practice before you can do what I do in my video without a few scratches</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.  The product is so defective that it will not charge and will only run for about 2-3 seconds. Either it was sitting on the shelf for years and the battery decayed or they just made a completely crappy product. Stay away. I will never trust a conair product ever again. Complete lack of quality control. How can this company stay in business. Absolutely the cheapest piece of crap I have ever spent money on......</li>
            <li> Works really good. Lots of power and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great so far and seems quality</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my daughter. With numerous mirrors, she was able to give herself a haircut.</li>
            <li> A quality hair cutter.  My wife has cut my hair for the entire 42 years we&#x27;ve been married.  She LOVES it!</li>
            <li> Did not work after first charge. I&#x27;m glad Amazon has a good return policy, I will get a Wahl.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy workhose clipper for those who do family haircuts at home. We bought a Conair 18 years ago and only stopped using it recently since the older model required long charge times and it wasn&#x27;t holding the charge for very long. I have three thick haired heads to trim on a monthly basis and this new clipper handles them very well indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are the best features of this newer version?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The lithium ion battery charges up in three hours flat and gives you 75 minutes of use. If you run out of juice you can still use it corded, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you are in a hurry and forgot to charge it you can charge it for 15 minutes to get a quick 15 minutes of use, or use it corded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The guide combs. These are plastic and do require to flex a little to be clipped onto the blade. The previous Conair we had used the same type of guide combs and not a single one broke or cracked in all the time we used it.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, we used a Remington for a few months [[ASIN:B004I8NO8A Remington HC5550 Precision Power Haircut &amp; Beard Trimmer Corded &amp; Cord-Free Use]] which came with slide on blades that could be adjusted to different heights. A tooth on the guide piece that had the most height options broke and left a jagged edge. Even if you do end up somehow breaking a tooth on one of the Conair guides, each height is on a different piece and so you can easily switch to a marginally shorter or longer hair length and not have the machine become useless until a replacement blade arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The motor is quite powerful and does a great job with thick hair. Didn&#x27;t hear it straining at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. comes with oil that you need in order to lubricate the blades, a cape (a must for ticklish kids!) and scissors for the detailed areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where it could be better :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Conair blades are held in place with two screws. Cleaning behind the cutting blades is an absolute pain. Some newer models, like the Remington mentioned above, now come with a slide button tha allows you to pop the blade up and wash out the hair and stuff that may be stuck behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. A pop out edging trimmer would have been  lovely bonus. We still end up using the moustache trimmer bit from a Phillips Norelco for sideburns and trimming around the neck [[ASIN:B004EXGN8W Philips Norelco 8240XL Speed-XL Shaver]] especially for my younger child who does not want the big trimming blade or a scissor anywhere near his face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with areas for improvement this is a excellent hair cutting kit. The design of the guides has been proven with time and, from my experience based on older models, the motors are well designed and last a long time. Highly recommended.the Remington mentioned above, now come with a slide button tha allows you to pop the blade up and wash out the hair and stuff that may be stuck behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.

            <li> I rarely give a full 5 stars to a product, but the Conair HC1100 Super Clipper deserves at least 5 stars. It is everything I want in a clipper. Let me preface this review by telling you that I have a used a top of the line Wahl for many years and LOVED it.....well, I love the Conair more. I did not think Conair would make such a high quality product, but the material is definately high quality. And what a great attention to detail. The first thing that I loved was that it came charged. Second, cordless use! OMG, I LOVE it!!! It makes it so much easier to handle. The only thing I do not like is that the guides are in millimeters. For those outside America, you will love this, but here, we work in inches. My Wahl had everything in fractions of an inch and I loved it. I don&#x27;t want to do the conversion. Normally I would bump it down to 4 stars, but the Super Cliper is so great, that I leave it at a solid 5 stars. Battery life is excellent and I have yet had to charge it back up. Make sure you keep it clean and well oiled and it should last a long time. The plastic guides are thicker than my Wahls, and should last equally as long. They fit better than my Wahl, and are not that difficult to remove. The Superr Clipper cuts quickly and cleanly. My thin hair was a piece of cake, but so was my sons thick hair! Perfect! If you are looking for a great clipper, look no further. You&#x27;ve found it. Buy it, and enjoy....as I am! :-)</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing anybody thinking about getting these go ahead and buy them NOW they are worth every penny. No tugging even without a guide on the blade</li>
