            <li>Love this face protection.</li>
            <li>Using one wek now and see my skin is more even tone and fading some spots.  </li>
            <li>The brown spots, tags, and many wrinkles were gone.</li>
            <li>I am close to 60 years old and the difference in my skin is truly incredible.</li>

            <li>my skin feels great and it really seems to work.</li>
            <li>I love that it has 30 spf.  </li>
            <li>I like this very much!!@</li>
            <li>It is light but still moisturizes thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>It helps smooth my skin and erases lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and good for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time a product that was meant to make my skin look better...</li>
            <li>I love it, really works</li>
            <li>I love the Neostrata products, this moisturizer leaves your skin so soft and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>it ;&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>been using for a few years and love it!</li>
            <li>You have to give it a chance because I really think your skin needs to adjust to it</li>
            <li>and I really think it helps to lighten spots caused by blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic moisturizer, not greasy and a little goes a long way - Love it!</li>
            <li>feels good, i can scrap all my other facial products like toner and serums.</li>
            <li>Not sure it protects skin against radicals as it claims but goes on smooth, fragrance free and like the SPF 30.</li>
            <li>Used to have very oily, shiny skin which became normal with age.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and have gotten 2 new pimples which is unusual for me</li>
            <li>I like the SPF 30 factor, not too high.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few years and my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>my skin also feels softer and more firm.</li>
            <li>I only wish it came in a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, and have not felt any stinging immediately after applying the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but its really good.</li>
            <li>Appreciate the broad spectrum SPF 30 without any yucky sun protection feel.</li>
            <li>When she came for a visit at Thanksgiving, I told her how much younger she looked and how clear her skin was.</li>
            <li>This is the second tube of this mosturizer so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 48 yr old Asian.  </li>
            <li>a little oily just at first - but soaks in in 3 minutes to non-greasy.</li>

            <li> Been using for several years now. I like it...not greasy. Absorbs quickly and good for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great price and received within two days!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended as an updated Neostrata that I was already using.  I like this very much!!@</li>
            <li> This night time moisturizer always does it&#x27;s job.  It is light but still moisturizes thoroughly.  It helps smooth my skin and erases lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I am using Neostrata product for over 15 years, and I am super happy with all they make!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have become a hooked on Neo Strata products</li>
            <li> This is the second tube of this mosturizer so far and I really love it. You have to give it a chance because I really think your skin needs to adjust to it but it keeps my combination skin at bay.  It seems to add plumpness to my face and I really think it helps to lighten spots caused by blemishes.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like Neostrata products.  I like the SPF 30 factor, not too high.  I do not like looking pale in the summer.</li>
            <li> As promised.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love the Neostrata products, this moisturizer leaves your skin so soft and non-greasy.  So glad I switched to using the Neostrata system.</li>
            <li> I love it, really works</li>
            <li> Love this face protection. Appreciate the broad spectrum SPF 30 without any yucky sun protection feel. Also does not go white on face like some SPF products do and I haven&#x27;t had one pimple from it, thank goodness!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it ;&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years and my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> I was delighted with my purchase and intend to shop again on Amazon, the price, speed of delivery and product was excellent.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Using one wek now and see my skin is more even tone and fading some spots.  I using this at night and the matrix support during the day. I will review again in couple months</li>
            <li> I never write these review things. I don&#x27;t even know why I am doing this one. Well, I do like this product. It&#x27;s expensive, but its really good. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy at all. Reduces aging spots over time. Like give it three months, but you will notice a difference. I only wish it came in a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> been using for a few years and love it!</li>
            <li> feels good, i can scrap all my other facial products like toner and serums.</li>
            <li> My sister is a missionary in Honduras. Her fair skin was covered with brown aging spots and tags. She went to a medical doctor for a check-up because she is a multiple myeloma survivor, and the woman noticed her skin and recommended NeoStrata Active Matrix and NeoStrata Cellular Restoration. When she came for a visit at Thanksgiving, I told her how much younger she looked and how clear her skin was. The brown spots, tags, and many wrinkles were gone. I immediately ordered both products. I would like to shout from the rooftops how incredibly wonderful NeoStrata is. I am close to 60 years old and the difference in my skin is truly incredible. I LOVE NEOSTRATA. It&#x27;s the first time a product that was meant to make my skin look better...actually worked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 48 yr old Asian.  Used to have very oily, shiny skin which became normal with age.  Neostrata skin active matrix is a white cream like lotion that goes on white, but does not leave any white residue.  However, it does leave my skin shiny - like I have oily skin again!  I do not have sensitive skin, and have not felt any stinging immediately after applying the product.  However, I do notice some flaking at the end of the day, so I think the product is working. After 3 - 4 days of continuous use, my skin does feel a little raw, but nothing too bad (like red or itchy or blotchy).  Just a little dry and uncomfortable.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and have gotten 2 new pimples which is unusual for me, so I think it&#x27;s because of this product.  Will continue trying it to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li> my skin feels great and it really seems to work. my skin also feels softer and more firm. I will definately recommend.</li>
            <li> Like the tube but the product is a bit sticky.  Hard to wear makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I love that it has 30 spf.  a little oily just at first - but soaks in in 3 minutes to non-greasy. no powder needed.  No skin reactions whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer, not greasy and a little goes a long way - Love it!</li>
            <li> Not sure it protects skin against radicals as it claims but goes on smooth, fragrance free and like the SPF 30. Might buy regular SPF going forward.</li>
