            <li>so it works perfect for that as well.overall I will be using this product for now on.</li>
            <li>Not the best out there....</li>
            <li>I do my best to attain hair products that don&#x27;t turn my hair into straw.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and the price is awesome.</li>
            <li>, if it were perfect for him, I&#x27;d give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li>the best Axe has to offer.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a very good product.</li>
            <li>He likes the hold - win win!  </li>
            <li>none of it particularly good!</li>
            <li>He loved it!</li>
            <li>Axe Spiking Glue is a great product.</li>
            <li>product worked great for me.</li>
            <li>it has a great AXE scent (although the container doesn&#x27;t specify which AXE scent it is).  </li>
            <li>This smells great.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>The hold is great, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The scent of this is, of course, great for him</li>
            <li>price at Amazon was great</li>
            <li>I applied this product to a damp head, my hair looked very nice and didn&#x27;t harden.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell and just a bit - a couple of drops - is needed to style my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a good product with a good scent</li>
            <li>Axe makes a good spiking glue.  </li>
            <li>My son took it, so it must be really good because he has good taste of things like this.</li>
            <li>summary, it could have been Axe, Wax or Tax, it does the job as good as any.</li>
            <li>This is a middle-of-the-road styling product, which isn&#x27;t surprising considering the price and the fact that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The reason I choose 5 stars because this axe gel product is wonderful fast shipping to axe has the best products I would be looking forward to buy more axe products</li>
            <li>I used this product on my son&#x27;s hair and we both liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Whatever styling gel and liked the results.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s just now getting to the age where he styles his own hair</li>
            <li>Even better, it smells pretty great, which makes my wife a happy camper.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and washes out easy!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product that comes in a reasonable size for me to travel with.</li>
            <li>The smells were great and weren&#x27;t as powerful as cologne, but had more kick than the fragrance of aftershave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This held my hair on the most humid days in Florida.</li>
            <li>However, the smell is over the top.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t do that with Axe spiking glue without using more product.    </li>
            <li>Many could say I have a \\&quot;slick\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>What makes me wonder is: where is the Axe touch?&lt;br /&gt;Axe is primarily a scent, and a rather nice one if used sparingly.</li>
            <li>When I added the Axe Styling Aid, I found this was the one with the cap off most often.</li>
            <li>Likes most Axe products.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s okay, but</li>
            <li>but as a woman, it&#x27;s my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>so glad I did</li>
            <li>and I received it in a couple of days.....with free shipping!</li>
            <li>A great smelling decent product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anything that smells this good and has this good of a marketing campaign is sure to please most teenage boys.</li>
            <li>A good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>cool stuff!</li>
            <li>My nephew is a huge fan of the spiked hair</li>
            <li>its great for guys maintaining a short hairstyle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Later, I got a free canister of Axe</li>
            <li>However, what I&#x27;ve seen so far has been good:    </li>
            <li>I guess it would work better with straight hair which is more manageable.</li>
            <li>Overall, Axe has a good product, but there are better ones out there (and cheaper too).  </li>
            <li>so I have to get something with super strong hold to keep it styled the way I like.</li>
            <li>is the first time I have used one of Axe&#x27;s hair products and I am both satisfied and disenchanted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say that is generally true.  </li>
            <li>My two teenage boys loved it, it works as intended.  </li>
            <li>Also because its thinner, I assume, it seems like you have more time to work with it, which the Got2b Glued stuff always seemed to harden too fast.  </li>
            <li>A technique many companies are taking in modern times....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to work into your hair, and it stiffens pretty quickly after your hands leave your hair.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly the same - great, all day hold, keeping my hair looking exactly how I set it in the morning.</li>
            <li>Nice texture and really nice aroma - and holds up well without making your hair hard.  </li>
            <li>Left on my fingers after putting it into my own hair it feels sort of tacky to touch.</li>
            <li>Yeah, right,</li>
            <li>and I use the &#x27;glue&#x27; right after towel drying my hair</li>
            <li>It was easy to dispense and provided just the right amount of hold for a busy school day!</li>
            <li>and I would not use this in my own hair, but it does achieve the look my son with very short hair wants.</li>
            <li>I liked this product for the way it holds and how it ultimately doesn&#x27;t have too much fragrance when it dries and sets.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my 21 year old son who really likes most of the Axe products.  </li>
            <li>One tube can typically last two months for me, sometimes more.</li>
            <li>and I have to try several more products.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hair spray, mousse, gel, wax, and such in my hair through the years, and Axe Spiking Glue ranks up there with my favorite of these products.</li>
            <li>I also remember being one of the first guys I knew who gobbled these products up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use pomades and gels and this looks more like a lotion or actual glue..  </li>
            <li>Though I am a bit old to be the typical Axe customer - I was pleasantly suprised with this product.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is an easy three star product.</li>
            <li>suppose Axe became smart in their marketing department and branched out to shampoo, body wash, and deodorant and hair products.  </li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, the hold is fine but breaks apart under the slightest sweat or physical stress.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it can be hard to get a good balance between \\&quot;holds hair\\&quot; and \\&quot;not stiff\\</li>
            <li>My son really likes this to hold his curls or spike his hair.</li>
            <li>Too much and your hair may look like it&#x27;s been embalmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks</li>
            <li>Who has rather wavy hair than straight.</li>
            <li>I am too old to use this for spiking, but I use it to style my hair to give it a youthful and fresh look, like you just came out of the gym.  </li>
            <li>However, I really had to work this product into my hair because it really looked like \\&quot;glue\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Once I applied the product held my hair very well in a comb backed style.</li>
            <li>In addition, it didn&#x27;t take much to use to achieve the style I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it during work and it has held up very well.  </li>
            <li>and he really likes that.  </li>
            <li>- so if you need your hair glued up stick straight, then by all means this is a 5-star all the way.  </li>
            <li>The hold is almost as good as got2b spiking glue hold (the only other spiking glue we use in our family)and</li>
            <li>He uses other Axe products and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value and a solid alternative to more expensive products.</li>
            <li>The same is true of Axe Styling Aid Hold Plus Touch Spiking Glue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but it comes in a much larger package, and I travel frequently...</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you are used to using paste but want something a bit easier to apply - this is a really good alternative as it is a very thick cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but I suggest you use only a little dab, you know, as suggested in those old Brylcream commercials:</li>
            <li>\\&quot;People with your kind of hair (thick and wavy), need something to help it &#x27;lay&#x27;,\\&quot; he said.</li>
            <li>It holds as firmly as a hair spray (though you can&#x27;t really brush it out of your hair - hair stays pretty crispy until your next shower) while being easy to apply with your hands like hair gel.    </li>
            <li>and it holds up on a hot day when Im outside sweaitng.</li>
            <li>My hair is usually pretty short</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not one for hair gel, but I bought some once on the recommendation of my barber.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently,  I was given a tube of this Styling Aid, and wow!</li>
            <li>only other spiking glue I&#x27;ve tried before was the Got2b Glued stuff, and this seems better to me.  </li>
            <li>I would not personally use this stuff, but it does offer a very strong hold with only a 75% wet look...not the LA</li>
            <li>I think its a bit stiff- smells too strong and would not use it for longer hair</li>
            <li>Once it dries your pretty much stuck with the style like any other styling gel.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still touchable and not stiff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not as stiff a hold as the got2b spiking glue</li>
            <li>The real challenge for me is finding something that will hold up well in the Arizona heat and low humidity.</li>
            <li>The container is neat with an asymmetrical top, although my only complaint is that the lid does not snap shut very well (that may just be a one-time issue).  </li>
            <li>I am honestly not too sure what I can say about a \\&quot;spiking glue\\&quot; which is basically a hair gel.  </li>
            <li>Not heavily scented either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not hold up longer hair very well and adds a \\&quot;crunch factor\\&quot; when using a larger amount of the product for longer hair dos.</li>
            <li>He generally wears his hair in a short faux-hawk (like a mohawk, but the sides are not completely shaved - just very short while the top remains longer/higher).  </li>
            <li>The product is extremely thick and pasty, but it really alows you to sculpt your hair any way you see fit</li>
            <li>Its a little greasy on your hands when applying, but wash off quickly so it does feel like glue.</li>
            <li>At first, the product seemed a little strange, it is more of a cream like consistency instead of the typical gel.  </li>
            <li>however, as a styling aid for his hair his complaint is that this is just too strong.  </li>
            <li>Axe typically makes an adequate product and this Styling Aid gel is no different.</li>
            <li>Also, the spikes&#x27; hold is not stiff enough to remain spikes after you put on a hat, accidentally run a hand through your hair, or bump your head into something.    </li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to use too much as it can give a \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a young man who would normally go out and get axe products.</li>
            <li>Its much more thin a product, which makes it easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>There is no question that this \\&quot;cement\\&quot; works well, leaving no awful gunk behind.</li>
            <li>This spiking glue does exactly what it says it does, it spikes your hair and holds it tight.  </li>
            <li>I used a little too much the first time just because i expected to need that much from past gels, but this one i only needed an amount slightly smaller than a pea vs something the size of a grape.  </li>
            <li>&quot; (i.e. if you use too much of it, your hair won&#x27;t move at all, but use too little and the product doesn&#x27;t work).</li>

            <li> I am too old to use this for spiking, but I use it to style my hair to give it a youthful and fresh look, like you just came out of the gym.  </li>
            <li> However, I really had to work this product into my hair because it really looked like \\&quot;glue\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Once I applied the product held my hair very well in a comb backed style.</li>
            <li> In addition, it didn&#x27;t take much to use to achieve the style I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it during work and it has held up very well.  </li>
            <li> and he really likes that.  </li>
            <li> - so if you need your hair glued up stick straight, then by all means this is a 5-star all the way.  </li>
            <li> The hold is almost as good as got2b spiking glue hold (the only other spiking glue we use in our family)and</li>
            <li> He uses other Axe products and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value and a solid alternative to more expensive products.</li>
            <li> The same is true of Axe Styling Aid Hold Plus Touch Spiking Glue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but it comes in a much larger package, and I travel frequently...</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you are used to using paste but want something a bit easier to apply - this is a really good alternative as it is a very thick cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but I suggest you use only a little dab, you know, as suggested in those old Brylcream commercials:</li>
            <li> \\&quot;People with your kind of hair (thick and wavy), need something to help it &#x27;lay&#x27;,\\&quot; he said.</li>
            <li> It holds as firmly as a hair spray (though you can&#x27;t really brush it out of your hair - hair stays pretty crispy until your next shower) while being easy to apply with your hands like hair gel.    </li>
            <li> and it holds up on a hot day when Im outside sweaitng.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually pretty short</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not one for hair gel, but I bought some once on the recommendation of my barber.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently,  I was given a tube of this Styling Aid, and wow!</li>
            <li> only other spiking glue I&#x27;ve tried before was the Got2b Glued stuff, and this seems better to me.  </li>
            <li> I would not personally use this stuff, but it does offer a very strong hold with only a 75% wet look...not the LA</li>
            <li> I think its a bit stiff- smells too strong and would not use it for longer hair</li>
            <li> Once it dries your pretty much stuck with the style like any other styling gel.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still touchable and not stiff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as stiff a hold as the got2b spiking glue</li>
            <li> The real challenge for me is finding something that will hold up well in the Arizona heat and low humidity.</li>
            <li> The container is neat with an asymmetrical top, although my only complaint is that the lid does not snap shut very well (that may just be a one-time issue).  </li>
            <li> I am honestly not too sure what I can say about a \\&quot;spiking glue\\&quot; which is basically a hair gel.  </li>
            <li> Not heavily scented either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not hold up longer hair very well and adds a \\&quot;crunch factor\\&quot; when using a larger amount of the product for longer hair dos.</li>
            <li> He generally wears his hair in a short faux-hawk (like a mohawk, but the sides are not completely shaved - just very short while the top remains longer/higher).  </li>
            <li> The product is extremely thick and pasty, but it really alows you to sculpt your hair any way you see fit</li>
            <li> Its a little greasy on your hands when applying, but wash off quickly so it does feel like glue.</li>
            <li> At first, the product seemed a little strange, it is more of a cream like consistency instead of the typical gel.  </li>
            <li> however, as a styling aid for his hair his complaint is that this is just too strong.  </li>
            <li> Axe typically makes an adequate product and this Styling Aid gel is no different.</li>
            <li> Also, the spikes&#x27; hold is not stiff enough to remain spikes after you put on a hat, accidentally run a hand through your hair, or bump your head into something.    </li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to use too much as it can give a \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a young man who would normally go out and get axe products.</li>
            <li> Its much more thin a product, which makes it easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> There is no question that this \\&quot;cement\\&quot; works well, leaving no awful gunk behind.</li>
            <li> This spiking glue does exactly what it says it does, it spikes your hair and holds it tight.  </li>
            <li> I used a little too much the first time just because i expected to need that much from past gels, but this one i only needed an amount slightly smaller than a pea vs something the size of a grape.  </li>
            <li> &quot; (i.e. if you use too much of it, your hair won&#x27;t move at all, but use too little and the product doesn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent stuff, but a little too \\&quot;hard\\&quot; for me.</li>
            <li> - Long lasting  </li>
            <li> I actually like his hair spiked instead of the long in your eyes look.</li>
            <li> To quote the old Brylcream commercial, \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> After several uses I can say it&#x27;s clearly not the best and certainly not the worst.</li>
            <li> Even if you retouch hair when dry the hair retains placement, but you can definitely feel it is still in the hair.</li>
            <li> It was decent on my short hair, but when my wife tried it on her longer hair, it was very stiff and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have gave up moose a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I gagged and they weren&#x27;t even in the room, the odor lingers that long.  </li>
            <li> However, I used to be the sales manager for a beauty supply company (a long time ago!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually need strong holding gel but dislike the stiff feeling, this gel will hold firmly but still allows some movement.  </li>
            <li> Usually a pea size amount will provide a decent hold to keep my hair where I wantit, yet there&#x27;s no shine or wet look.  </li>
            <li> I prefer my other two spiking glues: American Crew pomade and Got2Be glued.  </li>
            <li> The product gives that dry clumping look.</li>
            <li> Just the tiniest of dabs worked into wet hair and styled immediately afterwards will stay in place all day long.</li>
            <li> the gel doesn&#x27;t seem to loose its hold.  </li>
            <li> Looks junk, but not a high end styling product.</li>
            <li> Solid product all around, the only negative might be the price per ounce.</li>
            <li> My cabinet contains about 6 or 7 partially used containers of product that I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this....</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s also water soluble, so any sweat or wet hands will immediately wreck your spikes.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy and bit on the long side hair that I comb back.</li>
            <li> - A little goes a long way    </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way with this...</li>
            <li> I usually use hair gel or pomade to comb my hair back.  </li>
            <li> Will keep on purchasing and throw out the other glue products that never have their caps removed.</li>
            <li> It holds the hair in place, just as promised, and if that&#x27;s the result you seek, you probably have to accept that there&#x27;s going to be a slightly unnatural feel to your hair when you run your fingers through it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not used half of it..  </li>
            <li> (slightly damp).  </li>
            <li> Like the other Axe product I tried, this can leave your hair feeling a little stiff, but thankfully it isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> A very small amount went a long way and performed the way I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;A little dab will do ya.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I like a few spikes in my hair</li>
            <li> My son has quite a few glues on the counter.</li>
            <li> Worked well on my husbands shorter hair, but on my longer hair I just ended up with uneven texture-</li>
            <li> I prefer something like wax where you get movement and flexibility but still keep firm hold (as opposed to death grip stiff firm hold).</li>
            <li> Now trying to get him to talk about it is not easy since he is a guy of few words.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave it all stiff and gummy...  </li>
            <li> Also, when it dried there was very little flaking of the product</li>
            <li> I seldom use spiking glue, usually I go with gel or a pomade.  </li>
            <li> he&#x27;s past the stick-straight-spike look and now prefers a softer hold.</li>
            <li> So unless you feel the need to waste money or truly believe that women are going to accost you because you use Axe products, which is one of Axe&#x27;s promotion campaigns, I would just save your dollars and buy a less expensive product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it leaves hair crunchy like a gel,and wet looking.  </li>
            <li> I am in the field all day and between the sun, working and being at work for at least 10 hours</li>
            <li> Lame.     </li>
            <li> This product is WAY too expensive for the size of the tube and what the product does.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a bad choice, for those who want spiking glue.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s shampoo,or styling products,they are awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My son loves this. Anything that smells this good and has this good of a marketing campaign is sure to please most teenage boys. The product itself is a white paste, similar to the consistency of white glue. Left on my fingers after putting it into my own hair it feels sort of tacky to touch. The product gives that dry clumping look. Even if you retouch hair when dry the hair retains placement, but you can definitely feel it is still in the hair. Hair products are very personal and I would not use this in my own hair, but it does achieve the look my son with very short hair wants.</li>
            <li> This spiking glue does exactly what it says it does, it spikes your hair and holds it tight.  The product is extremely thick and pasty, but it really alows you to sculpt your hair any way you see fit and it holds up on a hot day when Im outside sweaitng.</li>
            <li> Axe typically makes an adequate product and this Styling Aid gel is no different. After several uses I can say it&#x27;s clearly not the best and certainly not the worst. As others have mentioned, the hold is fine but breaks apart under the slightest sweat or physical stress. It&#x27;s a good value and a solid alternative to more expensive products. One tube can typically last two months for me, sometimes more. Obviously, however, this varies depending on how much/often one uses the product. Overall, this is an easy three star product.</li>
            <li> Axe Spiking Glue is a great product. My hair is usually pretty short so I have to get something with super strong hold to keep it styled the way I like. It seems that whenever I find something I like the manufacturer stops making it and I have to try several more products. My cabinet contains about 6 or 7 partially used containers of product that I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked great for me. A very small amount went a long way and performed the way I wanted it to. The real challenge for me is finding something that will hold up well in the Arizona heat and low humidity. This performed well under those circumstances. Also, when it dried there was very little flaking of the product so it doesn&#x27;t look like I have dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I hope that I don&#x27;t jinx it and that they make it for a while.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my son&#x27;s hair and we both liked it a lot.  The hold is almost as good as got2b spiking glue hold (the only other spiking glue we use in our family)and it has a great AXE scent (although the container doesn&#x27;t specify which AXE scent it is).  The container is neat with an asymmetrical top, although my only complaint is that the lid does not snap shut very well (that may just be a one-time issue).  \\&quot;Hold Plus Touch\\&quot;  is supposed to refer to the fact that the product holds hairstyle in place but it&#x27;s still touchable and not stiff.  I&#x27;d have to say that is generally true.  It&#x27;s definitely not as stiff a hold as the got2b spiking glue but I think that&#x27;s the idea.  This is a good product with a good scent and I would recommend it.  My son and I both give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am honestly not too sure what I can say about a \\&quot;spiking glue\\&quot; which is basically a hair gel.  However, what I&#x27;ve seen so far has been good:    - Long lasting  - Doesn&#x27;t make your hair/hands feel greasy (I don&#x27;t get the desire to wash my hand 20 times after using it)  - A little goes a long way    Solid product all around, the only negative might be the price per ounce.</li>
            <li> My son really likes this to hold his curls or spike his hair. I think its a bit stiff- smells too strong and would not use it for longer hair a little goes a long way with this... its great for guys maintaining a short hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not one for hair gel, but I bought some once on the recommendation of my barber. \\&quot;People with your kind of hair (thick and wavy), need something to help it &#x27;lay&#x27;,\\&quot; he said. Yeah, right, and he likely got a commission from selling me a tube of sticky goo that made my hair feel like it had been washed in pancake syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, I got a free canister of Axe Whatever styling gel and liked the results. The same is true of Axe Styling Aid Hold Plus Touch Spiking Glue. Like the other Axe product I tried, this can leave your hair feeling a little stiff, but thankfully it isn&#x27;t sticky. It holds the hair in place, just as promised, and if that&#x27;s the result you seek, you probably have to accept that there&#x27;s going to be a slightly unnatural feel to your hair when you run your fingers through it. It&#x27;s a good product, but I suggest you use only a little dab, you know, as suggested in those old Brylcream commercials: \\&quot;A little dab will do ya.\\&quot; Too much and your hair may look like it&#x27;s been embalmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks</li>
            <li> I have gave up moose a long time ago. I need something that can style my hair as well as add some hold. This smells great. Its a little greasy on your hands when applying, but wash off quickly so it does feel like glue.This held my hair on the most humid days in Florida.I like a few spikes in my hair so it works perfect for that as well.overall I will be using this product for now on.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this....it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  If you run out of this stuff, you can substitute this with Super-Glue.</li>
            <li> They do not make this anymore and like it.</li>
            <li> i got this for my son. Who has rather wavy hair than straight. Not the best out there....I guess it would work better with straight hair which is more manageable. Once it dries your pretty much stuck with the style like any other styling gel. So use with caution.</li>
            <li> As if we don&#x27;t have enough Axe products on the market they now have hair gel? My two teenage boys loved it, it works as intended.  However, the smell is over the top.  I gagged and they weren&#x27;t even in the room, the odor lingers that long.  So mom&#x27;s beware! LOL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a young man who would normally go out and get axe products. However, I used to be the sales manager for a beauty supply company (a long time ago!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently,  I was given a tube of this Styling Aid, and wow! To quote the old Brylcream commercial, \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya\\&quot;. Just the tiniest of dabs worked into wet hair and styled immediately afterwards will stay in place all day long. The stongest Styling Aid I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very cool stuff!</li>
            <li> I seldom use spiking glue, usually I go with gel or a pomade.  But I decided to give this stuff a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other spiking glue I&#x27;ve tried before was the Got2b Glued stuff, and this seems better to me.  Its much more thin a product, which makes it easier to apply.  Also because its thinner, I assume, it seems like you have more time to work with it, which the Got2b Glued stuff always seemed to harden too fast.  Not heavily scented either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad choice, for those who want spiking glue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Got2B Glued hair spiking glue. It&#x27;s fine, but it comes in a much larger package, and I travel frequently...so I have to travel without hair stuff! Lame.     Enter Axe Styling Aid. It works exactly the same - great, all day hold, keeping my hair looking exactly how I set it in the morning. Even better, it smells pretty great, which makes my wife a happy camper. This is a very good product that comes in a reasonable size for me to travel with. 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hair spray, mousse, gel, wax, and such in my hair through the years, and Axe Spiking Glue ranks up there with my favorite of these products. It holds as firmly as a hair spray (though you can&#x27;t really brush it out of your hair - hair stays pretty crispy until your next shower) while being easy to apply with your hands like hair gel.    It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell and just a bit - a couple of drops - is needed to style my hair.</li>
            <li> Axe makes a good spiking glue.  It&#x27;s easy to work into your hair, and it stiffens pretty quickly after your hands leave your hair.  However, it&#x27;s also water soluble, so any sweat or wet hands will immediately wreck your spikes.  Also, the spikes&#x27; hold is not stiff enough to remain spikes after you put on a hat, accidentally run a hand through your hair, or bump your head into something.    I prefer my other two spiking glues: American Crew pomade and Got2Be glued.  These products are not water soluble, so sweat doesn&#x27;t affect the spikes.  And the holds, especially for Got2Be glued, are 12-14 hour holds.  The neat thing is, even if your spikes start to wilt, just run some damp hands through your hair, and bam! the spikes are back.  You can&#x27;t do that with Axe spiking glue without using more product.    Overall, Axe has a good product, but there are better ones out there (and cheaper too).  This is a pass for me.</li>
            <li> I am too old to use this for spiking, but I use it to style my hair to give it a youthful and fresh look, like you just came out of the gym.  It works well for that purpose.  After a week of using it, it disappeared.  My son took it, so it must be really good because he has good taste of things like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned not to use anything that has \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hair\\&quot; on the front. Whether it&#x27;s shampoo,or styling products,they are awful. This product promises \\&quot;Hold and Touch\\&quot;. Unfortunately it leaves hair crunchy like a gel,and wet looking.  If you actually care about your hair&#x27;s health,do not use Axe.</li>
            <li> At the risk of showing my age, I can recall when Axe only produced body sprays.  I also remember being one of the first guys I knew who gobbled these products up.  The smells were great and weren&#x27;t as powerful as cologne, but had more kick than the fragrance of aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose Axe became smart in their marketing department and branched out to shampoo, body wash, and deodorant and hair products.  I have noticed that the price of their products have gone up and the size of their packaging has become smaller.  A technique many companies are taking in modern times....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have used one of Axe&#x27;s hair products and I am both satisfied and disenchanted.  I have thick, wavy and bit on the long side hair that I comb back. Many could say I have a \\&quot;slick\\&quot; look. I usually use hair gel or pomade to comb my hair back.  I do my best to attain hair products that don&#x27;t turn my hair into straw.  This product is promoted as \\&quot;spike glue\\&quot; but the back of the tube states \\&quot;style hair as desired\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I applied this product to a damp head, my hair looked very nice and didn&#x27;t harden.  However, I really had to work this product into my hair because it really looked like \\&quot;glue\\&quot;.  Once I applied the product held my hair very well in a comb backed style. In addition, it didn&#x27;t take much to use to achieve the style I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue I have with this product is the size of the tube and the price. This product is WAY too expensive for the size of the tube and what the product does.  I can purchase a couple of containers of hair gel or pomade for the price that this \\&quot;hair glue\\&quot; costs.  So unless you feel the need to waste money or truly believe that women are going to accost you because you use Axe products, which is one of Axe&#x27;s promotion campaigns, I would just save your dollars and buy a less expensive product.</li>
            <li> There is no question that this \\&quot;cement\\&quot; works well, leaving no awful gunk behind. What makes me wonder is: where is the Axe touch?&lt;br /&gt;Axe is primarily a scent, and a rather nice one if used sparingly. This paste does not have any inviting aroma. I know, it does not have to, but then, what would make me pruchase Axe if I want a hair gel?&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it could have been Axe, Wax or Tax, it does the job as good as any.</li>
            <li> My son has quite a few glues on the counter. When I added the Axe Styling Aid, I found this was the one with the cap off most often. Now trying to get him to talk about it is not easy since he is a guy of few words. Likes the coconut smell. Likes most Axe products. Works well. I actually like his hair spiked instead of the long in your eyes look. Will keep on purchasing and throw out the other glue products that never have their caps removed.</li>
            <li> A great smelling decent product.&lt;br /&gt;It does not hold up longer hair very well and adds a \\&quot;crunch factor\\&quot; when using a larger amount of the product for longer hair dos.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He uses other Axe products and I love the smell.  He likes the hold - win win!  A good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a month and I&#x27;ve not used half of it..  I have short hair and I use the &#x27;glue&#x27; right after towel drying my hair (slightly damp).  Usually a pea size amount will provide a decent hold to keep my hair where I wantit, yet there&#x27;s no shine or wet look.  I&#x27;ve use pomades and gels and this looks more like a lotion or actual glue..  The hold is great, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is a middle-of-the-road styling product, which isn&#x27;t surprising considering the price and the fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s Axe. It was decent on my short hair, but when my wife tried it on her longer hair, it was very stiff and flaky. I&#x27;ve found it can be hard to get a good balance between \\&quot;holds hair\\&quot; and \\&quot;not stiff\\&quot; (i.e. if you use too much of it, your hair won&#x27;t move at all, but use too little and the product doesn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li> Though I am a bit old to be the typical Axe customer - I was pleasantly suprised with this product.  Nice texture and really nice aroma - and holds up well without making your hair hard.  If you are used to using paste but want something a bit easier to apply - this is a really good alternative as it is a very thick cream.</li>
            <li> I liked this product for the way it holds and how it ultimately doesn&#x27;t have too much fragrance when it dries and sets.  I usually need strong holding gel but dislike the stiff feeling, this gel will hold firmly but still allows some movement.  I would definitely recommend and buy this product again.    At first, the product seemed a little strange, it is more of a cream like consistency instead of the typical gel.  I used a little too much the first time just because i expected to need that much from past gels, but this one i only needed an amount slightly smaller than a pea vs something the size of a grape.  I have used it during work and it has held up very well.  I am in the field all day and between the sun, working and being at work for at least 10 hours the gel doesn&#x27;t seem to loose its hold.  This is definitely a very good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and the price is awesome. Shipping included. I&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 21 year old son who really likes most of the Axe products.  The scent of this is, of course, great for him and he really likes that.  however, as a styling aid for his hair his complaint is that this is just too strong.  he&#x27;s past the stick-straight-spike look and now prefers a softer hold. He generally wears his hair in a short faux-hawk (like a mohawk, but the sides are not completely shaved - just very short while the top remains longer/higher).  So he does like to have some hold in the hair, just not this much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, if it were perfect for him, I&#x27;d give it a 5 star. But for him it rates as a 3-star - it&#x27;s okay, but not something he&#x27;d use at this point.  Again, it is called \\&quot;Spiking Glue\\&quot; - so if you need your hair glued up stick straight, then by all means this is a 5-star all the way.  I decided to give it a 4 star - something in the middle since the product works as intended, but just works too well for my son to use.</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to be for men...  but as a woman, it&#x27;s my favorite hair product. I received a sample with something I bought and decided to try it...so glad I did....  it makes styling my hair so easy,&lt;br /&gt;but doesn&#x27;t leave it all stiff and gummy...  I would recommend this product for anybody.&lt;br /&gt;The price at Amazon was great and I received it in a couple of days.....with free shipping!</li>
            <li> Holds well, but definately not for longer hair. You have to be careful not to use too much as it can give a \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; result. Worked well on my husbands shorter hair, but on my longer hair I just ended up with uneven texture- none of it particularly good!</li>
            <li> I would not personally use this stuff, but it does offer a very strong hold with only a 75% wet look...not the LA Looks junk, but not a high end styling product. It&#x27;s decent stuff, but a little too \\&quot;hard\\&quot; for me. I prefer something like wax where you get movement and flexibility but still keep firm hold (as opposed to death grip stiff firm hold).</li>
            <li> Both my husband &amp; my boys use this. It smells amazing and washes out easy!</li>
            <li> The reason I choose 5 stars because this axe gel product is wonderful fast shipping to axe has the best products I would be looking forward to buy more axe products</li>
            <li> My nephew is a huge fan of the spiked hair look and he&#x27;s just now getting to the age where he styles his own hair so when I saw this product, I immediately ordered it for him. He loved it! It was easy to dispense and provided just the right amount of hold for a busy school day! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Worked the way I needed. I have used others, but the spiking glue is the best Axe has to offer.</li>
