            <li>I think one of the best things about this product is the company who owns it.  </li>

            <li>I give Aveya Products two thumbs up for a good product.</li>
            <li>It enhanced what already looked good</li>
            <li>My nanny loved it.</li>
            <li>But it gives a good curl and seems like it&#x27;s made well.</li>
            <li>I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review...</li>
            <li>These are really nice, They work good.</li>
            <li>On more than one occasion, I have caught my eyelid in it and when I squeezed...OUCH!</li>
            <li>My friend who gave me her honest thoughts said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s like</li>
            <li>We both liked the softness of the pad</li>
            <li>Nice product, I didn&#x27;t think my eyelashes could be curled until I used this product.  </li>
            <li>The curler itself has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>I was contacted by the manufacturer and asked to try this product and write an honest review.</li>
            <li>They seem to curl on their own now and they feel softer.</li>
            <li>I was offered this &amp;#34;Best Eyelash Curler&amp;#34; for free in return for my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>Not flimsy like most curlers I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
            <li>I received this item free for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many times they don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I do love it.  </li>
            <li>I received this item free of charge in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>According to the pamphlet the “Best Eyelash Curler” is supposed to last close to a year, around 9 months.</li>
            <li>and she thoroughly enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am really glad I was asked to review this product</li>
            <li>This is a great product, the combination of the smooth action and the comfortable cushion pads that come with the curler, you have one great product.</li>
            <li>This shows me that they are putting care into what they produce overlooking the &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; attitude of so many producers.  </li>
            <li>but it is a truthful description as to how it arrived to my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said that it was very easy to use and that the extra pads were great.  </li>
            <li>I first received this product I couldn’t wait to use it because the packaging was just too cute!</li>
            <li>It would have been great to have a better box to hold the curler and the extra pads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gifted this to the special lady in my life</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easily fits into a makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>It came with 3 refill pads which is nice but the bottom line is that neither one of us wants this lash curler and we aren&#x27;t going to give up the ones we already have.</li>
            <li>I was offered this item for free to review it.</li>
            <li>I received a coupon code for this item from the manufacturer, which made it free, for review purposes)</li>
            <li>like how light this curler is.</li>
            <li>I was excited by this alone as there were instructions on how to use the eyelash curler, when the pads should be replaced, and how to properly clean the eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>The curler pads are nice and soft (no eyelashes getting stuck!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has the full eyelashes but had never used a curler.  </li>
            <li>to the actual product…I loved it.</li>
            <li>That said, you definitely get what you pay for quality wise with this product.</li>
            <li>This package is a very flimsy, although the design is cute.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely a keeper and it&#x27;s nice to be able to leave a good review for a well designed and executed product that works like it&#x27;s advertised to and looks to be something I will have and use for a long time.</li>
            <li>The pads clean up nicely after each use, actually better than my other eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Even better, they worked.&lt;br /&gt;- comes with replacement pads.&lt;br /&gt;- is very sturdy in spite of being very light.&lt;br /&gt;- is easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I received the package pretty quickly and it was protected well.</li>
            <li>I asked her if all of her curlers broke right now, which one would she buy to replace it; she responded &amp;#34;I would probably buy the cheapest one I could find, but I do like how this one doesn&#x27;t pull my lashes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>everything else I have to say is all positive!</li>
            <li>After using this item for several weeks I have found it to be easy to maintain cleanliness, comfortable to use in my hand and  sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Neither of us would spend that much since they are available for almost$15.00 less.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe regular users of eyelash curlers will be able to tell a difference that we couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>So soft and easy for curling.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I love that it came with extra pads.  </li>
            <li>The finger holes are a bit bigger making it feel better when in use.</li>
            <li>Upon first opening it, the product comes with a pamphlet on care and usage of the product.</li>
            <li>it would not have wrapped nicely, and had sharp edges from the plastic box it arrives in.  </li>
            <li>Also it is a bit wide to fit comfortably.  </li>
            <li>in all, good product, extra pads, big finger holes, curls lashes.  </li>
            <li>But if it is easy to find and purchase the pads and the device holds up it could be the last eyelash curler you ever need to buy.</li>
            <li>and she liked the result but didn&#x27;t think she would use it on a daily basis as her schedule is full right down to the minute.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know and neither does my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the opportunity to test it</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This may not seem like much to some people, but when I am putting something that close to my eye</li>
            <li>You can buy eyelash curlers that are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- is very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I was really ecstatic when I was contacted to review this product.</li>
            <li>Does it work better than any other curler?</li>
            <li>Again, due to the shortage of long and beautiful lashes, I could barely tell the difference</li>
            <li>It replaced her old curler after the first use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a decent product</li>
            <li>Decent curler, but what sets it apart is the well- cushioned pad.</li>
            <li>and I do def recommend it although I do find the price to be a bit high</li>
            <li>since I got a new eyelash curler, and I was delighted to see a thick, soft cushion on the curling lip.  </li>
            <li>I have no use for make up however I do have a wife and she enjoyed this little device.  </li>
            <li>She said it was easy to use and the pads didnt pull her eye lashes like other curler pads</li>
            <li>Upon holding them in her hands she said they felt of normal quality and weren&#x27;t flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth the extra money for this one?</li>
            <li>I was glad for the note though because it&#x27;s obvious they have come a long way in design, safety and performance.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a brand new concept in the eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Will I purchase this curler when it’s time for a new one?</li>
            <li>First thing she noticed was that this came with extra pads in the box which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>The higher priced one also looked the same except a piece of gold trim on it somewhere</li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;re like me and have long straight lashes that no one notices because they stick out straight from your eye rather than curling like in the mascara commercials!</li>
            <li>This one makes soft curls on eyelashes without the tell-tale crimp caused by old-fashioned curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this and then gave it to my 19 year old daughter who is a model to try.</li>
            <li>Perhaps because the pad is so rubbery and soft.</li>
            <li>You also receive two replacement pads for your curler.&lt;br /&gt;The real point of possible contention for this product is the price.</li>
            <li>I have had some heavy ones, bulky, and plastic, This one os definitely light</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike the old eyelash curlers, this one is pain free, no tugging on the eyelashes or eyelids or even pulling out a few eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to find the right pads for the right eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I felt like it closed too much, in that the fingers came together completely without completely curling the lashes.</li>
            <li>using, the first thing she noticed was how soft the pads were, which allowed it to not pull her lashes like some of her other ones do.  </li>
            <li>comes with directions as well as suggestions for people like me who have very long, but unfortunately straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Overall, a big improvement over the older curlers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality, simple packaging, and extra</li>
            <li>The last curler I had was very flimsy and the handle actually bent the last time I used it, which is why I didn&#x27;t replace it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not really something I&#x27;ve ever given much thought to.</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the look after using these compared to the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So neither of us could compare it to another one we had used in the past, but it looked very pretty on her lashes.  </li>
            <li>I just have one small warning...be careful because it&#x27;s powerful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was offered this &amp;#34;Best Eyelash Curler&amp;#34; for free in return for my honest opinion.  Well since I&#x27;m a guy I offered this to my girlfriend to try.  First thing she noticed was that this came with extra pads in the box which is a plus.  Upon holding them in her hands she said they felt of normal quality and weren&#x27;t flimsy.  The finger holes were a little bit bigger than her other ones which allowed it to move around a bit as she was using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon using, the first thing she noticed was how soft the pads were, which allowed it to not pull her lashes like some of her other ones do.  After waiting 30 seconds or so on each side, her lashes were curled.  She couldn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the look after using these compared to the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, good product, extra pads, big finger holes, curls lashes.  Does it work better than any other curler? Is it worth the extra money for this one? I don&#x27;t really know and neither does my girlfriend.  I asked her if all of her curlers broke right now, which one would she buy to replace it; she responded &amp;#34;I would probably buy the cheapest one I could find, but I do like how this one doesn&#x27;t pull my lashes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used an eyelash curler in years, now I can&#x27;t imagine why! This curler was easy to use, sturdy and curled my lashes perfectly. It comes packaged as seen, and with three cushions for crimping. The last curler I had was very flimsy and the handle actually bent the last time I used it, which is why I didn&#x27;t replace it. This one is sturdy enough that I think it will last for years! Great item for the price. Especially if you&#x27;re like me and have long straight lashes that no one notices because they stick out straight from your eye rather than curling like in the mascara commercials! ;)</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  It&#x27;s functional and comes with extra sponges, which is a bonus.  The curler definitely feels as if made from quality material.  Not flimsy like most curlers I&#x27;ve encountered.  I will definitely keep this tool close by.  I give Aveya Products two thumbs up for a good product.</li>
            <li> My friend who gave me her honest thoughts said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s like any other&amp;#34;...based on her comments, I can only say that it&#x27;s average.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long while since I got a new eyelash curler, and I was delighted to see a thick, soft cushion on the curling lip.  No longer need eyelashes be crimped by the curler.  This one makes soft curls on eyelashes without the tell-tale crimp caused by old-fashioned curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the old eyelash curlers, this one is pain free, no tugging on the eyelashes or eyelids or even pulling out a few eyelashes.  It&#x27;s light weight and easily fits into a makeup bag.  Overall, a big improvement over the older curlers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> I had a hard time deciding how to rate this as I am a senior citizen and had never used one before plus the fact that my eyelashes are old just like me!  So we tend to thin in the hair and eyelash department.&lt;br /&gt;But I gave it a try and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble using it.  Again, due to the shortage of long and beautiful lashes, I could barely tell the difference so I gave them to my daughter-in-law to try.&lt;br /&gt;She has the full eyelashes but had never used a curler.  So neither of us could compare it to another one we had used in the past, but it looked very pretty on her lashes.  It enhanced what already looked good and she liked the result but didn&#x27;t think she would use it on a daily basis as her schedule is full right down to the minute.  She said maybe on Sunday....&lt;br /&gt;So I went to the store to see other curlers.  The lower priced one was only $2.99 and it looked just like this one except the rubber pad was white.  The higher priced one also looked the same except a piece of gold trim on it somewhere and it was only $3.78!&lt;br /&gt;Of course the price is what we both based our rating on.  Neither of us would spend that much since they are available for almost$15.00 less.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe regular users of eyelash curlers will be able to tell a difference that we couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, it was packaged well. I tried this and then gave it to my 19 year old daughter who is a model to try. This review is a compilation of both of our experiences, The finger holes were large, which can be alright, but it slipped around on our fingers and felt somewhat difficult to control. She felt that it opened too wide and became clumsy in that aspect. We both liked the softness of the pad but she felt it was a little &amp;#34;grabby&amp;#34;. I felt like it closed too much, in that the fingers came together completely without completely curling the lashes. Perhaps because the pad is so rubbery and soft. It came with 3 refill pads which is nice but the bottom line is that neither one of us wants this lash curler and we aren&#x27;t going to give up the ones we already have. I suppose I will keep this as a spare in case mine breaks and I need one before I can get another Shisiedo lash curler.</li>
            <li> These are really nice, They work good. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> My nanny loved it. it was a gift for her because she needed one.</li>
            <li> I like this curler. I just have one small warning...be careful because it&#x27;s powerful! On more than one occasion, I have caught my eyelid in it and when I squeezed...OUCH! But it gives a good curl and seems like it&#x27;s made well.</li>
            <li> I received this item free for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now.  I love that it came with extra pads.  So many times they don&#x27;t and it&#x27;s hard to find the right pads for the right eyelash curler. The pads clean up nicely after each use, actually better than my other eyelash curler. The finger holes are a bit bigger making it feel better when in use. It does what it is suppose to do, it curls your eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the cost, I personally think it is on the expensive side. But if it is easy to find and purchase the pads and the device holds up it could be the last eyelash curler you ever need to buy.</li>
            <li> Nice product, I didn&#x27;t think my eyelashes could be curled until I used this product.  Works very nicely!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a brand new concept in the eyelash curler. It is very similar to another one I have had for years. Also it is a bit wide to fit comfortably.  I really appreciate the opportunity to test it and I would recommend it to anyone who does not already have an eyelash curler..Also a replacement liner is a plus.</li>
            <li> I do love it.  So soft and easy for curling.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I received this item free of charge in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;When I first received this product I couldn’t wait to use it because the packaging was just too cute! Upon first opening it, the product comes with a pamphlet on care and usage of the product. I was excited by this alone as there were instructions on how to use the eyelash curler, when the pads should be replaced, and how to properly clean the eyelash curler. This may not seem like much to some people, but when I am putting something that close to my eye I definitely want it to be clean.&lt;br /&gt;On to the actual product…I loved it. The curler itself has a nice weight to it. It isn’t too heavy, but is weighted enough that it feels well-made and you aren’t afraid you will break it. The curler pads are nice and soft (no eyelashes getting stuck!). You also receive two replacement pads for your curler.&lt;br /&gt;The real point of possible contention for this product is the price. You can buy eyelash curlers that are much cheaper. According to the pamphlet the “Best Eyelash Curler” is supposed to last close to a year, around 9 months. That said, you definitely get what you pay for quality wise with this product. Will I purchase this curler when it’s time for a new one? Probably. Do I recommend it if you are looking for a quality, well made eyelash curler? YES.</li>
            <li> I was offered this item for free to review it. I received the package pretty quickly and it was protected well. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the packaging overall. It would have been great to have a better box to hold the curler and the extra pads. This package is a very flimsy, although the design is cute. The curler itself seems to work well, and the pads are very good. My only complaint is that the mechanism that clamps was built crooked on mine, so it didn&#x27;t capture all the lashes at once. What was captured were curled nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent product</li>
            <li> I have no use for make up however I do have a wife and she enjoyed this little device.  She said it was easy to use and the pads didnt pull her eye lashes like other curler pads do... Whatever that means, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good little product, I can attest to the build quality being sturdy enough to last me a while.</li>
            <li> I was contacted by the manufacturer and asked to try this product and write an honest review. So here goes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product-&lt;br /&gt;- is very attractively packaged.&lt;br /&gt;- is very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;- comes with directions as well as suggestions for people like me who have very long, but unfortunately straight eyelashes. Even better, they worked.&lt;br /&gt;- comes with replacement pads.&lt;br /&gt;- is very sturdy in spite of being very light.&lt;br /&gt;- is easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;- curled my lashes well without damaging them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the same eyelash curler for years and it&#x27;s not really something I&#x27;ve ever given much thought to. I was glad for the note though because it&#x27;s obvious they have come a long way in design, safety and performance. This product is definitely a keeper and it&#x27;s nice to be able to leave a good review for a well designed and executed product that works like it&#x27;s advertised to and looks to be something I will have and use for a long time.</li>
            <li> High quality, simple packaging, and extra pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gifted this to the special lady in my life and she thoroughly enjoyed it.  It replaced her old curler after the first use.  She said that it was very easy to use and that the extra pads were great.  Also, the packaging didn&#x27;t require a blowtorch or chainsaw to get into.  Great product for the ladies that curl their eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(reviewers note: I received a coupon code for this item from the manufacturer, which made it free, for review purposes)</li>
            <li> I was really ecstatic when I was contacted to review this product. I was just about to go out and buy me an eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con with this eyelash curler is the price. I wouldnt have purchased this for myself because odlf the price alone.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise everything else I have to say is all positive! I have been using this eyelash curler over a month now and I see a difference in my eyelashes. They seem to curl on their own now and they feel softer. I know that sounds weird, like hpw can an eyelash curler do that, but thats what it has to be. I used the same mascara I have been using for a year so I def know its not the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I like how light this curler is. I have had some heavy ones, bulky, and plastic, This one os definitely light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really glad I was asked to review this product and I do def recommend it although I do find the price to be a bit high</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the combination of the smooth action and the comfortable cushion pads that come with the curler, you have one great product. After using this item for several weeks I have found it to be easy to maintain cleanliness, comfortable to use in my hand and  sturdy.  Another great product by Aveya.  I think one of the best things about this product is the company who owns it.  They seem to go out of their way to follow up on their products and ask you what you think.  This shows me that they are putting care into what they produce overlooking the &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; attitude of so many producers.  This company knows I will return to them for future purchases because my money is well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give the product a 5 star review is because the packaging was damaged, had this been a gift for someone  it would not have wrapped nicely, and had sharp edges from the plastic box it arrives in.  This in not necessarily the companies fault but it is a truthful description as to how it arrived to my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Decent curler, but what sets it apart is the well- cushioned pad. No more pinched eyelids!</li>
