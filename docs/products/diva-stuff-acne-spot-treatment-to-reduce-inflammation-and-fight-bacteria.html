            <li>Amazing amazing.</li>

            <li>They are quite drying, but effective.</li>
            <li>i have to say honestly the pimple shrunk in just seconds.</li>

            <li>The blemish bomb is awesome for wearing under makeup, it goes on clear and you can reapply as needed.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the thing: most of the time these will not work overnight.</li>
            <li>my skin was the better for it.</li>
            <li>but I love the set of 3 from amazon.</li>
            <li>I have since bought 2 more sets and given them as gifts.  </li>
            <li>Both my teenagers love them.</li>
            <li>i LOVE these.</li>
            <li>although i haven&#x27;t picked a favorite cause</li>
            <li>love the ingredients also</li>
            <li>First off this stuff smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I started using these daily and have had awesome results in just one week.</li>
            <li>I have tried the acne spot treatment, which is the grey colored one, and it works great!</li>
            <li>Clears up acne very quickly without over drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased full product sizes on each of these and love it.</li>
            <li>they all work in there on wonderful little ways.</li>
            <li>Being honest the smell is not pleasant but very effective in what it does!  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of all Diva stuff products.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well for me, but the products seem nice</li>
            <li>Minimizes pimples significantly.</li>
            <li>and then very quickly which is exactly what something that purifies your skin is supposed to do I am now completely free</li>
            <li>nothing special but okay for the price to try all 3--had an error with my order and the company fixed it very quickly--like the mask but have not seen a great improvement; bought mainly for cystic acne</li>
            <li>I think you can buy the full sized creams on her website (diva stuff.com)</li>
            <li>but it is mild.  </li>
            <li>After reading the very first review I didn&#x27;t get these products I&#x27;m kicking myself</li>
            <li>Good at drying a single spot of acne</li>
            <li>Good as a spot treatment if you don&#x27;t mind having dark cored spots all over your face.</li>
            <li>I was so excited at first, saw quick results, then all of a sudden had a huge breakout</li>
            <li>i love how the mask can be overnight and only on problem areas</li>
            <li>Second, seems to work way better than over the counter acne products.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I keep a small bottle of alcohol in a spritzer bottle and lightly mist the top of the exposed cream before I put the lid on to kill any bacteria that I may have gotten into it.  </li>
            <li>Oh, &amp; sends free samples of her other products with every order...which has caused me to go purchase them full size.</li>
            <li>Each of these little creams can be used on its own or combined to pack a wallop on acne.</li>
            <li>my sister and mother all tried it for ONE pimple and ended up with a breakout on the whole area as well.</li>
            <li>Both products work very well and do what they claim to</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all thanks to diva stuff</li>
            <li>The same night i applied some to my whole face, i couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face, it was so soft.  </li>
            <li>I definitely saw really quick results with these products.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>by morning the blemish is almost completely gone!!</li>
            <li>I love the clay treatments and I will leave them on a trouble spot while I sleep.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I would use on large patches of acne, it seems like it&#x27;s better for spot treatment or very small areas.</li>
            <li>After literally trying everything including prescription medication, I decided to try these natural products from Diva stuff!</li>
            <li>I did re apply whenever I could and its a plus that it dries clear.</li>
            <li>I never thought my face would ever ever clear up.</li>
            <li>Having suffered from acne all my adult life, I know that not all treatments will work for everyone so maybe this will work for someone else.</li>
            <li>Plus they don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin like proactiv does.</li>
            <li>I think I prefer the white because it dries clear</li>
            <li>The clay spot treatment  (appears grey) is my favorite, &amp; I use it on cystic acne when I have one, &amp; usually within 48-72 hrs, it&#x27;s almost completely went down.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and the next morning the pimples were flat, and it did not hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> so you never over dry unaffected skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely gonna try other items from the line.</li>
            <li> they dry out pimples.  </li>
            <li> After using 2 weeks this is not really working and I have minor breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> The acne no matter what type saw absolutely no improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 of the 3 kinds seen here- the green clay one and the white creamy one.  </li>
            <li> The green one has a thicker consistency than the white.  </li>
            <li> After a very short time two of them dried up.</li>
            <li> and this did not dry my skin any further unlike some other treatments I had used in the past!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so these little tubs will last you awhile if you&#x27;re a few-zits-a-month girl like me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The other two are clay based</li>
            <li> The white is for normal zits, the gray for bad stubborn acne, and the darkest one is for those that are deep and cystic.  </li>
            <li> May be they do not work for a dark skin complexion like me.</li>
            <li> If I have a small blemish pop up I put a little cream on it before bed, wait for it to dry then take it off and</li>
            <li> I just dab it on with a little q-tip</li>
            <li> and you can use them on those awful deep zits, dab the stuff on, let it dry and suck out the badness and then wipe it clean.</li>
            <li> ( Not cool!)  </li>
            <li> I have very few breakouts now</li>
            <li> cause at least with these</li>
            <li> Everything I used either made it worse or didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Instead of the product to get rid of acne that was disturbing me, they keep increasing almost to areas that there were none.</li>
            <li> I had a crazy bout of hormonal acne that was stubborn, took forever to heal and left terrible marks.</li>
            <li> i would recommend to anyone who suffers with any type of acne.</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> I am sort of disappointed.</li>
            <li> It becomes depressing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed :&#x27;(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No matter which treatment I tried this never worked for me. The acne no matter what type saw absolutely no improvement. It didn&#x27;t reduce the size or shorten the duration. Having suffered from acne all my adult life, I know that not all treatments will work for everyone so maybe this will work for someone else.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenager daughter and is an amazing product for acne. Diva Stuff products is the best,  not irritate, smell&lt;br /&gt;great and is helping a lot, excellent customer service, too. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with all the acne line. I love the clay treatments and I will leave them on a trouble spot while I sleep. I use the bomb on my face under my makeup. I have very few breakouts now and my face feels and looks so beautiful.</li>
            <li> nothing special but okay for the price to try all 3--had an error with my order and the company fixed it very quickly--like the mask but have not seen a great improvement; bought mainly for cystic acne</li>
            <li> This stuff is ridiculous! Whatever is in it is a bunch of who ha! And doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> This was my 1st product ordered from Kym, &amp; since, I have ordered a TON more products from her! The blemish bomb is like regular acne medication, and can be used as such. The clay spot treatment  (appears grey) is my favorite, &amp; I use it on cystic acne when I have one, &amp; usually within 48-72 hrs, it&#x27;s almost completely went down. I dab it on the cystic acne before bed, &amp; keep it on overnite...great stuff. Oh, &amp; sends free samples of her other products with every order...which has caused me to go purchase them full size.</li>
            <li> I was so excited at first, saw quick results, then all of a sudden had a huge breakout :(( my sister and mother all tried it for ONE pimple and ended up with a breakout on the whole area as well. I&#x27;m so disappointed :&#x27;( It&#x27;s taking me forever to undo the damage..</li>
            <li> I have tried the acne spot treatment, which is the grey colored one, and it works great! If I have a small blemish pop up I put a little cream on it before bed, wait for it to dry then take it off and by morning the blemish is almost completely gone!! I would definitely recommend this to any \\&quot;diva\\&quot; with \\&quot;surprise\\&quot; blemish issues!! (:</li>
            <li> Good as a spot treatment if you don&#x27;t mind having dark cored spots all over your face. I would just sleep over night wearing these treatments and wash off in the morning. Good at drying a single spot of acne</li>
            <li> I had a crazy bout of hormonal acne that was stubborn, took forever to heal and left terrible marks.( Not cool!)  After literally trying everything including prescription medication, I decided to try these natural products from Diva stuff! I used the white cream( blemish bomb) on my inflamed whiteheads overnight and the next morning the pimples were flat, and it did not hurt anymore. I have very dry skin and this did not dry my skin any further unlike some other treatments I had used in the past! I did re apply whenever I could and its a plus that it dries clear. I definitely recommend this product for anyone with similar issues!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 of the 3 kinds seen here- the green clay one and the white creamy one.  Both products work very well and do what they claim to do- they dry out pimples.  The green one has a thicker consistency than the white.  I think I prefer the white because it dries clear and so it can be worn under makeup.  I just dab it on with a little q-tip and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> I definitely saw really quick results with these products. Being honest the smell is not pleasant but very effective in what it does!  I am a huge fan of all Diva stuff products.</li>
            <li> This product line is amazing!  The Blemish bomb works great. Minimizes pimples significantly. A little goes a long way. Definitely buy.</li>
            <li> I would buy again. Each of these little creams can be used on its own or combined to pack a wallop on acne. Here&#x27;s the thing: most of the time these will not work overnight. Here&#x27;s the thing: you won&#x27;t experience dryness or flaking either. I like that you can use them a couple of times a day without threat of overdrying skin. I found two days did the trick and my skin was the better for it. I don&#x27;t know that I would use on large patches of acne, it seems like it&#x27;s better for spot treatment or very small areas.</li>
            <li> This set of 3 acne creams is an awesome deal, I don&#x27;t have a ton of blemishes but when I do get one....yeesh. So this set is perfect because there&#x27;s a cream for whatever type of skin monster you&#x27;re dealing with. The blemish bomb is awesome for wearing under makeup, it goes on clear and you can reapply as needed. The other two are clay based and you can use them on those awful deep zits, dab the stuff on, let it dry and suck out the badness and then wipe it clean. It&#x27;s like a mini mask. A little goes a long way so these little tubs will last you awhile if you&#x27;re a few-zits-a-month girl like me. I think you can buy the full sized creams on her website (diva stuff.com) but I love the set of 3 from amazon. Plus they don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin like proactiv does. So happy I found this line!</li>
            <li> These products are good.  They are quite drying, but effective.</li>
            <li> I love all these!  The white is for normal zits, the gray for bad stubborn acne, and the darkest one is for those that are deep and cystic.  I use my finger to dip into them.  I keep a small bottle of alcohol in a spritzer bottle and lightly mist the top of the exposed cream before I put the lid on to kill any bacteria that I may have gotten into it.  This has worked great for me and I do this to my diva masks  as well.  These products smell wonderful and are truly effective.  I have since bought 2 more sets and given them as gifts.  Everyone has loved them!</li>
            <li> Instead of the product to get rid of acne that was disturbing me, they keep increasing almost to areas that there were none. May be they do not work for a dark skin complexion like me. I was experiencing some burning sensations which deceived me that the products are working great but no. I am sort of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product it has helped clear up my face! I am so happy I found this stuff I recommend it for anyone having issues with acne</li>
            <li> Awesome results! Both my teenagers love them. They can pick and choose which one will work for a specific outbreak.</li>
            <li> I have tried all three of these and let me just say it was one of the best choices in my life!!! If you have server acne like I did then these are a must have!</li>
            <li> After reading the very first review I didn&#x27;t get these products I&#x27;m kicking myself they are amazing they work perfectly I don&#x27;t know what she was talking about she said it gave her have a ton of pimples.it hurt my pimples so it made them bigger and then very quickly which is exactly what something that purifies your skin is supposed to do I am now completely free and it&#x27;s all thanks to diva stuff</li>
            <li> I love all of these! I never thought my face would ever ever clear up. It becomes depressing! Everything I used either made it worse or didn&#x27;t do anything at all. And the same products the stuff that clears acne scars is my god send. Along with the charcoal wash! Amazing amazing. Thank you!</li>
            <li> i LOVE these. although i haven&#x27;t picked a favorite cause they all work in there on wonderful little ways. i love how the mask can be overnight and only on problem areas so you never over dry unaffected skin. i would recommend to anyone who suffers with any type of acne. cause at least with these i know whatever pimple comes my way i have the solution. ive noticed puting the gray clay on pimples you feel coming in the next day there smaller and soon gone. pimples arnt an issue anymore (:</li>
            <li> I bought the BOMB. i received a sample of this in my order. I had a pimple in the middle of my forehead so i decided to put this on that area...i have to say honestly the pimple shrunk in just seconds. The same night i applied some to my whole face, i couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face, it was so soft.  i highly recommend it. love the ingredients also</li>
            <li> Omg. First off this stuff smells AMAZING! I just want to eat it. Second, seems to work way better than over the counter acne products. Definitely gonna try other items from the line. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Awesome Product!  Smells great and has done a fabulous job on my skin! Clears up acne very quickly without over drying. I&#x27;ve purchased full product sizes on each of these and love it.</li>
            <li> None of these worked for me. After a very short time two of them dried up.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me, but the products seem nice</li>
            <li> I suffer from hormonal cystic acne and this is the ONLY thing I have ever found that actually works!!! I started using these daily and have had awesome results in just one week. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> After using 2 weeks this is not really working and I have minor breakouts.  I&#x27;m using it as a cly mask not as directed but it is mild.  I would consider this trio an oil control minimizer not acne spot treatment</li>
