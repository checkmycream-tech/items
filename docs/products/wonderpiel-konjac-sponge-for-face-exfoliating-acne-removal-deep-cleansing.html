            <li>This sponge is excellent for daily facial cleaning.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, not messy at all.</li>
            <li>I was able to notice a differnce the first night my face was so much smoother</li>
            <li>It sells for only $10.00 which I have paid more for bodywash and a puff sponge that did not work as well nor were as easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>An hour after I used it, my face still felt freshly washed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It gets too soft and its more for cleansing.</li>
            <li>All views and opinions with regard to the products or company itself are my own and were not influenced nor reviewed by the company prior to posting.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for great and natural beauty products that not only work well, but make my life easier.</li>
            <li>Worth about a dime❗</li>
            <li>I think my favorite thing about it is how easy it is to use and how mess free it is.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite thing about it is how easy it is to use and how mess free it is.</li>
            <li>But since it slimes right over my face like a piece of phlegm, I&#x27;m going to stop using.  </li>
            <li>This unique rich plant Konjac is an all natural alkaline, an keeps the balance to remove oils and give the skin that you want and need.</li>
            <li>The high altitude makes the fibers very pure and pollutant free.</li>
            <li>’s ability it is best to dry it in an open area where both sides of sponge are able to dry.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>This Konjac sponge can be used by people with sensitive because the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Konjac you will find that the skin can become lighter, smoother, and leaves completely free to breath and give that look of loveliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it comes to my daily cleaning this sponge helps draws out so much more dirt.</li>
            <li>This Konjac sponge makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Especially when I used it to scrub in the shower, I just used my favorite shower gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So for $10, you’ll cut back on your favorite facial cleanser (mine is of course Mary Kay) and save maybe $20 or more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed if your sponge flattens out after the first time you use it, mine did too</li>
            <li>I get a better cleanse and exfoliation with simple brown sugar after a shower a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li>This sponge provides a light exfoliation and feels soft even around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I try to do everything as quickly as possible, so that I have more time to spend with my family.</li>
            <li>I love the Konjac Facial Sponge.</li>
            <li>I received this lovely Konjac Facial Sponge to review.</li>
            <li>The Wonderpiel Konjac Sponge is a feather light sponge made from 100% pure natural dietary fibre.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft clean skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really small but works good using 2 fingers and your thumb to was your face.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite facial sponge.</li>
            <li>It really does work and as soon as my current one wears out I&#x27;ll buy a new one for sure.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try out the new Konjac Facial Sponge with activated bamboo and charcoal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a neat little sponge to keep handy.</li>
            <li>Thanks Again..  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>but really there is no need to use one because this sponge will do the job.</li>
            <li>I like the tear drop shape because I can get the area around my eyes much easier than I can with a towel.</li>
            <li>You should plan to replace it every 3 months or so, depending on how much you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li>Use a drop of cleanser as this enhances it and really lathers whatever soap you use for your face.</li>
            <li>It is filled with nutrients such as protein, carbohydrate, iron, phosphorous, copper, zinc, vitamins, A, E, D, B1, B2, B6, B12, C and Folic Acid.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>:) Make sure you hang this sponge FAR, FAR away from your tub - it likes to hang on to water, and you&#x27;ll want to keep this sponge around for as long as you can because it&#x27;s terrific!</li>
            <li>But once I used this I can actually see the dirt on my rag when I wipe my face clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and can&#x27;t handle a lot of exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>My son enjoyed it but preferred the black bamboo &amp; charcoal sponge.  </li>
            <li>It works great for tired, sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying this sponge.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The Konjac Facial Sponge is 100% Natural Eco-and-animal friendly, as well as biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered a product that made me breakout out 60 yrs old!!  </li>
            <li>like the tear drop shape because it fits nice in the hand as well as lets me get to hard to reach areas like the sides of the nose or around the eyes.</li>
            <li>It is also 100% safe to use everyday, because it has a pH balance in it, it does not damage your skin.</li>
            <li>However, when I followed the directions on the package and soaked it in water for a few minutes, it became very soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this with or without your favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps to exfoliate your skin, but very gently.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels very soft after each use.  </li>
            <li>I first open the package I was expecting the sponge to have a coal like feel</li>
            <li>It’s super easy to rinse out and hang by the little string that it comes with to let it air dry naturally.</li>
            <li>Konjac Fiber is grown in a very high altitude in places such as Japan, Korea and China.</li>
            <li>It does so by exfoliating dead skin cells and leaving my skin feeling soft, smooth, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>end result was a silky soft baby soft skin feeling.  </li>
            <li>It  really helped my skin improve by the next day  Buy it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Takes all my dead skin away and leaves so smooth.</li>
            <li>it was soft on my face</li>
            <li>The sponge can be used every day and is not harsh.</li>
            <li>But this tiny sponge, obviously alien technology or perhaps witchcraft, not only GENTLY removes dead skin and feels delightful on your face, but it triples the lather of using your fingers to apply facial cleanser so you can use a smaller amount.</li>
            <li>you do not need to use facial cleanser with this particular sponge.  </li>
            <li>Wonderpiel Skin Care Konjac Facial Sponge with Activated Bamboo Charcoal removes various toxins &amp; oils from your skin while gently exfoliating it.</li>
            <li>Before this I usually just exfoliate my clean with out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a twice weekly face exfoliator for years due to my sensitive skin, but this amazing little sponge not only gets me exfoliate every day but has dramatically cut down on the amount of acne I have.</li>
            <li>Instructions on how to use and properly care for this sponge are clearly listed on the back of the package.</li>
            <li>It even comes with a string that is attached so that you can hang for proper storage allowing it to properly dry and be ready for you the next time that you need to use it.</li>
            <li>Once wet, the sponge is very soft to the touch and then can be applied to the skin.</li>

            <li> This sponge is excellent for daily facial cleaning.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, not messy at all.</li>
            <li> I was able to notice a differnce the first night my face was so much smoother</li>
            <li> It sells for only $10.00 which I have paid more for bodywash and a puff sponge that did not work as well nor were as easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> An hour after I used it, my face still felt freshly washed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li> I think my favorite thing about it is how easy it is to use and how mess free it is.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite thing about it is how easy it is to use and how mess free it is.</li>
            <li> But since it slimes right over my face like a piece of phlegm, I&#x27;m going to stop using.  </li>
            <li> This unique rich plant Konjac is an all natural alkaline, an keeps the balance to remove oils and give the skin that you want and need.</li>

            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This Konjac sponge can be used by people with sensitive because the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Konjac you will find that the skin can become lighter, smoother, and leaves completely free to breath and give that look of loveliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This Konjac sponge makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Especially when I used it to scrub in the shower, I just used my favorite shower gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed if your sponge flattens out after the first time you use it, mine did too</li>
            <li> I get a better cleanse and exfoliation with simple brown sugar after a shower a couple of times a week.</li>

            <li> I love the Konjac Facial Sponge.</li>
            <li> I received this lovely Konjac Facial Sponge to review.</li>
            <li> The Wonderpiel Konjac Sponge is a feather light sponge made from 100% pure natural dietary fibre.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft clean skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small but works good using 2 fingers and your thumb to was your face.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite facial sponge.</li>
            <li> It really does work and as soon as my current one wears out I&#x27;ll buy a new one for sure.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out the new Konjac Facial Sponge with activated bamboo and charcoal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a neat little sponge to keep handy.</li>
            <li> Thanks Again..  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> but really there is no need to use one because this sponge will do the job.</li>
            <li> I like the tear drop shape because I can get the area around my eyes much easier than I can with a towel.</li>
            <li> You should plan to replace it every 3 months or so, depending on how much you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> Use a drop of cleanser as this enhances it and really lathers whatever soap you use for your face.</li>
            <li> It is filled with nutrients such as protein, carbohydrate, iron, phosphorous, copper, zinc, vitamins, A, E, D, B1, B2, B6, B12, C and Folic Acid.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> :) Make sure you hang this sponge FAR, FAR away from your tub - it likes to hang on to water, and you&#x27;ll want to keep this sponge around for as long as you can because it&#x27;s terrific!</li>
            <li> But once I used this I can actually see the dirt on my rag when I wipe my face clean.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and can&#x27;t handle a lot of exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> My son enjoyed it but preferred the black bamboo &amp; charcoal sponge.  </li>
            <li> It works great for tired, sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying this sponge.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Konjac Facial Sponge is 100% Natural Eco-and-animal friendly, as well as biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered a product that made me breakout out 60 yrs old!!  </li>
            <li> like the tear drop shape because it fits nice in the hand as well as lets me get to hard to reach areas like the sides of the nose or around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It is also 100% safe to use everyday, because it has a pH balance in it, it does not damage your skin.</li>
            <li> However, when I followed the directions on the package and soaked it in water for a few minutes, it became very soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this with or without your favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to exfoliate your skin, but very gently.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels very soft after each use.  </li>
            <li> I first open the package I was expecting the sponge to have a coal like feel</li>
            <li> It’s super easy to rinse out and hang by the little string that it comes with to let it air dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Konjac Fiber is grown in a very high altitude in places such as Japan, Korea and China.</li>
            <li> It does so by exfoliating dead skin cells and leaving my skin feeling soft, smooth, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> end result was a silky soft baby soft skin feeling.  </li>
            <li> It  really helped my skin improve by the next day  Buy it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Takes all my dead skin away and leaves so smooth.</li>
            <li> it was soft on my face</li>
            <li> The sponge can be used every day and is not harsh.</li>
            <li> But this tiny sponge, obviously alien technology or perhaps witchcraft, not only GENTLY removes dead skin and feels delightful on your face, but it triples the lather of using your fingers to apply facial cleanser so you can use a smaller amount.</li>
            <li> you do not need to use facial cleanser with this particular sponge.  </li>
            <li> Wonderpiel Skin Care Konjac Facial Sponge with Activated Bamboo Charcoal removes various toxins &amp; oils from your skin while gently exfoliating it.</li>
            <li> Before this I usually just exfoliate my clean with out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a twice weekly face exfoliator for years due to my sensitive skin, but this amazing little sponge not only gets me exfoliate every day but has dramatically cut down on the amount of acne I have.</li>
            <li> Instructions on how to use and properly care for this sponge are clearly listed on the back of the package.</li>
            <li> It even comes with a string that is attached so that you can hang for proper storage allowing it to properly dry and be ready for you the next time that you need to use it.</li>
            <li> Once wet, the sponge is very soft to the touch and then can be applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had a single major breakout while I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I added my regular facial cleanser to the sponge after I wet it.</li>
            <li> When I wet it, it felt slick and soft and squeezed like a soft sponge</li>
            <li> The shape allows me to get harder to reach places such as around my eyes.</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> All I grab is the Konjac Facial Sponge, wet my face, use it, rinse and dry.</li>
            <li> All I grab is the Konjac Facial Sponge, wet my face, use it, rinse and dry.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use any other facial cleansers when using the sponge because you don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a string attached so when you rinse it out you can hang it to air dry.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and the sponge in the package is hard.</li>
            <li> I just wet the sponge used a circular motion on my face and neck rinsed it and hung to dry</li>
            <li> but when I wash my face with it, I can actually feel it scrubbing the dead skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even like to touch it when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So back to alien technology-</li>
            <li> The sponge comes dry and activates under running hot or cold water.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as to how well a sponge can over a period of time really clean your face, but I have been using it for two weeks, on my face</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as to how well a sponge can over a period of time really clean your face, but I have been using it for two weeks, on my face</li>
            <li> Not impressed, expecting a real exfoliation not a massage.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t currently use a konjac sponge in your skincare routine you seriously need get your hands on one.</li>
            <li> If it would stay hard like when it&#x27;s dry, maybe it would work.  </li>
            <li> This thing does not clean your face.  </li>
            <li> It even has a little string on it so that it can be hung after use to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little sponge has changed the way I handle my skin care.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that your skin makes or breaks your confidence - so thank goodness for nifty products like this Konjac Sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I did as instructed after soaking the sponge in water for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I love using this Konjac Sponge from Wonderpiel because even in the midst of evil zit breakouts, I can still use it.</li>
            <li> I like adding a small amount of face cleaner to it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> Thought this would stay hard so I can use it as a scrub.</li>
            <li> I was leery of the hard sponge on my poor little face, until I read the directions.</li>
            <li> Very small and did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I always encounter random months when my face decides to make life difficult and break out in pimple armageddon.</li>
            <li> RIDICULOUS!!!</li>

            <li> Not impressed, expecting a real exfoliation not a massage.</li>
            <li> I always encounter random months when my face decides to make life difficult and break out in pimple armageddon. Some months, my period comes and goes with no breakouts but when I get it...I GET it bad. I love using this Konjac Sponge from Wonderpiel because even in the midst of evil zit breakouts, I can still use it. This sponge has kept my blackheads and whiteheads to a minimum, so I am happy that I can still use it with zits and all! I am a firm believer that your skin makes or breaks your confidence - so thank goodness for nifty products like this Konjac Sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

            <li> This unique rich plant Konjac is an all natural alkaline, an keeps the balance to remove oils and give the skin that you want and need. It feels renewed. This Konjac sponge can be used by people with sensitive because the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Konjac you will find that the skin can become lighter, smoother, and leaves completely free to breath and give that look of loveliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help keep the Konjac sponge working to it’s ability it is best to dry it in an open area where both sides of sponge are able to dry.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite facial sponge. It makes my skin so soft and glowing. The shape allows me to get harder to reach places such as around my eyes. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this sponge free for review. This sponge is excellent for daily facial cleaning. I really like it. I have also tried ecotools sponge and I can say that I like this so much better. When it comes to my daily cleaning this sponge helps draws out so much more dirt. Before this I usually just exfoliate my clean with out and I still have dead skin and when I wipe my face not as much dirt comes off. But once I used this I can actually see the dirt on my rag when I wipe my face clean. This sponge has charcoal which is supposed to help with drawing out dirt better then just exfoliating by itself. I choose to use an additional facial cleanser but really there is no need to use one because this sponge will do the job. I have sensitive skin so I can’t use just anything on my skin so I can say that this sponge does not make my skin break out. This Konjac sponge makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I love to touch my face after I just this sponge. I like the tear drop shape because I can get the area around my eyes much easier than I can with a towel.</li>
            <li> The Wonderpiel Konjac Sponge is a feather light sponge made from 100% pure natural dietary fibre.&lt;br /&gt;It has a smart tear drop shape that fits nicely in my hand.  It even has a little string on it so that it can be hung after use to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first open the package I was expecting the sponge to have a coal like feel but it doesn&#x27;t at all.  It felt more like Styrofoam but softer.  When I wet it, it felt slick and soft and squeezed like a soft sponge but when I wash my face with it, I can actually feel it scrubbing the dead skin away,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result was a silky soft baby soft skin feeling.  My face felt so clean and refreshed.  Even hours later it still felt the same.  I look forward to continuing to see this konjac sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use any other facial cleansers when using the sponge because you don&#x27;t have to.  This is great if you have hypersensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I first received this sponge, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be able to use it or not. I have very sensitive skin, and the sponge in the package is hard. However, when I followed the directions on the package and soaked it in water for a few minutes, it became very soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this with or without your favorite cleanser. I added my regular facial cleanser to the sponge after I wet it. It foamed up just enough. As I washed my face with it, it felt very nice on my skin. It definitely helps to exfoliate your skin, but very gently. An hour after I used it, my face still felt freshly washed.&lt;br /&gt;This sponge can be used on the face and body. It comes with a string attached so when you rinse it out you can hang it to air dry. They recommend replacing it every 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great sponge to use for gentle exfoliating. I absolutely love it. I will be using this from now on instead of a washcloth. It does a great job and is extremely soft and gentle. So happy I got to try this in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> Soft clean skin. Feels nice when using the sponge</li>
            <li> Great nice size facial cleansing sponge !</li>
            <li> Wonderpiel Skin Care Konjac Facial Sponge with Activated Bamboo Charcoal removes various toxins &amp; oils from your skin while gently exfoliating it. While the charcoal is extracting out all of the impurities, the konjac is balancing out your face pH levels. You can use this sponge all by itself (no cleansers) and you will still get great results. This sponge can also be used on all skin types. The tear shaped design allows you to easily clean every surface area on your face with ease. Instructions on how to use and properly care for this sponge are clearly listed on the back of the package. I would highly recommend buying this sponge. You will not be disappointed with your purchase. ( I received this product free to review, but my opinions are my own).</li>
            <li> When’s the last time you used a sponge to exfoliate with? Yeah, I don’t either. Until I started using the Konjac sponge from Wonderpiel. It’s a great way to clean your face while drawing out the impurities and leaving you with an incredibly soft face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a neat little sponge to keep handy. The packaging says you don’t even need to use cleanser with it because it does the work of cleaning your skin without all the chemicals! I found it didn’t seem to harm my skin when I did though. Especially when I used it to scrub in the shower, I just used my favorite shower gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin seemed to look fresh and healthy after using the Konjac sponge. It’s super easy to rinse out and hang by the little string that it comes with to let it air dry naturally. Plus it is loaded with all sorts of minerals and nutrients that are good for your skin and it is supposed to help with fighting acne and blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the tear drop shape because it fits nice in the hand as well as lets me get to hard to reach areas like the sides of the nose or around the eyes. You should plan to replace it every 3 months or so, depending on how much you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I’m not quite sure how to pronounce “Konjac” but I’m pretty sure it translates to “Shut up and take my money!” I was leery of the hard sponge on my poor little face, until I read the directions. Always a good idea. It turns out, when you soak the sponge, it softened into a squishy oval of gelatinous-feeling something. Again, I have no idea what. But this tiny sponge, obviously alien technology or perhaps witchcraft, not only GENTLY removes dead skin and feels delightful on your face, but it triples the lather of using your fingers to apply facial cleanser so you can use a smaller amount. And IT’S SO SQUISHY!&lt;br /&gt;So back to alien technology- the sponge contains activated charcoal to kill bacteria that may try to collect on your precious sponge. Meaning you won’t need to worry about it hanging in your bathroom for the 2-3 months it will last. So for $10, you’ll cut back on your favorite facial cleanser (mine is of course Mary Kay) and save maybe $20 or more. Even though you’ll be sure to remember to clean your face twice a day just because you love the SQUISHY (see above) feeling. I’ve had for over a week and the novelty has not even begun to fade. I received this product for my unbiased opinion, and I’ll be purchasing it in two months.</li>
            <li> Face has never felt smoother!</li>
            <li> This sponge is excellent! I highly recommend. It cleans face excellent and exfoliates amazing without being too abrasive on the skin. Amazing sponge!!</li>
            <li> This sponge is awesome! It&#x27;s very durable, and I love the shape - it&#x27;s perfect for reaching all the nooks and crannies in your face. Using this sponge increases the blood flow to your face and makes the products you already use work better! Don&#x27;t be alarmed if your sponge flattens out after the first time you use it, mine did too but it works just as well :) Make sure you hang this sponge FAR, FAR away from your tub - it likes to hang on to water, and you&#x27;ll want to keep this sponge around for as long as you can because it&#x27;s terrific! Enjoy this sponge, and here&#x27;s to younger-looking skin!</li>
            <li> I received this for a review.  My son enjoyed it but preferred the black bamboo &amp; charcoal sponge.  It did the job and he used it on his chest, back and shoulders.  He never had acne but it also never caused any blemishes.  His skin did feel smoother though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small but works good using 2 fingers and your thumb to was your face. I wish it was A LOT bigger so I could use it on my body.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see or feel this thing exfoliate.  It just slipped over my skin like a slimy fish.  Yes, slimy.  I don&#x27;t even like to touch it when it&#x27;s wet.  If it would stay hard like when it&#x27;s dry, maybe it would work.  But since it slimes right over my face like a piece of phlegm, I&#x27;m going to stop using.  Waste of money.  I had to rub my face with my towel afterwards to get it clean.  This thing does not clean your face.  Unless I got a defective one.  That&#x27;s all I can think of.  And there is NO activated charcoal.  This is just vegetable fiber.  That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I love charcoal products and this does the job and gets my face clean.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t currently use a konjac sponge in your skincare routine you seriously need get your hands on one. These are so great at gently exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after using this sponge. Easy to reuse and works just as well after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype.  No big deal</li>
            <li> Thought this would stay hard so I can use it as a scrub. It gets too soft and its more for cleansing. Use a drop of cleanser as this enhances it and really lathers whatever soap you use for your face.</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> With all the wonderful reviews, I thought this was awesome, but it&#x27;s just OK. I get a better cleanse and exfoliation with simple brown sugar after a shower a couple of times a week. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and can&#x27;t handle a lot of exfoliation.  I use a clarisonic but even that I can only tolerate once per day.  This sponge provides a light exfoliation and feels soft even around my eyes.  I use an airbrush for my foundation and I if I wash with just my hands and a cleanser It doesn&#x27;t all come off.  This sponge is just enough to get the rest of my makeup off at the end of the day.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I received this free for testing purposes. All opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little sponge has changed the way I handle my skin care. I&#x27;ve been a twice weekly face exfoliator for years due to my sensitive skin, but this amazing little sponge not only gets me exfoliate every day but has dramatically cut down on the amount of acne I have. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had a single major breakout while I&#x27;ve been using it. It really does work and as soon as my current one wears out I&#x27;ll buy a new one for sure. 100% recommend this.</li>
            <li> Just arrived and I was dying to try it....it is amazing!! My skins feels great!</li>
            <li> I ordered a product that made me breakout out 60 yrs old!!  My daughter used a charcoal cleanser and her skin looks beautiful so I saw this and thought I try it.  It is wonderful  It  really helped my skin improve by the next day  Buy it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic! Cleans amazingly, leaves skin very soft and smooth. Very easy to use, not messy at all. You can read my full review here: https://adventureswithmandi.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/wonderpeil-konjac-facial-sponge-with-activated-bamboo-charcoal-review/</li>

I try to do everything as quickly as possible, so that I have more time to spend with my family. I think that is the way life should be. I am always looking for great and natural beauty products that not only work well, but make my life easier. I want something that is quick and easy to use. Something that is not going to cost me a fortune if my toddler accidentally gets into it. I was very excited to try out the new Konjac Facial Sponge with activated bamboo and charcoal. I had heard a lot about these sponges and how popular they are becoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac Facial Sponge is a sponge that is 5 x 7 x 1 inch and is made of Konjac Fiber. Konjac Fiber is grown in a very high altitude in places such as Japan, Korea and China. The high altitude makes the fibers very pure and pollutant free. It is filled with nutrients such as protein, carbohydrate, iron, phosphorous, copper, zinc, vitamins, A, E, D, B1, B2, B6, B12, C and Folic Acid. The sponge comes dry and activates under running hot or cold water. You hold it under running water for about a minute and squeeze it and that activates the bamboo and charcoal cleanser that is already in the sponge. The Konjac Facial sponge gently exfoliates dead skin cells, removes, toxins, oils and impurities from your skin. It works great for tired, sensitive or acne prone skin. It is also 100% safe to use everyday, because it has a pH balance in it, it does not damage your skin. The Konjac Facial Sponge is 100% Natural Eco-and-animal friendly, as well as biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive and acne prone skin. I love the Konjac Facial Sponge. I was very skeptical as to how well a sponge can over a period of time really clean your face, but I have been using it for two weeks, on my face and I have noticed significant improvement. The Konjac Facial Sponge has helped not only with my existing acne, but acne scars as well. It is also a great exfoliator. I think my favorite thing about it is how easy it is to use and how mess free it is. All I grab is the Konjac Facial Sponge, wet my face, use it, rinse and dry. It is quick and easy with great results. I do not know how much better you can get than that. It also is a great sponge to travel with. It is safe to use all over your body and it lasts for up to three months. It sells for only $10.00 which I have paid more for bodywash and a puff sponge that did not work as well nor were as easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives Konjac Facial Sponge 5 Stars!al Sponge.

            <li> It isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quick did not have to use any type of cleaner for my skin I just wet the sponge used a circular motion on my face and neck rinsed it and hung to dry I was able to notice a differnce the first night my face was so much smoother Have been using about a month now and will buy again Konjac Sponges are the best If you can find one that works great, This one does what it needs to do wet it and go to town on your face and neck I like adding a small amount of face cleaner to it. Takes all my dead skin away and leaves so smooth.</li>
            <li> The product advertised had activated charcoal in the description. The product I received has no mention of charcoal... 😣</li>
            <li> RIDICULOUS!!! Worth about a dime❗️Threw it in the garbage❗️</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Very small and did nothing for me. Maybe I just didn&#x27;t get a good one, but I wasn&#x27;t wowed.</li>
            <li> Each times I use I start getting breakouts</li>
            <li> I received this lovely Konjac Facial Sponge to review. I have been using several product to exfoliate my skin.  I like you do not need to use facial cleanser with this particular sponge.  I did as instructed after soaking the sponge in water for a few minutes it was soft on my face and I did use in circular motions.  My face feels very soft after each use.  It makes a big difference and I will be using these all the time.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Konjac Facial Sponge to help with cleansing my skin. It does so by exfoliating dead skin cells and leaving my skin feeling soft, smooth, and refreshed.  The sponge can be used every day and is not harsh. Once wet, the sponge is very soft to the touch and then can be applied to the skin. I use it in the morning and evening by applying my favorite cleansers to my face and using the sponge in a circular motion. What I love most about this product is that my skin feels extremely clean and looks fresh after each use. It even comes with a string that is attached so that you can hang for proper storage allowing it to properly dry and be ready for you the next time that you need to use it. This helps in preserving the properties of the sponge. I highly recommend this sponge as a great product that will provide your skin with a refresh and replenished appearance. Most of all, it&#x27;s a quality product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> feels good on my face</li>
            <li> Was very happy with my order</li>
