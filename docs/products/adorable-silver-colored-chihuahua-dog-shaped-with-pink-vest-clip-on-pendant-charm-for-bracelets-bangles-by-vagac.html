            <li> It looked better than I expected</li>
            <li> Broke the second day I had it. Not worth returning.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter in law and haven&#x27;t given it to her yet</li>
            <li> I love this charm, however the tail gets caught in things, so I won&#x27;t let my dog wear when I am not around.  My dog caught the tail on her food dish and she ended up dragging her food dish around, which scared her.  It is a very pretty charm.  My dog will wear it to show herself off.</li>
            <li> Looks better in person. real cute.</li>
            <li> Adorable and inexpensive. It arrived faster than it was estimated.</li>

            <li> This a cute silver chi dog with pink.sweater&lt;br /&gt;clip on your purse book.bag etc.great price&lt;br /&gt;delivery</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she likes it so much she&#x27;s wearing it all the time on her necklace. Cute. VERY tiny, though it is a charm for a&lt;br /&gt;charm bracelet. Shipping took well over a month, from Shenzen, China so do not order if you are in a hurry!  Very inexpensive, so if you are patient worth a wait.</li>
