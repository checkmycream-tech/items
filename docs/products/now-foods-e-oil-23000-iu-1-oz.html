            <li>I got it to assist in wound healing post surgery, and am pleased to have found this excellent product.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a wonderful product :)</li>
            <li>a  good way to get vitamin E oil, though, if you need it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product - look for d-alpha for good vitamin E</li>
            <li>It was $16.00 for 4 oz good price</li>
            <li>Good quality and a good value.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on the good reviews, however, when I received the bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just not... delicious.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>She has been using it for 2 months and is very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I will order more!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Pure oil is wonderful for my scalp.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I will update with how effective it is regardless of that fact.</li>
            <li>I mix this with cocoa butter and it really gives my legs a great feeling!</li>
            <li>it seems to speed healing up nicely.</li>
            <li>It is truly effective and I will be reordering soon.</li>
            <li>This was a beautiful Amber color and it works well on healing the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery great product</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using it for my flax seed hair gel with wonderful results.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for dry/and or mature skin, and  wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Great consistency and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>Great product for moisturizing your skin...especially for women of a certain age!</li>
            <li>But to be honest the Jason 45,000 i.u. vitamin E oil is more potency at a better price.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good -- my favorite combination :)</li>
            <li>Easy to use dropper was nice to drizzle the oil over the food.</li>
            <li>I liked the dropper it makes it so easy to add into my creams.</li>
            <li>and it goes on my face easier and smoother, but my face is oily and I worry it will make it more oily</li>
            <li>I use it to help heal scars on my face and moisturize my lips, word of caution- if you seek the sun after use, it remains in your pores and tends to tan real quickly, so use 50+ sport or face sun screen.</li>
            <li>Love this products.</li>
            <li>I suspect more olive oil is used now.</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using it since I have combination skin with visible pores on most of my face, and found it to be too thick/oily for my skin even in winter time.</li>
            <li>My face looks more youthful now.</li>
            <li>I love it to use on my face and areas</li>
            <li>Also it  dose not say on the lable how many</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>it but haven&#x27;t seen any results that make me love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it for my toes and fingernails, and even the callouses that we all have.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>however I am most concerned about your quality.</li>
            <li>I hope that you guys are able to resolve any quality issues you are having.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, but the smell is unbearable for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this makes it go farther.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it still is all-natural though.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;ll see what i&#x27;m looking like after about a month or more.</li>
            <li>It restores the skin to a more youthful state and does wonders against scars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It sure is doing the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ahhh peace of mind! :)</li>
            <li>Now foods brand is ok</li>
            <li>and after is pretty remarkable.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Just as described NOW brand always has high quality products, speedy delivery...very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>This has nice consistency and isn&#x27;t super sticky like others I have bought.</li>
            <li>I am giving it a 4 star because it runs out of the drouper very quickly.</li>
            <li>However, the smell is incredibly strong.  </li>
            <li>MY DARK CIRCLES WILL GO AWAY FOR GOOD!!!!!</li>
            <li>Wished that description, reviews, and answers to questions would have been accurate.  </li>
            <li>Her scars have since diminished greatly and I&#x27;m about to purchase a second bottle to continue using and hope for continued improvement.</li>
            <li>Gives skin a glowing and smooth look.</li>
            <li>It is now a light gold.</li>
            <li>I purchased primarily to help heal scars from surgery.  </li>
            <li>and I leave it in my face during all day and the results is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>This product seems to fit the description</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Works great as an extra moisturizer for my wrinkles at night.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this is good quality oil.</li>
            <li>but so far so good</li>
            <li>If you do not have that kind of time on your hands though I suggest giving this particular product a try just keep in mind</li>
            <li>Wonderfully rich oil.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to use on my face at night to help my complexion but because I am prone to breakouts</li>
            <li>I will buy it again, love it  ;)</li>
            <li>In fact, I was so impressed with the results that I began adding a few drops to my morning/evening facial moisturizing routine just for good measure.</li>
            <li>Great product 1 bottle lasts me a long time</li>
            <li>I use it on my face at night, and I love it within days the appearance of my skin has changed, it has a glowing look to it even first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I used it from January until August and have seen a significant decrease in the visibility of my burn marks.</li>
            <li>, that was important to me while pregnant.  </li>
            <li>This is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I thought I had done a thorough check to make sure this was pure E oil.</li>
            <li>The most pure form of Vitamin E I&#x27;ve used since childhood.</li>
            <li>D-Apha Tocopherol is the authentic, pure oil.</li>
            <li>Mine came in a deep amber color, so I assume it means its good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true vitamin E.</li>
            <li>Loved it for mixing with my essential oils for lotion.</li>
            <li>I have that clear skin like my mom&#x27;s, she even complemented me on how nice my face has cleared up.</li>
            <li>but she quickly turned her nose up to it.</li>
            <li>It has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;ll be more suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li>this was  recommended as being really good  for dry skin</li>
            <li>she said that she used E-Oil along with drinking plenty of water and a good diet, so I rushed and ordered me my first bottle, since then with the help of my daily vitamins</li>
            <li>good for my dog&#x27;s nose and dry skin but not for healing burns</li>
            <li>This product is fine if you don&#x27;t have an alternative, the eyedropper is a very helpful feature.  </li>
            <li>I used this product because I had heard good things about Vit E and this has cleared up the scar over the course of 2 weeks and the scar is looking much better and is hardly noticeable anymore.</li>
            <li>The oil is great, the dropper is messy.</li>
            <li>but this could really use some.  does not apply smoothly.  </li>
            <li>After using a few drops of this Vitamin E oil almost every day, my scars look great.</li>
            <li>I have to dilute it with another type of oil for example jojoba to be able to apply it over my skin this oil leaves my skin velvety soft</li>
            <li>I mix this in with my c serum, love it, makes face feel so soft, would reccomend to a friend</li>
            <li>Nice and deep amber.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The oil arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>, I always apply it right before bed time after vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I had very large pores on my skin.</li>
            <li>You are getting pure oil and your skin will thank you when you use it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing for dry skin....</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this product and think buying the better E oil is worth the money especially for putting it on the face.</li>
            <li>It smelled funny and had a funky after touch that was sort of sticky.  </li>
            <li>but I only wish I would have ordered more the first time around.</li>
            <li>Ultimately I prefer a looser/ more spreadable product.</li>
            <li>, my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Scars, hyperpigmentation, and enlarged pores are all fading, and my skin has never been so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my beauty products.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect to be.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using E-Oil I have seen some changes in my skin, my mom&#x27;s face has always looked clear and free of blemishes</li>
            <li>This is my first time in using this oil for both hair and skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; but I use this along with a half tsp of my own homemade essential oil face recipe I make and blends perfectly!</li>
            <li>later discovered, thanks to researching for hours, that you need to be sure which type of tocopherol it is, and notice how this one doesn&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin is super soft!</li>
            <li>Not sure what would be a good time to put it on.</li>
            <li>They feel soft and are diminishing quickly.</li>
            <li>Pure vitamin e oil.</li>
            <li>this is not 100% pure</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll use this up and buy a pure one.</li>
            <li>You want D PURE STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Looks like good quality Vitamin E - the serum I made works wonders, and the vitamin E will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>FIRST LET ME TELL YOU THAT I HAVE USED AND SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON HIGH END EYE SERUMS/CREAMS</li>
            <li>This oil has a very thick consistency and it&#x27;s great for homemade skin recipes</li>
            <li>Also it was much thinner than before.</li>
            <li>I really like the organic oil.</li>
            <li>so you do not need to use a whole lot of it),</li>
            <li>CVS E cream uses the synthesized E, while this product is the d-Alpha real E.  </li>
            <li>It works great directly on my daughter&#x27;s skin; however, for this aging adult it left big pimples on my skin</li>
            <li>The description for this item is very misleading.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t got to use it too much yet, so don&#x27;t have a usage comment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any that need it for this reason to give it a try!</li>
            <li>It has brought me much need relief and comfort.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>too much olive oil in it.</li>
            <li>very smelly.  </li>
            <li>It is very greasy too.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have seen a very noticeable improvement on some stretch marks I have.</li>
            <li>and it is very hydrating and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It helps my natural oils stay fresh and my skin toned if i get a hand cut, and it helped my skin blemishes over the years.</li>
            <li>This is real.</li>
            <li>but It works really well for what I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>i rubbed it on her knees and her scars began to fade fast.</li>
            <li>Can tell it&#x27;s really helping by morning.</li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it on surgical scars and it really helps fade them</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t tell you much and it seems like a home made label.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made up jars of homemade lotion with shea butter, coconut oil, almond oil, etc, and I put a whole dropperful of this E in also.  </li>
            <li>On the good side, it didn&#x27;t cause any negative reactions on my face.</li>
            <li>The color was right, NOT clear, true vit.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in how soft my skin has become in the areas I have been applying it to, and it does seem to be helping with scarring (even some old ones I&#x27;m testing it on).</li>
            <li>so I reordered and was dismayed to find that the oil I received the second time around was significantly lighter in color from the amber colored oil</li>
            <li>It is more viscous than other brands.</li>
            <li>If this has happened to my favorite vitamin e oil, how can I trust the integrity of your other products.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin around my cuticles and my skin rips easily.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I thought it was 100% pure, natural, undiluted, the real deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good combination of soy and olive oil, to be honest, with a little research and practice you can probably learn how to make your own product, and it could probably last you an entire year instead of spending 15.00 on a 1oz bottle that might only last a few months.</li>
            <li>So im back at square one which is 1oz for $7.00 ill just buy 4 bottles and be happy !</li>
            <li>ONLY THING IS THAT TONIGHT I WILL APPLY IT RIGHT BEFORE BEDTIME WHEN IAM READY TO GO TO SLEEP COUSE</li>
            <li>i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>LONGER:)..)I WILL NEVER SPEND MONEY ON HIGH END EYE CREAMS AGAIN..</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s best used on thick natural African American hair.</li>
            <li>I love that its a natural form of vit e unlike a lot of other ones that are synthetic.</li>
            <li>In the other day my face skin is so soft, looking healthy, as a baby skin.</li>
            <li>Pure Vitamin E Oil from a natural source is 32,000 IU per ounce.  </li>
            <li>This vitamin E oil is natural (d alpha tocopherol acetate) and pure.  </li>
            <li>Go find the brand Nature&#x27;s Bounty 100% Natural E-400iu Pure d-Alpha 120 softgels.</li>
            <li>This vitamin E oil is a good product and of course very thick.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin under my eyes soft and really helps with lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember, true vitamin E is not clear.</li>
            <li>If I have a fresh scar, I&#x27;ll use the vitamin E directly on the spot, not mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li>E isn&#x27;t clear, nice thick consistency.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin very soft</li>
            <li>It got rancid pretty quick, and this is not cheap.</li>
            <li>In the winter my skin dries out more than usual and I started using one drop of this with my morning face care routine.</li>
            <li>Was looking for an all natural Vitamin E and this is it!</li>
            <li>As thick as honey, I believe this is the real deal, this vitamin E oil is the one to get closer to the pure vitamin E, I had used many other brands, but this product I&#x27;d say is more natural vitamin E oil than any other brand I have used, it&#x27;s color</li>
            <li>I use this product for my hair, because I mix it with other products I don&#x27;t use much at a time so the size is just right.</li>
            <li>&amp; that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars because though it does make my skin soft the seller should have made that very clear.</li>
            <li>and it is helping clear my scars.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I don&#x27;t have a huge base for comparison</li>
            <li>All Natural and Premium</li>
            <li>I use it in my natural hair care regimen.</li>
            <li>Soak do not apply directly or rub the area...</li>
            <li>This E oil is based on natural oil.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I wished they had it in a larger bottle ,but they dont</li>
            <li>I had tried various products to cure pores but nothing really worked be it</li>
            <li>WOW.....</li>
            <li>IAM JUST 29YRS OLD AND DONT HAVE WRINKLES</li>
            <li>Applied frequently, the acne marks do disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Combine</li>
            <li>-it is vitamin e oil mixed with olive oil-who knows how much vitamin e</li>
            <li>Something to keep in mind, though, if you&#x27;re planning to apply it somewhere sensitive.</li>
            <li>I use them in all of my herbal concoctions, natural hair products and homemade family recipes.</li>
            <li>I use cloth diapers, and so far this oil has not interfered with absorbency, but keep in mind that I&#x27;m not gobbing it on.  </li>
            <li>(100% Natural Vitamin E Oil)</li>
            <li>I bought this in an attempt to find a natural solution for my hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>The product is great but it quite thick so the dropper is a bit messy.</li>
            <li>so i can apply it more evenly; by itself it&#x27;s quite thick and sticky.</li>
            <li>My only thing with this is that after doing my research true vitamin e oil is much THICKER and has more color than this product which makes me believe there are some artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am sure I made the right choice over other products, expensive and many other chemicals included.  </li>
            <li>I unwisely popped a zit on my chin that left a HUGE dark mark.</li>
            <li>so I searched high and low not wanting to run out of it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Now Foods E-oil for some time now on my toenails because they were starting to develop lines, and were not growing as quickly as they used to (due to nerve injury and hormone imbalance)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find real pure natural vitamin E these days.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, and so much easier than trying to cut open and squeeze out those little capsules!</li>
            <li>but I have had to stop using it because I somehow developed a soy allergy and am trying to avoid soy as much as possible.</li>
            <li>I went and purchased Jason brand vitamin e oil from whole foods after I used all of this oil, and there was absolutely no smell</li>
            <li>It has this listed on the label:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: 100% Natural Vitamin E oil (as d-alpha tocopherol from vegetable oil) and extra virgin olive oil.  </li>
            <li>and I barely have any hyper-pigmentation anymore</li>
            <li>I thought this was pure vitamin E , but there are other ingredients listed.</li>
            <li>Not exactly the color I was expecting, makes me wonder how pure it is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind that it has olive oil mixed in; it helps thin the super-thick vitamin E oil, making it easier to apply. :)</li>
            <li>The first bottle that I had from you guys that was a little older was vitamin e oil that was darkly colored and sticky.</li>
            <li>It makes my legs soft all day long!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 23 year old woman with lots of acne scars and chronically dry skin.</li>
            <li>I did my research and found out that tocopherol is a high level of vitimin e and is and it is not watered down with olive oil</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s neither bad, nor good for</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I got it to assist in wound healing post surgery, and am pleased to have found this excellent product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a wonderful product :)</li>
            <li> a  good way to get vitamin E oil, though, if you need it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product - look for d-alpha for good vitamin E</li>
            <li> It was $16.00 for 4 oz good price</li>
            <li> Good quality and a good value.</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the good reviews, however, when I received the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just not... delicious.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> She has been using it for 2 months and is very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I will order more!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Pure oil is wonderful for my scalp.</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I will update with how effective it is regardless of that fact.</li>
            <li> I mix this with cocoa butter and it really gives my legs a great feeling!</li>
            <li> it seems to speed healing up nicely.</li>
            <li> It is truly effective and I will be reordering soon.</li>
            <li> This was a beautiful Amber color and it works well on healing the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery great product</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for my flax seed hair gel with wonderful results.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for dry/and or mature skin, and  wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Great consistency and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> Great product for moisturizing your skin...especially for women of a certain age!</li>
            <li> But to be honest the Jason 45,000 i.u. vitamin E oil is more potency at a better price.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good -- my favorite combination :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use dropper was nice to drizzle the oil over the food.</li>
            <li> I liked the dropper it makes it so easy to add into my creams.</li>
            <li> and it goes on my face easier and smoother, but my face is oily and I worry it will make it more oily</li>
            <li> I use it to help heal scars on my face and moisturize my lips, word of caution- if you seek the sun after use, it remains in your pores and tends to tan real quickly, so use 50+ sport or face sun screen.</li>
            <li> Love this products.</li>
            <li> I suspect more olive oil is used now.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it since I have combination skin with visible pores on most of my face, and found it to be too thick/oily for my skin even in winter time.</li>
            <li> My face looks more youthful now.</li>
            <li> I love it to use on my face and areas</li>
            <li> Also it  dose not say on the lable how many</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> it but haven&#x27;t seen any results that make me love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it for my toes and fingernails, and even the callouses that we all have.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> however I am most concerned about your quality.</li>
            <li> I hope that you guys are able to resolve any quality issues you are having.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but the smell is unbearable for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this makes it go farther.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it still is all-natural though.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll see what i&#x27;m looking like after about a month or more.</li>
            <li> It restores the skin to a more youthful state and does wonders against scars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It sure is doing the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ahhh peace of mind! :)</li>
            <li> Now foods brand is ok</li>
            <li> and after is pretty remarkable.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Just as described NOW brand always has high quality products, speedy delivery...very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This has nice consistency and isn&#x27;t super sticky like others I have bought.</li>
            <li> I am giving it a 4 star because it runs out of the drouper very quickly.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is incredibly strong.  </li>
            <li> MY DARK CIRCLES WILL GO AWAY FOR GOOD!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wished that description, reviews, and answers to questions would have been accurate.  </li>
            <li> Her scars have since diminished greatly and I&#x27;m about to purchase a second bottle to continue using and hope for continued improvement.</li>
            <li> Gives skin a glowing and smooth look.</li>
            <li> It is now a light gold.</li>
            <li> I purchased primarily to help heal scars from surgery.  </li>
            <li> and I leave it in my face during all day and the results is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> This product seems to fit the description</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works great as an extra moisturizer for my wrinkles at night.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is good quality oil.</li>
            <li> but so far so good</li>
            <li> If you do not have that kind of time on your hands though I suggest giving this particular product a try just keep in mind</li>
            <li> Wonderfully rich oil.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to use on my face at night to help my complexion but because I am prone to breakouts</li>
            <li> I will buy it again, love it  ;)</li>
            <li> In fact, I was so impressed with the results that I began adding a few drops to my morning/evening facial moisturizing routine just for good measure.</li>
            <li> Great product 1 bottle lasts me a long time</li>
            <li> I use it on my face at night, and I love it within days the appearance of my skin has changed, it has a glowing look to it even first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I used it from January until August and have seen a significant decrease in the visibility of my burn marks.</li>
            <li> , that was important to me while pregnant.  </li>
            <li> This is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I thought I had done a thorough check to make sure this was pure E oil.</li>
            <li> The most pure form of Vitamin E I&#x27;ve used since childhood.</li>
            <li> D-Apha Tocopherol is the authentic, pure oil.</li>
            <li> Mine came in a deep amber color, so I assume it means its good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Loved it for mixing with my essential oils for lotion.</li>
            <li> I have that clear skin like my mom&#x27;s, she even complemented me on how nice my face has cleared up.</li>
            <li> but she quickly turned her nose up to it.</li>
            <li> It has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;ll be more suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li> this was  recommended as being really good  for dry skin</li>
            <li> she said that she used E-Oil along with drinking plenty of water and a good diet, so I rushed and ordered me my first bottle, since then with the help of my daily vitamins</li>
            <li> good for my dog&#x27;s nose and dry skin but not for healing burns</li>
            <li> This product is fine if you don&#x27;t have an alternative, the eyedropper is a very helpful feature.  </li>
            <li> I used this product because I had heard good things about Vit E and this has cleared up the scar over the course of 2 weeks and the scar is looking much better and is hardly noticeable anymore.</li>
            <li> The oil is great, the dropper is messy.</li>
            <li> but this could really use some.  does not apply smoothly.  </li>
            <li> After using a few drops of this Vitamin E oil almost every day, my scars look great.</li>
            <li> I have to dilute it with another type of oil for example jojoba to be able to apply it over my skin this oil leaves my skin velvety soft</li>
            <li> I mix this in with my c serum, love it, makes face feel so soft, would reccomend to a friend</li>
            <li> Nice and deep amber.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> , I always apply it right before bed time after vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I had very large pores on my skin.</li>
            <li> You are getting pure oil and your skin will thank you when you use it!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing for dry skin....</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and think buying the better E oil is worth the money especially for putting it on the face.</li>
            <li> It smelled funny and had a funky after touch that was sort of sticky.  </li>
            <li> but I only wish I would have ordered more the first time around.</li>
            <li> Ultimately I prefer a looser/ more spreadable product.</li>
            <li> , my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Scars, hyperpigmentation, and enlarged pores are all fading, and my skin has never been so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my beauty products.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect to be.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using E-Oil I have seen some changes in my skin, my mom&#x27;s face has always looked clear and free of blemishes</li>
            <li> This is my first time in using this oil for both hair and skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; but I use this along with a half tsp of my own homemade essential oil face recipe I make and blends perfectly!</li>
            <li> later discovered, thanks to researching for hours, that you need to be sure which type of tocopherol it is, and notice how this one doesn&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> In the morning my skin is super soft!</li>
            <li> Not sure what would be a good time to put it on.</li>
            <li> They feel soft and are diminishing quickly.</li>
            <li> Pure vitamin e oil.</li>
            <li> this is not 100% pure</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll use this up and buy a pure one.</li>
            <li> You want D PURE STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Looks like good quality Vitamin E - the serum I made works wonders, and the vitamin E will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> FIRST LET ME TELL YOU THAT I HAVE USED AND SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON HIGH END EYE SERUMS/CREAMS</li>
            <li> This oil has a very thick consistency and it&#x27;s great for homemade skin recipes</li>
            <li> Also it was much thinner than before.</li>
            <li> I really like the organic oil.</li>
            <li> so you do not need to use a whole lot of it),</li>
            <li> CVS E cream uses the synthesized E, while this product is the d-Alpha real E.  </li>
            <li> It works great directly on my daughter&#x27;s skin; however, for this aging adult it left big pimples on my skin</li>
            <li> The description for this item is very misleading.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got to use it too much yet, so don&#x27;t have a usage comment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend any that need it for this reason to give it a try!</li>
            <li> It has brought me much need relief and comfort.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> too much olive oil in it.</li>
            <li> very smelly.  </li>
            <li> It is very greasy too.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have seen a very noticeable improvement on some stretch marks I have.</li>
            <li> and it is very hydrating and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It helps my natural oils stay fresh and my skin toned if i get a hand cut, and it helped my skin blemishes over the years.</li>
            <li> This is real.</li>
            <li> but It works really well for what I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> i rubbed it on her knees and her scars began to fade fast.</li>
            <li> Can tell it&#x27;s really helping by morning.</li>
            <li> and I can really see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it on surgical scars and it really helps fade them</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t tell you much and it seems like a home made label.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made up jars of homemade lotion with shea butter, coconut oil, almond oil, etc, and I put a whole dropperful of this E in also.  </li>
            <li> On the good side, it didn&#x27;t cause any negative reactions on my face.</li>
            <li> The color was right, NOT clear, true vit.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in how soft my skin has become in the areas I have been applying it to, and it does seem to be helping with scarring (even some old ones I&#x27;m testing it on).</li>
            <li> so I reordered and was dismayed to find that the oil I received the second time around was significantly lighter in color from the amber colored oil</li>
            <li> It is more viscous than other brands.</li>
            <li> If this has happened to my favorite vitamin e oil, how can I trust the integrity of your other products.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin around my cuticles and my skin rips easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it was 100% pure, natural, undiluted, the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good combination of soy and olive oil, to be honest, with a little research and practice you can probably learn how to make your own product, and it could probably last you an entire year instead of spending 15.00 on a 1oz bottle that might only last a few months.</li>
            <li> So im back at square one which is 1oz for $7.00 ill just buy 4 bottles and be happy !</li>
            <li> ONLY THING IS THAT TONIGHT I WILL APPLY IT RIGHT BEFORE BEDTIME WHEN IAM READY TO GO TO SLEEP COUSE</li>
            <li> i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> LONGER:)..)I WILL NEVER SPEND MONEY ON HIGH END EYE CREAMS AGAIN..</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s best used on thick natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> I love that its a natural form of vit e unlike a lot of other ones that are synthetic.</li>
            <li> In the other day my face skin is so soft, looking healthy, as a baby skin.</li>
            <li> Pure Vitamin E Oil from a natural source is 32,000 IU per ounce.  </li>
            <li> This vitamin E oil is natural (d alpha tocopherol acetate) and pure.  </li>
            <li> Go find the brand Nature&#x27;s Bounty 100% Natural E-400iu Pure d-Alpha 120 softgels.</li>
            <li> This vitamin E oil is a good product and of course very thick.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin under my eyes soft and really helps with lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember, true vitamin E is not clear.</li>
            <li> If I have a fresh scar, I&#x27;ll use the vitamin E directly on the spot, not mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> E isn&#x27;t clear, nice thick consistency.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin very soft</li>
            <li> It got rancid pretty quick, and this is not cheap.</li>
            <li> In the winter my skin dries out more than usual and I started using one drop of this with my morning face care routine.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an all natural Vitamin E and this is it!</li>
            <li> As thick as honey, I believe this is the real deal, this vitamin E oil is the one to get closer to the pure vitamin E, I had used many other brands, but this product I&#x27;d say is more natural vitamin E oil than any other brand I have used, it&#x27;s color</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair, because I mix it with other products I don&#x27;t use much at a time so the size is just right.</li>
            <li> &amp; that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars because though it does make my skin soft the seller should have made that very clear.</li>
            <li> and it is helping clear my scars.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I don&#x27;t have a huge base for comparison</li>
            <li> All Natural and Premium</li>
            <li> I use it in my natural hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> Soak do not apply directly or rub the area...</li>
            <li> This E oil is based on natural oil.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I wished they had it in a larger bottle ,but they dont</li>
            <li> I had tried various products to cure pores but nothing really worked be it</li>
            <li> WOW.....</li>
            <li> IAM JUST 29YRS OLD AND DONT HAVE WRINKLES</li>
            <li> Applied frequently, the acne marks do disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Combine</li>
            <li> -it is vitamin e oil mixed with olive oil-who knows how much vitamin e</li>
            <li> Something to keep in mind, though, if you&#x27;re planning to apply it somewhere sensitive.</li>
            <li> I use them in all of my herbal concoctions, natural hair products and homemade family recipes.</li>
            <li> I use cloth diapers, and so far this oil has not interfered with absorbency, but keep in mind that I&#x27;m not gobbing it on.  </li>
            <li> (100% Natural Vitamin E Oil)</li>
            <li> I bought this in an attempt to find a natural solution for my hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> The product is great but it quite thick so the dropper is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> so i can apply it more evenly; by itself it&#x27;s quite thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> My only thing with this is that after doing my research true vitamin e oil is much THICKER and has more color than this product which makes me believe there are some artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am sure I made the right choice over other products, expensive and many other chemicals included.  </li>
            <li> I unwisely popped a zit on my chin that left a HUGE dark mark.</li>
            <li> so I searched high and low not wanting to run out of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Now Foods E-oil for some time now on my toenails because they were starting to develop lines, and were not growing as quickly as they used to (due to nerve injury and hormone imbalance)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find real pure natural vitamin E these days.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, and so much easier than trying to cut open and squeeze out those little capsules!</li>
            <li> but I have had to stop using it because I somehow developed a soy allergy and am trying to avoid soy as much as possible.</li>
            <li> I went and purchased Jason brand vitamin e oil from whole foods after I used all of this oil, and there was absolutely no smell</li>
            <li> It has this listed on the label:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: 100% Natural Vitamin E oil (as d-alpha tocopherol from vegetable oil) and extra virgin olive oil.  </li>
            <li> and I barely have any hyper-pigmentation anymore</li>
            <li> I thought this was pure vitamin E , but there are other ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the color I was expecting, makes me wonder how pure it is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that it has olive oil mixed in; it helps thin the super-thick vitamin E oil, making it easier to apply. :)</li>
            <li> The first bottle that I had from you guys that was a little older was vitamin e oil that was darkly colored and sticky.</li>
            <li> It makes my legs soft all day long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old woman with lots of acne scars and chronically dry skin.</li>
            <li> I did my research and found out that tocopherol is a high level of vitimin e and is and it is not watered down with olive oil</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s neither bad, nor good for</li>
            <li> The oil is not too heavy and it adds just the right amount of vitamin to my other oils that I mix together.</li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased but it is soon to shout &amp;#34;success&amp;#34; but the skin is feeling smoother and less red or angry looking.  </li>
            <li> Please remember that this is a true oil so its very thick in consistency and leaves marks on clothes if it doesn&#x27;t dry properly.</li>
            <li> I weigh the negative and positive reviews before I purchase a product then make a decision to buy.</li>
            <li> So much better than mederma or the other over the counter products with questionable fillers.</li>
            <li> Too bad because it was amazing quality for the price.</li>
            <li> but I have to say although it is pricey for the size, it works well and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Mine was near my collar bone so after cleaning it off, and applying antibiotic cream for a few days, the rash cleared up.</li>
            <li> I use it for minor cuts, rashes, and irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip biter, and this oil is just bitter enough to keep me from licking my lips.  </li>
            <li> This one is thick and seems to really get the job done.  </li>
            <li> though I&#x27;m not certain, I&#x27;ve been using  for several weeks and &amp;#34;like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So if you want only vitamin e then don&#x27;t buy this because it&#x27;s not purely that.</li>
            <li> Usually, I will get a new breakout within two days of using a product that doesn&#x27;t suit my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the remaining oil on dry areas of my body skin instead.</li>
            <li> I have been adding this vitamin E-oil in a moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It comes in a big, green bottle and you&#x27;ll have to poke each pill with a needle for topical usage, or take them interally, or both.</li>
            <li> High quality, thick oil.  </li>
            <li> Very  thick very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I found another company who sells 4oz bottle (The Vitamin Lady at Middle Earth) but clearly its not the same its thin and gold in color and vs the amber colored one I got from this company.</li>
            <li> i purchased the second bottle from you guys, my mom remarked on the loss of the dark amber color.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the 100% natural as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> I received the Now Foods E-Oil 32,000IU damaged (the stopper was loose and some of the oil leaked out in transit)</li>
            <li> i see slight changes in my scars on my back</li>
            <li> This is very thick and sticky, almost like honey, but it is very soothing to the lips, elbows, dry spots, etc.</li>
            <li> When we receive a product that we are not familiar with, especially when it is a low-price product, we muscle-test on it to determine the value to our bodies.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle were bigger, but this little one has lasted two months and counting.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, much thicker than castor oil.</li>
            <li> So it is not pure vitamin e oil</li>
            <li> I have used it only few times, but would like the other prospective buyers to know that you cannot wear it under your make-up and</li>
            <li> I use a tab bit all over my face every single night to help prevent wrinkles and it makes my skin glow when I wake up!!</li>
            <li> Applying this every night and day has closed all open cuts and healed missing skin!</li>
            <li> Small amount mixed with a leave in conditioner works</li>
            <li> Used this in conjunction with CVS E cream (thank you other amazon reviewer for all your research into the CVS E Cream) during my pregnancy for stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> This item I bought because of vaginal dryness due to menopause.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this items she uses it for her skin for stretch marks and other skin issues.</li>
            <li> I got this oil about 2 months ago to help the healing of a heart transplant scar as well as some other scars I had received during hospitalization.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail the other day and have been using it every day.</li>
            <li> have been mixing it with other oils to make an eye cream...</li>
            <li> All of the other products I surveyed had a lot of fillers (other oils).</li>
            <li> It is oil and such is hard to wash out of clothing that you care about.  </li>
            <li> Because of the thickness it is hard to get the same size drop each time.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, and feels very heavy and greasy when you first put it on; however, after a bit it does soak in, and leaves little to no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots.</li>
            <li> (I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DARK CIRCLES)MY EYE AREA</li>
            <li> I did keep it in the dark cabinet as the instructions said.</li>
            <li> as thick and dark color admit used to be, it is obviously diluted.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rather thick and you can actually smell the vitamin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s yellow and quite thick.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL FEEL A LITTLE DISCOMFORT,BUT OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> How runny the product was and how it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the previous bottle.</li>
            <li> is dark yellow almost orange color, very thick</li>
            <li> The oil is very heavy and thick, but it absorbs relatively well, and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I use a drop on my children&#x27;s bums when they start to get a little diaper irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Vitamin E oil from different sellers and have hard a difficult time finding one that is not mixed with another oil.</li>
            <li> It removes hyperpigmentation and scars in weeks, if used everyday, morning and evening.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be  too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this a few times and it works well.</li>
            <li> Just one drop will spread and smear across a few squares inches of skin.  </li>
            <li> I mix in in coconut oil and use it on my face everyday</li>
            <li> and this is just over a few months.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to spread it around.</li>
            <li> had a pretty bad bruise/ scar under my eye.</li>
            <li> The way I use it is as a tub soak, add a few drops with small amount of baby oil and soak in tub for twenty minutes.</li>
            <li> so I was not sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I had experience with this product in the past and needed to buy again.</li>
            <li> She had 2 total knee replacement last year that left her with 2 nasty looking scars over her knees.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure how the item is produced.</li>
            <li> But I used this everyday and the scar was almost unnoticeably in a week!</li>
            <li> This is very heavy E-oil.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;3/3/12: Modified rating to 4 star, since it didn&#x27;t cause any negative skin reaction, and thickness is the nature of this oil.</li>
            <li> Its thick, so you dont have to use alot on your face.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s really thick</li>
            <li> I do a thick layer on my face just before bed and by morning</li>
            <li> Too thick for daytime, tho do use it if I want a &amp;#34;beauty day&amp;#34; on a relaxing Sunday, just pampering myself.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is NOT pure Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> Have used it with some other oils during the cold weather when a lot of indoor heating dries out the air, and knuckles.</li>
            <li> I bought another brand previously and it ate through the plastic container leaving an awful, gooey mess down my cabinet onto the tile floor and grout.</li>
            <li> I was a disappointed that it is mixed with olive oil</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel very thick.</li>
            <li> This is very thick.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and sticky so be warned about that.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I asked her what was her secret</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell  and doesn&#x27;t absorb fully into skin</li>
            <li> but sadly it&#x27;s DL...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t speak well of its quality as I ended up having an allergic reaction to the stuff after using it for a week to moisturize surgery scars.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t smell this bad.</li>
            <li> My daughter was having a bad case of eczema.</li>
            <li> Something fundamental has changed in the manufacturing of this product and I am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> It also makes my eye lashes grow like crazy!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the smell is still just awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pure Vitamin E Oil from a natural source is 32,000 IU per ounce.  How is it possible that this is mixed with OLIVE OIL and is still 32,000 IU?  It smelled funny and had a funky after touch that was sort of sticky.  I would not recommend.    I prefer this product:  [[ASIN:B00NH70RBU Vitamin E Oil by GreatFull Skin Is a 100% All Natural and Premium All Purpose Liquid Serum Ointment - Best Emollient to Hydrate and Nourish Face, Skin, Hair, and Nails - Heal Scar Tissue - Beneficial for Baby Skin, Stretch Marks, Sunburn, Anti Aging, Wr...]]</li>
            <li> Nice product. I am giving it a 4 star because it runs out of the drouper very quickly. there is no control. otherwise, its great!</li>
            <li> The oil is not too heavy and it adds just the right amount of vitamin to my other oils that I mix together.</li>
            <li> I mix it with the Vit C oil and it goes on my face easier and smoother, but my face is oily and I worry it will make it more oily</li>
            <li> I use it to help heal scars on my face and moisturize my lips, word of caution- if you seek the sun after use, it remains in your pores and tends to tan real quickly, so use 50+ sport or face sun screen.</li>
            <li> I was a disappointed that it is mixed with olive oil, I guess I should have closely read the ingredients. However it is advertised as E-oil</li>
            <li> great product great company</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago one of our dogs bit our daughter and once she was healed enough that the dr said we could start using Vitamin E I searched for the highest concentration I could find and went with this.  Her scars have since diminished greatly and I&#x27;m about to purchase a second bottle to continue using and hope for continued improvement.</li>
            <li> I thought I had done a thorough check to make sure this was pure E oil. It is not. It&#x27;s mixed with olive oil. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully rich oil.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Its thick, so you dont have to use alot on your face. everytime I use it I only use two drops. Removes scars and hyperpigmentation. Pure vitamin e oil. Dont use this as a moisturizer for the face, it may break you out. Use this product after you are done putting moisturizer on your face. It removes hyperpigmentation and scars in weeks, if used everyday, morning and evening. Gives skin a glowing and smooth look.</li>
            <li> this was  recommended as being really good  for dry skin -especially if airplane travel is a big  part of life.  we  are still  trying it. but it seems to be  too heavy.  a  good way to get vitamin E oil, though, if you need it.</li>
            <li> Love this products. Makes hair feel very thick. But it&#x27;s best used on thick natural African American hair. Small amount mixed with a leave in conditioner works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Also great for body during winter seasons. Small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night time under eye treatment. I love that its a natural form of vit e unlike a lot of other ones that are synthetic. It makes the skin under my eyes soft and really helps with lines and wrinkles. It also makes my eye lashes grow like crazy!! Love this!!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to use on my face at night to help my complexion but because I am prone to breakouts the inevitable happened so I started adding it to my skin care products. That worked wonderfully so I reordered and was dismayed to find that the oil I received the second time around was significantly lighter in color from the amber colored oil I&#x27;d fallen for. It is now a light gold. Also it was much thinner than before. I suspect more olive oil is used now. Too bad because it was amazing quality for the price. Still a quality product but I only wish I would have ordered more the first time around.</li>
            <li> I use this vitamin e oil as a preservative in my lip balms.  I haven&#x27;t taken it orally, I prefer the capsules for that.  I do occasionally rub it around my eyes for added moisture.  Love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> As thick as honey, I believe this is the real deal, this vitamin E oil is the one to get closer to the pure vitamin E, I had used many other brands, but this product I&#x27;d say is more natural vitamin E oil than any other brand I have used, it&#x27;s color is dark yellow almost orange color, very thick I have to dilute it with another type of oil for example jojoba to be able to apply it over my skin this oil leaves my skin velvety soft, I always apply it right before bed time after vitamin C serum. I will buy it again, love it  ;)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece-dog&#x27;s skin problems. Started off great but she quickly turned her nose up to it. Easy to use dropper was nice to drizzle the oil over the food. Might start using it for myself.</li>
            <li> My surgeon recommended vitamin E oil for help with post-surgery scarring. It is very thick, and feels very heavy and greasy when you first put it on; however, after a bit it does soak in, and leaves little to no greasy residue. I have noticed a significant difference in how soft my skin has become in the areas I have been applying it to, and it does seem to be helping with scarring (even some old ones I&#x27;m testing it on). In fact, I was so impressed with the results that I began adding a few drops to my morning/evening facial moisturizing routine just for good measure. This one will definitely be a repeat buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased primarily to help heal scars from surgery.  So far, I am pleased but it is soon to shout &amp;#34;success&amp;#34; but the skin is feeling smoother and less red or angry looking.  I am sure I made the right choice over other products, expensive and many other chemicals included.  This is Vita E oil and that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I use it in my natural hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> In the winter my skin dries out more than usual and I started using one drop of this with my morning face care routine. It has a weird smell  and doesn&#x27;t absorb fully into skin so it leaves a sheen to your face.</li>
            <li> Great deal. The smaller container. Pure oil is wonderful for my scalp. I really like the organic oil. Great deal</li>
            <li> I bought it to even and lighten my skin tone, but didn&#x27;t notice any improvement after one month of use. I had to stop using it since I have combination skin with visible pores on most of my face, and found it to be too thick/oily for my skin even in winter time. I think it&#x27;ll be more suitable for dry skin. I&#x27;ll use the remaining oil on dry areas of my body skin instead. On the good side, it didn&#x27;t cause any negative reactions on my face. So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s neither bad, nor good for me.&lt;br /&gt;3/3/12: Modified rating to 4 star, since it didn&#x27;t cause any negative skin reaction, and thickness is the nature of this oil.</li>
            <li> Great oil. I would definitely purchase again. So far I&#x27;ve been using it for my flax seed hair gel with wonderful results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a 100 percent vitamin E nor does it specify if it&#x27;s d-alpha vitamin e. It is mixed with olive oil and I don&#x27;t even know how diluted it is. Very disappointed. I will update with how effective it is regardless of that fact.</li>
            <li> Very good for my skin. Im doing once a week a &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; with this oil and Bepanthen Diaper(Nappy) Care Ointment 100g and I leave it in my face during all day and the results is FANTASTIC. In the other day my face skin is so soft, looking healthy, as a baby skin. My skin is oily already but the result is a skin oil controlled. i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> arrived in a neat pack with bubble wrap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;applied on blemishes and they do lighten - i combined this with vit C powder though</li>
            <li> I mix this in with my c serum, love it, makes face feel so soft, would reccomend to a friend</li>
            <li> Looks like good quality Vitamin E - the serum I made works wonders, and the vitamin E will last a very long time. I recommend this product - look for d-alpha for good vitamin E</li>
            <li> Great product. It is more viscous than other brands. Ultimately I prefer a looser/ more spreadable product. However, it was great for my intended usage.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I will definitely be purchasing this again!!</li>
            <li> This vitamin E oil is a good product and of course very thick. But to be honest the Jason 45,000 i.u. vitamin E oil is more potency at a better price. This oil would be my choice if I could not get the Jason brand.</li>
            <li> I received the Now Foods E-Oil 32,000IU damaged (the stopper was loose and some of the oil leaked out in transit) but I did order this product from Now Foods before; it lasted some time since I was only using it on my fingernails and feet (it&#x27;s really thick so you do not need to use a whole lot of it), but I have to say although it is pricey for the size, it works well and goes a long way. It took the dryness and lines out of my nails and has made them stronger. It&#x27;s a good combination of soy and olive oil, to be honest, with a little research and practice you can probably learn how to make your own product, and it could probably last you an entire year instead of spending 15.00 on a 1oz bottle that might only last a few months. If you do not have that kind of time on your hands though I suggest giving this particular product a try just keep in mind this is not 100% pure Vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/24/16: I have been using the Now Foods E-oil for some time now on my toenails because they were starting to develop lines, and were not growing as quickly as they used to (due to nerve injury and hormone imbalance), I have to say it has helped the health of my toenails but I have had to stop using it because I somehow developed a soy allergy and am trying to avoid soy as much as possible. Just a heads up for the onlookers, contemplating whether or not they should give this oil a try, if you have a soy allergy I recommend you avoid this product!</li>
            <li> When we receive a product that we are not familiar with, especially when it is a low-price product, we muscle-test on it to determine the value to our bodies. This stuff tested very good. Cheap and good -- my favorite combination :)</li>
            <li> NOT ONE STRETCH MARK! Used this in conjunction with CVS E cream (thank you other amazon reviewer for all your research into the CVS E Cream) during my pregnancy for stretch marks.  CVS E cream uses the synthesized E, while this product is the d-Alpha real E.  I like that this is not soy based, that was important to me while pregnant.  I&#x27;m now starting the combo to see if it works for wrinkles.  Wish they sold this in larger bottles.  I used one bottle every 3 weeks during the later parts of my pregnancy.  Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.  Note:  It is oil and such is hard to wash out of clothing that you care about.  I wore a cami over the cream and then put whatever shirt/dress on over that.</li>
            <li> It works great directly on my daughter&#x27;s skin; however, for this aging adult it left big pimples on my skin so I had to add it by drop form [1 or 2] to my daily lotion routine.  I have had no problems with it this way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is NOT pure Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> The description for this item is very misleading.  It says nothing about olive oil and yet on the product bottle it indicates that it does contain olive oil.  There is no indication as to the percentages of e-oil to the olive oil.</li>
            <li> This is very thick. I use it for making lip balm. Because of the thickness it is hard to get the same size drop each time.</li>
            <li> Mine came in a deep amber color, so I assume it means its good quality. Haven&#x27;t got to use it too much yet, so don&#x27;t have a usage comment.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this oil, it&#x27;s great for homemade skin care. I was suprised, this and the jojoba oil together make an awesome collection.</li>
            <li> As someone else posted, this vitamin e is not as thick and dark color admit used to be, it is obviously diluted.</li>
            <li> Just as described NOW brand always has high quality products, speedy delivery...very happy with my purchase and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> The now brand is a great value in price but not lacking in product a great oil I have been using for body and hair and skin for over a year now and it makes everything softer</li>
            <li> This is great for dry skin. I use it at night as it is too greasy for the daytime. This is wonderful for dry/and or mature skin, and  wrinkles. My face looks more youthful now. Also it is great for prevention of scars.</li>
            <li> I thought this was pure vitamin E , but there are other ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> Nice and deep amber.  Works great.  Does amazing things even noticeable overnight in some places!  I combined it with Mederma for a scar on my belly.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the D- alpha form but sadly it&#x27;s DL... So, I&#x27;ll use this up and buy a pure one. The plus side of this - SMELLS LIKE PUMPKIN!!!</li>
            <li> I bought another brand previously and it ate through the plastic container leaving an awful, gooey mess down my cabinet onto the tile floor and grout. Have used it with some other oils during the cold weather when a lot of indoor heating dries out the air, and knuckles. It works great.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I weigh the negative and positive reviews before I purchase a product then make a decision to buy. This item I bought because of vaginal dryness due to menopause. I was running out of choices and did not want to result to hormones in any way. So through my research I saw that vitamin does give some relief. It has helped me tremendously. I highly recommend any that need it for this reason to give it a try! It has brought me much need relief and comfort. The way I use it is as a tub soak, add a few drops with small amount of baby oil and soak in tub for twenty minutes. Soak do not apply directly or rub the area...just soak pat yourself dry...and you will see the difference in comfort.</li>
            <li> i have recently started using 2 drops of the oil on my face every night, and results could be seen within a day of use. my face has never been clearer or brighter. i&#x27;ve even stopped using store bought moisturisers and cleansers on my face. i&#x27;m currently thinking of mixing this with some argan oil so i can apply it more evenly; by itself it&#x27;s quite thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> Great product for moisturizing your skin...especially for women of a certain age!</li>
            <li> This E oil is based on natural oil. Everything else was synthetics based.</li>
            <li> The oil is great, the dropper is messy. That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Great product 1 bottle lasts me a long time</li>
            <li> High quality, thick oil.  The oil arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I mix this with cocoa butter and it really gives my legs a great feeling! It makes my legs soft all day long!</li>
            <li> I like this e-oil  1oz 32,000 ui I did my research and found out that tocopherol is a high level of vitimin e and is and it is not watered down with olive oil it&#x27;s rather thick and you can actually smell the vitamin. I love it to use on my face and areas wear I have dark spots. I like it so much that I wished they had it in a larger bottle ,but they dont so I searched high and low not wanting to run out of it.I found another company who sells 4oz bottle (The Vitamin Lady at Middle Earth) but clearly its not the same its thin and gold in color and vs the amber colored one I got from this company.Also it  dose not say on the lable how many iu&#x27;s it is so im sending it back. It was $16.00 for 4 oz good price but Im sending it back both of them. So im back at square one which is 1oz for $7.00 ill just buy 4 bottles and be happy !</li>
            <li> Wished that description, reviews, and answers to questions would have been accurate.  This vit e oil is from soy. Soy is not listed anywhere.  I am allergic to soy protein and would not have ordered had I known. Lowest list of ingredients of all I looked at before buying.</li>
            <li> I had very large pores on my skin. I had tried various products to cure pores but nothing really worked be it Lancome  genifique. Then I came across this product and within couple months my skin has cleared out. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! You are getting pure oil and your skin will thank you when you use it! I do a thick layer on my face just before bed and by morning, my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> too much olive oil in it.</li>
            <li> I do like it. I think it did it&#x27;s job! It&#x27;s true vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Good quality and a good value. Worked perfectly for making my own foundation powder.</li>
            <li> Very  thick very moisturizing! work wonders! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This vitamin E oil is natural (d alpha tocopherol acetate) and pure.  I got it to assist in wound healing post surgery, and am pleased to have found this excellent product.</li>
            <li> Ive just been using this for a week on some of my acne scars and acne that is currently in the process of healing and I have to say that the difference is already noticable! When used on acne that is healing, the acne doesn&#x27;t even leave a scar. Its like nothing was ever there!!! There is not even any pigmentation. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> WOW.....FIRST LET ME TELL YOU THAT I HAVE USED AND SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON HIGH END EYE SERUMS/CREAMS AND NONE COMPARE TO THIS.I JUST RECIVED THIS PRODUCT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND APPLIED A ABOUT 1 DROP ON EACH EYE LAST NIGHT AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT MY EYES LOOK GREAT (I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DARK CIRCLES)MY EYE AREA LOOKS AWESOME THAT I DIDNT HAVE TO PILE UP CONCEALER I CAN JUST IMAGINE RESULTS WITH REGULAR USE.THE ONLY THING IS THAT TONIGHT I WILL APPLY IT RIGHT BEFORE BEDTIME WHEN IAM READY TO GO TO SLEEP COUSE IF THIS GETS INTO YOUR EYES YOU WILL FEEL A LITTLE DISCOMFORT,BUT OTHER THAN THAT I LOVE IT :)...IAM JUST 29YRS OLD AND DONT HAVE WRINKLES YET ANYWHERE BUT I KNOW THIS VIT E WILL KEEP THEM AWAY  (ATLEAST FOR A WHILE LONGER:)..)I WILL NEVER SPEND MONEY ON HIGH END EYE CREAMS AGAIN..ALSO I ORDERED VIT K SERUM TO COMBINE THIS WITH HOPEFULLY MY DARK CIRCLES WILL GO AWAY FOR GOOD!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use a tab bit all over my face every single night to help prevent wrinkles and it makes my skin glow when I wake up!! NO breakouts either (and I have oily skin too)!! This is a must for great skin! It&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; but I use this along with a half tsp of my own homemade essential oil face recipe I make and blends perfectly!</li>
            <li> I add this stuff to my eye cream, my lips, and mix it in with my body lotion- it is awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> very smelly.  i dont like perfumed products but this could really use some.  does not apply smoothly.  i tried combining it w/my nite time moisturizer but the smell is still just awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the glorious reviews. I personally have never used any Vit E oil before so I was not sure what to expect. It is very thick, much thicker than castor oil. It is not easy to spread it around. It is very greasy too. I put it on my face and realized that it is going to spoil my pillow covers. It also spreads to the hair and makes the hair greasy. I am yet to see if it works coz it is too soon to comment on the results coz I have used it only few times, but would like the other prospective buyers to know that you cannot wear it under your make-up and in fact not to the bed too. Not sure what would be a good time to put it on.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product. I use it for homemade shea butter and face creams and I really like it. I liked the dropper it makes it so easy to add into my creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old woman with lots of acne scars and chronically dry skin. Adding the Vitamin E oil to my nightly moisturizer has made a WORLD of difference. Scars, hyperpigmentation, and enlarged pores are all fading, and my skin has never been so soft and smooth. The oil is very heavy and thick, but it absorbs relatively well, and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase! Delivery was also prompt, and the packaging was excellent.</li>
            <li> I think this may be inherent of vitamin E oil though I&#x27;m not certain, I&#x27;ve been using  for several weeks and &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; it but haven&#x27;t seen any results that make me love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep looking for another option.</li>
            <li> It got rancid pretty quick, and this is not cheap. I did keep it in the dark cabinet as the instructions said.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff regularly. I have seen a very noticeable improvement on some stretch marks I have. (not from pregnancy)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Vitamin E oil from different sellers and have hard a difficult time finding one that is not mixed with another oil. This product seems to fit the description and I am happy with it. I wish they had a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived on time and in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve used it almost for all my hair and body moisturizing needs.</li>
            <li> This is a great E oil.  I am buying lots of Now brand vitamins.  I read the reviews on this product and think buying the better E oil is worth the money especially for putting it on the face.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product. I am currently using it in my hair care and skin care regimen. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the color I was expecting, makes me wonder how pure it is.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Applied frequently, the acne marks do disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Combine using this with the Tea Tree Oil can almost solve the acne problem totally.</li>
            <li> This was a beautiful Amber color and it works well on healing the skin quickly.  I&#x27;ve used it on sunburns, scars, and acne marks it seems to speed healing up nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my stretch marks to see if it would help them and so far absolutely no difference though I haven&#x27;t used it longer than a week, it doesn&#x27;t claim to help with that so whatever. It does make my skin very soft so that&#x27;s a plus! I mixed it with a bottle of lotion and it is very hydrating and lasts all day. It is very thick and sticky so be warned about that. Also it has OLIVE OIL in the ingredients too. So it is not pure vitamin e oil-it is vitamin e oil mixed with olive oil-who knows how much vitamin e there actually is in it? So if you want only vitamin e then don&#x27;t buy this because it&#x27;s not purely that. &amp; that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars because though it does make my skin soft the seller should have made that very clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped Vit E oil around.  Have some that don&#x27;t quite do it for me.  This one is thick and seems to really get the job done.  Love it for my toes and fingernails, and even the callouses that we all have.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Great consistency and easily absorbed. I have acne prone skin and it is helping clear my scars. No breakouts since I started using it. Usually, I will get a new breakout within two days of using a product that doesn&#x27;t suit my skin. My skin feels very nice to touch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t speak well of its quality as I ended up having an allergic reaction to the stuff after using it for a week to moisturize surgery scars. I don&#x27;t know if this is a defect of the product or just the nature of my chemistry. Something to keep in mind, though, if you&#x27;re planning to apply it somewhere sensitive. Mine was near my collar bone so after cleaning it off, and applying antibiotic cream for a few days, the rash cleared up.</li>
            <li> Works great on scars!!!!! Will definitely buy again like soon!!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved it for mixing with my essential oils for lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous moisturizer. I don&#x27;t mind that it has olive oil mixed in; it helps thin the super-thick vitamin E oil, making it easier to apply. :)</li>
            <li> I have been adding this vitamin E-oil in a moisturizer for dry skin. The product is great but it quite thick so the dropper is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> This product is fine if you don&#x27;t have an alternative, the eyedropper is a very helpful feature.  However, the smell is incredibly strong.  I was using for my pregnancy baby bump, and the smell would make me nauseous every time.  I went and purchased Jason brand vitamin e oil from whole foods after I used all of this oil, and there was absolutely no smell so I would recommend the Jason brand over this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this a few times and it works well. My only thing with this is that after doing my research true vitamin e oil is much THICKER and has more color than this product which makes me believe there are some artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair, because I mix it with other products I don&#x27;t use much at a time so the size is just right.</li>
            <li> I had experience with this product in the past and needed to buy again. It helps my natural oils stay fresh and my skin toned if i get a hand cut, and it helped my skin blemishes over the years.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my cuts on my fingers, especially around my nails. I have very dry skin around my cuticles and my skin rips easily. Applying this every night and day has closed all open cuts and healed missing skin! Miracle product!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this items she uses it for her skin for stretch marks and other skin issues. Works as needed. I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find real pure natural vitamin E these days. This is real. I use it in my mixes because I am allergic to all over the counter skin products.</li>
            <li> Will def buy again. Exactly what I needed for my beauty products.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect to be. To be fair, I don&#x27;t have a huge base for comparison but It works really well for what I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery great product</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using E-Oil I have seen some changes in my skin, my mom&#x27;s face has always looked clear and free of blemishes I asked her what was her secret she said that she used E-Oil along with drinking plenty of water and a good diet, so I rushed and ordered me my first bottle, since then with the help of my daily vitamins I have that clear skin like my mom&#x27;s, she even complemented me on how nice my face has cleared up. Yes I would recommend E-Oil #32,000IU Alpha 1oz.</li>
            <li> This is my first time in using this oil for both hair and skin I&#x27;m looking forward to using it in different ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this product.  I use it quite a bit if my homemade lotions.  I will order more!</li>
            <li> My name is Michelle Oyeka and I have been purchasing your now products for over 5 years now. I use them in all of my herbal concoctions, natural hair products and homemade family recipes. I buy your products because I know I&#x27;m getting the highest quality for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I purchased some vitamin E oil from you guys for my Mom. She had 2 total knee replacement last year that left her with 2 nasty looking scars over her knees. The first bottle that I had from you guys that was a little older was vitamin e oil that was darkly colored and sticky. i rubbed it on her knees and her scars began to fade fast. It was amazing. So much better than mederma or the other over the counter products with questionable fillers. It worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i purchased the second bottle from you guys, my mom remarked on the loss of the dark amber color. How runny the product was and how it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the previous bottle. Something fundamental has changed in the manufacturing of this product and I am quite disappointed. I wish to continue purchasing from you store in the future however I am most concerned about your quality. If this has happened to my favorite vitamin e oil, how can I trust the integrity of your other products. I hope that you guys are able to resolve any quality issues you are having. Or if someone can take the time to explain what has happened to the vitamin e oil product I would greatly appreciate that. Thank You.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, and so much easier than trying to cut open and squeeze out those little capsules!</li>
            <li> I add it to my lotion and my hair cream and my blemishes are fading great product. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  and would recommend it to others looking for Vit E oil.</li>
            <li> The color was right, NOT clear, true vit. E isn&#x27;t clear, nice thick consistency. Works great as an extra moisturizer for my wrinkles at night. Can tell it&#x27;s really helping by morning. Too thick for daytime, tho do use it if I want a &amp;#34;beauty day&amp;#34; on a relaxing Sunday, just pampering myself.</li>
            <li> I got this oil about 2 months ago to help the healing of a heart transplant scar as well as some other scars I had received during hospitalization. After using a few drops of this Vitamin E oil almost every day, my scars look great. I massage it in well, using the techniques suggested for scar therapy. They feel soft and are diminishing quickly. I am ordering a 2nd bottle today. I wish the bottle were bigger, but this little one has lasted two months and counting.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my skin and I have to admit that I definitely saw results.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is good quality oil. It smells a bit like diluted olive and vegetable oil, but it is condensed to a brownish, oily liquid that is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to put this on a couple cuts and see how it helps them heal.</li>
            <li> had a pretty bad bruise/ scar under my eye. I used this product because I had heard good things about Vit E and this has cleared up the scar over the course of 2 weeks and the scar is looking much better and is hardly noticeable anymore.</li>
            <li> This is very heavy E-oil.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail the other day and have been using it every day. I love it. Been trying to find a non synthetic vitamin E oil. This has nice consistency and isn&#x27;t super sticky like others I have bought. I will buy again after I run out.</li>
            <li> The most pure form of Vitamin E I&#x27;ve used since childhood. It is truly effective and I will be reordering soon. Thank you for a wonderful product :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about 2-3 weeks now and I can really see a difference in my skin.  I put it on every night before my moisturizer.  In the morning my skin is super soft! It also has a glow. I love it!</li>
            <li> I use it on surgical scars and it really helps fade them</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the good reviews, however, when I received the bottle and I have doubt about the label. It really doesn&#x27;t tell you much and it seems like a home made label. So I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the 100% natural as it&#x27;s advertised. I could print out the same label from my printer.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering this product again, it works so well on my skin. Was looking for an all natural Vitamin E and this is it! I use it on my face at night, and I love it within days the appearance of my skin has changed, it has a glowing look to it even first thing in the morning. I will definitely keep using this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but the smell is unbearable for me.  I wish in the future they do something so it doesn&#x27;t smell this bad.</li>
            <li> good for my dog&#x27;s nose and dry skin but not for healing burns</li>
            <li> I use this topically on my and my kids&#x27; skin.  I use it for minor cuts, rashes, and irritated skin.  I mixed it with some coconut oil and lavendar EO for use on ezcema.  I use a drop on my children&#x27;s bums when they start to get a little diaper irritation.  I use cloth diapers, and so far this oil has not interfered with absorbency, but keep in mind that I&#x27;m not gobbing it on.  Just one drop will spread and smear across a few squares inches of skin.  I put one drop on my lips when they&#x27;re chapped.  I&#x27;m a lip biter, and this oil is just bitter enough to keep me from licking my lips.  It&#x27;s not bad, just not... delicious.  Has staying power.  The dropper works well.  Been using it for quite a while and I&#x27;ve only gone through maybe 1/6 to 1/5 of the bottle.  I use multiple drops per day.  I&#x27;ve made up jars of homemade lotion with shea butter, coconut oil, almond oil, etc, and I put a whole dropperful of this E in also.  I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing another to keep upstairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice: This is not 100% vitamine E oil.  It has this listed on the label:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: 100% Natural Vitamin E oil (as d-alpha tocopherol from vegetable oil) and extra virgin olive oil.  Not a deal breaker, since I often mix it with a drop of lotion or oil in my palm anyway.  I&#x27;m sure this makes it go farther.  Just wanted to put it out there since I didn&#x27;t remember reading that on the product description.  I&#x27;m glad it still is all-natural though.</li>
            <li> I just received my package about four days ago which is why I gave it four stars but so far so good i see slight changes in my scars on my back so we&#x27;ll see what i&#x27;m looking like after about a month or more.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E is wonderful for the skin, so I try to use it every day. It restores the skin to a more youthful state and does wonders against scars.&lt;br /&gt;I have been mixing it with other oils to make an eye cream... It sure is doing the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(bought a concentrated Vitamin E from Now Foods)</li>
            <li> This is a great multipurpose oil. I use about a teaspoon of it in my hair and body butters. I also used it at a lubricant when stretching my earring hole.  It&#x27;s a great healing oil.</li>
            <li> My daughter was having a bad case of eczema. Though we tried oatmeal baths and aveeno eczema lotion, only this oil cleared out her skin and healed it. Ahhh peace of mind! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it was 100% pure, natural, undiluted, the real deal. It&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label reads &amp;#34;Tocopherol (100% Natural Vitamin E Oil) (soy) and Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil (Extra Virgin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I later discovered, thanks to researching for hours, that you need to be sure which type of tocopherol it is, and notice how this one doesn&#x27;t say. D-Apha Tocopherol is the authentic, pure oil. DL is not. The L makes all the difference. You want D PURE STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. Go find the brand Nature&#x27;s Bounty 100% Natural E-400iu Pure d-Alpha 120 softgels. It comes in a big, green bottle and you&#x27;ll have to poke each pill with a needle for topical usage, or take them interally, or both. The bottle is about $20 USD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, true vitamin E is not clear. It&#x27;s yellow and quite thick.</li>
            <li> Now foods brand is ok but I am not sure how the item is produced.</li>
            <li> This is very thick and sticky, almost like honey, but it is very soothing to the lips, elbows, dry spots, etc. I use this for spots like that, and grapeseed oil for larger areas.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift. On doctor&#x27;s recommendation to use Vit E on her toes, I purchased this product for a friend because it had the best concentration of Vit E in it. All of the other products I surveyed had a lot of fillers (other oils). She has been using it for 2 months and is very pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil to treat the 2nd degree burn marks I suffered on my forearm and upper leg.  For some reason, I only used this product on my arm and not the leg.  I used it from January until August and have seen a significant decrease in the visibility of my burn marks. They are still there but the difference before and after is pretty remarkable.  In comparison, the product I used on my leg (different version of vitamin e) did not produce any results.  Please remember that this is a true oil so its very thick in consistency and leaves marks on clothes if it doesn&#x27;t dry properly.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly for my project</li>
            <li> I bought this in an attempt to find a natural solution for my hyper-pigmentation. I mix in in coconut oil and use it on my face everyday and I barely have any hyper-pigmentation anymore and this is just over a few months. If I have a fresh scar, I&#x27;ll use the vitamin E directly on the spot, not mixed with coconut oil. I unwisely popped a zit on my chin that left a HUGE dark mark. It looked like a mole. But I used this everyday and the scar was almost unnoticeably in a week!</li>
            <li> This oil has a very thick consistency and it&#x27;s great for homemade skin recipes and it&#x27;s amazing for dry skin.... LOVE IT</li>
