    <ol>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s probably the best baby sunscreen we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is great!  </li>
            <li>The company owner is a real nice guy too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my face, under makeup, and been happy with the protection.  </li>
            <li>We are always on the lookout for a great sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals.</li>
            <li>I would like to comment on its great efficacy.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, this is good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Good combination of a good EWG score and price.</li>
            <li>The spray works awesome for every day, quick coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen covers well, absorbs nicely, smells great, and most importantly seems to do a great job at preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li>Some nut allergy sufferers are told to not use ANY products with nut oils of any kind.  </li>
            <li>Since I had it handy, I also used it on my own face before spending the day boating.  </li>
            <li>It even smells nice.</li>
            <li>This products is just too greasy to accomplish that - it washes off very easily by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was totally fine with this sunscreen though and it seemed to have good coverage and protection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s \\&quot;certified 100% natural,\\&quot; and if you read the ingredient list you&#x27;ll be impressed by all the natural things it contains.</li>
            <li>This is a good sunscreen, full of all kinds of botanical ingredients and antioxidants.</li>
            <li>I tried shaking the tube and massaging it to mix it up better, but it did not help.  </li>
            <li>For me, I would prefer a slightly better smelling product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The annual beach trip was posing a problem as most sunblocks get under the skin rather than stay on the surface.</li>
            <li>you get the more you need these lotions.</li>
            <li>than that, this is the most perfectest sunscreen ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great option for a natural sunscreen if the price isn&#x27;t out of your range.</li>
            <li>was happy to receive the MelanSol Natural Baby Sunscreen via the vine</li>
            <li>It says right on the bottle that the sunscreen is water resistant for 40 mintues, which is a nice amount of time.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t rub into the skin easily and can leave a whitish residue.  </li>
            <li>They are a very worthy group.</li>
            <li>because it is advertised as chemical free, it is easy to apply, and it leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sunscreen really held its own when my kids where in the pool.</li>
            <li>It is BPA, phthalate, gluten, and paraben free.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s been a few decades since I was or had a baby, I still prefer gentle sunscreens free of chemical contamination for my own skin, so I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is not clumpy like some mineral sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It has a light tint</li>
            <li>When I first used the MelanSol Sunscreen for Baby, I noticed that the sunscreen is very light and not overly creamy.</li>
            <li>It scores a 2 on EWGs Skin Deep website for safe cosmetics (lower is better!).</li>
            <li>The pool will soon be warm enough to give this better feedback.</li>
            <li>Two family members have fought skin cancer so the rest of the family value effective sunscreens and those of us with sensitive skin need strong, yet mild, ones.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen isn&#x27;t greasy, smells pleasant, and doesn&#x27;t leave my kids&#x27; faces white after.  </li>
            <li>Of course you want your baby&#x27;s sensitive skin protected and many of us would prefer to know what is in the suncreen while we do that!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am extremely fair, so I don&#x27;t need to worry about the ashy-appearance of titanium dioxide on my skin because I&#x27;m so white anyway.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this MelanSol on the rest of my body, and stick to my tried and true Neutrogena for my face.</li>
            <li>the original greasy feeling lotion turns into an absorbed, hydrated skin that is UVA/UVB protected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ergo, super well-blended products to me address the issue</li>
            <li>/&gt;- it is listed for ages 6 months and older so most in the family can use it</li>
            <li>A cream is much better than a spray as a new baby can&#x27;t be told to hold its breath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy to the point of being oily, so it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I now know that this product will be great for little babies.</li>
            <li>It did a good job of protecting our kids faces and they only got a little color after spending a good part of the day in the sun.</li>
            <li>I love the all natural ingredients in MelanSol Sunscreen along with the SPF 30 protection.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great luck with Blue Lizard Sensitive and it is substantially cheaper.</li>
            <li>Will not get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell that I don&#x27;t love, but almost all sunscreens do and this one doesn&#x27;t last after it&#x27;s been on your skin for a while.</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural sunscreens over the years with varying results and have never come across one where the odor affected me</li>
            <li>We have tried so many different baby sunscreens, searching for something safe for our whole family that also works well.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the right choice.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say that deserves a positive review!</li>
            <li>Goes on terrific, easy to spread, good coverage, no ghastly/ghostly white streaks</li>
            <li>The texture of the product is creamy and light enough for easy application.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to check is whether or not the product actually provided adequate protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>but I found it to actually rub in quite nicely and without too much of that chalk</li>
            <li>It was a bit strong for me, but I have an excessively sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>It rubs in VERY easily for a mineral based sunscreen, which is so important with squirmy little children.</li>
            <li>Be aware.</li>
            <li>First, the cost is rather prohibitive.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s possible to micro-pulverize these minerals for greater invisibility and 2)</li>
            <li>I found several recommendations for this product as a safe infant sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost when I consider any sunscreen I go to the Environmental Work Group website.</li>
            <li>Lower is better and that is in the low risk group.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t see that white streaking which is a  problem with many titanium dioxide sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice product that is all natural.  </li>
            <li>Also a physical block, it has a less-oily, more viscous texture that really seems to catch and hold onto skin all day.</li>
            <li>Naturally, my wife tried it out on herself under direct exposure to our bright Florida skies without issue prior to applying it to the child.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, it was just to rub it on my skin and it seemed very greasy.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased that the tan colored sunscreen disappeared into my skin in a few minutes and lost the original greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Mine arrived with the formula separated, such that there was clear  &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; that came out separate from the &amp;#34;cream &amp;#34; which seemed less than ideal.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>her skin may not be ready to handle.</li>
            <li>As a mother that is constantly, looking for safe and natural products, this product receives my approval.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely fair, blonde hair, blue eyed boy that has been out for up to 5 hours in direct sunlight with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>They are both really great products, especially compared to other natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s free of all the petro-chemicals that we all want to keep off our babies, it prevents sunburn, is gentle on skin, and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However I did notice sweet almond oil low on the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>the older</li>
            <li>It has very good lasting ability; even when I washed it off I could still smell it; bad for me but an indicator that it is not going to dissolve easily in water.</li>
            <li>a light beige tint won&#x27;t work any better on darker skin than white will (and it will be too dark on persons such as me).  </li>
            <li>I now feel secure in knowing that I am protecting her skin without hurting her with toxins and other ingredients</li>
            <li>More and more information comes out everyday about the dangers of the sun and the importance of sunscreen, but I was never sure what brand new baby skin could handle.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have always used baby products as a result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin as does my daughter, so</li>
            <li>there is no offensive smell, and the slight smell at first dissipates quickly as it is absorbed</li>
            <li>However, since I had it and don&#x27;t have babies, I figured I&#x27;d try it in the hot African sun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, adults with sensitive skin should consider using this baby product for themselves!</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t developed even the slightest redness!  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen is such an important part of skincare, especially for young kids who spend a lot of time outdoors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I admittedly haven&#x27;t been out I the sun with this on yet (again, not much sun yet to be had), the fact that a physical block sits on top ofthe skin (as opposed to chemical sunscreens whih must absorb into the skin - that&#x27;s why the wait-15-minutes-after-applying-before-exposure-rule) - and that it is only effective so long as it is in place - leads me to believe this will be less effective than other brands over a long period of time (because it does not stay on that</li>
            <li>This item fits the bill for health conscious new mothers.</li>
            <li>But if you have a baby, you know that you also want something that rubs on quickly and smoothly for those squirmy bodies who don&#x27;t sit still and something that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of unhealthy added</li>
            <li>so it spreads easily, and it kept my face from getting burned, even when I&#x27;ve been outside several hours in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>Our daughter has very sensitive skin and has broken out in hives over the most gentle products.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so close to the 3oz carry on TSA requirement, I would have liked a bottle a little bit smaller to carry on or bigger since I have to check it anyway.</li>
            <li>I love that this is 100% natural especially when I am thinking about putting it on my little ones.</li>
            <li>Since, my kids have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>We are a family of five who spends a considerable amount of time at the beach during the summer months.  </li>
            <li>We spend a lot of time outside in the spring and summer months and are very cautious about our sun exposure.</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>there are countless,creams, gels, screens, lotions,aloe etc.so for a change I bought this a baby sunscreeen, I figure it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, and that&#x27;s what I got; I crossed over the bridge,</li>
            <li>I wear sunscreen every day under my makeup and it takes me a while to blend this into my natural skin color (I&#x27;m caucasian.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>We have used this sunscreen on our 10 month old a couple of times now without even a hint of skin</li>
            <li>I have used this on my one year old granddaughter and on myself and prolonged exposure to the odor makes me feel nauseous.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think the biggest plus of this product is that it is advertised as natural.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is 100% natural and I am not applying toxins to her skin.  </li>
            <li>This has a good consistency; not too runny yet not too difficult to rub in.</li>
            <li>This allowed me to easily rub the sunscreen into my kid&#x27;s skin without having to rub and rub excessively.</li>
            <li>MelanSol has a pleasant scent, absorbs into the skin without much trouble, and is slightly tinted to help avoid a the white residue.  </li>
            <li>It has a slightly odd scent - mild, but noticeable.</li>
            <li>It did the trick for me as well, probably better than a lot of regular brand sunscreens that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The price is way to high for me to use regularly.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen is easy to rub into your child&#x27;s skin, not being overly oily or thick.  </li>
            <li>It provides broad spectrum protection (UVA and UVB).  </li>
            <li>There are other products that score better and cost the same of less.  </li>
            <li>No pink cheeks on my son since we opened this bottle</li>
            <li>Yet while this is a lot, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a tube of sunscreen that will last all summer long and do the job better than any of the competitors.</li>
            <li>I only use natural / mineral sunscreen for my kids and this product meets our needs well.</li>
            <li>On several occasions that I used this sunscreen on my 6 year old son, it seemed to protect him from sunburns.  </li>
            <li>and it is a 3.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: not overly strong nor terribly offensive; but also not something I would wear because it smells good</li>
            <li>At around twenty bucks, it&#x27;s pretty comparable to my previous go-to for the kids, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Second, when I first opened the tube of sunscreen, the product that came out was extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in New York and am only just starting to require sunscreen, so I will need to update later on its efficacy in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My little girls keeps sneaking it on because she likes it so much!</li>
            <li>Because of the natural oils involved I would suggest storing in your refrigerator for long term use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s slightly oily texture - I tried to remix the oil wih the cream in my hand before applying the product without much success:  the cream sort of slipped around on the oil, so I had to rub pretty hard to get it worked into my skin, which is not something I like to do on my face, for instance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: I won&#x27;t buy this due to the high price and the EWG score.  </li>

            <li> I wanted to be able to check is whether or not the product actually provided adequate protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> but I found it to actually rub in quite nicely and without too much of that chalk</li>
            <li> It was a bit strong for me, but I have an excessively sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> It rubs in VERY easily for a mineral based sunscreen, which is so important with squirmy little children.</li>
            <li> Be aware.</li>
            <li> First, the cost is rather prohibitive.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s possible to micro-pulverize these minerals for greater invisibility and 2)</li>
            <li> I found several recommendations for this product as a safe infant sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> First and foremost when I consider any sunscreen I go to the Environmental Work Group website.</li>
            <li> Lower is better and that is in the low risk group.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t see that white streaking which is a  problem with many titanium dioxide sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice product that is all natural.  </li>
            <li> Also a physical block, it has a less-oily, more viscous texture that really seems to catch and hold onto skin all day.</li>
            <li> Naturally, my wife tried it out on herself under direct exposure to our bright Florida skies without issue prior to applying it to the child.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, it was just to rub it on my skin and it seemed very greasy.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased that the tan colored sunscreen disappeared into my skin in a few minutes and lost the original greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Mine arrived with the formula separated, such that there was clear  &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; that came out separate from the &amp;#34;cream &amp;#34; which seemed less than ideal.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> her skin may not be ready to handle.</li>
            <li> As a mother that is constantly, looking for safe and natural products, this product receives my approval.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely fair, blonde hair, blue eyed boy that has been out for up to 5 hours in direct sunlight with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> They are both really great products, especially compared to other natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s free of all the petro-chemicals that we all want to keep off our babies, it prevents sunburn, is gentle on skin, and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However I did notice sweet almond oil low on the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> the older</li>
            <li> It has very good lasting ability; even when I washed it off I could still smell it; bad for me but an indicator that it is not going to dissolve easily in water.</li>
            <li> a light beige tint won&#x27;t work any better on darker skin than white will (and it will be too dark on persons such as me).  </li>
            <li> I now feel secure in knowing that I am protecting her skin without hurting her with toxins and other ingredients</li>
            <li> More and more information comes out everyday about the dangers of the sun and the importance of sunscreen, but I was never sure what brand new baby skin could handle.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have always used baby products as a result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin as does my daughter, so</li>
            <li> there is no offensive smell, and the slight smell at first dissipates quickly as it is absorbed</li>
            <li> However, since I had it and don&#x27;t have babies, I figured I&#x27;d try it in the hot African sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, adults with sensitive skin should consider using this baby product for themselves!</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t developed even the slightest redness!  </li>
            <li> Sunscreen is such an important part of skincare, especially for young kids who spend a lot of time outdoors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I admittedly haven&#x27;t been out I the sun with this on yet (again, not much sun yet to be had), the fact that a physical block sits on top ofthe skin (as opposed to chemical sunscreens whih must absorb into the skin - that&#x27;s why the wait-15-minutes-after-applying-before-exposure-rule) - and that it is only effective so long as it is in place - leads me to believe this will be less effective than other brands over a long period of time (because it does not stay on that</li>
            <li> This item fits the bill for health conscious new mothers.</li>
            <li> But if you have a baby, you know that you also want something that rubs on quickly and smoothly for those squirmy bodies who don&#x27;t sit still and something that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of unhealthy added</li>
            <li> so it spreads easily, and it kept my face from getting burned, even when I&#x27;ve been outside several hours in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has very sensitive skin and has broken out in hives over the most gentle products.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so close to the 3oz carry on TSA requirement, I would have liked a bottle a little bit smaller to carry on or bigger since I have to check it anyway.</li>
            <li> I love that this is 100% natural especially when I am thinking about putting it on my little ones.</li>
            <li> Since, my kids have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> We are a family of five who spends a considerable amount of time at the beach during the summer months.  </li>
            <li> We spend a lot of time outside in the spring and summer months and are very cautious about our sun exposure.</li>
            <li> So far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> there are countless,creams, gels, screens, lotions,aloe etc.so for a change I bought this a baby sunscreeen, I figure it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, and that&#x27;s what I got; I crossed over the bridge,</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen every day under my makeup and it takes me a while to blend this into my natural skin color (I&#x27;m caucasian.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> We have used this sunscreen on our 10 month old a couple of times now without even a hint of skin</li>
            <li> I have used this on my one year old granddaughter and on myself and prolonged exposure to the odor makes me feel nauseous.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think the biggest plus of this product is that it is advertised as natural.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is 100% natural and I am not applying toxins to her skin.  </li>
            <li> This has a good consistency; not too runny yet not too difficult to rub in.</li>
            <li> This allowed me to easily rub the sunscreen into my kid&#x27;s skin without having to rub and rub excessively.</li>
            <li> MelanSol has a pleasant scent, absorbs into the skin without much trouble, and is slightly tinted to help avoid a the white residue.  </li>
            <li> It has a slightly odd scent - mild, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> It did the trick for me as well, probably better than a lot of regular brand sunscreens that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> The price is way to high for me to use regularly.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is easy to rub into your child&#x27;s skin, not being overly oily or thick.  </li>
            <li> It provides broad spectrum protection (UVA and UVB).  </li>
            <li> There are other products that score better and cost the same of less.  </li>
            <li> No pink cheeks on my son since we opened this bottle</li>
            <li> Yet while this is a lot, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a tube of sunscreen that will last all summer long and do the job better than any of the competitors.</li>
            <li> I only use natural / mineral sunscreen for my kids and this product meets our needs well.</li>
            <li> On several occasions that I used this sunscreen on my 6 year old son, it seemed to protect him from sunburns.  </li>
            <li> and it is a 3.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: not overly strong nor terribly offensive; but also not something I would wear because it smells good</li>
            <li> At around twenty bucks, it&#x27;s pretty comparable to my previous go-to for the kids, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Second, when I first opened the tube of sunscreen, the product that came out was extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in New York and am only just starting to require sunscreen, so I will need to update later on its efficacy in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My little girls keeps sneaking it on because she likes it so much!</li>
            <li> Because of the natural oils involved I would suggest storing in your refrigerator for long term use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slightly oily texture - I tried to remix the oil wih the cream in my hand before applying the product without much success:  the cream sort of slipped around on the oil, so I had to rub pretty hard to get it worked into my skin, which is not something I like to do on my face, for instance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: I won&#x27;t buy this due to the high price and the EWG score.  </li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that, last I knew, the price was pretty high (I think $30 for this tube, if I remember correctly; it&#x27;s not currently listed).  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that it has not been sunny often enough yet to give it a long test.  </li>
            <li> After trying nearly every product out there over the last few years, this is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn me into a whining puddle of mud.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond being gentle on skin and working well as a sunblock, MelanSol&#x27;s product applies consistently and absorbs easily without leaving nasty streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for your little ones!</li>
            <li> /&gt;MelanSol rubs on without leaving a thick white film on the skin surface, something that I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding in the sunscreens that the EWG rates highly.  </li>
            <li> unsure of long term protection on very sunny days – it does say to reapply at least every two hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a long</li>
            <li> She wasn&#x27;t out there very long though.  </li>
            <li> Technically, this product is a sun block because it uses a barrier method of sun protection with titanium dioxide as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but a little seems to go a long way so it may last longer than I am used to.</li>
            <li> There was still no reaction so the next time she played outside, I rubbed a small amount on her to see if it would indeed offer protection for her.  </li>
            <li> I think the scent comes for the green tea personally.</li>
            <li> a few shakes whips it back in to its intended consistency.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price is so high that I do not think I could buy regularly.</li>
            <li> Currently there seems to be some uncertainty as to the relative safety of titanium dioxide, but compared to the chemicals in some other sunscreens it&#x27;s probably at least \\&quot;less bad\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> I only need a small squeeze to cover their faces.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn her like a lot of other sunscreens do.  </li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrance; however, it contains a scent - perhaps this is due to all the plant-based extracts in it.</li>
            <li> that is the only negative.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t leave a white kabuki-mask-like residue like some brands, hah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has the slightly tinted, thicker paste feel</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, it&#x27;s a slightly thinner than some sunscreens</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy and oddly tinted.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not pleasant but not offensive, maybe reminiscent of clay.</li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> in the heat, it can get a little soupy, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, the tube I received had the little round &amp;#34;tamper-evident&amp;#34; foil detached from the tip of the tube and stuck inside the lid, which prevented sunscreen from being dispensed.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, natural sunscreens are difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had opportunity to truly test the product to see whether my fair-skinned son will redden under harsh conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy that the product I received expires next month.</li>
            <li> just a few vigorous shakes makes it creamy again.  </li>
            <li> I often find myself using the stick sunscreens for my kids&#x27; faces because they are easier to put on, but the kinds I often use leave my kids&#x27; faces pale blue-white unless I apply a lot of rubbing.  </li>
            <li> It did not cause any breakouts on my face, which is a common problem I experience with other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when I had no adverse reaction to it, I tried a small amount on her skin.  </li>
            <li> are very few sunscreens I can use on my face, as they tend to cause redness or make me break out.</li>
            <li> Scores a 3 (not very good).  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother either of my kids&#x27; delicate skin and even through some sweaty park playing, no one was complaining about stinging eyes.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and is not too thick, not too thin.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth risking a potentially dangerous reaction.</li>
            <li> Even after sitting in the sun during a two hour lacrosse game, my skin was protected.  </li>
            <li> No matter how careful I am, I ALWAYS get it in my eye at some point during the day (usually at a very inconvenient time too.)</li>
            <li> We would go through a tube of MelanSol in a matter of days, making it quite an expensive option.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I first used the MelanSol Sunscreen for Baby, I noticed that the sunscreen is very light and not overly creamy. This allowed me to easily rub the sunscreen into my kid&#x27;s skin without having to rub and rub excessively. I also like that the sunscreen does not leave a film or sticky residue on their skin or my hands. There is a faint smell but nothing overwhelming. I think the scent comes for the green tea personally. My kids which are ages 9 and 6 had no issues with any breakouts plus their skin never received any burns. Since, my kids have somewhat sensitive skin I now know that this product will be great for little babies. The sunscreen really held its own when my kids where in the pool. They were in the pool for some time and they did not receive any burns at all. It says right on the bottle that the sunscreen is water resistant for 40 mintues, which is a nice amount of time. As a mother that is constantly, looking for safe and natural products, this product receives my approval.</li>
            <li> I love the all natural ingredients in MelanSol Sunscreen along with the SPF 30 protection.  The sunscreen is easy to rub into your child&#x27;s skin, not being overly oily or thick.  It didn&#x27;t bother either of my kids&#x27; delicate skin and even through some sweaty park playing, no one was complaining about stinging eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that this was a baby sunscreen. However, since I had it and don&#x27;t have babies, I figured I&#x27;d try it in the hot African sun. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, adults with sensitive skin should consider using this baby product for themselves!</li>
            <li> Received this on the Vine program to review but contains almond oil. Some nut allergy sufferers are told to not use ANY products with nut oils of any kind.  Be aware.</li>
            <li> Of course you want your baby&#x27;s sensitive skin protected and many of us would prefer to know what is in the suncreen while we do that! This product has worked well on our infant.  This has the slightly tinted, thicker paste feel but I found it to actually rub in quite nicely and without too much of that chalk look post application.  It is water proof and unscented.  It is a bit pricey, but a little seems to go a long way so it may last longer than I am used to.</li>
            <li> I have the MelanSol Sunscreen as well as the MelanSol Baby formula.  They are both really great products, especially compared to other natural sunscreens.  In my experience, natural sunscreens are difficult to apply.  They don&#x27;t rub into the skin easily and can leave a whitish residue.  MelanSol has a pleasant scent, absorbs into the skin without much trouble, and is slightly tinted to help avoid a the white residue.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face, under makeup, and been happy with the protection.  Even after sitting in the sun during a two hour lacrosse game, my skin was protected.  It did not cause any breakouts on my face, which is a common problem I experience with other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things to consider with this sunscreen.  First, the cost is rather prohibitive.  We are a family of five who spends a considerable amount of time at the beach during the summer months.  We would go through a tube of MelanSol in a matter of days, making it quite an expensive option.  Second, when I first opened the tube of sunscreen, the product that came out was extremely greasy.  I tried shaking the tube and massaging it to mix it up better, but it did not help.  I had to squeeze out and discard about a quarter-sized blob of the product before usable, non-greasy sunscreen came out of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great option for a natural sunscreen if the price isn&#x27;t out of your range.</li>
            <li> We are always on the lookout for a great sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals. We spend a lot of time outside in the spring and summer months and are very cautious about our sun exposure. This sunscreen covers well, absorbs nicely, smells great, and most importantly seems to do a great job at preventing sunburn. No pink cheeks on my son since we opened this bottle and I&#x27;d say that deserves a positive review!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice product that is all natural.  I applied it in the house to test it out.  It is a little greasy and oddly tinted.  It hasn&#x27;t been sunny enough yet to try it on the kids outdoors.  The price is way to high for me to use regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in New York and am only just starting to require sunscreen, so I will need to update later on its efficacy in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a beige-tinted creamy formula in a tube. Mine arrived with the formula separated, such that there was clear  &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; that came out separate from the &amp;#34;cream &amp;#34; which seemed less than ideal. It has a slightly odd scent - mild, but noticeable. Perhaps this means there isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;masking&amp;#34; scent which may be of benefit to some people with fragrance sensitivities. For me, I would prefer a slightly better smelling product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did not care for it&#x27;s slightly oily texture - I tried to remix the oil wih the cream in my hand before applying the product without much success:  the cream sort of slipped around on the oil, so I had to rub pretty hard to get it worked into my skin, which is not something I like to do on my face, for instance. The texture/oiliness for me would make it a deal-breaker on the face.  I think on the body it would be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely fair, so I don&#x27;t need to worry about the ashy-appearance of titanium dioxide on my skin because I&#x27;m so white anyway. But I&#x27;m no a big fan of tinting physical blocks to hide the whiteness inherent in these mineral-based sunscreens because 1) it&#x27;s possible to micro-pulverize these minerals for greater invisibility and 2) a light beige tint won&#x27;t work any better on darker skin than white will (and it will be too dark on persons such as me).  Ergo, super well-blended products to me address the issue better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, I like and use California Baby sunscreen. Also a physical block, it has a less-oily, more viscous texture that really seems to catch and hold onto skin all day. This products is just too greasy to accomplish that - it washes off very easily by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I admittedly haven&#x27;t been out I the sun with this on yet (again, not much sun yet to be had), the fact that a physical block sits on top ofthe skin (as opposed to chemical sunscreens whih must absorb into the skin - that&#x27;s why the wait-15-minutes-after-applying-before-exposure-rule) - and that it is only effective so long as it is in place - leads me to believe this will be less effective than other brands over a long period of time (because it does not stay on that well /is so greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will amend if applicable as I begin gardening later this month.</li>
            <li> What can I say, this is good sunscreen.  It&#x27;s free of all the petro-chemicals that we all want to keep off our babies, it prevents sunburn, is gentle on skin, and lasts for a long time.  I would say it&#x27;s probably the best baby sunscreen we&#x27;ve tried.  My only real complaint is that, last I knew, the price was pretty high (I think $30 for this tube, if I remember correctly; it&#x27;s not currently listed).  Yet while this is a lot, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a tube of sunscreen that will last all summer long and do the job better than any of the competitors.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have always used baby products as a result.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to receive the MelanSol Natural Baby Sunscreen via the vine program.&lt;br /&gt;EWG: Scores a 3 (not very good).  I see others said it scores 2 but I just double-checked and it is a 3.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: not overly strong nor terribly offensive; but also not something I would wear because it smells good&lt;br /&gt;Application:  Goes on terrific, easy to spread, good coverage, no ghastly/ghostly white streaks&lt;br /&gt;Affect on skin: Hallelujah, no break outs, no eyes tearing, no sunburn or windburn&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I won&#x27;t buy this due to the high price and the EWG score.  There are other products that score better and cost the same of less.  I&#x27;ve had great luck with Blue Lizard Sensitive and it is substantially cheaper.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that it has not been sunny often enough yet to give it a long test.  When I first tried it, it was just to rub it on my skin and it seemed very greasy.  I was pleased that the tan colored sunscreen disappeared into my skin in a few minutes and lost the original greasy feeling.  I have very sensitive skin as does my daughter, so when I had no adverse reaction to it, I tried a small amount on her skin.  There was still no reaction so the next time she played outside, I rubbed a small amount on her to see if it would indeed offer protection for her.  She was not outside for a lengthy time but there was no reaction once again and the sunscreen did its job very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros and cons I found are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it is listed for ages 6 months and older so most in the family can use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the original greasy feeling lotion turns into an absorbed, hydrated skin that is UVA/UVB protected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- there is no offensive smell, and the slight smell at first dissipates quickly as it is absorbed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it is water resistant for 40 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it is certified 100% natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the immediate greasy feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- unsure of long term protection on very sunny days – it does say to reapply at least every two hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the sunscreen.  Two family members have fought skin cancer so the rest of the family value effective sunscreens and those of us with sensitive skin need strong, yet mild, ones.  This seems to be the right choice.  We will continue to use it this summer for the ultimate test.</li>
            <li> Ever since having a baby, sunscreens have had to go through the Environmental Working Group (EWG) rating system before I will put it on my kid.  Given that every sunburn that a child has increases the chances of skin cancer later in life (five sunburns during your entire lifetime will double the chances at melanoma per the Skin Cancer Foundation), a well working sunscreen is a must.  But if you have a baby, you know that you also want something that rubs on quickly and smoothly for those squirmy bodies who don&#x27;t sit still and something that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of unhealthy added ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MelanSol rubs on without leaving a thick white film on the skin surface, something that I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding in the sunscreens that the EWG rates highly.  The EWG actually rates this as a 2 (Low Hazard) on a scale of 1-10 and recommends the sunscreen.  It is BPA, phthalate, gluten, and paraben free.  It provides broad spectrum protection (UVA and UVB).  At the time of this writing, though, it is snowing in April (boo!) and I haven&#x27;t had opportunity to truly test the product to see whether my fair-skinned son will redden under harsh conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest beef with the product is the price.  At around twenty bucks, it&#x27;s pretty comparable to my previous go-to for the kids, [[ASIN:B000RYKBEO KINeSYS Spray-On Sunscreen]].  But I prefer a cream to a spray for when we will be exposed to the sun all day at the pool or beach.  The spray works awesome for every day, quick coverage.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has very sensitive skin and has broken out in hives over the most gentle products.  She was totally fine with this sunscreen though and it seemed to have good coverage and protection.  It&#x27;s disappointing it&#x27;s so close to the 3oz carry on TSA requirement, I would have liked a bottle a little bit smaller to carry on or bigger since I have to check it anyway.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet. Just received. Not happy that the product I received expires next month. Will not get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The annual beach trip was posing a problem as most sunblocks get under the skin rather than stay on the surface. A cream is much better than a spray as a new baby can&#x27;t be told to hold its breath. This item fits the bill for health conscious new mothers.</li>
            <li> This has a good consistency; not too runny yet not too difficult to rub in. The smell is not pleasant but not offensive, maybe reminiscent of clay. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I did notice sweet almond oil low on the list of ingredients. Because of a nut allergy and advice to avoid nut oils, we will not be using this product. We didn&#x27;t experience a reaction (it was not used by the allergic individual) but it&#x27;s not worth risking a potentially dangerous reaction.</li>
            <li> This is a good sunscreen, full of all kinds of botanical ingredients and antioxidants. It&#x27;s \\&quot;certified 100% natural,\\&quot; and if you read the ingredient list you&#x27;ll be impressed by all the natural things it contains. The actual sun protection comes from titanium dioxide. Currently there seems to be some uncertainty as to the relative safety of titanium dioxide, but compared to the chemicals in some other sunscreens it&#x27;s probably at least \\&quot;less bad\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are very few sunscreens I can use on my face, as they tend to cause redness or make me break out. Unfortunately, this one is no exception. It made my forehead break out. Not full-blown pimples, but several red bumps. I suspect this is caused by all the nourishing oils in the product. Of course, this stuff is meant for babies, and they&#x27;re not likely to break out from oils like we adults do. I will continue to use this MelanSol on the rest of my body, and stick to my tried and true Neutrogena for my face.</li>
            <li> there are countless,creams, gels, screens, lotions,aloe etc.so for a change I bought this a baby sunscreeen, I figure it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, and that&#x27;s what I got; I crossed over the bridge, if it works, buy it; don&#x27;t have illusions.&lt;br /&gt;And the older you get the more you need these lotions. Time was skin-care was off, my radar, now it&#x27;s on it.</li>
            <li> I found several recommendations for this product as a safe infant sunscreen.  I would like to comment on its great efficacy.  I have an extremely fair, blonde hair, blue eyed boy that has been out for up to 5 hours in direct sunlight with this sunscreen.  He hasn&#x27;t developed even the slightest redness!  Since I had it handy, I also used it on my own face before spending the day boating.  It did the trick for me as well, probably better than a lot of regular brand sunscreens that I have used in the past.  Would highly recommend for your little ones!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s been a few decades since I was or had a baby, I still prefer gentle sunscreens free of chemical contamination for my own skin, so I am very happy with this product. I doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, it&#x27;s a slightly thinner than some sunscreens so it spreads easily, and it kept my face from getting burned, even when I&#x27;ve been outside several hours in the middle of the day. It has a light smell that I don&#x27;t love, but almost all sunscreens do and this one doesn&#x27;t last after it&#x27;s been on your skin for a while.</li>
            <li> I love that this is 100% natural especially when I am thinking about putting it on my little ones. Unfortunately, the price is so high that I do not think I could buy regularly.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is such an important part of skincare, especially for young kids who spend a lot of time outdoors. I only use natural / mineral sunscreen for my kids and this product meets our needs well. We put it to the test over spring break as our kids had outdoor soccer camp. It goes on smooth and is not clumpy like some mineral sunscreens. It did a good job of protecting our kids faces and they only got a little color after spending a good part of the day in the sun. We will buy again.</li>
            <li> I admit it. I&#x27;m a big grown up baby when it comes to getting sunscreen in my eyes. No matter how careful I am, I ALWAYS get it in my eye at some point during the day (usually at a very inconvenient time too.) After trying nearly every product out there over the last few years, this is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn me into a whining puddle of mud. It does not burn or sting no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish was different is that it goes on very white. I wear sunscreen every day under my makeup and it takes me a while to blend this into my natural skin color (I&#x27;m caucasian.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is the most perfectest sunscreen ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS The company owner is a real nice guy too. I called them with questions and they bend over backwards to help their customers.</li>
            <li> I often find myself using the stick sunscreens for my kids&#x27; faces because they are easier to put on, but the kinds I often use leave my kids&#x27; faces pale blue-white unless I apply a lot of rubbing.  This sunscreen isn&#x27;t greasy, smells pleasant, and doesn&#x27;t leave my kids&#x27; faces white after.  A little goes a long way-- I only need a small squeeze to cover their faces.  I actually don&#x27;t even mind the sunscreen on my face, and I can be picky about the type I use!</li>
            <li> By biggest point of hesitation with any baby products for topical application is the potential for skin irritation. We have used this sunscreen on our 10 month old a couple of times now without even a hint of skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next box I wanted to be able to check is whether or not the product actually provided adequate protection from the sun. Naturally, my wife tried it out on herself under direct exposure to our bright Florida skies without issue prior to applying it to the child. It does its job as a sunscreen just as well as the leading names in the industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond being gentle on skin and working well as a sunblock, MelanSol&#x27;s product applies consistently and absorbs easily without leaving nasty streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left in the heat, it can get a little soupy, but a few shakes whips it back in to its intended consistency.</li>
            <li> First and foremost when I consider any sunscreen I go to the Environmental Work Group website. I also support them. They are a very worthy group. They rate sunscreens. This scored a 2 overall. Lower is better and that is in the low risk group. I won&#x27;t even consider 3 or above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of ingredients here. It does seem to moisturize skin and our daughter did not complain. I like it as well. Definitely on my recommend list, but it is pricier than some. My go to sunscreen is the Seventh Generation one. Good combination of a good EWG score and price.</li>
            <li> I would have given this sunscreen five stars if not for the noxious odor; I simply cannot tolerate it.  I have used this on my one year old granddaughter and on myself and prolonged exposure to the odor makes me feel nauseous.  I have tried many natural sunscreens over the years with varying results and have never come across one where the odor affected me so negatively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... that is the only negative. The texture of the product is creamy and light enough for easy application.  It has a light tint so you don&#x27;t see that white streaking which is a  problem with many titanium dioxide sunscreens.  It dries to a satiny finish and is not sticky.  It has very good lasting ability; even when I washed it off I could still smell it; bad for me but an indicator that it is not going to dissolve easily in water. The protection is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When exposed to heat the oils in the product become a bit separated but just a few vigorous shakes makes it creamy again.  Because of the natural oils involved I would suggest storing in your refrigerator for long term use.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many different baby sunscreens, searching for something safe for our whole family that also works well. This one is definitely a winner. It scores a 2 on EWGs Skin Deep website for safe cosmetics (lower is better!). It rubs in VERY easily for a mineral based sunscreen, which is so important with squirmy little children. It even smells nice. My little girls keeps sneaking it on because she likes it so much!</li>
            <li> Try it on my girl with eczema.  No problems there.  It didn&#x27;t burn her like a lot of other sunscreens do.  She didn&#x27;t get sunburn either. She wasn&#x27;t out there very long though.  I will have to give an update when winter stops coming during the spring.  The pool will soon be warm enough to give this better feedback.</li>
            <li> On several occasions that I used this sunscreen on my 6 year old son, it seemed to protect him from sunburns.  I like the sunscreen because it is advertised as chemical free, it is easy to apply, and it leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my son said that he does not like the smell.  I agree that this product has a medicine-like or eucaliptus-like smell, but I think that it airs out quickly enough to ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the tube I received had the little round &amp;#34;tamper-evident&amp;#34; foil detached from the tip of the tube and stuck inside the lid, which prevented sunscreen from being dispensed.  Which makes me question manufacturer&#x27;s production quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the biggest plus of this product is that it is advertised as natural.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great!  It&#x27;s moisturizing and is not too thick, not too thin.  I also like that it&#x27;s SPF 30 and not lower.  It is a little expensive though.</li>
            <li> Technically, this product is a sun block because it uses a barrier method of sun protection with titanium dioxide as the active ingredient. It&#x27;s very creamy to the point of being oily, so it&#x27;s easy to apply. At least it doesn&#x27;t leave a white kabuki-mask-like residue like some brands, hah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrance; however, it contains a scent - perhaps this is due to all the plant-based extracts in it. It was a bit strong for me, but I have an excessively sensitive nose. Since it&#x27;ll be used outside, I doubt the scent will bother anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all sunscreens and sun blocks, the product should be reapplied often. It seems to work well as no one suffered sun damage, but it&#x27;s probably the most expensive sun block I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I got this sunscreen for my baby granddaughter.  I like the fact that it is 100% natural and I am not applying toxins to her skin.  More and more information comes out everyday about the dangers of the sun and the importance of sunscreen, but I was never sure what brand new baby skin could handle.  I now feel secure in knowing that I am protecting her skin without hurting her with toxins and other ingredients her skin may not be ready to handle.</li>
