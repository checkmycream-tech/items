            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure if those could ever be improved, but this scrub really does smooth them out!  </li>
            <li>There are many fragrances available, and I have tried all of them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff, but dont pay that much $$ .</li>
            <li>This product leaves your skin so smooth and it smells so good, its positively lickable.</li>
            <li>Tree Hut also has other awesome products as well.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so credibly soft and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>First let me say, this stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li>it smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling very very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It works well and my skin feels smooth</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>the creme i use after shower on warm skin &amp; it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>I also love that I know what all but two of the ingredients are, that&#x27;s rare in a beauty product these days.  </li>
            <li>This body scrub smells amazing and leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This made my skin really soft and it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Works wonders, makes my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so sweet that it smells like I am putting brown sugar on my skin.</li>
            <li>This body scrub is amazing, really left my skin smooth,</li>
            <li>I find I do go through the tub fairly quickly</li>
            <li>the VERY FIRST use</li>
            <li>so much!!..</li>
            <li>Great scrub for the shower and everyday use.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels baby soft, love it.</li>
            <li>Not a huge fan of the smell, but it still works great.</li>
            <li>this by far is better.  </li>
            <li>When i use the scrub my skin is soft and looks more even when i&#x27;m applying lotion.</li>
            <li>It does an average job of scrubbing your body-no irritation for me at all, and very easy and smooth to use.</li>
            <li>They are all equally effective, so the only question you should really be asking yourself is, \\&quot;What scent</li>
            <li>Great for winter months when skin gets dull.</li>
            <li>First product ,..that I&#x27;ve been looking for ,..&lt;br /&gt;Finally got this hooked,..</li>
            <li>I bought this scrub first here but then found it at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li>thanks me!</li>
            <li>I first used Baby&#x27;s Foot to get rid of the unwanted roughness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my first choice</li>
            <li>My personal favorite of all Tree Hut&#x27;s sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li>one has me interested as well.</li>
            <li>This made my skin very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped clear out my pours and make my face clean.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the price you pay at Walmart for it, seeing as how it lasts a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels very smooth after the exfoliating sugar granules go to work on it, but it does not feel dry at all - in fact, it feels moisturized.  </li>
            <li>then I know it&#x27;s really working and not just some foofy &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It really does,.</li>
            <li>not so much so that it leaves your skin sore....</li>
            <li>i even use it under my eyes before makeup &amp; it really smooths the skin there</li>
            <li>, maybe I use too much, maybe it&#x27;s too watery, that you may have to decide for yourself.  </li>
            <li>I guess the free shipping for prime may make it worth it if you don&#x27;t live near a walmart or are only making this purchase since Walmart only ships free if you purchase $50 or ore.</li>
            <li>YOU WILL WANT TO USE THIS TO SHAVE YOUR LEGS, BEFORE FAUX TANNING AND TO SIMPLY LEAVE YOUR SKIN BABY FRESH !</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but it is only $5.98 bucks at walmart for the same size, etc.</li>
            <li>The sugar granule size it great too...not  too big, not too small!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for HIGH quality scrubs, this is not it.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub but my only caution is to check Ulta first to smell them because the scents are powerful and very distinct and I accidently ordered the wrong one a bit ago (not this order) and didnt like the smell.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have to be gentle, but</li>
            <li>oh my goodness, it makes my skin so soft!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate higher if the smell was different.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin super soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>soft,</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin baby soft and supple, and paired with Vaseline CocoaRadiant Lotion my skin</li>
            <li>When you rinse it off, your skin is left very supple.</li>
            <li>It works well all over on my young, sensitive, and tattooed skin.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way per section of your body, and the more you rub it in, the sugar crystals melt.</li>
            <li>I am slowly ordering all the different scents they have but this is has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting something special, and then I see it for half the price art various sites.</li>
            <li>i felt a major difference.</li>
            <li>The first day i go this, i used it on the little bumps that always seem to be on the back of arms.</li>

            <li> I love this scrub but my only caution is to check Ulta first to smell them because the scents are powerful and very distinct and I accidently ordered the wrong one a bit ago (not this order) and didnt like the smell.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have to be gentle, but</li>
            <li> oh my goodness, it makes my skin so soft!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate higher if the smell was different.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin super soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> soft,</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin baby soft and supple, and paired with Vaseline CocoaRadiant Lotion my skin</li>
            <li> When you rinse it off, your skin is left very supple.</li>
            <li> It works well all over on my young, sensitive, and tattooed skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way per section of your body, and the more you rub it in, the sugar crystals melt.</li>
            <li> I am slowly ordering all the different scents they have but this is has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting something special, and then I see it for half the price art various sites.</li>
            <li> i felt a major difference.</li>
            <li> The first day i go this, i used it on the little bumps that always seem to be on the back of arms.</li>
            <li> I also use a flat hand lufa and use this *gently* on my face to remove and dead or pealing skin.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of product for the price (about $5 at Walmart) and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> However, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long on your body; (remember though, you bought it for exfoliation, not for scenting.)</li>
            <li> This is a very course scrub with the potential of hurting yourself it you scrub to hard, but  </li>
            <li> Even though i haven&#x27;t used it yet, my skin is dry from the constant weather change in the south.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that I had ordered the 3 pack instead of the single.  </li>
            <li> This one to me was just average because I don&#x27;t feel there is enough oil after this is rinsed off so my skin is not as soft as I was hoping compared to other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> The odor is sweeter smelling than I expected, but I like it overall.  </li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s a little more expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my Keratosis Pilaris, (little bumps on the back of my upper arms).  </li>
            <li> amazing, a must buy👍👍, just hated the fact for extra shipping fees.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin crazy smooth.</li>
            <li> No, really.</li>
            <li> I tried the other scent</li>
            <li> the scrub is very rough but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nutty, chocolately, and slightly coffee-scented smell to me.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never used this much less heard of this brand.</li>
            <li> Try applying it and then shaving it off, maybe mix with a little baby oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> my fave is the creme &amp; that may be because i use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> the scrub i&#x27;ve used 3 times because i don&#x27;t feel everyday is needed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Not nice</li>
            <li> Not great if you have heavy callouses like myself though.</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body in slow circles in a bath, once a week.</li>
            <li> ..smell incurable</li>
            <li> iv been scrubbing those bad boys with all kinds of soaps and body acre scrubs...  </li>
            <li> My issue is that I hate the smell-</li>

            <li> First product ,..that I&#x27;ve been looking for ,..&lt;br /&gt;Finally got this hooked,..now every nite,..I&#x27;ll use it for my treatment on my body,..felt soft,..smell incurable</li>
            <li> Great exfoliant! I use it once a week and my skin feels baby soft, love it. Not a huge fan of the smell, but it still works great.</li>
            <li> I bought it for me, but I noticed it was disappearing quicker than I was using it. One day, my spouse said, \\&quot;you know that body scrub in your shower, it&#x27;s like cleaning your body with sugar.\\&quot; It is phenomenally amazing stuff. We love it.</li>
            <li> Read about this product on XOJane.com and ordered right then, it smells delicious and makes my skin silky smooth.  Can&#x27;t wait to order the body wash!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> THE MOST AMAZING BODY SCRUB ON THE MARKET !  YOU WILL WANT TO USE THIS TO SHAVE YOUR LEGS, BEFORE FAUX TANNING AND TO SIMPLY LEAVE YOUR SKIN BABY FRESH !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for sometime now. BONUS: Hubby loves it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I used it at my mom&#x27;s house once and promptly went out and bought my own. Yes it smells very good but that&#x27;s not even the best part. It is wonderful all over my body but it works the best on my face right before I wash it with face wash. This is such a great exfoliator! Go get it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the store anymore so I came here.  So happy to have this product again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME.  I have sensitive skin and have to be gentle, but oh my goodness, it makes my skin so soft!  It smells great, which is what attracted me to it after smelling it at a relative&#x27;s house, but it is so much more than a good smell.  It works great!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub because it makes my skin feel so smoothe. Also, my skin smells like cocoa butter. It reminds me of tanning on the beach. lol!</li>
            <li> This Body scrub is &#x27;AWESOME&#x27; it feels great putting it on while in the bath or shower, smells just absolutely wonderful, makes my skin soft as a baby&#x27;s but…LOL..I love it so much!!..I have to get more soon :))</li>
            <li> I love this scrub but my only caution is to check Ulta first to smell them because the scents are powerful and very distinct and I accidently ordered the wrong one a bit ago (not this order) and didnt like the smell. I bought this scrub first here but then found it at Wal-Mart but they didn&#x27;t have all the scents like Amazon did even though it&#x27;s a little more expensive on Amazon. Works wonders, makes my skin nice and soft. I like to use this before I shave to i exfoliate my skin and raise the hair follicles. I also use a flat hand lufa and use this *gently* on my face to remove and dead or pealing skin. It&#x27;s helped clear out my pours and make my face clean. This is a very course scrub with the potential of hurting yourself it you scrub to hard, but  i like that it&#x27;s course because then I know it&#x27;s really working and not just some foofy &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; like all the others.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub. Just bought a week ago and I&#x27;m ordering another one. The Brazilian but scent smells so good as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because they no longer carried the scent I really liked and the reviews on this one were good. It works well and my skin feels smooth after- it&#x27;s also the eighth texture (exfoliates without being grainy) going on so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  My issue is that I hate the smell- it&#x27;s so sweet that it smells like I am putting brown sugar on my skin. I&#x27;d rate higher if the smell was different.</li>
            <li> love the way this stuff smells!  it is a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> It was a nice smelling scrub, adequently amount for the money, and nice container. Overall, very low on my radar of scurbs.</li>
            <li> I have used several salt and sugar body scrubs.  This one to me was just average because I don&#x27;t feel there is enough oil after this is rinsed off so my skin is not as soft as I was hoping compared to other products I have used.  However, if you like a drier feel after using a scrub, you might like this.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I felt the scent was not as I was expecting.  It smells more like nutty caramel sauce that you would eat and I prefer scents that don&#x27;t remind me of dessert.</li>
            <li> First time using it and was very pleased!! Leaves your skin super soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. It is great for right after shaving. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> The first day i go this, i used it on the little bumps that always seem to be on the back of arms. the VERY FIRST use i felt a major difference. iv been scrubbing those bad boys with all kinds of soaps and body acre scrubs...  I am so pleased with how well this stuff works. it smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling very very smooth and soft. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The odor is sweeter smelling than I expected, but I like it overall.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent on the skin after a shower, which I think is good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this on here. It runs for about $6 at Walmart. $14 is a ripoff. It&#x27;s good stuff, but dont pay that much $$ .</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so credibly soft and smells amazing! The sugar granule size it great too...not  too big, not too small!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It smells amazing and I wish I could eat it. Great consistency and does a good job exfoliating. I am slowly ordering all the different scents they have but this is has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> When, I use it to scrub all over my body. I love the smell. It kinda smells like coffee. Would love to buy again.</li>
            <li> This body scrub is amazing, really left my skin smooth, amazing, a must buy👍👍, just hated the fact for extra shipping fees.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. You know how some products leave your skin kissable? This product leaves your skin so smooth and it smells so good, its positively lickable. Great for winter months when skin gets dull.</li>
            <li> Great scrub for the shower and everyday use. Not great if you have heavy callouses like myself though. But I use it to get an overall smoothing about three times a week.</li>
            <li> This exfoliant smells amazing. I use it all over my body in slow circles in a bath, once a week. It leaves my skin baby soft and supple, and paired with Vaseline CocoaRadiant Lotion my skin thanks me! A little goes a long way per section of your body, and the more you rub it in, the sugar crystals melt. When you rinse it off, your skin is left very supple. It works well all over on my young, sensitive, and tattooed skin. You get a lot of product for the price (about $5 at Walmart) and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body scrub.  I purchase this from King Soopers (Kroger) locally because it costs under $7 to buy it in the store.  It does wonders for my Keratosis Pilaris, (little bumps on the back of my upper arms).  I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure if those could ever be improved, but this scrub really does smooth them out!  I also use it on my d&amp;eacute;colletage to smooth-out skin there.  There are many fragrances available, and I have tried all of them.  They are all equally effective, so the only question you should really be asking yourself is, \\&quot;What scent do I want?\\&quot;  It really is a wonderful product!  If you are looking for a great body scrub, this is the one to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is meant to be informative of the product I have personally tried, and is not reflective of the seller distributing this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I first used Baby&#x27;s Foot to get rid of the unwanted roughness.  Then I scrubbed my feet with this body scrub then apply the shea body butter.  My feet feel and look awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The store that I bought this scrub from stopped selling it and so I was super happy to find it on amazon. This body scrub smells amazing and leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> First let me say, this stuff smells amazing. It really does,. As soon as you open it, you&#x27;re going to want to eat it. It does an average job of scrubbing your body-no irritation for me at all, and very easy and smooth to use. However, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long on your body; (remember though, you bought it for exfoliation, not for scenting.) It&#x27;s not my first choice but it&#x27;s worth the price you pay at Walmart for it, seeing as how it lasts a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for HIGH quality scrubs, this is not it. It&#x27;s low on the list. But if you&#x27;re looking for something adequate just to get the job done, this is an excellent choice to start with. Tree Hut also has other awesome products as well.</li>
            <li> I love this and use this when I take a bath.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite of all Tree Hut&#x27;s sugar scrubs. Leaves my skin crazy smooth. Also, it smells so good you might be tempted to eat it. No, really. It&#x27;s a nutty, chocolately, and slightly coffee-scented smell to me. Try applying it and then shaving it off, maybe mix with a little baby oil. Your legs (or wherever) will feel UH-MAY-ZING afterword.</li>
            <li> This made my skin very soft and clean. It has a nice scent as well. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This made my skin really soft and it smells AMAZING. A nutty vanilla/brown sugar smell. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!!  My only wish is that I had ordered the 3 pack instead of the single.  The smell is amazing and it makes my skin feel so smooth.  I use it every night before bed.</li>
            <li> received several tree hut shea butter items as mother&#x27;s day gifts. they were purchased on amazon....just not by me. i&#x27;ve never used this much less heard of this brand. i have been amazed by the quality &amp; performance. the scrub is very rough but not so much so that it leaves your skin sore....just a bit rosy but so very smooth. smells great &amp; the coconut one has me interested as well. my fave is the creme &amp; that may be because i use it everyday.  the scrub i&#x27;ve used 3 times because i don&#x27;t feel everyday is needed. the creme i use after shower on warm skin &amp; it absorbs very well. really good after shaving. i use it before i get into bed for the night too &amp; use it generously then. my skin looks great in the morning. i even use it under my eyes before makeup &amp; it really smooths the skin there ( i am 59 so yah....there&#x27;s some lines there). i can&#x27;t believe i&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before but i sure i am glad i know it now. may be my new favorite beauty item!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but it is only $5.98 bucks at walmart for the same size, etc. (in-store and even online).  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I guess the free shipping for prime may make it worth it if you don&#x27;t live near a walmart or are only making this purchase since Walmart only ships free if you purchase $50 or ore.</li>
            <li> I do love this sugar scrub, but why am I will buy it here when even Wal-Mart have it for a much better price., unless you don&#x27;t have a Wal-Mart, target, ulta and who knows where else, then I can see that happening.</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub because it smells scrumptious and works beautifully.  My skin feels very smooth after the exfoliating sugar granules go to work on it, but it does not feel dry at all - in fact, it feels moisturized.  I also love that I know what all but two of the ingredients are, that&#x27;s rare in a beauty product these days.  With all the benefits, you can&#x27;t beat this scrub especially for the price.  I am going to get some for my mom as a gift!</li>
            <li> I should buy stock because I love this stuff.  I tried the other scent this by far is better.  It&#x27;s a nice consistency, doesn&#x27;t feel like you are scraping your skin off.  I find I do go through the tub fairly quickly, maybe I use too much, maybe it&#x27;s too watery, that you may have to decide for yourself.  Never the less I wouldn&#x27;t tell you not to buy it because it works great, smells great and I think if you are fond of that scent you will not regret your purchase.  I&#x27;ve ordered this several times.</li>
            <li> Even though i haven&#x27;t used it yet, my skin is dry from the constant weather change in the south. When i use the scrub my skin is soft and looks more even when i&#x27;m applying lotion.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting something special, and then I see it for half the price art various sites. Not nice</li>
