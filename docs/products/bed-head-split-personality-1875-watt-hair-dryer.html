            <li>Love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I love that it has three heat settings, as well as three speed settings.</li>
            <li>I have had so many blow driers for my curly, I can&#x27;t even count them all.</li>

            <li>Cool looking for teenagers</li>
            <li>Quieter than my last which is also good.</li>
            <li>It worked great when I first started using it, but recently I have noticed that it is not as powerful as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>This is an adequate hair dryer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, good size (odd yellow on other side) and good price.</li>
            <li>For the money, this hair dryer works very well!  </li>
            <li>After that the handle got very hot and popped very loud and just quit.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Has all the various fan speeds, heat settings, and cool shot button that I want on a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This is light &amp; my cool shot is cooler than tyres I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>This has high heat but the hair doesn&#x27;t blast my hair around making it frizzy.</li>
            <li>High quality hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It gets my hair dry super fast.</li>
            <li>Be careful tho, the hot button really means HOT.</li>
            <li>This is what I found with dryers.&lt;br /&gt;Low-end ($15-$25): lightweight , compact but very loud.</li>
            <li>Too much hassle to send back.</li>
            <li>Daily co-washing and a leave-in treatment with a weekly gentle shampoo solved all these problems for me.</li>
            <li>small and light enough, no hearing loss at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, researching tourmaline vs ceramic vs ionic, purchasing and returning a number of both low and high end dryers; ladies it&#x27;s not the hardware.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but surprised at that.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to replace an old Bed Head dryer that finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>This was purchased to replace my 10 year old con air dryer that recently died.</li>
            <li>This product started getting extremely hot in the handle a few weeks after purchase, and then quit working all together.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine,color treated hair that I wash and dry daily, and when my dryer died I spent weeks looking for a replacement.</li>

            <li> My only complaint is that my favorite universal hair diffuser will not fit on this one, but that&#x27;s not really Bed Head&#x27;s fault I suppose!</li>
            <li> 1875 watts of forced hot air will dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> The little cover on the back does pop off occasionally, but nothing to worrisome or troubling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dry my hair often, so it is not an issue with overuse.  </li>
            <li> Just not willing to pay an arm and a leg for a dryer.</li>
            <li> Would give it five stars if it blew a little harder, but I know the Wattage going in!  </li>
            <li> The settings, including cold shot, all work with no complaints and the diffuser is an absolute dream!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this dryer doesn&#x27;t fry it.</li>
            <li> Sad that I bought something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in March and now I have to replace it because the wire is exposed and creates sparks and is dangerous.</li>
            <li> Cold shot button never worked.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this was just a random incident and won&#x27;t happen to anyone else!!</li>

            <li> Nice blow dryer.  Works well,  Good power.  Multiple settings.  Cool looking for teenagers</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer. The attachments are awesome and i love all the settings it has...Be careful tho, the hot button really means HOT. You can burn yourself but its good for your blow outs.</li>
            <li> Really great blow dryer for anyone. The colors are eye-catching and it has a nice feel in your hand. I love that it has three heat settings, as well as three speed settings. The little cover on the back does pop off occasionally, but nothing to worrisome or troubling. The two diffusers are wonderful. In all, a great product.</li>
            <li> Not the most powerful blow dryer but it does the job</li>
            <li> I purchased this in March and now I have to replace it because the wire is exposed and creates sparks and is dangerous. I can&#x27;t return it. I do not reccomend this item!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer. Has multiple settings, and I like the concentrator and diffuser. The only thing I dislike is that the writing on the heat/force settings is rubbing off after a month. Not a big deal, but surprised at that.</li>
            <li> Very cute and works great.</li>
            <li> For the money, this hair dryer works very well!  Has all the various fan speeds, heat settings, and cool shot button that I want on a hair dryer.  For some reason, a similarly priced hair dryer I have just frizzes my hair.  This one does not frizz.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I have had so many blow driers for my curly, I can&#x27;t even count them all. This has high heat but the hair doesn&#x27;t blast my hair around making it frizzy. I bought a second one incase it ever bites the dust! Best one I have ever had by a long shot.</li>
            <li> Cold shot button never worked. Too much hassle to send back. Faulty product. Sad that I bought something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The dryer rattles, and this AM sparks flew out of the nozzle causing an electrical shock to my head!  Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about six months.  It worked great when I first started using it, but recently I have noticed that it is not as powerful as it used to be.  I don&#x27;t dry my hair often, so it is not an issue with overuse.  I&#x27;ve never had an issue with a dryer losing power like this before.  I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because it is lightweight, sleek and has a nice look.  I just wish it held up better.</li>
            <li> Dryer works great and love the diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is light &amp; my cool shot is cooler than tyres I&#x27;ve had in the past. Love it!</li>
            <li> i love this blower do my curly hair so nice &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine,color treated hair that I wash and dry daily, and when my dryer died I spent weeks looking for a replacement. After reading reviews, researching tourmaline vs ceramic vs ionic, purchasing and returning a number of both low and high end dryers; ladies it&#x27;s not the hardware. If you suffer from dryness, dullness, damage, fly-always, and/or frizz; change your hair care products and rotate them seasonally. Daily co-washing and a leave-in treatment with a weekly gentle shampoo solved all these problems for me. This is what I found with dryers.&lt;br /&gt;Low-end ($15-$25): lightweight , compact but very loud. Conair cord keeper had a whine that will probably cause hearing loss.&lt;br /&gt;High-end ($50 and up): heavier and quieter but no need to spend that on a hair dryer. AC motors are also heavier, bigger and louder.&lt;br /&gt;Mid-range ($30-$40): small and light enough, no hearing loss at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews for quality (dies in 3 months or catching fire) but forget the marketing BS, I found no difference with the tourmaline/ceramic/ionic. 1875 watts of forced hot air will dry your hair.  This Bed Head dryer is great. It&#x27;s easy to clean, good size (odd yellow on other side) and good price. Worked with my criteria for price and sound, don&#x27;t care what minerals and materials it&#x27;s made with.</li>
            <li> This product started getting extremely hot in the handle a few weeks after purchase, and then quit working all together. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> has three temp settings and we just love this!</li>
            <li> This is an adequate hair dryer</li>
            <li> High quality hair dryer.  Included with two extensions.  Diffuser and concentrated attachment.</li>
            <li> Heating element died after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This dries my hair faster than I would have anticipates since it does not feel like there is a lot of air coming out. Quieter than my last which is also good. My only complaint is that my favorite universal hair diffuser will not fit on this one, but that&#x27;s not really Bed Head&#x27;s fault I suppose!</li>
            <li> Great dryer.  Purchased this to replace an old Bed Head dryer that finally bit the dust.  Good price, good heat, good airflow.  Would give it five stars if it blew a little harder, but I know the Wattage going in!  Just not willing to pay an arm and a leg for a dryer.</li>
            <li> my hair dryer came with a diffuser but no concentrator. i would like to know why.</li>
            <li> Beware!!! Burned me!! Worked great for a week. After that the handle got very hot and popped very loud and just quit. Scared me to death and I threw it on the floor when it happened!! I called the bed head customer service to report the issues and got a refund from Amazon. Hopefully this was just a random incident and won&#x27;t happen to anyone else!!</li>
            <li> It works great!!! I love the colors. Thank you</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace my 10 year old con air dryer that recently died. So far, it&#x27;s amazing! The settings, including cold shot, all work with no complaints and the diffuser is an absolute dream!</li>
            <li> I love the interchangeable attachments. It gets my hair dry super fast. I have thin hair and this dryer doesn&#x27;t fry it. Its perfect.</li>
