    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>This works great.</li>
            <li>Gets most of the gunk out but doesn&#x27;t fully clean...not that impressed.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work as well as smells nice!</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it&#x27;s good for getting most of the makeup off your brushes.</li>
            <li>Liked the smell of the sanitzer.</li>
            <li>Easy way to clean brushes that smells great.  </li>
            <li>I can still see foundation tinting on my stippling brush, for example - but it does get most of the gunk off.</li>
            <li>I have always struggled with acne and have committed to trying to eliminate bacteria touching my face everywhere possible...including my make-up brushes.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with merchandise</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get everything off, but it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Smells good, good solid spray.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and a nice to have in between clients and</li>
            <li>but with this it is super easy!  </li>
            <li>Now my foundation goes on smoothly instead of in clumps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100% clean -</li>
            <li>Gets my brushes really clean</li>
            <li>Does a good job cleaning my brushes daily.  </li>
            <li>The mild scent is pleasing.  </li>
            <li>No idea how clean they get or if they are really germ free - but a lot of product comes off on the paper towel after I use this.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and cleans and sanitizes my brushes very well.  </li>
            <li>when I cannot wash my brushes right away.</li>
            <li>It does a reasonable job in getting the brushes clean and disinfected.</li>
            <li>This definitely does what I need it to, and gives me more time between washes.</li>
            <li>Left my powder brush clean, soft and smelling really good without any apparent residue.</li>
            <li>A few sprays and a good rub on a towel and my brushed seem clean after using them.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper then the Sephora version</li>
            <li>This really does get the stuff of your brushes</li>
            <li>and it is very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>This brush cleaner leaves my brushes fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have to worry about color-mixing, but a clean and sanitized brush is necessary to avoid breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is not hard on the bristles at all.</li>
            <li>All the make up on my white eye shadow brush comes right off</li>
            <li>Remember the smell will be going in your face constantly after its on your brushes and it doesn&#x27;t evap or go away, it&#x27;s just not want you want to smell when your getting ready for work or to go out</li>
            <li>Washing my brushes every day is a major pain</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully to clean my makeup brushes after I had seriously neglected them.  </li>

            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I hate washing my makeup brushes after every single use - this lets me get away with only washing them every week, which I suspect will make my brushes last longer too.</li>

            <li> I use this on my brushes every day after applying makeup. It does a reasonable job in getting the brushes clean and disinfected. It&#x27;s not 100% clean - I can still see foundation tinting on my stippling brush, for example - but it does get most of the gunk off. I still wash my brushes once a week in antibacterial hand soap and a lot comes out, but I suppose for in between cleaning it helps keep bacterial transfer down.</li>

            <li> Smells good, good solid spray. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it&#x27;s good for getting most of the makeup off your brushes. It doesn&#x27;t get everything off, but it does a pretty good job. I would recommend using this on a daily basis, but washing your brushes with brush shampoo once a week as well.</li>

            <li> Satisfied with merchandise</li>
            <li> This works great. I use shampoo and conditioner on the brush every couple of weeks and for daily cleansing this is good.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009W8UIVW/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning my brushes daily.  Gets my brushes really clean and it is very inexpensive.  I just wish it came in a bigger bottle so I wouldn&#x27;t have to reorder it all of the time.</li>
            <li> I like this cleaner.  It is easy to use and cleans and sanitizes my brushes very well.  The mild scent is pleasing.  This brush cleaner leaves my brushes fresh and soft.  It is not hard on the bristles at all.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived broken, sprayer did not work, leaking. Had to transfer to another type bottle I had laying around. Not sure I will buy again. Liked the smell of the sanitzer.</li>
            <li> A few sprays and a good rub on a towel and my brushed seem clean after using them. All the make up on my white eye shadow brush comes right off</li>
