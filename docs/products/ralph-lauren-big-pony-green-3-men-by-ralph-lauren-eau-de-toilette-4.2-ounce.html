            <li>What can I say, if you love cologne, and owning a library of mens colognes like I do, then you will love it!</li>
            <li>I have been complimented many times when wearing this scent, and I have asked my coworkers if it is overpowering -</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>This is my husbands favorite cologne</li>
            <li>Glad I chose this cologne after some research.  </li>
            <li>very special smell, I like</li>
            <li>Not overpowering at all but still strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>It smells very crisp and clean with a minty scent.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell , it&#x27;s big bottle, my husband love it too.</li>
            <li>Smell so fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li>Nice and woodsy/manly while being clean and fresh at the same time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s manly, and it&#x27;s amazing, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Very nice, only thing is the scent does not last all day.</li>
            <li>Obviously, you get better cost at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the wrist I sprayed the department store cologne on held the scent much longer.</li>
            <li>AS WELL, THANKS</li>
            <li>I have found a scent that really works for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>Fast shippine I will buy again</li>
            <li>This scent is one of those that lasts long, and is neither too strong nor overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Walked into a Macy&#x27;s store and was sampling some of the new Polo for men.</li>
            <li>Ordered the large size.&lt;br /&gt;This will last me through the year!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I love this scent, and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores anymore</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it smells classy, and is light enough for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>purchased it directly through Amazon (not a 3rd party seller), and I can speak to its authenticity, as my brother had the same one he purchased from a store.  </li>

            <li> Best scent on the market. I get compliments all the time and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Buy this, buy it here. Again, buy this, buy it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say that because this is the cheapest place you will find it and this is the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life.&lt;br /&gt;When I die, I&#x27;ll probably just request that I get a shot of this when I get put in my casket(fresh to death).</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift at Christmas and a few days later had an awkward conversation that began &amp;#34;did you know you got me fake cologne?&amp;#34; As I have never had a bad experience with a product received here, I somewhat took offense to the notion and we went to a local department store to compare scents. The products look identical; however, the smells although very similar, are definitely not the same cologne. I also noticed that the wrist I sprayed the department store cologne on held the scent much longer. The experience has turned me off to any future cologne purchases online.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, its my favorite scent for my boyfriend!</li>
            <li> Very good cologne, great smell as well. Smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted, but not a huge deal. Was very satisfied with shipping speed.</li>
            <li> I checked it in the store and it seemed to be fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, at home, was average. Nothing horrible, but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, and I love the smell. It&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s manly, and it&#x27;s amazing, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> What can I say, if you love cologne, and owning a library of mens colognes like I do, then you will love it!</li>
            <li> This scent is one of those that lasts long, and is neither too strong nor overpowering.  I have been complimented many times when wearing this scent, and I have asked my coworkers if it is overpowering - they insisted it isn&#x27;t (I don&#x27;t think so, either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those scents that, when you smell it on someone else, you wonder, \\&quot;What is the name of that scent??\\&quot;  I would recommend it to everyone, and will continue to use it.  In my opinion, it smells classy, and is light enough for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it directly through Amazon (not a 3rd party seller), and I can speak to its authenticity, as my brother had the same one he purchased from a store.  Excellent cologne for any time of day.  20 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Very nice, only thing is the scent does not last all day.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells its a great parfum I recommend it to use it. My grilfriend like it a lot and that is enough for me.</li>
            <li> Its a good one and dont have to explain about Ralph Lauren&#x27;s standards.  I love this product.  Go for it</li>
            <li> EVERYONE ALWAYS TELLS ME AT WORK, WHAT IM WEARING CUZ I SMELL &amp;#34;HOT&amp;#34;, I LOVE THE SMELL AS WELL, THANKS A LOT! :)</li>
            <li> No. 3 is my favorite out of all of them and it smells great on men! makes a great gift!</li>
            <li> I love this scent, and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores anymore (I think it&#x27;s discontinued?). Luckily Amazon had it and for a good price too! Nice and woodsy/manly while being clean and fresh at the same time. Smells like a classier version of Abercrombie Fierce</li>
            <li> Walked into a Macy&#x27;s store and was sampling some of the new Polo for men. This one stood out, I had to have it. Obviously, you get better cost at Amazon. Ordered the large size.&lt;br /&gt;This will last me through the year!&lt;br /&gt;Good product at a great price. Thank you Amazon and Polo!</li>
            <li> Love the smell , it&#x27;s big bottle, my husband love it too. Smell so fresh and sweet. Good choice for him.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes.  It smells very crisp and clean with a minty scent.  Not overpowering at all but still strong.</li>
            <li> I have found a scent that really works for me. A co-worker commented, \\&quot; How can your wife resist not jumping you when you wear that?\\&quot; But that&#x27;s another story! LOL. Works for me!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was prompt, product arrived in good condition. Well pleased. (So is the wife).</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne and I found it at a great price! It smells so good and is about $20 cheaper than a dept store.</li>
            <li> Glad I chose this cologne after some research.  The price was great, and it is as promised.  It&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> very special smell, I like</li>
            <li> My husband had all the series except for this one.  This is great, specially when you don&#x27;t have to pay $ 65.00 for it.</li>
            <li> I always like of smell of this cologne.Fast shippine I will buy again</li>
