            <li> Not very comfortable either.  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t allow a thing like the shampoo bowl to slow my business down.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing in that the size was much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> A waste of my hard earned $200</li>
            <li> The water, shampoo and other left ugly water makes and visable stains.</li>
            <li> My plumber used the one provided and it fit awful.</li>
            <li> Not happy...</li>
            <li> So needless to say not happy at all!</li>

            <li> Good value. Fast delivery. Had to spend another 60 $ on parts. Parts came with it did not work.</li>
            <li> I love the look of the sink, but it came with different parts to it than pictured. Also all of the plumbing  was not the right plumbing. We had to spend another $100.00 buying the correct plumbing . So needless to say not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Love the sinks but they are a little narrow . It is what it is !</li>
            <li> i just had this installed today. seems to work great. great size. doesnt look cheap.</li>
            <li> Bought and installed for my daughter.  The mounting brackets are allow for a little bit of movement.  Other than that this is a terrific sink.  Glad I picked it.  WOuld do so again.</li>
            <li> Beatiful and fresh looking.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Disappointing in that the size was much smaller than I expected. It is not the size of a standard shampoo bowl. Not happy...</li>
            <li> Feels small and stains easily.  Not very comfortable either.  Just not a lot of room in the bowl.  I&#x27;m only doing a small amount of hair so I guess it&#x27;s okay.  Also make sure it isn&#x27;t hung too low.  That may be part of the problem with mine.</li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;tinie&amp;#34; sound, but everything works great, and customers say it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, classy looking sink for a great price!</li>
            <li> I chose this shampoo bowl because I liked the looks of it and also loved the faucet lever too. I also chose it because it came with a neck rest which makes it a lot more comfortable for my clients neck. It was a good price too.</li>
            <li> Great bowl and great price. Only one problem... there is no paperwork included in the box for the city plumbing inspectors to review the specs on the bowl. So my salon passed all inspections except for my plumbing. But luckily, the inspector gave me a break &amp; passed me two days later. So, this is a great bowl, easy to clean and looks great. Customers notice immediately how professional it looks.</li>
            <li> Looks INSANELY gorgeous in my custom made backwash cabinet.  Came with everything the plumber needed and was packed super well.  Arrived fast too.  I love that this is a bit different than the classic white or black sinks out there.  And it&#x27;s just as larger (or larger) than most European style oval/round bowls on the market.</li>
            <li> These Sinks look great. The hoses are noisey tho.  May have to replace them. Easy to clean, light to install.  The neck cushion is soft.</li>
            <li> The sink is absolutely beautiful! It is a conversation piece in my salon and everyone likes it.</li>
            <li> Brand new with no flaws, item is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Great looking, comfortable.</li>
            <li> Super sharp looking sinks for our new shop, w&#x3D;easy to order and communicate with seller. Great value!</li>
            <li> this product met my expectations and is easy to clean easy to assemble!!!! vacuum breaker included in the price and a very sturdy!!!</li>
            <li> I have busy salon of 15 years. I can&#x27;t allow a thing like the shampoo bowl to slow my business down.  I sink didn&#x27;t come with the brackets that is on the instructions. My plumber used the one provided and it fit awful. The water, shampoo and other left ugly water makes and visable stains. This was not going to work. I had it up for only one day and I said take it down. I wish I could send it back but I had it for a little while until I was ready to use it. I was going to buy another one so that the shampoo bowls could match but I quickly told my plumber to take it down and put back the  bowl. I know it was more expensive than the traditional black shampoo bowls but I always try to offer my clients something nice and different. A waste of my hard earned $200</li>
