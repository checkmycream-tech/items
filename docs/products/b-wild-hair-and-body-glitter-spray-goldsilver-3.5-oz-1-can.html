            <li>The gold/silver is a good combo.</li>
            <li>good luck getting any of it on your body.</li>
            <li>I loved this stuff.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Most of the glitter particles fly all around and don&#x27;t stick where you need them to.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I really liked how well it stuck to my clothes and skin</li>
            <li>looks nice on skin and light-brown hair.</li>
            <li>but after it dries it kind of looks like sand on your body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The staying power is very good on the skin, but only good in the hair.  </li>
            <li>this is the best glitter spray on the market it falls like snow quiet</li>
            <li>Hopefully if i order more, this problem will be solved.   </li>
            <li>so I put on some more.</li>
            <li>Very sparkly and great for  hair or skin.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>But this IS sparkly for sure</li>
            <li>so i guess i better get me some as well.</li>
            <li>I sprayed this over metallic body paint to give it a more shimmery look and that did the trick.</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product isn&#x27;t my favorite smell.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with makeup glitter that you brush on if you&#x27;re using it for  body glitter..</li>
            <li>We kept adding more and more.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you are using this for going out or a wedding it would be more subdued.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with this product, I really love it</li>
            <li>that means it can be sprayed on anything and will not be wet its silky and flawless</li>
            <li>It is real fun to sparkle during the holidays.</li>
            <li>It more so sprays like a strong gust of air full of sparkles</li>
            <li>The spray also works beautifully and gave that extra sparkle to my daughter on the dance floor.</li>
            <li>so do a little at a time to see what&#x27;s best</li>
            <li>I liked this spray but it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not like hair spray where it sticks to you which if you are spraying on your body</li>
            <li>it was def there and the light of a house will show the sparkles but the light at a club</li>
            <li>amd needed a cheap way to add metal flake to some custom paint work.</li>
            <li>Love it exactly what I want it</li>
            <li>The glitter is very fine and goes straight to the scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just SO much to clean up even after you&#x27;ve tried already</li>
            <li>Nozzle clogs fast, but I love the spray.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good thing because you don&#x27;t want to feel gross and sticky</li>
            <li>I got enough sparkles on me though which was good</li>
            <li>what that means, but the good thing is, the smell is very short lived; it lasts for maybe 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>not the full effect anyway.</li>
            <li>But its looks good, its doesnt look tacky or gross, like its not hairspray.</li>
            <li>this is cause this spray was made with perfection when it was made the gold alone is the same silky and silver alone so gold/silver is as good both even if you are doing a project it will be good for that i use on body and face over makeup for pictures very dry and is smooth to the spraying,happy buying on this product</li>
            <li>Great product but a little overpriced</li>
            <li>and shimmery it was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Sparkly and fun and</li>
            <li>Works great for my little  dancer!</li>
            <li>It looks fun when you first spray it</li>
            <li>Finished the entire bottle in one day!!! :)</li>
            <li>SO pretty and sparkly.</li>
            <li>So pretty on.</li>
            <li>We wanted something more theatrical.</li>
            <li>exactly what my daughters were looking for.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried this on my skin yet but tested it out on a napkin and its really pretty and sparkly.</li>
            <li>BUT just a warning its really stinky and smells really strongly like old grandma perfume.</li>
            <li>We were actually very excited to receive that we recceived the spray a day before we left for competition.</li>
            <li>I felt that the glitter spray was so fine that it was barely noticeable in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I was sparkling all night long. :-)</li>
            <li>Also, why does the spray have a very strong perfumey smell, as other reviewers have stated?</li>
            <li>This one was great and didn&#x27;t make a giant mess everywhere like others I have purchased before.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is highly pressurized, so don&#x27;t be too startled by the blast, but I recommend spraying it away from you the first time you use it just so you can get a feel for the type of pressure you need to</li>
            <li>I did like it enough to buy again and it was cheap</li>
            <li>and we wanted her really glittery.  </li>
            <li>I feel as if I have to spray too much to notice it.</li>
            <li>It performed better than I couldve expected.</li>
            <li>I would appreciate the seller to have more common sense and send the product in a box or more padding because this isn&#x27;t acceptable, especially when you pay $8 for something.</li>
            <li>I think if she had black hair perhaps it would show up more.</li>
            <li>but if I do buy it again I would definitely buy more than one, as a back up.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Works great, a little pricey, can doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I love how glittery this is both on skin and in hair, but the smell is very strong and unpleasant and it didn&#x27;t seem to dissipate over the course of an hour.</li>
            <li>I have a tradition to spray some sparkle on my hair between Thanksgiving and New Years every year.</li>
            <li>Since I dont own any air brushing equipment, I tried using hair glitter a few years back.</li>
            <li>I applied it outside and it didn&#x27;t seem to sparkle that much</li>
            <li>My daughters are gymnasts and need some sparkle action in their hair for a competition.</li>
            <li>Its not even possible to tell the difference between a real flaked paint job and my hair spray flake job.</li>
            <li>It is not the type of clog that you get out with some warm water, the pump is actually broken.  </li>
            <li>We went through it in the first use only because we sprayed so much of it on 5 different people...</li>
            <li>Fun stuff, does not last long though.</li>
            <li>I had to come write a review since my use for this is not conventional by any means.</li>
            <li>My bathroom still looks like a golden sparkly mess</li>
            <li>you can find this at Walgreen&#x27;s too for about the same price.i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I barely see any on the hair.  </li>
            <li>You can barely tell there is anything on your hair.</li>
            <li>Itemed arrived quickly but not satisfied with the outcome.   </li>
            <li>I bought this product for when I feel I need a little bit of sparkle in my life, which is pretty often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ended up using the whole bottle on one dress, and within a couple hours about a third of the glitter had found its way into the carpet or on other people</li>
            <li>It can weigh down your hair if you spray too much..</li>
            <li>and you use it all pretty fast and after a few sprays it stops blowing out glitter and instead blows out plain air.</li>
            <li>clear coated it with a few layers of acrylic clear coat paint.</li>

            <li> Messy and not very thin when applied</li>
            <li> There are other body sprays that are lighter and less intense</li>
            <li> The hair spray does not smell bad, has nice sparkles and goes on well.</li>
            <li> i can spray it over makeup and even wet sufaces like wet hair and clothes even holloween makeup wigs or on the skin for a glitter experience silk and crystal like its the longest lasting spray it on anything and it will gleam</li>
            <li> and it is very dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very glittery.</li>
            <li> I had to apply it five times so that it was minimally visible.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Careful when you spray not to get it all on your clothes too!</li>
            <li> I let it cure for half a day then</li>
            <li> but when I started to used it something happened and the little hole where the spray goes out damaged and couldn´t use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> My little girl loves the sparkle in her hair.</li>
            <li> it tends to wane of a little.</li>
            <li> Its a big Hollywood secret</li>
            <li> Not sure if this goes away over time or not..</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t hard on it.  </li>
            <li> I mean EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> and if you sweat it would feel even worse.</li>
            <li> But now it is broken.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than hair spray in terms of smelling like alcohal.</li>
            <li> but it did not feel sticky or uncomfortable at all.  </li>
            <li> And it weirdly smells food too?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid</li>
            <li> but this is just a tad step up (not TOO crazy uness</li>
            <li> ; aerosol base seems unhealthy for the skin</li>
            <li> for the glitter part, I bought silver and was disappointed with the amount of sparkle.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is the smell.</li>

            <li> this is the best glitter spray on the market it falls like snow quiet and it is very dry that means it can be sprayed on anything and will not be wet its silky and flawless i can spray it over makeup and even wet sufaces like wet hair and clothes even holloween makeup wigs or on the skin for a glitter experience silk and crystal like its the longest lasting spray it on anything and it will gleam this is cause this spray was made with perfection when it was made the gold alone is the same silky and silver alone so gold/silver is as good both even if you are doing a project it will be good for that i use on body and face over makeup for pictures very dry and is smooth to the spraying,happy buying on this product im on my second can it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> It is real fun to sparkle during the holidays. I have a tradition to spray some sparkle on my hair between Thanksgiving and New Years every year.</li>
            <li> Used this for a Halloween costume.  I really liked how well it stuck to my clothes and skin but it did not feel sticky or uncomfortable at all.  I was sparkling all night long. :-)</li>
            <li> I just received the BWILD \\&quot;glitter gold and silver spray.\\&quot; I opened the \\&quot;bubbler mailer\\&quot; and found the cap cracked. It doesn&#x27;t close properly. I&#x27;m afraid if i take it anywhere in my bag, it might leak. I would appreciate the seller to have more common sense and send the product in a box or more padding because this isn&#x27;t acceptable, especially when you pay $8 for something. Hopefully if i order more, this problem will be solved.   Itemed arrived quickly but not satisfied with the outcome.   Also, why does the spray have a very strong perfumey smell, as other reviewers have stated? Is there a way to fix that??  thank you!</li>
            <li> Used on pageant girls and they just loved it and kept wanting more!!!  Finished the entire bottle in one day!!! :)</li>
            <li> Love it exactly what I want it</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I applied it outside and it didn&#x27;t seem to sparkle that much so I put on some more. When I went inside I looked like a vampire from Twilight.</li>
            <li> Nozzle clogs fast, but I love the spray.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t look glittery</li>
            <li> SO pretty and sparkly. Very sparkly and great for  hair or skin. The gold/silver is a good combo. looks nice on skin and light-brown hair. Careful when you spray not to get it all on your clothes too! :) But this IS sparkly for sure so if that&#x27;s what you want then it&#x27;s perfect!. There are other body sprays that are lighter and less intense but this is just a tad step up (not TOO crazy uness you spray a LOT) It can weigh down your hair if you spray too much.. so do a little at a time to see what&#x27;s best</li>
            <li> Love this! And it weirdly smells food too? lol</li>
            <li> The glitter looks great but good luck getting any of it on your body. Most of the glitter particles fly all around and don&#x27;t stick where you need them to.</li>
            <li> Messy and not very thin when applied</li>
            <li> Great product but a little overpriced</li>
            <li> We were actually very excited to receive that we recceived the spray a day before we left for competition. The spray also works beautifully and gave that extra sparkle to my daughter on the dance floor. Thank you</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff. We went through it in the first use only because we sprayed so much of it on 5 different people... 2x! It worked great.</li>
            <li> Does this come.with three or one can?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in hair. Doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> my mom raved about this B-wild hair and body glitter so i ordered it for her and she loved it. It took us forever to find and i searched for hours online (so big ups to Amazon for actually selling it). Its a big Hollywood secret so i guess i better get me some as well.</li>
            <li> I liked this spray but it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not like hair spray where it sticks to you which if you are spraying on your body it&#x27;s a good thing because you don&#x27;t want to feel gross and sticky and if you sweat it would feel even worse. It more so sprays like a strong gust of air full of sparkles lol and there are a TON of sparkles. I couldn&#x27;t see it in my hair since my hair color is already a goldish color but looking in the mirror it was def there and the light of a house will show the sparkles but the light at a club won&#x27;t however i DID see it all over my body. It made so so glittery and shimmery it was pretty cool. The only thing is it looks like the glitter is all concentrated at the bottom even if you shake it up and you use it all pretty fast and after a few sprays it stops blowing out glitter and instead blows out plain air. I got enough sparkles on me though which was good but it feels like a one time use sort of product. Another thing I will mention is this stuff gets EVERYWHERE. I mean EVERYWHERE. It blows out in such a way that the sparkles explode all over the place. My bathroom still looks like a golden sparkly mess and I used this stuff a week ago. It&#x27;s just SO much to clean up even after you&#x27;ve tried already lol. I sprayed this over metallic body paint to give it a more shimmery look and that did the trick.</li>
            <li> It is awesome hairspray…I used it on my daughter and sprayed it on her tooth fairy money.  But now it is broken.  It is not the type of clog that you get out with some warm water, the pump is actually broken.  I wasn&#x27;t hard on it.  I did like it enough to buy again and it was cheap but if I do buy it again I would definitely buy more than one, as a back up.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for when I feel I need a little bit of sparkle in my life, which is pretty often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The staying power is very good on the skin, but only good in the hair.  There may be some staying tricks I need to follow, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is highly pressurized, so don&#x27;t be too startled by the blast, but I recommend spraying it away from you the first time you use it just so you can get a feel for the type of pressure you need to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product isn&#x27;t my favorite smell.  Someone close to me told me it smells like a dollar store.  I have no idea what that means, but the good thing is, the smell is very short lived; it lasts for maybe 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfect for skin and hair you can find this at Walgreen&#x27;s too for about the same price.i have sensitive skin and this does not irritate . Reccommend .</li>
            <li> This product works well.  Great glitter effect to hair. Since glitter will go everywhere, stand in the tub when spraying for easier clean-up, or go outside.  You will glitter and look glamorous.</li>
            <li> I love how glittery this is both on skin and in hair, but the smell is very strong and unpleasant and it didn&#x27;t seem to dissipate over the course of an hour.</li>
            <li> So pretty on. So sparkly</li>
            <li> It looks fun when you first spray it but after it dries it kind of looks like sand on your body. It&#x27;s not very glittery. You&#x27;re better off with makeup glitter that you brush on if you&#x27;re using it for  body glitter..</li>
            <li> I felt that the glitter spray was so fine that it was barely noticeable in my daughter&#x27;s hair. We kept adding more and more.  She was supposed to be a star and we wanted her really glittery.  It didn&#x27;t work as we wanted it to. We wanted something more theatrical. Perhaps if you are using this for going out or a wedding it would be more subdued.</li>
            <li> Ended up using the whole bottle on one dress, and within a couple hours about a third of the glitter had found its way into the carpet or on other people</li>
            <li> I had a problem with this product, I really love it but when I started to used it something happened and the little hole where the spray goes out damaged and couldn´t use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> Product did not come out uniformly. I had to apply it five times so that it was minimally visible. Won&#x27;t purchase again. Would have returned but didn&#x27;t want the hassel.</li>
            <li> The worst part is the smell. It&#x27;s worse than hair spray in terms of smelling like alcohal. Yuck! It smells toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the glitter part, I bought silver and was disappointed with the amount of sparkle.  The glitter is very fine and goes straight to the scalp. I barely see any on the hair.  I can see it in her scalp, though. My daughter at 4 loves it.  I think if she had black hair perhaps it would show up more. I feel as if I have to spray too much to notice it.</li>
            <li> Works great, a little pricey, can doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My daughters are gymnasts and need some sparkle action in their hair for a competition. This one was great and didn&#x27;t make a giant mess everywhere like others I have purchased before.  Sparkly and fun and exactly what my daughters were looking for.</li>
            <li> Glittery but the &amp;#34;highly flammable&amp;#34; aerosol base seems unhealthy for the skin</li>
            <li> The hair spray does not smell bad, has nice sparkles and goes on well. My little girl loves the sparkle in her hair.</li>
            <li> I had to come write a review since my use for this is not conventional by any means. I build scale model cars amd needed a cheap way to add metal flake to some custom paint work. Since I dont own any air brushing equipment, I tried using hair glitter a few years back. It worked so I recently purchased this hair and body glitter product. It performed better than I couldve expected. Its not even possible to tell the difference between a real flaked paint job and my hair spray flake job. I let it cure for half a day then clear coated it with a few layers of acrylic clear coat paint. Beautiful flake, excellent even coverage. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fun stuff, does not last long though. not the full effect anyway. it tends to wane of a little. but I like it anyway</li>
            <li> Works great for my little  dancer!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this on my skin yet but tested it out on a napkin and its really pretty and sparkly. BUT just a warning its really stinky and smells really strongly like old grandma perfume. Not sure if this goes away over time or not..</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I havent used it on my body, only on my hair. But its looks good, its doesnt look tacky or gross, like its not hairspray. You can barely tell there is anything on your hair. The only thing I would recommend is doing it outside, because I did my hair in my room and there is still glitter all over my wall and floor!</li>
