            <li>I love this, it is one of Estee&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li>This is a good one</li>
            <li>Ladies, want compliments on how good you smell, wear this cologne.  </li>
            <li>someone always tells me how good I smell.</li>
            <li>brought it for a gift they loved it</li>
            <li>The smooth vanilla, amber, and others, perfectly blended.</li>
            <li>this one is not the lovely, beautiful scent that I am accustomed to from Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li>My very favorite.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is truly an amazing place to shop.</li>
            <li>Ohhhhh I love this perfume and the &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; is the formula to buy.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this perfume, receive many complements</li>
            <li>I love Estee Lauder fragrances</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years</li>
            <li>This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumer spray.  </li>
            <li>If anyone remembers Youth Dew it is the most old-ladyish aldehyde smelling perfume on the planet.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is a favorite for my mom.</li>
            <li>I only could afford this truly wonderful perfume, maybe once a year.  </li>
            <li>I love this cologne</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon was able to provide it.</li>
            <li>Just what she wanted and at a better price than box stores.</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I love it too.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found it on the Amazon.</li>
            <li>So, as I dearly enjoyed the scent of &amp;#34;Spellbound,&amp;#34; we bought a cheap plastic dispenser at a discount store and pried the cap off of the bottle and poured the cologne spray into the  plastic dispenser to be able to use what I had purchased.&lt;br /&gt;~Sherry</li>
            <li>This perfume is my favorite and it smells clean and you won&#x27;t get a headache from it because it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>and it had a wonderfully unique, spicy, clove smell</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, it is long lasting and very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>But for me, it is cloying and just almost sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it for years and constantly get comments (especially from males) on how wonderful the fragrance is.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>and i really enjoy the smell so much.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the better scents available.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bold, spicy scent with an under note of fruit.&lt;br /&gt;Every one comments on how much they lke it</li>
            <li>This was for a gift and the exact perfume was requested so there fore</li>
            <li>This is my signature scent I&#x27;ve been wearing it since it first came out in 1991.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for over 10 years and it never fails.....</li>
            <li>My son had bought this for me many, many years ago and of course there&#x27;s sentimental feelings because of this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume based on my love of Estee Lauder and hearing another White Linen lover loves this.</li>
            <li>I wore it in 1991 - when it had first debuted.</li>
            <li>I constantly get compliments from young to older people about how good I spell and what is that fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for a long time and get many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Estee Lauder products are good - and the scents last a long time.</li>
            <li>Iit  does certainly creates a spellbinding aura around the one wearing that scent</li>
            <li>I was really very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I am assuming it was received with much enthusiasm</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>verry much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon, you have it in.</li>
            <li>Like they filled the original formula with half a bottle of Youth Dew!  </li>
            <li>It seems that once someone finds a fragrance or lipstick shad or other product that they love, it becomes discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Classic scent of floral &amp; sandalwood.</li>
            <li>No long lines and no crazy drivers to contend with.</li>
            <li>And the White Linen line is my favorite - clean scents that are NEVER overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Very feminine and soft.</li>
            <li>An original smell is THE smell, if you&#x27;re going to change something as specific to the human brain as a SMELL, please also change the name of the fragrance and give it new packaging.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much ONLY use Estee Lauder cosmetics and fragrances.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted a bottle ever since I first smelled it way back in the early 90s</li>
            <li>Smelled like the bottle was old</li>
            <li>but I know she will be surprised.</li>
            <li>This is a long wearaing and very distink smell.  </li>
            <li>however, this to me was not the same as the one I normally purchas at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The perfume is as expected, but the bottle itself doesn&#x27;t spray the liquid very well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m unfortunately spent my limit on orders now, however I have been a long time fan of Spellbound.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I will not use any other perfume.</li>
            <li> This is just not right.  </li>

            <li> It smells nothing like what I remember from a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> The return policy was clearly understood that is was impossible to do so.  </li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find?  </li>
            <li> Hard to find sometimes in stores.</li>
            <li> I finally ordered a bottle from Macy&#x27;s (sorry, not from here, but it made me so mad</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed with this dispenser as the sprayer was somehow broken and would not spray.  </li>
            <li> Perfume is perfume and if what you like there is no reason to provide a bad review.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had to come here and gripe) and it smells TERRIBLE!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The perfume is as expected, but the bottle itself doesn&#x27;t spray the liquid very well. I have to pump it several times to get just a bit out.</li>
            <li> I am based in Malaysia and tried ordering this product online from Amazon.com, but was informed that this product only shipped to US. I was really very dissapointed. I hope Amazon.com would reconsider their shipping rules as this could increase their global reach.</li>
            <li> Ohhhhh I love this perfume and the &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; is the formula to buy. It lasts all day. The scent is a bold, spicy scent with an under note of fruit.&lt;br /&gt;Every one comments on how much they lke it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of estee lauder&#x27;s perfumes.This is a good one and i really enjoy the smell so much.Very feminine and soft.</li>
            <li> One of the best scents out there!!</li>
            <li> I worked with a woman that wore Spellbound and it was wonderful. She got tons of compliments. I finally got some for myself and I could swear it&#x27;s not the same perfume. I realize it may smell differently on some people but not that differently. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume, receive many complements</li>
            <li> Smelled like the bottle was old</li>
            <li> Not the scent for me, too medicinal and not at all flattering. I love Estee Lauder fragrances&lt;br /&gt;but this one is not the lovely, beautiful scent that I am accustomed to from Estee Lauder. I returned&lt;br /&gt;for an exchange</li>
            <li> The scent did not last at all.  I have been using this for many years however, this to me was not the same as the one I normally purchas at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is just not right.  It smells nothing like what I remember from a few years ago.  Of course, I prefer the lotion over the cologne.  Always have but I cannot find the lotion anywhere.  Perhaps it is no longer manufactured.  I do  not recommend this product at all if you are wanting the fragrance as it used to be.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume stay on smell wonderful. when I wear it everyone always asks me what im wearing..</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed with this dispenser as the sprayer was somehow broken and would not spray.  The return policy was clearly understood that is was impossible to do so.  So, as I dearly enjoyed the scent of &amp;#34;Spellbound,&amp;#34; we bought a cheap plastic dispenser at a discount store and pried the cap off of the bottle and poured the cologne spray into the  plastic dispenser to be able to use what I had purchased.&lt;br /&gt;~Sherry Gudgeon</li>
            <li> This was for a gift and the exact perfume was requested so there fore I am assuming it was received with much enthusiasm</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites.  I have used it for a long time and get many compliments.  It seems to last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Perfume is perfume and if what you like there is no reason to provide a bad review.  It is what it is.</li>
            <li> This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumer spray.  I must admit that the it is Spellbound for me as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling perfume I have ever had. I&#x27;ve worn it for years and constantly get comments (especially from males) on how wonderful the fragrance is.  I even had a co-worker purchase it for his wife but he says it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on her so I guess all fragrances are not for all people.</li>
            <li> What HAPPENED to this perfume??  I&#x27;ve wanted a bottle ever since I first smelled it way back in the early 90s and it had a wonderfully unique, spicy, clove smell I&#x27;ve been longing for.  I finally ordered a bottle from Macy&#x27;s (sorry, not from here, but it made me so mad I had to come here and gripe) and it smells TERRIBLE!  Like they filled the original formula with half a bottle of Youth Dew!  If anyone remembers Youth Dew it is the most old-ladyish aldehyde smelling perfume on the planet.  Why do designers do this?  An original smell is THE smell, if you&#x27;re going to change something as specific to the human brain as a SMELL, please also change the name of the fragrance and give it new packaging.  ICK!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a favorite for my mom. The product arrived promptly and in excellent condition. My mother was  delighted which made me very happy.</li>
            <li> I only could afford this truly wonderful perfume, maybe once a year.  I am complimented by even strangers when I wear Spellbound.  Now I can afford this product because I do not have to pay Macy&#x27;s prices.  Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> spellbound is the most awesome fall scent. I love this cologne</li>
            <li> I have to give a 5 star rating for this product because I bought it as a surprise gift for my wife. She has been craving this perfume forever, so I decided to buy it for her as a surprise and boy.. was she over the moon when she received it.</li>
            <li> I constantly get compliments from young to older people about how good I spell and what is that fragrance.  This perfume is my favorite and it smells clean and you won&#x27;t get a headache from it because it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Luv this perfume. I have used it for years. I will not use any other perfume. I was so happy to find it at Amozon.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent I&#x27;ve been wearing it since it first came out in 1991. The shipping was fast and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a friend as a gift.  Why is it so hard to find?  It seems that once someone finds a fragrance or lipstick shad or other product that they love, it becomes discontinued.  Glad Amazon was able to provide it.</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted and at a better price than box stores. No long lines and no crazy drivers to contend with.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, it is long lasting and very pleasant.  Received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite perfume. Everytime I wear it, I always get asked..&amp;#34;what are you wearing..it smells so good&amp;#34; Not just woman, but men too...my husband hates that...LoL</li>
            <li> So very happy I found this perfume on your site. Will buy more in the future.  And may also buy some as gifts.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a long wearaing and very distink smell.  My boyfriend loves it, and recommendes it to all the ladies.  He can pick it out in a crowd.  I love it too.  My very favorite.</li>
            <li> Ladies, want compliments on how good you smell, wear this cologne.  It lasts all day and a little bit goes a long way.  Been using this product for over 10 years and it never fails.....someone always tells me how good I smell. Worth the money</li>
            <li> I love this, it is one of Estee&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this perfume spray for years. Didn&#x27;t think they made it anymore. Checked on line for it and was so happy I could purchase it. My son had bought this for me many, many years ago and of course there&#x27;s sentimental feelings because of this. Spray is just like I remembered it. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My sister in law loves this!</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the better scents available. Iit  does certainly creates a spellbinding aura around the one wearing that scent</li>
            <li> brought it for a gift they loved it verry much it smells great too I would buy again thank you</li>
            <li> Classic scent of floral &amp; sandalwood. Hard to find sometimes in stores.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Estee Lauder. And the White Linen line is my favorite - clean scents that are NEVER overwhelming. I had heard someone say this scent is like that - it isn&#x27;t to me, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL Estee Lauder products are good - and the scents last a long time. I pretty much ONLY use Estee Lauder cosmetics and fragrances. I purchased this perfume based on my love of Estee Lauder and hearing another White Linen lover loves this. But for me, it is cloying and just almost sickeningly sweet. It&#x27;s too much for me. I&#x27;m going to try to sell it on eBay.</li>
            <li> After trying very hard to recall its name, I have finally found it. I wore it in 1991 - when it had first debuted. I received so many compliments. I am so glad to have found it on the Amazon. It is truly an amazing place to shop. They do virtually have all products that you can imagine. It is an evening scent, so must use sparringly for the day hours. Can&#x27;t guess how it will smell on others, but I just like it alot! The smooth vanilla, amber, and others, perfectly blended. Exquisite scent. ~KHH</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use.  I have used Spellbound for years and will not change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unfortunately spent my limit on orders now, however I have been a long time fan of Spellbound. Omg I have not had spellbound since 2001. I couldn&#x27;t find any. I thought it was not around anymore.  Thanks amazon, you have it in.</li>
            <li> My wife has not opened this up yet but I know she will be surprised.</li>
