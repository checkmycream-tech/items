            <li>It dawned on me that I can just purchase the Nice&#x27;n Easy Color tint at $6.97 plus taxt a retail store which will contain this great Nice&#x27;n Easy conditioner.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to purchase it at the drugstore, but had not been able to find it for months!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome once a week conditioner to use with Clairol Natural Instincts hair color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
            <li>Out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried - professional and drugstore brands included - this is one of the best!</li>
            <li>I love this product so much amazing.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST conditioner I ever used.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, shiny and smelling great!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, colored &amp; perm.  </li>
            <li>Clairol has discontinued Nice&#x27;n Easy ColorSeal Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Save your money, go to the store and buy Clairol Nice &amp; Easy hair coloring.</li>
            <li>A sample of this Nice &#x27;n Easy conditioner was included with my hair dye.  </li>
            <li>I paid about $6.97 plus tax at a retail store for the Nice&#x27;n Easy Permanent Color which included the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this conditionor.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Plan on getting lots more.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, many \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; treatments that swear this and that and its all baloney.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>, I am in love with the product, and will be purchasing much more of it.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find it in stores and</li>
            <li>so pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>But I purchased the gloss treatment thinking it was more.  </li>
            <li>but it is my fault for not reading more in to it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the hair color any more and just wanted the treatment.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the product and recommend it to anyone with hair issues.  </li>
            <li>Seems like this works better than most conditioners I have tried for color treated hair, also travels well and fits easily in overnight bag</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to find this - I was told it was available - but could not find it anywhere - not Target, Walgreens, Walmart, etc. -</li>
            <li>While the Clairol is still available in the Nice&#x27;n Easy boxes, it is no longer available as a stand-alone</li>
            <li>This product is great for my hair making them so shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Used to be able to find this in the local stores but great to find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It gives your hair a great shine and a soft, smooth feel.  </li>
            <li>When I received the Nice&#x27;n Easy Color Seal, I noticed it&#x27;s the same size as the one included in Nice&#x27;n Easy Color Permanent Color box.  </li>
            <li>and this really makes my hair smooth and shiny - even in humid weather!!</li>
            <li>Great product left my hair looking smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>but this keeps my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Then it was available alone for a while until I could no longer find it in store.  </li>
            <li>Thank&lt;br /&gt;you for making this product available.</li>
            <li>I wish it was still available.  </li>
            <li>This is the same great product that comes with the hair dye.</li>
            <li>Great product for use once a week or so in addition to the regular shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I tried conditioners by Paiul Mitchel but in my opinion the Clairol Intensive therapy  conditioner is far superior.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week and for special occasions, and I take it as my travel conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I loved the instant softness that this product provided to my hair.</li>
            <li>I asked for a full refund plus the cost of shipping and got it</li>
            <li>This is the stuff in the old Loving Care coloring.</li>
            <li>blow drying my hair straight to get my hair shiny, smooth and prepped for hot rollers!!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to finally find this product online at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Way over priced and the laugh is on me.</li>
            <li>Although they seem to be a little controversial, I love their  affect on my hair.</li>
            <li>I found this stuff in a bottle of hair dye and after a couple uses found it online and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>I have found some others that are almost as good but are less money.  </li>
            <li>Excellent service as  usual!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li>However, I do use hot rollers and hair dryer.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product, I immediately returned to the store to see if it could be purchased separately</li>
            <li>I first tried this product because it was part of a color box.  </li>
            <li>is why it was higher than advertised.</li>
            <li>so soft, &amp; tangle free</li>
            <li>Yep, like others, it came with the hair color and OMG, it really works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very leery changing products as the Pantene ingredients are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks so much...</li>
            <li>Why would anyone in their right mind pay 19.99 for this when they can go to walmart and buy a box with the exact same size for 6.50?</li>
            <li>Works really well for dry hair, glad I use it to keep my hair younger looking.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to achieve such softness as far as conditioning unless I apply a conditioning product, apply a plastic cap and sit under my hair dryer for 30 minutes or more; this is one of those products that can achieve those same results in a shorter period of time or if you are short on time and still desired that deep moisturized effect.</li>
            <li>I would use it more, but it is a little pricey.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and frizzy in its natural state</li>
            <li>and I was not able to find it in any of the local grocery or drug stores, I then searched on line and came across the Clairol&#x27;s nice&#x27;n&#x27;easy intensive treatment and this product provides the exact same results as the color treat (obviously because they&#x27;re both made by Clairol)</li>
            <li>I have dry, coarse hair and tried MANY products.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>This color seal that they are selling is the EXACT same product (and size) that comes in a $7.00 box of Clairol hair dye and these people are selling it for $16.99.</li>
            <li>Not so, it was light weight, left my hair very manageble &amp; extremely shinny.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought it would leave my hair flat.  </li>
            <li>Just a little bit made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I think this is the same color fast conditioner that comes with Natural Instincts color.  </li>
            <li>And soft and shiney too.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and looks so shiny.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is the ultimate in moisture, manageability, shine, THE WHOLE PACKAGE.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and controlled but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I am highly sensitive to perfumed products, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me.</li>
            <li>So considering at its most expensive a box of hair color is about $7 and usually you can find a coupon online for $3 off the most you should pay for this product is $4-$5 not $15.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry place, and this makes my hair feel delightfully soft and silky.   </li>
            <li>I was initially introduced to this product through my purchases of the Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts hair color, a 1 oz sample (called color treat) is included with the hair color</li>
            <li>Instead of searching in local stores, in the future  I will go directly to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I live in south Louisiana and it&#x27;s always 100% humid along with extreme heat in the summer months.  </li>

            <li> At first, I thought it would leave my hair flat.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I think this is the same color fast conditioner that comes with Natural Instincts color.  </li>
            <li> And soft and shiney too.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and looks so shiny.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is the ultimate in moisture, manageability, shine, THE WHOLE PACKAGE.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and controlled but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive to perfumed products, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me.</li>
            <li> So considering at its most expensive a box of hair color is about $7 and usually you can find a coupon online for $3 off the most you should pay for this product is $4-$5 not $15.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry place, and this makes my hair feel delightfully soft and silky.   </li>
            <li> I was initially introduced to this product through my purchases of the Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts hair color, a 1 oz sample (called color treat) is included with the hair color</li>
            <li> Instead of searching in local stores, in the future  I will go directly to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I live in south Louisiana and it&#x27;s always 100% humid along with extreme heat in the summer months.  </li>
            <li> It gives my highlights a long lasting effect.</li>
            <li> A definite must for my extremely dry hair.  </li>
            <li> This i ordered for a friend a long time ago.</li>
            <li> My hair gets really dry.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the tube was so small.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t be surprised at the small size.  </li>
            <li> and you have very dry hair</li>
            <li> I expected a standard size conditioner tube but it is about half that size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding it harder to find this product by itself without having to buy the hair color as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s not available in larger quantities because I would purchase it by the BARREL.</li>
            <li> that work, and you can find them in other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I could go to grocery store and buy it for half the cost.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap, you&#x27;d be waaay better off just buying the hair dye kit and using the conditioner in it1</li>
            <li> and so when I straighten it, it becomes dry and dull.</li>
            <li> To purchase just the conditioner through Amazon it cost a little over $8.00.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> I did not realize however that the price I paid was for one little tube.</li>
            <li> A little pricy.  </li>
            <li> But with the use of this product, my hair is soft, shiny, no-frizz, and absolutely manageable for a change in this horrible climate.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what that meant, and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> But with my trusty Amazon site, I can always get the hard to find products.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately hard to find</li>
            <li> and I have thick (4A/B) relaxed hair</li>
            <li> My son told me the other day that my hair looked frizzy - yikes!!!!  </li>
            <li> Having parents that are Dominican, I am constantly caught between the \\&quot;bad hair/good hair\\&quot; discussion with people.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works great...just too expensive to use every day.</li>
            <li> The smell is stronger than the one in the box, but not so bad that I cannot tolerate it.</li>
            <li> It is terrible how some people try to make a dollar off off ripping people off.</li>

            <li> Works really well for dry hair, glad I use it to keep my hair younger looking. And soft and shiney too.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy and it&#x27;s really hard to find in stores.  This is an awesome once a week conditioner to use with Clairol Natural Instincts hair color.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I no longer color my hair, but I still use this treatment on my hair once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding it harder to find this product by itself without having to buy the hair color as well. It works perfectly on my hair. It&#x27;s probably the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
            <li> Clairol has discontinued Nice&#x27;n Easy ColorSeal Conditioner.Hats off to Amazon.com for providing a source.Merchandise arrived on time.Excellent service as  usual!!!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this conditionor.  I have very fine hair, colored &amp; perm.  At first, I thought it would leave my hair flat.  Not so, it was light weight, left my hair very manageble &amp; extremely shinny.  HOWEVER, I CAN NO LONGER FIND IT IN THE STORES.. AMAZON is the best way to go, keep it coming!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have dry, coarse hair and tried MANY products. but this keeps my hair smooth and shiny.  This is the same tube you would get at a grocery store with the hair color package for about $7. Save your money, go to the store and buy Clairol Nice &amp; Easy hair coloring. You&#x27;ll definitely save money...and no shipping</li>
            <li> Dont buy this colorseal conditioner from these people! This color seal that they are selling is the EXACT same product (and size) that comes in a $7.00 box of Clairol hair dye and these people are selling it for $16.99. It is terrible how some people try to make a dollar off off ripping people off.</li>
            <li> The product was received promptly.  I&#x27;ve used it before and find it to work well for my colored hair.</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to find this - I was told it was available - but could not find it anywhere - not Target, Walgreens, Walmart, etc. - but knew I could get it here - love the product!</li>
            <li> I found this stuff in a bottle of hair dye and after a couple uses found it online and ordered it right away.  Out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried - professional and drugstore brands included - this is one of the best!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my over bleached hair to soften which it does. As a teen I used the Clairol conditioner on my bleached hair but sat for an hour with towel wrapped around my head. Now you can achieve the same results in 3 minutes. I tried conditioners by Paiul Mitchel but in my opinion the Clairol Intensive therapy  conditioner is far superior. Haven&#x27;t found in stores yet.    Peg R.   Pasadena,Ca.</li>
            <li> One of my friends is a hair dresser and recommended this stuff to me when I visited Belize for my hair that she had recently colored for me.  I have to say my color has lasted longer than it ever has this time and the conditioning aspect of this product beats anything else I have ever tried!  Love this product.  Plan on getting lots more.  Doc</li>
            <li> Do not buy!!!  This is a tube out of hair color box.  I could go to grocery store and buy it for half the cost.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much amazing. I love love love!!!</li>
            <li> A sample of this Nice &#x27;n Easy conditioner was included with my hair dye.  It&#x27;s so wonderful, I&#x27;ve never used a conditioner like it before.  I thought I&#x27;d look to see if they sold it separately and they do!  My hair feels soft and looks so shiny.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Yep, like others, it came with the hair color and OMG, it really works.  I have tried many, many \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; treatments that swear this and that and its all baloney.  My son told me the other day that my hair looked frizzy - yikes!!!!  I live in south Louisiana and it&#x27;s always 100% humid along with extreme heat in the summer months.  But with the use of this product, my hair is soft, shiny, no-frizz, and absolutely manageable for a change in this horrible climate.  So, I was delighted to see it written on the tube that you could buy this product separate.  I looked at several locations but it was unavailable.  But with my trusty Amazon site, I can always get the hard to find products.  Thank you Amazon and thank you Clairol!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ever hair conditioner out there and this really makes my hair smooth and shiny - even in humid weather!! Definitely ordering more. For me, I only need to use it once a week! It&#x27;s great! I don&#x27;t color or perm my hair.  However, I do use hot rollers and hair dryer. This product is great because I don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of time blow drying my hair straight to get my hair shiny, smooth and prepped for hot rollers!!</li>
            <li> When I received the Nice&#x27;n Easy Color Seal, I noticed it&#x27;s the same size as the one included in Nice&#x27;n Easy Color Permanent Color box.  I paid about $6.97 plus tax at a retail store for the Nice&#x27;n Easy Permanent Color which included the conditioner.  To purchase just the conditioner through Amazon it cost a little over $8.00.  It dawned on me that I can just purchase the Nice&#x27;n Easy Color tint at $6.97 plus taxt a retail store which will contain this great Nice&#x27;n Easy conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  A definite must for my extremely dry hair.  I use it once a week to maintain the shine.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I was initially introduced to this product through my purchases of the Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts hair color, a 1 oz sample (called color treat) is included with the hair color and I loved the instant softness that this product provided to my hair. I am AA and I have thick (4A/B) relaxed hair, you apply this product after you have colored your hair and also as a maintenance product to help maintain your color and as an intensive conditioning treatment. I have never been able to achieve such softness as far as conditioning unless I apply a conditioning product, apply a plastic cap and sit under my hair dryer for 30 minutes or more; this is one of those products that can achieve those same results in a shorter period of time or if you are short on time and still desired that deep moisturized effect. When I first used this product, I immediately returned to the store to see if it could be purchased separately and I was not able to find it in any of the local grocery or drug stores, I then searched on line and came across the Clairol&#x27;s nice&#x27;n&#x27;easy intensive treatment and this product provides the exact same results as the color treat (obviously because they&#x27;re both made by Clairol), I am in love with the product, and will be purchasing much more of it. I do wish that the company would distribute the product in a larger container such as in a 16 oz bottle or tube. The product is reasonably priced and Amazon in my experience has always provided excellent customer service and I promptly received this item within 5 days of ordering it. This is a product that will be a staple item in my hair regiment.  I would give this product a 5+ but because of the 1.96 oz tube that it comes in I am giving in a 4 because I would like it in a larger container, come on Clairol listen to your consumers!!!!</li>
            <li> A semi-review repeat...  as posted on Amazon for Clairol ColorSeal Conditioning Gloss.  (Clairol said both products are discontinued, and were essentially the same.  Not sure what that meant, and neither did they.)  This review is mostly a head&#x27;s up...  and a memorial for a great product.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Clairol about the difficulty finding this product. They said it had been discontinued and suggested [[ASIN:B003G38Y6K Pantene Pro-V Color Hair Solutions Color Nourishing Treatment, 1.9 Ounce]].  While the Clairol is still available in the Nice&#x27;n Easy boxes, it is no longer available as a stand-alone product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the Pantene, yet. I&#x27;m very leery changing products as the Pantene ingredients are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will miss the Clairol ColorSeal/Moisture Intensive Conditioner. Such a great weekly product and so wonderful for fine/thin hair or children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone in their right mind pay 19.99 for this when they can go to walmart and buy a box with the exact same size for 6.50?</li>
            <li> I first tried this product because it was part of a color box.  Then it was available alone for a while until I could no longer find it in store.  Amazon came to the rescue!  This product is great for my hair making them so shiny and soft.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This is the conditioner that is in the box when you color your hair at home.  I have never been able to find it in stores and&lt;br /&gt;was so pleased to find it on Amazon.  Instead of searching in local stores, in the future  I will go directly to Amazon.  Thank&lt;br /&gt;you for making this product available.</li>
            <li> I think this is the same color fast conditioner that comes with Natural Instincts color.  It&#x27;s the best to moisturize and protect hair color.  I wish it was still available.  The tubes that come with the color are getting smaller and smaller.</li>
            <li> This performs and seem just like what comes with the hair coloring.  I was surprised that the tube was so small.  I expected a standard size conditioner tube but it is about half that size.  It is a littler bigger than the dinky tube that comes with the hair coloring.  Just don&#x27;t be surprised at the small size.  Otherwise, it works great...just too expensive to use every day.</li>
            <li> This is the same size tube that is in the gray solutions box.  So for $10.00 I could have purchased the product w/the tube.  But I purchased the gloss treatment thinking it was more.  So for $16.00 I got the tube only.  Not to happy with it but it is my fault for not reading more in to it.  So if you need more just buy a box of coloring w/ tube in it.!!!  I had to pay shipping is why it was higher than advertised.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST conditioner I ever used. It makes my hair soft, shiny and smelling great! I will never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the greatest conditioner ever.  Unfortunately hard to find</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to finally find this product online at Amazon.  I used to be able to purchase it at the drugstore, but had not been able to find it for months! It does a wonderful job conditioning color-treated hair. I will continue buying this product at Amazon.  Thanks so much...</li>
            <li> Age and coloring have taken their toll on my hair.  I used to only use this product after coloring, because it came with the kit.  I loved it, and I&#x27;m pleased to see that I can now buy it separately.  I live in a dry place, and this makes my hair feel delightfully soft and silky.   I use it about once a week and for special occasions, and I take it as my travel conditioner.  I would use it more, but it is a little pricey.  It&#x27;s the methicones, (dimethicone, amethicone, etc.) that work, and you can find them in other conditioners. Although they seem to be a little controversial, I love their  affect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Seems like this works better than most conditioners I have tried for color treated hair, also travels well and fits easily in overnight bag</li>
            <li> I used the conditioner in the color treatment and my hair never felt softer. I don&#x27;t use the hair color any more and just wanted the treatment. I understand why someone might be upset at buying it for the price but i would pay anything for it.  I love how my hair feels and it is great it is separate from the hair color now since I am no longer coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> Having parents that are Dominican, I am constantly caught between the \\&quot;bad hair/good hair\\&quot; discussion with people. This conditioner is the ultimate in moisture, manageability, shine, THE WHOLE PACKAGE. I LOVE this conditioner. It&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s not available in larger quantities because I would purchase it by the BARREL. My hair is very curly and frizzy in its natural state and so when I straighten it, it becomes dry and dull. After using this conditioner my hair has been restored to its healthiest state. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like my hair anymore! I give this conditioner an A+++++. If you are thinking about buying it, STOP THINKING! Just do it; you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner on the market</li>
            <li> This is the same great product that comes with the hair dye. However, it is also the same size. So considering at its most expensive a box of hair color is about $7 and usually you can find a coupon online for $3 off the most you should pay for this product is $4-$5 not $15. Save yourself some money and just go buy the box of hair dye.</li>
            <li> This is a very good conditioner but I think it is a little pricey.  I have found some others that are almost as good but are less money.  If you want something that is very good and you have very dry hair I would recommend this.  It is really a good product.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to find this in the local stores but great to find on Amazon.  Great product for use once a week or so in addition to the regular shampoo and conditioner.  Leaves my hair soft and controlled but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner! It gives my highlights a long lasting effect. I wish they sell this at Walgreens!</li>
            <li> I love the product and recommend it to anyone with hair issues.  I did not realize however that the price I paid was for one little tube. Way over priced and the laugh is on me.</li>
            <li> wonderful product its a shame clairol doesnt put this on store shelves anymore. makes you hair so soft, &amp; tangle free</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I have used the hair dye that it comes with for years. The product I recieved was NOT the same as what I get in the hair dye kits. This stuff destroyed my hair! I asked for a full refund plus the cost of shipping and got it, that&#x27;s the only thing on the \\&quot;up and up\\&quot; about this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap, you&#x27;d be waaay better off just buying the hair dye kit and using the conditioner in it1</li>
            <li> This i ordered for a friend a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the conditioner that comes with the hair color products.  This was close to it and I would purchase it again even though it&#x27;s pretty small.</li>
            <li> Great product left my hair looking smooth and silky.  A little pricy.  Nonetheless, it worked great.  Will definately buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this one each week.  It gives your hair a great shine and a soft, smooth feel.  No greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> This is the stuff in the old Loving Care coloring. I am highly sensitive to perfumed products, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me. They no longer make Loving Care, but I remembered how great this stuff was. My hair gets really dry. So I searched and this appears to be the same stuff. Just a little bit made a huge difference. I read some complaints on the size of the package for the price. It says use a &amp;#34;quarter-sized&amp;#34; amount and I did. There is plenty in there for weeks and weeks of weekly conditioning. Very pleased. The smell is stronger than the one in the box, but not so bad that I cannot tolerate it.</li>
