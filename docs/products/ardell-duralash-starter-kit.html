            <li>but I am happy with them.  </li>
            <li>A good assortment of lash sizes, glue and glue remover and tweezers.</li>
            <li>Glue is good.</li>
            <li>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right, but I followed the instructions to the best of my ability.</li>
            <li>Dont kill my own lashes.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled</li>
            <li>mail something that has a very strong chemical smell,leaking glue and adhesive remover, and pay the postage too?</li>
            <li>but most I had to rip off my own eyelashes after dabbing the remover on my lashes for almost an hour.</li>
            <li>Ok...</li>
            <li>These were ok.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got the starter kit though, just so I could compare the lengths and know that this brand of glue isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I was more than pleased to see the difference that they made to my eyes..........</li>
            <li>Love how they look</li>
            <li>I love this lash kit.  </li>
            <li>&amp; i will order more when its finish.</li>
            <li>my lashes came out quite lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure is just baby oil or something.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes.  </li>
            <li>When I first applied these eyelashes, I loved them.</li>
            <li>if you have someone to help you, these might work pretty good.  </li>
            <li>They look great, totally natural.  </li>
            <li>The kit comes with everything you need and they are really easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>, you do not put them on top of your lashes, they go right on the skin on top of the lash line.</li>
            <li>But when I opened the mailing envelope, I quickly became nauseous with the strong smell of the glue.</li>
            <li>They were a little tricky at first but after some help from a friend they look great!  </li>
            <li>The lashes are so soft and look so natural like my own lashes!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried individual lashes and thought the starter kit would be a good introduction.</li>
            <li>Thanks to receller!!</li>
            <li>I have tried permanent lashes before and this is a great starter kit to get a few applications out of.</li>
            <li>When they did eventually fall off, I could see several of my own eyelashes stuck to them.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t easy to apply but I was prepared for that and the tweezers provided were pretty decent and helped a lot.</li>
            <li>If the remover worked better I would love this and buy it again, but how pretty your lashes look are not worth how much it hurts take them off.</li>
            <li>This could be because I am a first time user</li>
            <li>I messed up w the first 6-8</li>
            <li>I definitely will buy more lashes to apply when I run out.</li>
            <li>I will say it was pretty fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I liked the look of the short ones enough to try again with a package solely consisting of the short length and researching a better glue brand.</li>
            <li>- maybe I used too much glue?</li>
            <li>However, the glue was as strong as super glue and clumped up a bit after it dried.  </li>
            <li>I am getting married soon,and wanted to add a little more to my look.</li>
            <li>The other reviews about the glue were pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>excellent, first time using singles, a little glue goes a long way, I used a bobby pin to get the adhesive out of the little bottle and dabbed on the cardboard backing, gently swayed the lash back and forth.  </li>
            <li>and I got lots of complements on my \\&quot;new</li>
            <li>The only thing I dont like is that the glue dryes very fast</li>
            <li>easy to use and last quite a long time</li>
            <li>As you only use a minute amount of glue, it will last a while I think, meaning in the future i&#x27;ll just buy more lashes.</li>
            <li>These took me a couple tries to get good at putting them on, but after getting a few on, I could do them in a flash!</li>
            <li>This is a company that clearly does not care about their customers.</li>
            <li>Totally natural looking</li>
            <li>i ended up with big clumps of glue and pulled the whole set of out of frustration.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money, and the glue will last you through several refill kits.</li>
            <li>It took me 30 minutes of consistent dabbing to get one particular eyelash off that was stuck on hard.</li>
            <li>It comes with the adhesive and remover which is key, since to protect your own lashes you should never ever pull fake lashes in order to remove them.</li>
            <li>3 different sizes and tweezers to apply them easyly, you will need some practice because it is not easy the first time.   </li>
            <li>Then, when I went to remove them a week later, my love quickly turned into hate.</li>

            <li> Then, when I went to remove them a week later, my love quickly turned into hate.</li>
            <li> but if you are trying to do it yourself, its just about impossible to apply these to your own lashes.  </li>
            <li> If you have dark lashes (mine are white blond), then I would highly recommend these to be used as directed (for a few weeks at a time without mascara).</li>
            <li> I found that the longer ones were way too long and the mediums almost were as well.</li>
            <li> It was a little bit difficult to get the tecnic to put them at the beginning, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I also use them with mascara, and try to use them only for big events, as I remove them after a few days, instead of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Glue does not hold up well in heat or when wet (showering)</li>
            <li> That way I could try all the various lengths and start with just a small amount of this brand of glue.</li>
            <li> I found that the lashes didn&#x27;t stay on as long as claimed, and through out the day I would have one or 2 missing gaps on my lash line...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth loosing my eyelashes...</li>
            <li> , remover does not work as expected, you will have a hard time trying to take off your false eyelashes and in the meanwhile you will loose some of your natural ones.</li>
            <li> the glue made my lashes look oddly shiny</li>
            <li> The glue takes a little while to set, so they aren&#x27;t set-and-go lashes.  </li>
            <li> a few came off no problem</li>
            <li> hard to work with by yourself.</li>
            <li> The remover hardly works at all.  </li>
            <li> The glue bottles are SO thin they both broke</li>
            <li> not matter what I tired</li>
            <li> This kit contains everything you need if you&#x27;ve never applied false lashes before.</li>
            <li> Once I got the lashes in place they didn&#x27;t hold long (not even a couple hours) and the glue does leave terrible dried clumps on your lashes and lash line.</li>
            <li> They stay on (and sometimes hurt incredibly awful when removing them), and they look natural.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was a disaster.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m stuck with ruined product unless I take time out of my day,</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be using them again.</li>
            <li> the glue would not adhere to my lash, making this useless</li>
            <li> Ive worked in customer service for 17 years and would never leave a customer unhappy if I can help it.</li>
            <li> The remover did remove the glue but it does burn your eyes like crazy as well.</li>

            <li> I have tried permanent lashes before and this is a great starter kit to get a few applications out of. It comes with the adhesive and remover which is key, since to protect your own lashes you should never ever pull fake lashes in order to remove them. I&#x27;m a cosmetology student so I know how to apply these properly and that is key when getting these lashes, you should never put them on your inner waterline upper or lower, you do not put them on top of your lashes, they go right on the skin on top of the lash line.</li>
            <li> This kit has everything to have great eyelashes! 3 different sizes and tweezers to apply them easyly, you will need some practice because it is not easy the first time.   I did not rate this product with 5 stars for just one reason, remover does not work as expected, you will have a hard time trying to take off your false eyelashes and in the meanwhile you will loose some of your natural ones.</li>
            <li> This kit contains everything you need if you&#x27;ve never applied false lashes before. A good assortment of lash sizes, glue and glue remover and tweezers. They do take some pratice to learn to apply them properly; finding an online video tutorial helps. As you only use a minute amount of glue, it will last a while I think, meaning in the future i&#x27;ll just buy more lashes.</li>
            <li> This kit is great! The lashes are so soft and look so natural like my own lashes! It was a little bit difficult to get the tecnic to put them at the beginning, but it&#x27;s ok. I wash them, sleep with them and they are still there. The only thing I dont like is that the glue dryes very fast so you actually need to harry up when placing the lashes.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I wanted a simple kit, with everything included. I am getting married soon,and wanted to add a little more to my look. I will say it was pretty fast delivery. But when I opened the mailing envelope, I quickly became nauseous with the strong smell of the glue. Without looking at the outside of the package, I opened it. The glue was dripping all over, the bottle of glue and the bottle of remover had both been smashed. Needless to say, it was a disaster. I sent an email to the company, asking for a refund, and their reply was \\&quot;once we receive it back we will then issue you a refund. Ok... So I&#x27;m supposed to pay out of my pocket to send this back? It wasn&#x27;t my fault it came this way. The packaging was not damaged. I believe the product was shipped that way. This is a company that clearly does not care about their customers. Ive worked in customer service for 17 years and would never leave a customer unhappy if I can help it. Needless to say, I&#x27;m stuck with ruined product unless I take time out of my day, mail something that has a very strong chemical smell,leaking glue and adhesive remover, and pay the postage too? Never again.</li>
            <li> These were ok. This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried individual lashes and thought the starter kit would be a good introduction. That way I could try all the various lengths and start with just a small amount of this brand of glue. I found that the longer ones were way too long and the mediums almost were as well. They aren&#x27;t easy to apply but I was prepared for that and the tweezers provided were pretty decent and helped a lot. The other reviews about the glue were pretty accurate. Once I got the lashes in place they didn&#x27;t hold long (not even a couple hours) and the glue does leave terrible dried clumps on your lashes and lash line. This could be because I am a first time user but I decided to try a different glue next time I do these. The remover did remove the glue but it does burn your eyes like crazy as well. I liked the look of the short ones enough to try again with a package solely consisting of the short length and researching a better glue brand. I am glad I got the starter kit though, just so I could compare the lengths and know that this brand of glue isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I was more than pleased to see the difference that they made to my eyes..........easy to use and last quite a long time</li>
            <li> hard to work with by yourself. lasted about a week on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I messed up w the first 6-8 then I got the hang of it. Love how they look I&#x27;m so happy w these. Hope they hold up well.</li>
            <li> The glue bottles are SO thin they both broke and I couldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I love this lash kit.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money trying out a lash kit.  The kit comes with everything you need and they are really easy to apply.  They look great, totally natural.  I definitely will buy more lashes to apply when I run out.</li>
            <li> They were a little tricky at first but after some help from a friend they look great!  Totally natural looking and I got lots of complements on my \\&quot;new mascara.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> When I first applied these eyelashes, I loved them. Then, when I went to remove them a week later, my love quickly turned into hate. I used the remover (I tried for several days) and could not get the eyelashes to come off - maybe I used too much glue? When they did eventually fall off, I could see several of my own eyelashes stuck to them. Now, I&#x27;m waiting for my eyelashes to grow back which will take several weeks. Needless to say, I will not be using them again. It&#x27;s not worth loosing my eyelashes...</li>
            <li> I do like the lashes in this starter kit.  However, the glue was as strong as super glue and clumped up a bit after it dried.  The remover hardly works at all.  It took me 30 minutes of consistent dabbing to get one particular eyelash off that was stuck on hard.</li>
            <li> if you have someone to help you, these might work pretty good.  but if you are trying to do it yourself, its just about impossible to apply these to your own lashes.  i ended up with big clumps of glue and pulled the whole set of out of frustration.</li>
            <li> I ordered already 3 packs! &amp; i will order more when its finish. Its perfect!!!!!!!!! All in time. Glue is good. Looks holywood-great. Dont kill my own lashes. Thanks to receller!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right, but I followed the instructions to the best of my ability. I found that the lashes didn&#x27;t stay on as long as claimed, and through out the day I would have one or 2 missing gaps on my lash line... Over all, the application took a while... the glue made my lashes look oddly shiny so I won&#x27;t be attempting these again.</li>
            <li> These took me a couple tries to get good at putting them on, but after getting a few on, I could do them in a flash! I can glue on an entire eye of lashes in about 10 minutes. And they last me about two weeks with a couple of touch ups. I even wore them on a beach trip and they survived ocean air, swimming, and boat rides. These are my favorite fake lashes I&#x27;ve ever used. Definitely worth the money, and the glue will last you through several refill kits.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t stick and didn&#x27;t work. not matter what I tired the glue would not adhere to my lash, making this useless</li>
            <li> Glue does not hold up well in heat or when wet (showering)</li>
            <li> I picked these up at my local cvs, it took some time to get the lashes on, bit of practice. my lashes came out quite lovely. I was so thrilled and i was planing on buying another set when I took these off, but then it came time to take them off. the remover I&#x27;m sure is just baby oil or something. a few came off no problem but most I had to rip off my own eyelashes after dabbing the remover on my lashes for almost an hour. If the remover worked better I would love this and buy it again, but how pretty your lashes look are not worth how much it hurts take them off.</li>
            <li> excellent, first time using singles, a little glue goes a long way, I used a bobby pin to get the adhesive out of the little bottle and dabbed on the cardboard backing, gently swayed the lash back and forth.  The lashes ended up looking like whispies.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes.  The glue takes a little while to set, so they aren&#x27;t set-and-go lashes.  I also use them with mascara, and try to use them only for big events, as I remove them after a few days, instead of weeks.  They stay on (and sometimes hurt incredibly awful when removing them), and they look natural.  I don&#x27;t use them but maybe 3-4 times a year, but I am happy with them.  If you have dark lashes (mine are white blond), then I would highly recommend these to be used as directed (for a few weeks at a time without mascara).</li>
