            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Great brush all around now.</li>
            <li>I like the length and wood contruction of the handle, and the brush is a good quality.</li>
            <li>I have gotten these at another store, and loved them.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT..</li>
            <li>A good scrubber and stimulator.</li>
            <li>Sturdy handle and a nice size sponge.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice brush.  </li>
            <li>They are quite nice and are durable.</li>
            <li>I bought an exfoliating bath brush which I liked much better</li>
            <li>Wife loved it and finds it very useful</li>
            <li>I decided to try out a real loofah instead of relying solely on the cheap mesh scrubbies and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with this loofah.</li>
            <li>Okay I&#x27;ve never had one of these before</li>
            <li>And I have MANY that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Was more thank</li>
            <li>works ok.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It holds up well after many uses and exfoliates well...</li>
            <li>Have used these in the shower for many years.</li>
            <li>Perfect for scrubbing that itchy back after a day in the sun!</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Pretty good brush.</li>
            <li>Great product, all natural</li>
            <li>Top can come off instead of using handle, and reattaches securely.  </li>
            <li>Also, I would have preferred a rounded handle, which would have made it more comfortable when reaching over my shoulders.</li>
            <li>When mine gets old I will happily buy another.  </li>
            <li>Guess it is fine.</li>
            <li>However, I have also noticed that the brush isn&#x27;t too securely attached to the handle.</li>
            <li>the product is cheaply mada and after a fwe days of owning it it had already seperated from the stick and had mold growth on the stick</li>
            <li>Great BACK BRUSH.  </li>
            <li>The loofah is smooth and does nothing but glide over your skin without cleaning.  </li>
            <li>This is the absolute BEST product for dry skin brushing out there.</li>
            <li>it will still be great when used dry for years to come.</li>
            <li>The product arrived promptly and is just what I wanted: a great rough scrubber.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not quite sturdy, but good enough...</li>
            <li>This is well attached go a nice stick, making it easy to use it to exfoliate skin from the back.</li>
            <li>feels great and has not come apart like other s have</li>
            <li>so i just super glued it before using it.  </li>
            <li>Love this loofah brush, it&#x27;s quality at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Had not gotten them online or off Amazon before so was a little concerned that the quality might not be as good, but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love the brush, and I like the wood construction overall, but there is a significant flaw.  </li>
            <li>And nothing feels better for scratching your back, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be better if the head didn&#x27;t slip off the handle occasionally.</li>
            <li>I love it, does wonders for my back.</li>
            <li>more of a back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>As my first loofa I was looking for something that would exfoliate my bachne.  </li>
            <li>Though the product says it softens up with water, it certainly didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Since nothing actually broke I was able to shove the handle back into the channel and with a little force it stayed in fairly well.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to</li>
            <li>BETTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li>The only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the glue issue, but it is too nice to only give 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>Sponge started falling off with first use, completely off in two weeks.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised to see mold in first week.  </li>
            <li>... you must use this product DRY to really enjoy its benefits.</li>
            <li>nice for the price but way too hard.  </li>
            <li>For those who said  it easily breaks, treat it like something of value and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>After first use, the loofah was still in tact with the wooden handle.</li>
            <li>Loofa Back Brush, decent product, kind of hard to reach the exact middle of the back if you are doing it by yourself.</li>
            <li>so far no complaints</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>seems very different, and VERY sturdy, so</li>
            <li>The new brush appears to have a wooden dowel embedded through the handle and into the wooden board.  </li>
            <li>I just use it to wash my back, the sponge itself is pretty stiff which I guess is how they&#x27;re supposed to be?</li>

            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> seems very different, and VERY sturdy, so</li>
            <li> The new brush appears to have a wooden dowel embedded through the handle and into the wooden board.  </li>
            <li> I just use it to wash my back, the sponge itself is pretty stiff which I guess is how they&#x27;re supposed to be?</li>
            <li> Or, after using it dry several times, then rinse/clean it under water, and as long as you let dry it out completely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just using it normally, but the brush still seems a little loose.    </li>
            <li> I can really scrub with this thing hard, but you gotta be careful because it&#x27;s glued to the wood as another reviewer mentioned it can possibly fall off.</li>
            <li> Though I have not owned it long I can say it works well</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break; the loofa is glued to a wood panel that has a slightly tapered slot carved into the top, this mates with the handle, and the two pieces appear to be glued together... but very poorly.  </li>
            <li> However, handle was a little too short for my liking, as I have sore shoulders issues.</li>
            <li> What a hunk of junk, sprung was abnormally hard too and never really got soft.</li>
            <li> the loofah does not separate from the handle, which is held in place with a small nail.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of such misrepresentation of products.</li>
            <li> brush is hard as a rock&lt;br /&gt; complete waste of money</li>
            <li> At less than $7, I would give this product a try.</li>
            <li> This thing is as hard as a piece of wood and as rough as a lava rock.  </li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for, I just wish the handle was a few inches</li>
            <li> The sponge is stiff as pumice and stays that way.</li>
            <li> I definitely understand the reason for some of the bad reviews on the Loofa Back Brush.</li>
            <li> Flat handle is a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> If I hit my mother on the head the head with it I would knock her out with a small tap.  </li>
            <li> it is made very poor and you can buy the same thing in a walmart store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stiff and seems to absorb soap, it&#x27;s sturdy and made well but doesn&#x27;t get sudsy like a loofa does.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and mine&#x27;s still hanging in there tough.</li>
            <li> When wet or in the shower it&#x27;s basically completely USELESS for me.</li>
            <li> You can tell it was poorly made.  </li>
            <li> and they would separate when the glue failed.  </li>
            <li> Handle kept cutting into my thumbs during use.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great. Though I have not owned it long I can say it works well and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for, I just wish the handle was a few inches longer.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product, all natural</li>
            <li> Sturdy scrubber.  Top can come off instead of using handle, and reattaches securely.  Flat handle is a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I definitely understand the reason for some of the bad reviews on the Loofa Back Brush. I like the length and wood contruction of the handle, and the brush is a good quality. However, I have also noticed that the brush isn&#x27;t too securely attached to the handle. I&#x27;m just using it normally, but the brush still seems a little loose.    The makers of this product probably know about this problem. Since there does appear to be a wooden dowel/screw through the handle and brush. It&#x27;s still not quite sturdy, but good enough... At less than $7, I would give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I have gotten these at another store, and loved them. Had not gotten them online or off Amazon before so was a little concerned that the quality might not be as good, but it is fantastic. Would recoment its purchase.</li>
            <li> Sturdy handle and a nice size sponge.  I wish this had a spare sponge head to change it.</li>
            <li> Guess it is fine. It was a gift and so far no complaints</li>
            <li> Though the product says it softens up with water, it certainly didn&#x27;t.  If I hit my mother on the head the head with it I would knock her out with a small tap.  This thing is as hard as a piece of wood and as rough as a lava rock.  I&#x27;ll never buy again.  What a joke.</li>
            <li> Okay I&#x27;ve never had one of these before so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but it seems to get the job done. I just use it to wash my back, the sponge itself is pretty stiff which I guess is how they&#x27;re supposed to be? I can really scrub with this thing hard, but you gotta be careful because it&#x27;s glued to the wood as another reviewer mentioned it can possibly fall off. However I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and mine&#x27;s still hanging in there tough.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush. However, handle was a little too short for my liking, as I have sore shoulders issues. Also, I would have preferred a rounded handle, which would have made it more comfortable when reaching over my shoulders. Handle kept cutting into my thumbs during use. But, overall a quality product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out a real loofah instead of relying solely on the cheap mesh scrubbies and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with this loofah. It&#x27;s a sturdy scrubber.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had the loofa for about a week now. My husband is the one who uses it and he says&#x27; it works great. The construction looks sturdy. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This is well attached go a nice stick, making it easy to use it to exfoliate skin from the back.</li>
            <li> Terrible. The sponge is stiff as pumice and stays that way. How does this thing get called a &amp;#34;loofa&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> I was is need for a loofah with a handle. When the package arrived, it contained a loofah attached to a wooden handle. So far so good! After first use, the loofah was still in tact with the wooden handle. It offered the additional reach that I was looking for. I have the loofah, attached to a wooden handle, offering additional reach. What else can I ask for!</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT..BETTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Sponge started falling off with first use, completely off in two weeks. What a hunk of junk, sprung was abnormally hard too and never really got soft.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST product for dry skin brushing out there. And I have MANY that I&#x27;ve tried. Once you start using it you don&#x27;t want to stop. And nothing feels better for scratching your back, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT (and a big but) ... you must use this product DRY to really enjoy its benefits. When wet or in the shower it&#x27;s basically completely USELESS for me. Or, after using it dry several times, then rinse/clean it under water, and as long as you let dry it out completely it will still be great when used dry for years to come.</li>
            <li> It would be better if the head didn&#x27;t slip off the handle occasionally. A good scrubber and stimulator.</li>
            <li> brush is hard as a rock&lt;br /&gt; complete waste of money&lt;br /&gt; also the brush does not come off&lt;br /&gt; a rip off</li>
            <li> Was more thank I was expecting. It&#x27;s awesome. Fits Perfectly and matches me perfectly. I&#x27;m very very happy with it.</li>
            <li> the product is cheaply mada and after a fwe days of owning it it had already seperated from the stick and had mold growth on the stick</li>
            <li> I love it, does wonders for my back.</li>
            <li> nice for the price but way too hard.  more of a back scratcher.  People say the head keeps falling off so i just super glued it before using it.  You can tell it was poorly made.  works ok.</li>
            <li> My only problem was the length of the handle, it was just too short. Maybe I am just too tall...LOL</li>
            <li> Wife loved it and finds it very useful</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush.  I have had these before and the only problem was the handle was glued to a wooden board that held the loofa and they would separate when the glue failed.  The new brush appears to have a wooden dowel embedded through the handle and into the wooden board.  If this resolves the separation problem I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love the brush, and I like the wood construction overall, but there is a significant flaw.  The second day I had this I dropped it in the shower and the head came off!  It didn&#x27;t break; the loofa is glued to a wood panel that has a slightly tapered slot carved into the top, this mates with the handle, and the two pieces appear to be glued together... but very poorly.  Since nothing actually broke I was able to shove the handle back into the channel and with a little force it stayed in fairly well.  It has since come apart a couple times, and I just force it back together.  Eventually I will drill a hole through the handle and head, drip some glue in the hole and the head&#x27; channel, tap a dowel in and likely never worry about it coming apart again.  Note that the glue holding the loofa to the head seems very different, and VERY sturdy, so no problems there.    I do recommend this, but I would only give it as a gift if I did the extra drill/glue/dowel step before giving it to anyone.  When mine gets old I will happily buy another.  The only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the glue issue, but it is too nice to only give 3 stars.  :)</li>
            <li> They updated this brush with a fastener that held the handle to the brush with a dowel fastener. Great brush all around now.</li>
            <li> Loofa is a loofa is a loofa. I was looking for something really coarse for my boyfriend. He says it&#x27;s too soft even though reviews for this product said it&#x27;s too rough.</li>
            <li> Loofa Back Brush, decent product, kind of hard to reach the exact middle of the back if you are doing it by yourself.</li>
            <li> As my first loofa I was looking for something that would exfoliate my bachne.  It holds up well after many uses and exfoliates well...I was just expecting something softer.</li>
            <li> Have used these in the shower for many years. They are quite nice and are durable.</li>
            <li> Perfect for scrubbing that itchy back after a day in the sun!</li>
            <li> Great BACK BRUSH.  Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep this seller in my favorites to buy from.</li>
            <li> the loofah does not separate from the handle, which is held in place with a small nail.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of such misrepresentation of products.</li>
            <li> The loofah is smooth and does nothing but glide over your skin without cleaning.  Returning.</li>
            <li> feels great and has not come apart like other s have</li>
            <li> Love this loofah brush, it&#x27;s quality at a decent price. For those who said  it easily breaks, treat it like something of value and it will last a long time. It&#x27;s not meant to last forever, not made of steel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stiff and seems to absorb soap, it&#x27;s sturdy and made well but doesn&#x27;t get sudsy like a loofa does.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly and is just what I wanted: a great rough scrubber.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. it is made very poor and you can buy the same thing in a walmart store.</li>
            <li> This might happen to all loofah but I was surprised to see mold in first week.  I will not recommend it. I bought an exfoliating bath brush which I liked much better</li>
            <li> I do lie the loofa back brush, but I should have ordered the brush with curved handle. So that is what I will order next.</li>
