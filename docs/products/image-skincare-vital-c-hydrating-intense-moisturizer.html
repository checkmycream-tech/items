            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Light formula which doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy,oily look.</li>
            <li>so this is a great deal on Amazon, though I cannot recommend the last seller as it has been a month and the product is still &amp;#34;in transit&amp;#34; with no tracking number!!!  </li>
            <li>Great daily moisturizer that&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>it is a light orange scent.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m certainly not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy, smells very nice and most importantly super-hydrating.  </li>
            <li>I love how this makes my mature skin feels - silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have lots of redness to my skin and very sensitive to most products.  </li>
            <li>Very Hydrating, not greasy at all, feels very good on my face, not too heavy feeling on my skin at all</li>
            <li>The vital night cream works better and way easier to apply.</li>
            <li>Vital C is calming and soothing and makes my skin look so much better.  </li>
            <li>, I decided to give Image skin care products a try as I remembered purchasing cleansing cream at a beauty salon while back and somewhat liked.  </li>
            <li>The shipper got it right out to me though</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time that I&#x27;ve bought online and didn&#x27;t smell right.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin which was caused by a reaction from a popular anti aging company.</li>
            <li>trying to find something more affordable to alternate with .</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, i&#x27;m sure that i have used the trial size version of this product several times and it doesnt smell like this.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>The salon prices were so much higher than what you can purchase through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  </li>
            <li>This product is good in hydrating dry sensitive skin from the elements of nature.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very refreshing in the AM with a slight citrus fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Also, I completely stopped using a few skin care lines I used to love - namely Shiseido and Clinique - then within a matter of days, redness has disappeared and bumps have shrunk - so amazed!!  </li>
            <li>It shines so much that when I put makeup on, I look like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>Really like it</li>
            <li>Hope this product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>it is very helpful for me to order online.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have purchesed the vital C serum online several times and i love it.</li>
            <li>Regardless of every other review that says it&#x27;s great, it is absolutely not a true Image product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have rosacea.</li>
            <li>Also the smell is a little potent.</li>
            <li>Still there are rashes on my nose and around cheeks but barely noticeable and skin touches much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, as you age you loose a lot of moisture in your skin, mine became dry.  </li>
            <li>I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.</li>
            <li>I believe the internet is 100% correct when posts say Vital C cannot be bought online.</li>
            <li>This stuff is nothing like the real thing -  rip off - BIG TIME - BUYER BEWARE!!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it has never bother me.</li>
            <li>Definitely can tell that my skin is much brighter after using this product.</li>
            <li>wonder if its old?  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s texture, feeling on skin, smell and overall effect is absolutely nothing..</li>
            <li>I use this during the day and the and the Vital C Hydrating Repair cream for night.  </li>
            <li>It is too early to tell if it is making a difference, but I like the smell and feel of the product.  </li>
            <li>It added the exact moisture I needed to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin had been very dry and this really helped!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is the genuine product or a counterfeit....</li>
            <li>have two one I keep in my purse with me when away from home and the other for first thing in morning, last thing at night and on hot days use several times a day...refreshing as well</li>
            <li>, I tried various facial treatment, taking some vitamin supplement, avoid certain foods, changed haircare products, none of which seemed to have worked to ease the condition drastically.  </li>
            <li>Really use this product daily since I was introduced to it after a spa facial.  </li>
            <li>I bought it from the salon and spent too much.</li>
            <li>While i realize that its not the product i meant to buy, i have used several image products and the Vital C products have always smelled like oranges.</li>
            <li>The condition looked worse after exercising which I love to do</li>
            <li>I live in a sunny place and it really helps the sun damage from times past.  </li>
            <li>I live in Arizona where it is very dry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have dry skin which was caused by a reaction from a popular anti aging company. Used topical steroids alternately with oral pills because of inflammation and swelling from reaction from products too used by esthetic peels and whatever process to help ease down my skin but nothing helped not Til I tried these line of products by Image. I used it since December and I am ok for now.</li>
            <li> I love Image skin care products!!  This product met all my expectations.Image</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine life without this product</li>
            <li> THis wonderful cream smells like a creamsicle and is full of Vit. C. which is excellent for my dry skin when I wake up in the morning Idon&#x27;t feel any tightness on my face. It glows after I splash nice cool water!  Enjoy. I am a La Mer addict! trying to find something more affordable to alternate with .</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed in this product. I believe the internet is 100% correct when posts say Vital C cannot be bought online. This stuff is nothing like the real thing -  rip off - BIG TIME - BUYER BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> A little thick, makes it a little difficult to apply to my face.  Also the smell is a little potent. Kind of smells like cheap perfume. The vital night cream works better and way easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Have been using this line of skincare for 5 years. Absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> Same product at my Derm but this is way cheeper.  Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Never again. This product makes my face extremely greasy. It shines so much that when I put makeup on, I look like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;Since I can&#x27;t return the bottle, I&#x27;m just using it overnight.</li>
            <li> Regardless of every other review that says it&#x27;s great, it is absolutely not a true Image product. Don&#x27;t chance it and waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It smells great and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite day cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the genuine product or a counterfeit....the distinctive Orange aroma is missing.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item. Well I&#x27;m certainly not disappointed. It&#x27;s thick and creamy, smells very nice and most importantly super-hydrating.  Really superb for the winter months.</li>
            <li> Love this product it is so smooth and non greasy</li>
            <li> Fabulous line of products!!!! Great for people like me with rosacea, very calming and soothing!!! Packaged well and prompt!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and my skin shows no difference. I bought it from the salon and spent too much. I&#x27;m hesitant to ever purchase other products from Image again.</li>
            <li> It was very greasy, weird smelling, and made me break out. I used it twice. Total waste of money.  I&#x27;ve used this in the past and the smell was different. I&#x27;m wondering if they changed their formula?</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, it is one of my repeat Amazon orders.</li>
            <li> Light formula which doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy,oily look. Bought this after I had exhausted the last remnants of the sample tube from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very refreshing in the AM with a slight citrus fragrance.  It has kept away my usual winter dullness and redness and yet it feels firm and not greasy.  Really like it; may not use it in the summer months.</li>
            <li> This product is good in hydrating dry sensitive skin from the elements of nature.</li>
            <li> Received the product in a couple of days&lt;br /&gt;Great price and easy purchase&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
            <li> I truly like the product, however I waited forever for this to arive.  I went ahead &amp; bought another one at my Drs office because I couldn&#x27;t wait any longer on this one.</li>
            <li> I chose this because of the great reputation that Image has.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that I use during the winter!  My skin had been very dry and this really helped!</li>
            <li> Have to use more than the serum ( 2 pumps instead of 1 pump). Hope this product is the real deal. Doesn&#x27;t have the Orange scent that this product is known for. Hum?</li>
            <li> The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.</li>
            <li> have two one I keep in my purse with me when away from home and the other for first thing in morning, last thing at night and on hot days use several times a day...refreshing as well</li>
            <li> Love it. I have sensitive skin and it has never bother me. I use all the image c products and love them all.</li>
            <li> I have purchesed the vital C serum online several times and i love it. I accidentally purchased this instead this last time, and i don&#x27;t like this product AT ALL. It stinks. It smells like some kind of clove cigarette. While i realize that its not the product i meant to buy, i have used several image products and the Vital C products have always smelled like oranges. I am very disappointed. As a matter of fact, i&#x27;m sure that i have used the trial size version of this product several times and it doesnt smell like this.</li>
            <li> Really use this product daily since I was introduced to it after a spa facial.  Love the product but not the spa prices so this is a great deal on Amazon, though I cannot recommend the last seller as it has been a month and the product is still &amp;#34;in transit&amp;#34; with no tracking number!!!  Only time I have had this problem with Amazon!  :/</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell yet how i like it</li>
            <li> Love this product! It added the exact moisture I needed to my dry skin. It only takes a small amount to do the trick! It also has a nice citrus scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering. It was also half the price here on Amazon than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Definitely can tell that my skin is much brighter after using this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> So moisturizing and a great price!  It&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Thankfully someone recommended it to me. So greatful.</li>
            <li> I wish it had at least some SPF.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!  Definitely life has been placed back into my skin.</li>
            <li> Great transaction, love it! Great daily moisturizer that&#x27;s not greasy. Wear it every day, was also a good price !</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell like the product I&#x27;ve purchased in the salon.  This isn&#x27;t the first time that I&#x27;ve bought online and didn&#x27;t smell right.  I&#x27;ve seen previous comments that concur.  Product feels the same and the container looks the same....wonder if its old?  The shipper got it right out to me though</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
            <li> I like the product line, but this product smells different than the rest.  It doesn&#x27;t have the nice citrus fragrance of the the serum or the eye creme.</li>
            <li> I am very particular and found this to be a wonderful product. I was attracted to the product due to the vitamin C. It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> great product and works well for my skin care.  it is very helpful for me to order online.  I can trust amazon and I get great service and product.</li>
            <li> Not the same product.&lt;br /&gt;I usually get the product in an all silver container.  It was in a plastic white container.&lt;br /&gt;It smelled completely different than the product I usually get.  I wondered if it was a different product at a cheaper cost. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> good service and great product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. It feels so good on the skin and the scent is wonderful. I am 47 and go for monthly facials, my esthetician uses this line on my skin and I have noticed a big, big difference in the tone, brightness, and freshness of my skin. I don&#x27;t have to wear heavy foundation any longer, only using a BB cream. This is the first line of skin care products that have done what they claim to do and this cream is wonderful for a night cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers and used to just be happy to have something that didn&#x27;t make me breakout. This feels so good, no breakouts, no irritation AND it has actually improved the way my skin looks. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing! Love it! My skin is soooo dry and I need something that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin</li>
            <li> Finally, something wonderful to moisturize without any breakouts!  Soothing, non-greasy moisturizer.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Did not like the container.  Would prefer a jar type contained.</li>
            <li> 100% authentic product.  Absorbs quickly, smells amazing and keeps skin hydrated without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Has taken tge redness out of my skin and smoothed out the surface of my skin. Highly recommend if you have rosacea.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my mature skin feels - silky and smooth.  Image has great skin products at a very affordable price.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product.  After 30 days I noticed a big difference</li>
            <li> Very smooth and moisturizing product.  My massage spa used this on my facial and I was sold.</li>
            <li> still waiting for results!</li>
            <li> Accidentally ordered this moisturizer. I bought the anti-aging serum by Vita-C before, which is perfect. This product&#x27;s texture, feeling on skin, smell and overall effect is absolutely nothing..</li>
            <li> Very Hydrating, not greasy at all, feels very good on my face, not too heavy feeling on my skin at all</li>
            <li> I had a groupon for a mini peel and the products that were used was the &amp;#34;Image&amp;#34; skincare line. I loved it  and decided to purchase a full size.</li>
            <li> I just opened my package minutes ago and was excited to put my favorite moisturizer on my face. Sadly, this was not it. An extremely perfumed counterfeit version of greasy lotion arrived in it&#x27;s place. I feel stupid for trying to purchase this moisturizer for a discount online. I&#x27;m really disappointed. I give it zero stars.</li>
            <li> love it.  the best stuff I have every put on my skin.  I have lots of redness to my skin and very sensitive to most products.  Vital C is calming and soothing and makes my skin look so much better.  The orange scent is awesome.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Is not  oily and very refreshing. Will definitely  order in the future. Use 2 times a day. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love the image product line. I live in Arizona where it is very dry. This is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this product, as you age you loose a lot of moisture in your skin, mine became dry.  I use this during the day and the and the Vital C Hydrating Repair cream for night.  I tried this product when I got a facial at a Salon.  The salon prices were so much higher than what you can purchase through Amazon.  I will purchase these products only from Amazon from now on.  You will honestly see results quickly by using this Image skin care line products.</li>
            <li> I am using this product on the advice of my physician.  I love the smell and feel of the product.  It is too early to tell if it is making a difference, but I like the smell and feel of the product.  It smells like I have just peeled an orange!</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Only face product that doesn&#x27;t dry me out or cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, red spots started to appear all over my face and be noticeable.  The condition looked worse after exercising which I love to do so it&#x27;d been quite disturbing, and hated having to put on heavy makeup.  Thought this could be Rosacea associated with my age, diet, lifestyle, I tried various facial treatment, taking some vitamin supplement, avoid certain foods, changed haircare products, none of which seemed to have worked to ease the condition drastically.  Then it&#x27;d gotten worse as a few pimples appeared under my eyebrow and stinging itchy sensation all over so one day just recently, I decided to give Image skin care products a try as I remembered purchasing cleansing cream at a beauty salon while back and somewhat liked.  Also, I completely stopped using a few skin care lines I used to love - namely Shiseido and Clinique - then within a matter of days, redness has disappeared and bumps have shrunk - so amazed!!  Still there are rashes on my nose and around cheeks but barely noticeable and skin touches much smoother.  I cannot say 100% yet that Image moisturizer helped to clear my conditions since some ingredients in other makers&#x27; products might have simply caused skin reaction but I&#x27;m very happy &amp; satisfied to see the great result by using this product !!</li>
            <li> This is a great serum for the price.  I live in a sunny place and it really helps the sun damage from times past.  I use it twice a day.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It is really nice. I have dry skin and feel dry with a lot of moisturizers, but with this one I feel hydrated all day long. I like the smell it is a light orange scent. I also like that I don&#x27;t need a lot to feel well moisturized. It is pricey, but will last 3 to 4 months.</li>
