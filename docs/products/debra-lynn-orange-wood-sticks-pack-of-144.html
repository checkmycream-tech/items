            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>love this type or orange wood sticks.</li>
            <li>Great and not harsh on cuticles.</li>
            <li>They are smooth and strong.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I wanted one end pointed, but I can use the pushy side to clean too.</li>
            <li>Clean your nails, remove polish.</li>
            <li>I use them primarily for eyebrow waxing, so they need to been pretty strong to stir the wax.  </li>
            <li>There are so many I will be able to use these for a long time.</li>
            <li>Not too exciting</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>this is a high quality orange stick, it&#x27;s stout, and their delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>They were the kind that Revlon sells (one end pointed like a pencil, the other end cut obliquely), which is ok, but not as expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hoarding 3 orange wood sticks for years, and they are very shabby now.</li>
            <li>The orange sticks were very steardy.  </li>
            <li>the sticks are fine, but, older ones had a pointed end as well as a curved flat end.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I bought a giant plastic bag of orange sticks, but I go through them very fast (like 1 stick every 2 weeks).</li>
            <li>These orange sticks are a little long for my taste, but they are strong and work well to remove Shellac gel after applying acetone.  </li>
            <li>This shipped last, however arrived first, two days later - I have yet to receive the other shipments, three days later.</li>

            <li> These are solid, long sticks.</li>
            <li> Someone mentioned in their review that both ends were flat, wish I&#x27;d seen that.</li>
            <li> Both ends are flat in what I received, not a problem.  </li>
            <li> These are squared flat edge on both ends, like a screwdriver.</li>
            <li> only con is that they were packaged in a cellophane wrap thing, not well, so be careful.</li>
            <li> no used to the ones that have a sharp point on one end and flat on the order.</li>
            <li> They are long and sturdy and the edges didn&#x27;t fray or splinter when wet.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT a cheap flimsy orange stick, I&#x27;ve used orange sticks that look like they could double as toothpicks -</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> They are longer than I expected, almost six inches, but no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if there is a different fulfiller.</li>
            <li> I ended up playing &amp;#34;pick up sticks&amp;#34; when I picked it up to take one out and half of them fell out.</li>
            <li> The orange sticks I received were not as shown in the picture, and they took approximately 3 months to arrive after 3 messages to the seller.  </li>
            <li> Plus, they are so well made that I used a couple to prop up a cutting that I am rooting.</li>
            <li> so they won&#x27;t use the horrible, abrasive metal thing on me.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Great quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ve got them stashed in places I need!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I use these for every manicure and to remove my Gel nail polish they work well and for the price 144 sticks was a great deal.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT a cheap flimsy orange stick, I&#x27;ve used orange sticks that look like they could double as toothpicks - this is a high quality orange stick, it&#x27;s stout, and their delivery was quick. I made a purchase that was separated into three different shipments. This shipped last, however arrived first, two days later - I have yet to receive the other shipments, three days later. I&#x27;m very impressed and will purchase more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> These are solid, long sticks. Someone mentioned in their review that both ends were flat, wish I&#x27;d seen that. I wanted one end pointed, but I can use the pushy side to clean too. I&#x27;ve been hoarding 3 orange wood sticks for years, and they are very shabby now. I was happy to trash them. These are now every place I might want one. Plus, they are so well made that I used a couple to prop up a cutting that I am rooting. Worked great there too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that they were packaged in a cellophane wrap thing, not well, so be careful. I ended up playing &amp;#34;pick up sticks&amp;#34; when I picked it up to take one out and half of them fell out. Not a big deal, so this is definitely a five star product.</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected. The orange sticks were very steardy.  My only issue was that the product was opened (thats the reason for the 3 stars)</li>
            <li> Great and not harsh on cuticles. There are so many I will be able to use these for a long time.</li>
            <li> They were great..i love them&lt;br /&gt;And the price is good</li>
            <li> Sticks of wood. Clean your nails, remove polish. Not too exciting but they work.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and good quality.  I needed them for cosmetology and I love them.  I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> love this type or orange wood sticks. no used to the ones that have a sharp point on one end and flat on the order. use it when polished nails, pushing back cuticles or when doing nail art.</li>
            <li> Some of mine had split on the ends. This hurt my cuticles, but this works well for dipping in polish remover and wiping away excess.</li>
            <li> These orange sticks are very sturdy and have the perfect size ends.  Large pack of 144 is a great bargain!</li>
            <li> These are the highest quality oragne sticks.  I use them primarily for eyebrow waxing, so they need to been pretty strong to stir the wax.  I love them!  You CANNOT beat this price.</li>
            <li> I tried to find wooden orange sticks in stores, but could not.  I selected this product because of the good reviews.  I was not disappointed.  I received a big bag of orange sticks.  They are longer than I expected, almost six inches, but no complaints.  Both ends are flat in what I received, not a problem.  They are smooth and strong.  I like to take a wooden cuticle stick to the nail shop so they won&#x27;t use the horrible, abrasive metal thing on me.  I don&#x27;t know who Debra Lynn is, but I like her cuticle sticks.</li>
            <li> the square tip ends just like described the package was open some but the sticks were all there and not damaged</li>
            <li> Great price for a huge amount of a staple in your beauty routine products.</li>
            <li> This is a great value at 144 per pack! Buying in bulk is the way to go for this product.</li>
            <li> No complaints, item as described.  Priced lower than what I can find it for locally.</li>
            <li> These orange sticks are a little long for my taste, but they are strong and work well to remove Shellac gel after applying acetone.  The sticks are beveled on both ends, and are a good value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I bought a giant plastic bag of orange sticks, but I go through them very fast (like 1 stick every 2 weeks). They get all of my cuticles out of the way, and even &amp;#34;find&amp;#34; hangnails I didn&#x27;t know I had until I used the stick.</li>
            <li> the sticks are fine, but, older ones had a pointed end as well as a curved flat end.  These are squared flat edge on both ends, like a screwdriver.</li>
            <li> The orange sticks I received were not as shown in the picture, and they took approximately 3 months to arrive after 3 messages to the seller.  They were the kind that Revlon sells (one end pointed like a pencil, the other end cut obliquely), which is ok, but not as expected.  I had purchased this same item on amazon before and it was as pictured.  Not sure if there is a different fulfiller.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality Orange Wood Sticks.  They are long and sturdy and the edges didn&#x27;t fray or splinter when wet.</li>
