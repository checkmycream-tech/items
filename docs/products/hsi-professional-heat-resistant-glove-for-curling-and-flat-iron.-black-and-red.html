            <li>It was an awesome price, and was delivered super quick!!</li>
            <li>the glove works great and it arrived very quickly, and as ordered.</li>
            <li>Great deal and great product and fast ship!  </li>
            <li>glove fit is great for me as I have longer fingers.</li>
            <li>The seller was great, too, and this was a smooth transaction all the way.</li>
            <li>It also washes nicely.</li>
            <li>I paid the shipping cost to show them that there are some people would not buy into this kind of fraud.</li>
            <li>It fitted nicely my daughter&#x27;s hand (tall 5&#x27;11 with proportionate hands).</li>
            <li>Protects you from the heat..  Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li>so it is always handy.  </li>
            <li>It does get warm from the iron though.</li>
            <li>The material might fool you into thinking that it&#x27;s just another winter kind of glove that you can get anywhere and that it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t give a comprehensive review of this product.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging.  </li>
            <li>It also does protect your wrists, which is nice.</li>
            <li>and she like it nice producte</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it weren&#x27;t so slippy for those transfers, but I don&#x27;t see a way around that since any kind of \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; coating would also cause it to catch on your hair.  </li>
            <li>In the picture it looks really nice</li>
            <li>i would have liked it if it was tighter</li>
            <li>If you own any winter gloves that look like this use them.  </li>

            <li>They aren&#x27;t heatproof, but when they start to warm up, you know your hair is done.</li>
            <li>Is good price, just do not expect to hold a curl more then a 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Its a great glove... very durable and i can curl my hair without burning my fingers!!!</li>

            <li>This heat-resistant glove is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering more.</li>
            <li>while you can still feel the heat, it&#x27;s better than not having a glove.</li>
            <li>Love this gloveâ˜ºï¸</li>
            <li>You want to be able to wear it and grip your hair without burning your hand.  </li>
            <li>Love it use it with my chi hand dryer keep me from burning my hand while doing blowouts</li>
            <li>Surely a finger saver.</li>
            <li>I tried both gloves and HS&#x27;s was better (thicker).</li>
            <li>I love this tool and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>Ok i am not in the hair business.  </li>
            <li>Not any more this glove is awsome.  </li>
            <li>I love this glove.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say more than that</li>
            <li>My grand daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>Nice feel and light weight.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 of the gloves, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>These fit the bill!</li>
            <li>The glove is great and really keeps me from burning my fingers when heat styling.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I have burned myself so many times on my forehead or neck, and now I don&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li>You just put your gloved hand either around the barrel or lay it on your forehead while you rest the curling iron on top of it.  </li>
            <li>and I am extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Perfect for if you need a gloove, just want one for all hair irons, or want a second glove!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>but it does provide much better coverage</li>
            <li>I am assuming there is no way to make it fel better, but I just can not give it five stars.</li>
            <li>With these gloves I can work quicker and better and not get any burns.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t help you if you are holding your hand to a 400 degree iron for more than 3-4 seconds.</li>
            <li>You will love it[[ASIN:</li>

            <li>I am satisfied with this item.  </li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay money for this glove.</li>
            <li>Love love.  </li>
            <li>I was sure the description said \\&quot;heat resistant\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>After washing the glove I was able to use it without any issue.  </li>
            <li>Okay product.</li>
            <li>Great tool it really made the difference heat resistant.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Especially great for younger girls just learning to use them on their hair!</li>
            <li>Love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>I could not hold the curling iron for more than 1-2 seconds.</li>
            <li>I had another one which was more resistant to heat.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It will keep your hand safe.</li>
            <li>Styling wands can be tricky to use without receiving burns on your hands and wrist, but this glove will keep your skin safe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product I&#x27;m enjoying the use of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this glove.  </li>
            <li>but still I am able to use the curling iron with ease.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but when I do it will be better than fingertip burns.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>Both of us love the size and shape.  </li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>and I figured I had better protect both hands.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I opted to purchase this glove because I hoped it would provide more protection from the heat.  </li>
            <li>It works better than the glove my iron came with but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought they would be more heat resistant than they are but they will do.</li>
            <li>Ok quality.</li>
            <li>This glove is a fantastic addition when purchasing any hair iron!</li>
            <li>A must for every woman....nor  more burns using the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Really pleased with this glove I need to order another one as I use it a lot with my straighteners</li>
            <li>it helps me not to be as nervous, allowing me to make better curls.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than the finger gloves that came with my curling iron.</li>
            <li>It w hearts up instantly and works awesome.</li>
            <li>However, I would not have been able to do the job at all without the gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love this glove.</li>
            <li>It was okay, does the job.</li>
            <li>Then when I got home I did some more curls</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was going to burn or anything like that.</li>
            <li>The weave is tighter and I think it is a better quality than the one that came with my wand.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s kind of huge, which is a problem when you&#x27;re trying to maneuver, because the fingers keep getting bunched up, which makes yur hair slip off the rod</li>
            <li>These heat gloves are wonderful.will order more.</li>
            <li>cost of the glove was appropriate.</li>
            <li>I love the interchangeable sizes and being able to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li>I am better off burning my fingers than hassling with this thing.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to make sure that I have gloves for both hands for using my curling wand.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the glove.  </li>
            <li>THIS ADDED PROTECTION MAKES ME FEEL SAFE.</li>
            <li>havnt been able to get use to it</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great price.</li>
            <li>Most of us Wil never be robbed by a guy in a mask holding a weapon.  </li>
            <li>I love this glove.</li>
            <li>so I can part my hair sections better.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find a glove that keeps you from burning your fingers.</li>
            <li>This glove makes sure that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>Could not touch iron for more than 10 seconds before getting burned.</li>
            <li>I love this Item</li>
            <li>I use this glove every time I curl, and it keeps my skin safe from accidental burns.</li>
            <li>The glove works better than the glove that came with my curling iron.</li>
            <li>It helps some with protecting my fingers when I use my curling wand, but I am still looking for a better product.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>My hair holds heat and with this glove I am able to style without burning my finger-tips.  </li>
            <li>The material takes some getting used to, since the glove is not form fitting.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job, much nicer then the glove included with the iron.</li>
            <li>Love how it feels on a hand (not sratchy).</li>
            <li>hope to find a better, thinner glove that provides better protection from the heat.</li>
            <li>This glove is much better than the one that came with the wand.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many rows of bristles, which allow a lot of exposed metal, and so I&#x27;m my always burning my finger when I&#x27;m styling my hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know they made things like this, figuring everyone else was just better at using these tools.</li>
            <li>I am sure it works and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>It seems to be adaptable to most any size hand.  </li>
            <li>The thicker the section of hair the more protection you have using the glove this way.</li>
            <li>Prevents burning hands &amp; fingers while still able to grip iron or styling tools.</li>
            <li>If your gloved finger gets too close to the heat, you will start to feel it and be able to pull away.  </li>
            <li>and I burned my hand alot when trying to flip my hair, this glove was the perfect remedy for use with my flat iron, now I can grip the iron closer to the plate area which gives me more comtrol and allows me to get my hair even straighter.</li>
            <li>Very useful purchase!</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have used.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Glad I lost the original!</li>
            <li>a bright note, shipping was INCREDIBLY fast!</li>
            <li>It would be perfect if the fingers weren&#x27;t so long or perhaps came in two or three sizes:</li>
            <li>Curling iron gloves sounded like a perfect thing but good ones have been hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Great product, just what I was looking for to use with my new curling iron which came with a two-fingered heat resistant glove,</li>
            <li>now I noticed that with the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove on she is way more happy and jipper doing her</li>
            <li>I found the price reasonable &amp; I loved the FREE shipping!</li>
            <li>Does exactly the job it is suppose to do, was new and in perfect condition as described on product description!</li>
            <li>works great - no burns, even when learning to use the curling iron, this saved me!&lt;br /&gt;Received Quickly and exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I recommend to get well fitting, comfortable pair of glove from a store.</li>
            <li>and so far works great.  </li>
            <li>It fits great and completely protects my fingers.</li>
            <li>That is why I am so happy to have the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove.  </li>
            <li>No matter how careful you are or experienced you are, you can get a burn from a curling iron/rod!</li>
            <li>a snug fit would be better</li>
            <li>I have long fingers and the glove stretches to fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good quality.</li>
            <li>I see nothing special about it or even heat resistant!</li>
            <li>It looks like a shower mitt and you can still easily get burned through it.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and straightens (or curls)</li>
            <li>To state it easily &amp;#34;I will Never be without this Glove again.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Easy to slip on and off also.  </li>
            <li>Makes it easy to handle the curling wand without any problem.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I felt this was easy to use and</li>
            <li>Came very quickly and with no issues.</li>
            <li>The product is so easy to work with and handle.</li>
            <li>Nice fit and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I can still move my hands easily through my hair - no snags, no problems from the gloves.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,  although I bought a separate heat glove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I was expecting, and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>But its size makes it easy to take on and off to switch hands.</li>
            <li>This glove fits snugly and let&#x27;s your hand move easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I am strongly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product and how fast I received my order.</li>
            <li>Fingers Still get pretty warm.</li>
            <li>but I knew I&#x27;d be more comfortable with a full glove.  </li>
            <li>Works fine to protect your hand from being burned.</li>
            <li>The Glove works fine.</li>
            <li>It does that just fine.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to put on, light weight</li>
            <li>The product is fine, unless you sit there holding onto the iron.</li>
            <li>The material of this glove is fine - you won&#x27;t burn your fingers with it on.</li>
            <li>My wife had one of these gloves for doing her hair, however I also found it worked better than oven mitts when grabing something hot from the oven as I got a better grip.</li>
            <li>It came quickly also!</li>
            <li>I purchased this glove based on the reviews being mostly positive and thought this would be effective using a wand… but i can&#x27;t believe that this glove fits any women&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>It works very well and I am so glad I ordered 2!</li>
            <li>The glove fit fine and didn&#x27;t impede my use in any way.</li>
            <li>You can feel some heat through the glove, to be able to tell if your hair is burning or not, but it never got too hot!</li>
            <li>It was a HUGE hit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I have huge hands.</li>
            <li>The glove also fits comfortably and does not make my hand sweat.</li>
            <li>But after looking at Youtube videos and some online tips this really makes my hair look really nice.</li>
            <li>In contrast this HSI glove is made of a comfortable lightweight material that allows me to move my fingers freely when styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>You can smooth your hair while it is being curled and with this glove you won&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li>This glove was more hassle than it was worth.</li>
            <li>I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products.</li>
            <li>I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.</li>
            <li>This is a cheaply made material for this purpose, unravelled within a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>This is basically just a cheap cotton glove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s generous in size and comfortable.</li>
            <li>But, overall it is great.</li>
            <li>Fits comfortably.</li>
            <li>also, I liked argan oil sample so much that ordered biggest bottle yesterday.</li>
            <li>This has been a great tool as I need to be hands on when curling my short hair.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable, a must with the curling iron.</li>
            <li>It should work, and 2) It should fit.  </li>
            <li>There was no difference in comfort from heat and the cheap checkout glove fit and didn&#x27;t get caught in my styling tools.</li>
            <li>This was important to be as I&#x27;ve burned that area</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t use this one for taking things in and out of the oven, it&#x27;s too light for that.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable glove.</li>
            <li>A big thanks to HSI for a wonderful product..</li>
            <li>Purchased this item to replace the one that came with the curling wand and this one is FAR superior.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li>This glove works great for protecting your hand from the heat of curling iron, flat iron, etc.  </li>
            <li>Well made, soft, smooth, great to use with hot air dryer &amp; brushes or curling iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a normal cheap glove!!</li>
            <li>The nice thing is that there are a lot of quilters that also have new hair styles!  </li>
            <li>worked great with my keratin treatment for the 450 degree flat iron!</li>
            <li>The glove fits very well and resists heat fairly well but after about 10 min of straightening hair it gets a bit hot.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, and you won&#x27;t feel the heat.</li>
            <li>No more burnt fingers, so I&#x27;m really happy with the gloves, I used curling and flat iron work perfect on both</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did as I would have burned myself for sure after using this new tool.</li>
            <li>Great product, prevents little burns I&#x27;ve had with my curling iron; also amazingly fast and good service.</li>
            <li>The item arrived really quickly and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>However, my new curling iron and this glove are super effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hands safe from the extremely hot temperature of the iron.  </li>
            <li>Worth every dollar!</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Original review:</li>
            <li>Love this so much!</li>
            <li>Now I have no more burns, glove works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered this along with my hot iron.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li>Love protecting ny pretty hands from burns.</li>
            <li>I will have to sew off a significant piece of the finger length and cut it shorter.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that I don&#x27;t have to first buy yet another curling</li>
            <li>I used both together (three finger glove on first, then this glove on top of it) and still felt like my fingertips were getting burned.</li>
            <li>It does the job and doesn&#x27;t add significant bulk to my hands.</li>
            <li>I purchased the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for my girlfriend and this is what she told me about the item when she used it the first time (with a huge smile on her face), and I quote \\&quot;this glove is great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being totally honest, I&#x27;m still new to using my clamp-less iron.  </li>
            <li>the hair effectively leaving it smooth, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit super snugly</li>
            <li>Also, there is not that much heat resistance as opposed to the better fitting neoprene gloves, which cost just about the same, are more maneuverable and grip the hair better.  </li>
            <li>They fit my hand really good even though I have a smaller size hand.  </li>
            <li>Also Blue Novelties, the company I purchased from is a excellent company to do business with, as they not only shipped fast, but also follow up with an email to make sure you are satisfied with your purchas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does a great job without feeling like my hand precision is limited.</li>
            <li>The glove was the right size and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>The curling wand gets super hot and with the glove I was able to touch the wand to help me curl my hair without getting burnt.</li>
            <li>He would probably wear a size large in men&#x27;s gloves and has no problem fitting into this one-size-fits-all glove.  </li>
            <li>nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>Meh, I don&#x27;t feel like this glove is anything special.</li>
            <li>, i guess i thought it would have some special material.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any special heat-resistant properties.</li>
            <li>I love this glove and would recommend it very highly to anyone suffering from burning their hands while trying to curl their hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and doesn&#x27;t make it harder to feel your hair like you might think it would.  </li>
            <li>Works great, especially when first learning to use a curling wand.  </li>
            <li>I found this glove as being the most reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>am thrilled that I found the HSI Professional glove.  </li>
            <li>to the dollar store and buy a pair of cheap winter gloves, you&#x27;ll get the same protection, a better fit and TWO gloves to boot!</li>
            <li>If they fit your hand I could see liking them, but I just don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the money.</li>
            <li>Sewed on the mini 3 finger glove to the full glove and it works</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often because I am in love with my bouncy curls but every once in a while I like a change.  </li>
            <li>Its not too big and its a good price.</li>
            <li>It was comfortable to wear and really useful.</li>
            <li>The glove fits perfectly and is not bulky clumsy.  </li>
            <li>I decided to look for a full glove to keep my ring finger and pinky from getting burned.</li>
            <li>Keeps hands cool and let you manage your hair</li>
            <li>It does an ok job of protecting my hand from the heat, for the price, I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li>: provides full coverage to curling hand and heat protection (tested up to 330</li>
            <li>and I had to pay the full price ($25.00)</li>
            <li>I really like this glove much more than the one I bought when buying the curling iron.</li>
            <li>You will feel the heat through the glove if you do that, not terribly and not as much without it, but the glove is not 100% heat resistant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly petite woman, so the size of the glove is a bit big, but I understand why since it is a one size fits all.</li>
            <li>It keeps the fingers cool.</li>
            <li>Not a bad glove</li>
            <li>I liked it because even though it won&#x27;t hold the heat for long (it holds for about 6 to 10 seconds), it prevented me from burning my hand by accidentally touching the curling iron.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how easily I got used to not getting burned :)</li>
            <li>One of these gloves came with my HSI Flat Iron and at first it worked great.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for a good 8 months or more until I wore a couple small holes in it.  </li>
            <li>i LOVE that it really DOES heat up super quick.  </li>
            <li>This is a great heat resistant glove that does not get caught on my InStyler curler (which has teeth)/flat iron like some other heat resistant gloves have.  </li>
            <li>I saw this and thought if it&#x27;s good for keeping burns off hands from flat irons, it might work from mom.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>This glove is good for herstyler irons and the hotter flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for pressing the quilt pieces and seams, especially those tiny ones.  </li>
            <li>Oh, these are super cheap-looking too.</li>
            <li>Curling my hair goes so quickly now.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with more practice this glove will function better for me, but for now, I can only give it three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item came quick and is just as described.</li>
            <li>I had to buy another for my curling iron that only came with 3 fingers, non heat resistant and I burnt my fingers many, MANY times....</li>
            <li>Shipping was adequate and</li>
            <li>found it to be quite adequate for using my curling wand.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it will take me a while to get used to this, but I don&#x27;t think this glove provides adequate pretection from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While you can&#x27;t hold your hand against a hot tool for very long without feeling the heat, it is great for preventing quick accidental burns.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I have average size hands and it fits great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I do stick my iron inside when I&#x27;m done and even very hot</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and exactly as described!</li>
            <li>With the high temps of the modern hair irons, you&#x27;ve got to have one of these for your own safety.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use my new curling wand without it.</li>
            <li>It really keeps the heat off and is easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li>I was hitting the same spot on my finger repeatedly and was working on a pretty good blister, so I went looking for a solution.</li>
            <li>Ordering was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This glove is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m thinking of getting another one to use for my hot rollers!</li>
            <li>and I would not have been able to complete my hairstyle without it!</li>
            <li>I guess it is working pretty well for her!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>After losing it on a recent trip, I ordered this as a replacement--no more burned fingers!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to manage my hair while I use the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It would fit a large man&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>This is a great little item when working with the Curling wand that I bought.</li>
            <li>so my hair stays hot for a few seconds after flat ironing so being able to touch it immediately after is great!</li>
            <li>The special value of this glove is that it protects my wrists from getting singed by the hot iron.  </li>
            <li>It seems funny to order a special glove for curling your hair...</li>
            <li>I never had a curling iron that didn&#x27;t have a clasp before, so the whole idea of using this glove seemed totally bizarre t me.</li>
            <li>While these gloves still allow heat to penetrate to your fingers, they do fit well, and are very flexible.</li>
            <li>Comfortable glove that really protects against heat.</li>
            <li>For the cheap price, this glove works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also comes with a nice glove to handle your hot hair without burning your fingers, a very cute heat proof pouch made of red satin, and a tiny bottle of Argan oil.</li>
            <li>She had a Paul Mitchell, but says that this HSI is far better.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>she is even starting to do her own hair now that we have the glove to protect her hands.</li>
            <li>iron really is worth every dollar</li>
            <li>just enough to feel warm at times</li>
            <li>For the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and that was a worth while investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>well worth</li>
            <li>It is really useful and does what it claims.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy, stylish and affordable - worth the money</li>
            <li>only thing I would do to improve it, would be to have it offered in sizes for a better fit.</li>
            <li>I guess this is more protection than none, because I couldn&#x27;t even hold my hand near it without it.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical with it being so cheap, but it was great!!</li>
            <li>Hopefully, in the future, more sizes can be available.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;d have better protection just wearing any old glove.  </li>
            <li>Nothing heat protective about it.doent worth 6.99$ .</li>
            <li>It helps contribute to the great styling the flat iron offers.  </li>
            <li>I was wanting to do something different to my hair other than just straightening or curling, this is the perfect tool to get the beach wave look.</li>
            <li>What I love most about them, is that they don&#x27;t leave my hair static-y when I use them like some of the other gloves I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>I love this product is great when you use curling iron, hot rollers or flat iron, I have used it many times lately</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to return these and use my own winter gloves to flat iron hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering some kind of grippy tape for my flat iron&#x27;s handle for that, but that isn&#x27;t a fault of the design of this product as that \\&quot;feature\\&quot; wouldn&#x27;t work on this side of things.  </li>
            <li>It seems the heat just goes right through it.</li>
            <li>So this was just right for me.</li>
            <li>Does its job right and to the point, just like this review</li>
            <li>I feel the heat right away.</li>
            <li>Not the right product for me.</li>
            <li>Best of all, even though the material is lightweight, it keeps me safe from unpleasant burns &amp; scorches.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if it were resistant enough to keep it from getting uncomfortably hot</li>
            <li>It fits well and offers me great protection while using the hot curling irons and flat irons.</li>
            <li>but I have to say it is very large.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this flat iron at a very reasonable price, as some of them cost well over $100.  </li>
            <li>Still better than bare hands</li>
            <li>Way Better than straightening hair with bare hands</li>
            <li>It does feels better than bare hands, but I can still feel the heat - hence the reason for 4 star</li>
            <li>and I cannot tolerate much more heat with it than I do with bare fingers.  </li>
            <li>Gave it 2 stars because it&#x27;s better than just using bare fingers.</li>
            <li>My hair does not slip any more than it does with my bare hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would be better is it was tight fitting.</li>
            <li>gloves fit my hands fine, with maybe a bit of extra room at the fingertips.</li>
            <li>They are great even when my thirteen year old uses the hot spiral curler on very long hair.</li>
            <li>Also fits great to hand other fit much bigger !</li>
            <li>after reading a whole bunch of reviews about how awesome this product was, and how fast it heated up (because who wants to stand around while their hair straightener warms up enough to actually fix your hair?)</li>
            <li>Great product for such a low price!</li>
            <li>It  works great and the only improvement I would make is to have them come in different sizes.</li>
            <li>I just received this item yesterday and only used it once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Ive had the glove now for a few months and use it daily and its held up perfect !</li>
            <li>This glove solves the problem, is reasonably priced, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I can feel some heat through the glove while lightly pressing the ends of my hair against the iron, but it is comfortable enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>what can I say,the glove was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>also want to note that I have no trouble handling my fine hair with the glove on.</li>
            <li>I have straightened my hair and also created big ringlets quickly and easily with this iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then, I stumbled on the HSI glove used when curling irons are too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely no difference between this glove and the kind you get from a store selling winter cotton/yarn  gloves.  </li>
            <li>It works the same as putting a sock on your hand and touching the iron.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first HSI product in the mall about 10 years ago, it lasted 6+ years.</li>
            <li>but when I really want to take my time, I put it on and it works just as described!</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>I have had absolutely no issues with feeling like my fingers were getting too warm or even close to burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, I have used the glove many times since purchase &amp; have found that the extra finger length has not been a hindrance now that I am accustomed to working with it.  </li>
            <li>Heat glove as described, auick shipping - Thanks!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It gets as hot as the iron, so watch out...</li>
            <li>First of all I am not a beautician.  </li>
            <li>We crafters know just how hot our glue guns get,</li>
            <li>, if only there was heat resistant glove for my neck ... :)</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Even when she holds the hair on her wand, her hand never gets hot.</li>
            <li>I always have to try on 100 pairs of gloves to make sure that I don&#x27;t get that webbed finger look, but this glove was still too big.  </li>
            <li>I feel a bit of heat through the glove but it is not uncomfortable or burning.  </li>
            <li>also the price is very affordable!.</li>
            <li>Overall, i&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li>but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>thanks to this glove!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Tried three different gloves before this, none of them could handle heat better than this.</li>
            <li>This glove does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do keep my hand</li>
            <li>So big, I may not even be able to get any use out of it, whether it works or not.</li>
            <li>I admit to being a klutz around hot electric anythings.  </li>
            <li>I was working with because it was so hot.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li>(Get two ;-)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>how reasonably priced it was!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a bit more protection, but overall, the product functions as intended.  </li>
            <li>so I know exactly what temp to release my curl at.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>Does what it says, just doesn&#x27;t do exactly what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>I like the glove, but one came with my hot rollers so I did not need to buy it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The glove protected my fingers and allowed me to touch my hair while it was still hot.</li>
            <li>Pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, they do not perform well with higher temps.  </li>
            <li>I was going to return it, but paying for shipping really doesn&#x27;t make it worth it.</li>
            <li>I would only say that it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Even regular winter gloves worked better.  </li>
            <li>No more burns while making perfect spiral curls, this glove totally protects from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Your hand are not protected at all and are still burned by the hot rollers.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I will get a cover to put it on top once is turned on because it can burn the surface where you put it.</li>
            <li>Gives peace of mind that hot iron won&#x27;t  accidentally hit wrist.</li>
            <li>The one that came with my wand was felt, which I think works better, but it was only three fingers, and I can&#x27;t find any felt of sale.  </li>
            <li>The glove protects hands from heat while extracting  a turkey from a hot fryer.  </li>
            <li>Did not seem to work any better at resisting heat from my hot irons than a regular winter type glove.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for a product that was exactly as you advertised, and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>I love the all over coverage the glove provides versus the type that only covers 3 fingers.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>My first glove was a bonus</li>
            <li>Also, it didn&#x27;t actually work any better than a winter glove would.</li>
            <li>items like this that we don&#x27;t send back because it&#x27;d end up costing us more in time, effort, and shiping than we paid to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use this glove, since it was too big for my hand.</li>
            <li>This is the first heating glove I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I can grab my hair without burning and style it while its hot...</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to hold the hot end of the curling/flat iron.</li>
            <li>This curling wand does exactly what I wanted it to do</li>
            <li>Protected my hand from the heat pretty well.</li>
            <li>I did not realize how hot the curling wand I purchased for my granddaughter would get.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>On the InStyler, that is HOT.</li>
            <li>I only needed to be able to hold the ends of my hair while I curled it.  </li>
            <li>Could be more heat resistant but works well enough</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but keep in mind, I did not purposely test it by laying my finger on the hot metal.</li>
            <li>It makes using a wand curler so much easier !</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This glove works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>A heat resistant glove is pretty straight forward, right?</li>
            <li>I love this glove - I was always hitting a hot spot on my flat iron - and this glove prevents that.</li>
            <li>You will feel the heat  if you rest your fingers or hands for more than a moment on the hot flat iron or curling</li>
            <li>This glove is great, it is big enough to cover my hand and wrist so it doesn&#x27;t burn, and keeps me blister free while curling my short hair.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, it fits most hands well enough and certainly protects from the heat.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the fit, which they were a little more &#x27;heat resistant.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Turns out the little 3-finger glove that came with my wand, for free, is much more heat resistant.</li>
            <li>Before I had the glove, my fingers would be so red and very sore from touching her hot ironed hair while working on it...</li>
            <li>(obviously, don&#x27;t keep your hand on the hot piece for over 45 seconds consecutively, then you will feel the real heat), but hey 45 seconds is much more than 3 seconds before pain</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I ordered a 2nd one and now just wear both while I style my hair.  </li>
            <li>flat iron is truly amazing after I used it the first day I got it, with the included oil, my hair was soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a heat glove to use with my professional (that means super dang hot) heat tools.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too - thanks!</li>
            <li>I just knew I had to stop burning my fingers when using my hot rollers and straight iron.</li>
            <li>I really like this glove as my curling wand gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>You can feel the heat for sure, but no burning as long as you keep moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well for holding hot hair irons</li>
            <li>However, if your hands are bigger and you tend to burn yourself while using your curling or flat iron then they are a good idea.</li>
            <li>She was able to wrap her very long hair around the barrel of the iron without any burn or discomfort.</li>
            <li>The previous glove I had came with my curling iron, but I use these kind of gloves for any heat styling of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I found it easy enough to comb through my hair with the gloves on as well-</li>
            <li>The seller shipped it very quickly too; I received it on the same day as my Prime order!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s snug enough so that it&#x27;s easy to handle my hair.</li>
            <li>I found a lot of large bulky gloves that are used for industrial type work.  </li>
            <li>For a lady, I have large hands.  </li>
            <li>The glove did run large and she never said anything about it.</li>
            <li>The glove is not meant to hold on to the iron, but will certainly keep you from being burned if your fingers accidentally touch the iron.  </li>
            <li>way too large for my hands</li>
            <li>Runs large</li>
            <li>I have rather large hands for a woman, and my daughter can use the glove as well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks much for a product that makes doing what I have to do with all these hot tools much safer.</li>
            <li>This glove isn&#x27;t effective against any setting hot enough to actually curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the one I previously puchased so much</li>
            <li>My husband is a chef and sometimes needs to handle hot ramekins and other items that require more dexterity than an oven mitt/glove.  </li>
            <li>I used the curling iron for the first time and was particular not to burn my fingers.</li>
            <li>, it works so that is the main thing, I like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in COMPLETE agreement with the reviewer that stated something to the effect of, as soon as the glove starts to get too hot, your hair is done!  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m okay with that because it&#x27;s really hard to find glove sizes that fit my hand anyway</li>
            <li>It shipped fast, and was packaged</li>
            <li>I thought the whole purpose was to protect my fingers from the heat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to be concerned that the heat of the iron will cause me problems thanks to the gloves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She went on to say that thanks to the glove</li>
            <li>I can still comb my fingers through my very curly hair, while wearing these gloves.</li>
            <li>It really blocked the heat of the curling iron.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It makes styling my hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li>The item was as described and the shipment was very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you do not want to burn the counter or vanity that you are working to style your hair, this product works very well</li>
            <li>I really like this glove.  </li>
            <li>I can now freely manipulate the brush without the heat discomfort on the left hand.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>Make curling my hair much easier now.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without it.</li>
            <li>The package included a heat resistant glove as well which made it so much easier to hold my hair while straightening it.</li>
            <li>Really helps preventing burning your hands.</li>
            <li>and it really does work.</li>
            <li>They must have been made for some beefy construction workers hands.</li>
            <li>very flimsy.</li>
            <li>This Glove does not block the heat, might as well have used a regular cheap glove from walmart.  </li>
            <li>i think that would be a selling point for anyone who wants to save time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do that...</li>
            <li>I highly suggest you purchase this one!</li>
            <li>I really had no idea what to look for in a heat resistant glove.</li>
            <li>I tried and really like it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this glove to use with the curling iron and it protected my fingers from the heat very well.</li>
            <li>it really keeps the heat away from your fingers and makes the process of ironing your hair a lot safer</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve gone to Walmart and bought a cheap, regular pair of gloves instead of waiting for this one glove.</li>
            <li>The glove is much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see how these are any different from cheap mittens one can get at walmart?</li>
            <li>and this glove really helps.</li>
            <li>She uses it very often.</li>
            <li>One size doesn&#x27;t fit all - it&#x27;s way bigger for my hand and those extras keep getting in the way</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really even use it.  </li>
            <li>and it definitely helps to keep my hand burn free.</li>
            <li>Protects my hand very well.</li>
            <li>Too much for a glove.</li>
            <li>I really like this glove</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you worry about burning yourself while curling your hair!</li>
            <li>Really &amp;#34;takes the heat&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Makes curling my hair with a 400 degree iron much easier because I&#x27;m not as scared to burn my hand.  </li>
            <li>Not what I expected, but ok</li>
            <li>and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>but it absolutely makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>These gloves are real hand savers.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel heat really.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience using a curling iron</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried full-on holding the hot end of the wand with it, but for normal use it works well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the prompt service and delivery.</li>
            <li>Someone suggestion this glove and it works very well.....</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work because I curl my hair all the time</li>
            <li>This is really a must have when using straighteners.</li>
            <li>It makes using clipless irons much easier.</li>
            <li>Expected more.</li>
            <li>It arrived and makes using my curling rod (w/o a clip) much easier.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recomend it!</li>
            <li>My hand thanks me for getting this.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t knew what to think about it, I have never heard of it before, but I can say it works very well...</li>
            <li>and then you really start to burn.</li>
            <li>I really wished I had saved my receipt to return this.  </li>
            <li>All in all I really like these gloves</li>
            <li>This glove really works well with the clipless curling iron.  </li>
            <li>but I really think it would make sense to sell 2.  </li>
            <li>I love the results from the iron, but it used to take forever because I had to be so careful not to burn my fingers when wrapping and holding the hair around the barrel.  </li>
            <li>This glove works really well.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this glove to anyone who wants to protect themselves.</li>
            <li>But my wife absolutely loves it for doing her hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine trying to really use it.</li>
            <li>I do like my glove but wished I had listened to others and just went and bought a cheap pair of winter gloves as it is the same thing</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Really protects my hand when I&#x27;m using a clipless curling iron.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and efficient.  </li>
            <li>The iron I purchased does not have a clip to hold the hair in place, and this glove works really well.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I bought this and it works very well</li>
            <li>I bought this glove and it worked very well</li>
            <li>Obviously its not made to be able to hold an iron directly.</li>
            <li>However, with the glove on I was able to place my hand on the hair directly as it was curling and obviously felt a bit of heat</li>
            <li>Just exactly what we needed to go with our new curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen these advertised with different curling irons and thought they would be handily when using my flat iron for curling my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, with coarse strands AND thinner strands, so I keep my iron pretty warm for the coarse parts.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and prevent burns from the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>And the quality is much better than the other glove I had before.</li>
            <li>especially if you are constantly using hot tools &#x3D;] would recommend to anyonee</li>
            <li>want to get a good glove to pretect my hand when using curing rod, see the good reviews and purchase this one, want to give it a try,  but the glove is way too small and thin, heat resistant?</li>
            <li>It was so frustrating and made it take so long to curl my hair that I just took it off and tried my best not to burn my hands.  </li>
            <li>and I normally wear large in women&#x27;s gloves and medium in men&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>What a great idea for us novices or folks who are not good with hair appliances!  </li>
            <li>This glove is no different, it doesnt have any special coating or lining</li>
            <li>Maybe a little loose, but works great.</li>
            <li>My hair falls out so quickly and I really hate using any hair spray so this works awesome for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The glove didn&#x27;t fit, finger length was too long</li>
            <li>This helps a bunch and it&#x27;s long enough to cover past your wrist, great buy!</li>
            <li>and my hands are kind of small, so</li>
            <li>Hey I am up for anything that saves my skin and finger that iron is hot also it it a professional  product</li>
            <li>in the past I have singed my fingertips before, no problems now with this handy glove.</li>
            <li>Does what I need, just use it in my left hand when I&#x27;m using the Instyller, I burned my hand so many times before because I am not very experienced using the Iron or the InsStyler, so now I can be confident I wont get burn.</li>
            <li>I like my new heat resistant glove!</li>
            <li>Since the highest setting is too hot for my fine hair, I only go up to the 2nd hottest setting (375 degrees).  </li>
            <li>In order to be one size fits all, the glove is a bit roomy, particularly in the length of the fingers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first glove of this type I&#x27;ve used, but it worked exactly as I expected, it fits fine and offers a balance of heat protection vs ability to feel through the glove.</li>
            <li>Static is created between hair and glove, so it&#x27;s much more difficult to manage the styling process.</li>
            <li>i can hold the styling brush longer without the blower heat burning my fingers for an extra 15 seconds , thats more than enough to do what i need to do.</li>
            <li>Super solid product.  </li>
            <li>if only my neck was so lucky...</li>
            <li>I use it mainly when I curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I love that these cover the whole hand and not just a few fingers.</li>
            <li>This glove is better than no glove, I guess, but I agree with those reviews that say that this glove seems no different from a simple, cotton glove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not have thick insulation, but it still offers good protection.</li>
            <li>I am right handed and could really use a glove for my left hand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this glove for quilters everywhere.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this glove.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li>This heat resistant glove fits well and protects me from the high heat of the curling irons.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this glove to assist my jr. high age daughter curl her hair.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be thicker to keep the high heat away from your hand, but it is thinner than I thought.</li>
            <li>I am kind of new to using flat irons, lets just say I had to try quite a few to get the right one.</li>
            <li>One star off because it could be a little more heat resistant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more pricey</li>
            <li>However, we don&#x27;t even think about how we lose a lot more when we buy little &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Luckily I had my heat protection cover from a flat iron I have.</li>
            <li>Fit is as expected.</li>
            <li>It protects my fingers just as much as my crusty old winter wool gloves would.</li>
            <li>My mother in law got me an &amp;#34;ov-glove&amp;#34; to try and it completely blocks the heat, but is much bulkier than this glove.</li>
            <li>This one was huge and repeatedly got caught when I closed both my straightner and curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I normally buy a size 7.5 in gloves</li>
            <li>makes straightening my hair go by so much faster since I can actually handle the hot hair.</li>
            <li>But after about 4 months the protective coating does wear off and now it&#x27;s like a normal winter glove.</li>
            <li>It will also burn your fingers if the contact with the iron is more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li>I feel that this is normal.</li>
            <li>I was irritated but it didn&#x27;t seem worth sending back because it was inexpensive to begin with.</li>
            <li>But for the sake of preventing your hands from burning from the normal course of doing your hair, it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>the finger sections are a full inch too long on all of my fingers!  </li>
            <li>I can put the iron right up next to my fingers as I press the seams</li>
            <li>I put my hand right on the curling iron, which was at 400 degrees in tempature and felt only warmth.</li>
            <li>it was a little big, but i have small hand, still work perfect.</li>
            <li>She can curl her long hair using this flat iron which she cannot do as easily with the straight edge</li>
            <li>Other than the glove being HUGE, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>My sewing/quilting group is always coming up with new ideas to use things new.</li>
            <li>so I searched and found the product and purchased a new one.</li>
            <li>I purchased this glove to work with my new curling wand.</li>
            <li>Since all of her friends comment on the new waves in her hair, she tells them about the curling wand and the glove she uses.</li>
            <li>So I went to Amazon to find a new one and ordered this product.</li>
            <li>Hoped this would help my daughter not burn herself with her new iron</li>
            <li>I would continue to burn my hand while using my new, heavier curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking I would wear it while using my new hair straightener but haven&#x27;t needed it.  </li>
            <li>Bought the glove to go with a new curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It does not serve the purpose, my right thumb is feeling the pain of using my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, but you do not want to touch the Iron to much or too long, is better then the regular glove for Winter, I guess, but I never try to feel the different.</li>
            <li>There is a little light on top which is red when you first turn it on and which changes to green when the iron has heated up and is at the temperature you specified with the temperature control dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No problems so far!</li>
            <li>The glove definitely protected the hand from the hot iron.</li>
            <li>It is hot enough that it smooths my hair with one pass of the iron and it works when you twist it a bit to create and wave.  </li>
            <li>She used it on every female in the house the first day.</li>
            <li>The flat Iron holder works very well for keeping the iron off the counter while you are styling your hair, since the iron does get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I feel my hand is getting too hot when handling my hair next to the barrel.</li>
            <li>Plus, I hold my hair to the iron with this glove and when it finally gets hot on my hand, I know my hair is done.  </li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting a unique product only to open it and say &amp;</li>
            <li>So far, no burned fingers!  </li>
            <li>It is certainly not \\&quot;heat-resistant,\\&quot; which implies some sort of special material.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this flat iron on not only my hair</li>
            <li>This is all I need from now on for all sorts of styles and no more pain from touching the iron accidentally.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty happ with it.</li>
            <li>this has been the first glove that actually works for me while doing my hair!</li>
            <li>I use it to keep the hot hair off my daughter&#x27;s back when styling her hair.</li>
            <li>but you actually bet a whole pair for a Buck or two instead of one glove for $6.99!</li>
            <li>A heat resistant glove for flat irons should fit your hand snugly enough that you can use that hand to assist with your styling.  </li>
            <li>Useful for curling iron but fingers are made for a monkey.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute necessary product 2 use with ur new herstyler!</li>
            <li>The glove arrived quickly and is everything I expected.</li>
            <li>First time for me, of course not the same to feel your hair as with the bare hand, but it does what I need, preventing me from burning my hand again!!!</li>
            <li>Flat irons get hot</li>
            <li>I wish it was a tight fit to my hand, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My main critique is that there&#x27;s nothing apparently \\&quot;special\\&quot; about this glove to make it heat resistant.</li>
            <li>I tend to be clumsy and prefer to have my entire hand covered in the event that I lose my grip on the wand or inadvertently touch the wand with more than just 3 fingers!</li>
            <li>But this glove seemed to be extra large.</li>
            <li>It has certainly saved me several steamed fingers.  </li>
            <li>A must for certain curling irons, but it&#x27;s easier to use a regular curling iron and not have to deal with a the glove protection.</li>
            <li>I felt like a little kid wearing my parents cheap cotton gloves from the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because it was half of the original listing price</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve used an old cotton glove and saved money!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Quite frankly, there isn&#x27;t much of a difference between using this \\&quot;heat resistant\\&quot; glove and any generic glove that you may already have in your winter closet.</li>
            <li>Wrapping my short straight hair around a heated curling rod was burning the tips of my fingers, until I purchased this glove.</li>
            <li>this completely protected my hand from my curling wand</li>
            <li>What sold me was reading reviews from professional stylists who use this glove and like it.  </li>
            <li>Like all the others, it doesn&#x27;t completely keep the heat away, but I don&#x27;t burn myself.</li>
            <li>As clumsy as I am when it comes to using heated curling tools (as evidenced by the many burns on my hands/neck/etc.)</li>
            <li>This by far outshines them all in performance.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d known what it was like, I would have just dug up and old winter glove from my sock drawer.  </li>
            <li>They did not protect my fingers nearly as well.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t offer much protection overall.</li>
            <li>First the fingers are ridiculously long, like XL glove size.</li>
            <li>This is working well so far.  </li>
            <li>You will feel some heat through glove but use that as an indicator of when to complete your hold and release curl.  </li>
            <li>I chose to replace it with this one because it said professional.  </li>
            <li>If this is professional,  I&#x27;ll take a substandard freebie any day.</li>
            <li>Before I made that asumption, I tried it on both my husband and my adult son.  </li>
            <li>a considerable amount of the forearm.</li>
            <li>Its not for putting your hand directly on the heat tool, its for allowing you to get close without feeling the heat.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t block the heat completely, but you&#x27;re not going to be burned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also soft, lightweight, and stretchy, so it&#x27;s not cumbersome when styling.</li>
            <li>This is simple product that works really well.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came in at least two sizes, this and a smaller one.</li>
            <li>This wonderful glove has allowed me to once again curl my hair without burning the crap out  of myself.</li>
            <li>You can also pin each curl to your head so they can cool completely without gravity pulling them down.</li>
            <li>It is flexible so that I can easily handle the small</li>
            <li>I have had success using this with flat irons, curling irons especially.</li>
            <li>:) it doesn&#x27;t slide down, but its almost an inch too long on all my fingers, and my whole life I&#x27;ve been &#x27;joked&#x27; about my long piano finger hands.</li>
            <li>I use it with my curling iron and flat iron and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 12 y/o daughter, to use with her flat iron, and she said it works really well.</li>
            <li>She uses a flat iron and this glove makes that job so much easier.</li>
            <li>Its very helpful when working with curling and flat irons.</li>
            <li>I really like this glove, it is well made, and it helps to use when styling hair with rod curler or flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I use my left hand to keep the brush steady when the hair is drying on the brush.  </li>
            <li>I use one in my sewing room when ironing, especially when I am sewing a quilt top or a small craft project.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it is way too big for my small hands, would have been better if it came in</li>
            <li>I just got my hair cut to shoulder length and have to learn how to curl the shorter hair particularly in the back.</li>
            <li>A third glove remains and I suspect it will have the same fate as the first two.</li>
            <li>As a former stylist, I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I have no other complaints besides the size!</li>
            <li>but i have small hands and it is HUGE.</li>
            <li>Makes it so much nicer to hold onto hair while flat ironing and not burning bare fingers.  </li>
            <li>so I usually alter/sew them to fit.</li>
            <li>I have small hands, and these fit even my hands rather well.</li>
            <li>They would easily fit anyone who wears a small or medium glove.</li>
            <li>I have normal sized hands for a female.</li>
            <li>I have fairly large hands and very long fingers for a woman</li>
            <li>So I see a lot of complaints about this glove not being resistant, calm down.</li>
            <li>Smooth shiny hairis the result with only a little effort.</li>
            <li>I bought this glove for my teen daughter to use with her new curling wand.</li>
            <li>Several years ago I purchased a heat resistant glove (different brand), but it was so bulky that I ended up getting rid of it as I could not move my fingers very well in coordinating with the curler.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for a glove I had in the past, it has been just as good, if not better</li>
            <li>it made well, not to thick, but easy to use.</li>
            <li>This glove does all that, I even had my finger resting against a VERY hot curling iron for a few moments while I waited for my hair to curl</li>
            <li>I was getting burnt due to it getting so hot.  </li>
            <li>I tried them out the other day with my hot iron- when the iron hit my hand, I didn&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li>no regrets with this purchase!</li>
            <li>All very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone with long hair and steady hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to flat irons</li>
            <li>My daughter loves using her glove with her new flat iron.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a large barrel curling iron and realized it had no place to hold on while I curled my long hair.  </li>
            <li>Not for a prolonged hold, but great for insurance against bad accidental burns.</li>
            <li>Pick one up from a dollar general and save some money.</li>
            <li>No more heat resistant than a regular cheap cotton glove.  </li>
            <li>Now you have an extra if one is old or get lost.</li>
            <li>Feels just like a regular old cotton glove.  </li>
            <li>and I barely felt the heat at all..</li>
            <li>I have used it several times so far</li>
            <li>Since I can no longer feel the heat from my hair, I just need to be careful not to apply too much heat.  </li>
            <li>I can touch the curling iron and barely feel any heat from the iron.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my ten year old daughter to curl her hair.</li>
            <li>The glove works, but just barely.  </li>
            <li>I might as well put my bare hands on here, because it wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, protects from the heat and isn&#x27;t too thick to know what you&#x27;re doing with your fingers.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who especially use the high heat flat irons</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made out of a knit, sweater type of fabric that renders the glove too big and bulky to work with, particularly the fingertips where the seams and extra cloth prohibit proper grip on your hair as you wrap it around the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>So, when I try to use a hot tool to fix my hair, I end up feeling clumsy and like I can&#x27;t get a decent hold on anything.  </li>
            <li>B00563K6VO HSI PROFESSIONAL Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron.</li>
            <li>Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron.</li>
            <li>I just purchased the HSI PROFESSIONAL Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron</li>
            <li>B00563K6VO HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron.</li>
            <li>Wow...Total hot mess.</li>
            <li>:B00563K6VO HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00563K6VO HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron.</li>
            <li>This glove is so thin and pointless, I would have had more success using an oven mit.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive hands due to medical issues and the gloves I purchased really help when I am using my flat iron.</li>
            <li>At least with a regular glove they stretch to fit your hands.</li>
            <li>I recently went on a trip and accidentally left my old glove at a hotel.</li>
            <li>She gave one to a friend who reached the same conclusion and took the same action.  </li>
            <li>Once I feel a little bit of heat through the glove, I know the hair is ready!</li>
            <li>She said the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove is thin enough to fit comfortably but thick enough to protect her hand and fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona where the super dry climate makes hair really hard to manage.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased *HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed straight for 3 days instead of poofing up after only 1 with the other irons that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gloves are slightly too large but will work for curling hair.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t be bothered to return it - $13 down the drain.</li>
            <li>Some are made from a very scratchy plastic - somewhat like a dish washing scratch pad, and have thick wide seams that make it hard to feel effectively.  </li>
            <li>In the beginning it&#x27;s great and unlike the previous bad review it DOES protect your hand and is not your normal run of the mill winter glove.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not worried about starting a fire, I&#x27;m worried about comfort from major heat and possibly a burn.</li>
            <li>I like that the glove is long, it is not tight around my wrist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard as it is to use a curling wand with precision let alone some flimsy gloves that don&#x27;t fit - fingers too long.</li>
            <li>only gripe is that it is too big for my hand which makes it a little awkward, so having this in a smaller size would be ideal.</li>
            <li>My 18 year old younger but larger brother (much taller and bigger than me 6&#x27;2, football built big hands) tries it on and the finger part of glove are still to long for him!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>The glove is a little large on my hands (and my hands are probably medium size), but I have gotten used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>think I have average-sized hands for a woman, but this glove was a little large.</li>
            <li>Just a very little warmth felt, but curling iron is EXTREMELY HOT &amp; w/out glove, would give &gt; 3rd degree burns (if a measure of &gt;3rd degree existed)!!  </li>
            <li>So, good for heat, bad for women&#x27;s size hand.</li>
            <li>The worse part is how huge it is.</li>

            <li> Very good product</li>
            <li> Very good vendor.  </li>
            <li> They all said it is a very good iron.</li>
            <li> iron is working just great and the glove perfectly resists from heat and burning fingers.</li>
            <li> Good for me for peace of mind!</li>
            <li> Good product!</li>
            <li> its always good 2 have a backup!</li>
            <li> With this glove, I wrapped the ends of my hair around the curling iron and held it there until it was beautifully curled and shiny.</li>
            <li> It helps me get the curling iron in the best position for a good curl, without burning my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The glove itself is made well and has really good heat resistance, but to me the best feature is a bit of a longer cuff.</li>
            <li> great product, does a good job of resisting the heat!</li>
            <li> Good quality &#x3D; happy mom and thrilled teenager!!</li>

            <li> This is going to be a great tool this summer.</li>
            <li> Works really great.</li>

            <li> It works great as you can hold on to your hair and touch the curling iron and not get burnt.  </li>

            <li> The seller was great, too, and this was a smooth transaction all the way.</li>
            <li> It also washes nicely.</li>
            <li> I paid the shipping cost to show them that there are some people would not buy into this kind of fraud.</li>
            <li> It fitted nicely my daughter&#x27;s hand (tall 5&#x27;11 with proportionate hands).</li>
            <li> Protects you from the heat..  Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> so it is always handy.  </li>
            <li> It does get warm from the iron though.</li>
            <li> The material might fool you into thinking that it&#x27;s just another winter kind of glove that you can get anywhere and that it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t give a comprehensive review of this product.</li>

            <li> and she like it nice producte</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it weren&#x27;t so slippy for those transfers, but I don&#x27;t see a way around that since any kind of \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; coating would also cause it to catch on your hair.  </li>
            <li> In the picture it looks really nice</li>
            <li> i would have liked it if it was tighter</li>

            <li> Not only was I happy to find a product like this, but really happy that it works!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t heatproof, but when they start to warm up, you know your hair is done.</li>

            <li> I love the fact that I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was going to burn or anything like that.</li>
            <li> The weave is tighter and I think it is a better quality than the one that came with my wand.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s kind of huge, which is a problem when you&#x27;re trying to maneuver, because the fingers keep getting bunched up, which makes yur hair slip off the rod</li>
            <li> These heat gloves are wonderful.will order more.</li>
            <li> cost of the glove was appropriate.</li>
            <li> I love the interchangeable sizes and being able to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> I am better off burning my fingers than hassling with this thing.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to make sure that I have gloves for both hands for using my curling wand.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the glove.  </li>
            <li> THIS ADDED PROTECTION MAKES ME FEEL SAFE.</li>
            <li> havnt been able to get use to it</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great price.</li>
            <li> Most of us Wil never be robbed by a guy in a mask holding a weapon.  </li>
            <li> I love this glove.</li>
            <li> so I can part my hair sections better.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find a glove that keeps you from burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> This glove makes sure that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> Could not touch iron for more than 10 seconds before getting burned.</li>
            <li> I love this Item</li>
            <li> I use this glove every time I curl, and it keeps my skin safe from accidental burns.</li>
            <li> The glove works better than the glove that came with my curling iron.</li>
            <li> It helps some with protecting my fingers when I use my curling wand, but I am still looking for a better product.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> My hair holds heat and with this glove I am able to style without burning my finger-tips.  </li>
            <li> The material takes some getting used to, since the glove is not form fitting.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job, much nicer then the glove included with the iron.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on a hand (not sratchy).</li>
            <li> hope to find a better, thinner glove that provides better protection from the heat.</li>
            <li> This glove is much better than the one that came with the wand.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many rows of bristles, which allow a lot of exposed metal, and so I&#x27;m my always burning my finger when I&#x27;m styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know they made things like this, figuring everyone else was just better at using these tools.</li>
            <li> I am sure it works and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> It seems to be adaptable to most any size hand.  </li>
            <li> The thicker the section of hair the more protection you have using the glove this way.</li>
            <li> Prevents burning hands &amp; fingers while still able to grip iron or styling tools.</li>
            <li> If your gloved finger gets too close to the heat, you will start to feel it and be able to pull away.  </li>
            <li> and I burned my hand alot when trying to flip my hair, this glove was the perfect remedy for use with my flat iron, now I can grip the iron closer to the plate area which gives me more comtrol and allows me to get my hair even straighter.</li>
            <li> Very useful purchase!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have used.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Glad I lost the original!</li>
            <li> a bright note, shipping was INCREDIBLY fast!</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if the fingers weren&#x27;t so long or perhaps came in two or three sizes:</li>
            <li> Curling iron gloves sounded like a perfect thing but good ones have been hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Great product, just what I was looking for to use with my new curling iron which came with a two-fingered heat resistant glove,</li>
            <li> now I noticed that with the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove on she is way more happy and jipper doing her</li>
            <li> I found the price reasonable &amp; I loved the FREE shipping!</li>
            <li> Does exactly the job it is suppose to do, was new and in perfect condition as described on product description!</li>
            <li> works great - no burns, even when learning to use the curling iron, this saved me!&lt;br /&gt;Received Quickly and exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I recommend to get well fitting, comfortable pair of glove from a store.</li>
            <li> and so far works great.  </li>
            <li> It fits great and completely protects my fingers.</li>
            <li> That is why I am so happy to have the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove.  </li>
            <li> No matter how careful you are or experienced you are, you can get a burn from a curling iron/rod!</li>
            <li> a snug fit would be better</li>
            <li> I have long fingers and the glove stretches to fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good quality.</li>
            <li> I see nothing special about it or even heat resistant!</li>
            <li> It looks like a shower mitt and you can still easily get burned through it.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and straightens (or curls)</li>
            <li> To state it easily &amp;#34;I will Never be without this Glove again.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Easy to slip on and off also.  </li>
            <li> Makes it easy to handle the curling wand without any problem.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I felt this was easy to use and</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and with no issues.</li>
            <li> The product is so easy to work with and handle.</li>
            <li> Nice fit and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can still move my hands easily through my hair - no snags, no problems from the gloves.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,  although I bought a separate heat glove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I was expecting, and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> But its size makes it easy to take on and off to switch hands.</li>
            <li> This glove fits snugly and let&#x27;s your hand move easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I am strongly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and how fast I received my order.</li>
            <li> Fingers Still get pretty warm.</li>
            <li> but I knew I&#x27;d be more comfortable with a full glove.  </li>
            <li> Works fine to protect your hand from being burned.</li>
            <li> The Glove works fine.</li>
            <li> It does that just fine.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to put on, light weight</li>
            <li> The product is fine, unless you sit there holding onto the iron.</li>
            <li> The material of this glove is fine - you won&#x27;t burn your fingers with it on.</li>
            <li> My wife had one of these gloves for doing her hair, however I also found it worked better than oven mitts when grabing something hot from the oven as I got a better grip.</li>
            <li> It came quickly also!</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove based on the reviews being mostly positive and thought this would be effective using a wand… but i can&#x27;t believe that this glove fits any women&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> It works very well and I am so glad I ordered 2!</li>
            <li> The glove fit fine and didn&#x27;t impede my use in any way.</li>
            <li> You can feel some heat through the glove, to be able to tell if your hair is burning or not, but it never got too hot!</li>
            <li> It was a HUGE hit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I have huge hands.</li>
            <li> The glove also fits comfortably and does not make my hand sweat.</li>
            <li> But after looking at Youtube videos and some online tips this really makes my hair look really nice.</li>
            <li> In contrast this HSI glove is made of a comfortable lightweight material that allows me to move my fingers freely when styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> You can smooth your hair while it is being curled and with this glove you won&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> This glove was more hassle than it was worth.</li>
            <li> I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products.</li>
            <li> I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.</li>
            <li> This is a cheaply made material for this purpose, unravelled within a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> This is basically just a cheap cotton glove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s generous in size and comfortable.</li>
            <li> But, overall it is great.</li>
            <li> Fits comfortably.</li>
            <li> also, I liked argan oil sample so much that ordered biggest bottle yesterday.</li>
            <li> This has been a great tool as I need to be hands on when curling my short hair.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable, a must with the curling iron.</li>
            <li> It should work, and 2) It should fit.  </li>
            <li> There was no difference in comfort from heat and the cheap checkout glove fit and didn&#x27;t get caught in my styling tools.</li>
            <li> This was important to be as I&#x27;ve burned that area</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t use this one for taking things in and out of the oven, it&#x27;s too light for that.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable glove.</li>
            <li> A big thanks to HSI for a wonderful product..</li>
            <li> Purchased this item to replace the one that came with the curling wand and this one is FAR superior.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li> This glove works great for protecting your hand from the heat of curling iron, flat iron, etc.  </li>
            <li> Well made, soft, smooth, great to use with hot air dryer &amp; brushes or curling iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a normal cheap glove!!</li>
            <li> The nice thing is that there are a lot of quilters that also have new hair styles!  </li>
            <li> worked great with my keratin treatment for the 450 degree flat iron!</li>
            <li> The glove fits very well and resists heat fairly well but after about 10 min of straightening hair it gets a bit hot.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, and you won&#x27;t feel the heat.</li>
            <li> No more burnt fingers, so I&#x27;m really happy with the gloves, I used curling and flat iron work perfect on both</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did as I would have burned myself for sure after using this new tool.</li>
            <li> Great product, prevents little burns I&#x27;ve had with my curling iron; also amazingly fast and good service.</li>
            <li> The item arrived really quickly and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> However, my new curling iron and this glove are super effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hands safe from the extremely hot temperature of the iron.  </li>
            <li> Worth every dollar!</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Original review:</li>
            <li> Love this so much!</li>
            <li> Now I have no more burns, glove works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered this along with my hot iron.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Love protecting ny pretty hands from burns.</li>
            <li> I will have to sew off a significant piece of the finger length and cut it shorter.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that I don&#x27;t have to first buy yet another curling</li>
            <li> I used both together (three finger glove on first, then this glove on top of it) and still felt like my fingertips were getting burned.</li>
            <li> It does the job and doesn&#x27;t add significant bulk to my hands.</li>
            <li> I purchased the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for my girlfriend and this is what she told me about the item when she used it the first time (with a huge smile on her face), and I quote \\&quot;this glove is great</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being totally honest, I&#x27;m still new to using my clamp-less iron.  </li>
            <li> the hair effectively leaving it smooth, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit super snugly</li>
            <li> Also, there is not that much heat resistance as opposed to the better fitting neoprene gloves, which cost just about the same, are more maneuverable and grip the hair better.  </li>
            <li> They fit my hand really good even though I have a smaller size hand.  </li>
            <li> Also Blue Novelties, the company I purchased from is a excellent company to do business with, as they not only shipped fast, but also follow up with an email to make sure you are satisfied with your purchas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does a great job without feeling like my hand precision is limited.</li>
            <li> The glove was the right size and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The curling wand gets super hot and with the glove I was able to touch the wand to help me curl my hair without getting burnt.</li>
            <li> He would probably wear a size large in men&#x27;s gloves and has no problem fitting into this one-size-fits-all glove.  </li>
            <li> nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> Meh, I don&#x27;t feel like this glove is anything special.</li>
            <li> , i guess i thought it would have some special material.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any special heat-resistant properties.</li>
            <li> I love this glove and would recommend it very highly to anyone suffering from burning their hands while trying to curl their hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and doesn&#x27;t make it harder to feel your hair like you might think it would.  </li>
            <li> Works great, especially when first learning to use a curling wand.  </li>
            <li> I found this glove as being the most reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> am thrilled that I found the HSI Professional glove.  </li>
            <li> to the dollar store and buy a pair of cheap winter gloves, you&#x27;ll get the same protection, a better fit and TWO gloves to boot!</li>
            <li> If they fit your hand I could see liking them, but I just don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the money.</li>
            <li> Sewed on the mini 3 finger glove to the full glove and it works</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often because I am in love with my bouncy curls but every once in a while I like a change.  </li>
            <li> Its not too big and its a good price.</li>
            <li> It was comfortable to wear and really useful.</li>
            <li> The glove fits perfectly and is not bulky clumsy.  </li>
            <li> I decided to look for a full glove to keep my ring finger and pinky from getting burned.</li>
            <li> Keeps hands cool and let you manage your hair</li>
            <li> It does an ok job of protecting my hand from the heat, for the price, I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> : provides full coverage to curling hand and heat protection (tested up to 330</li>
            <li> and I had to pay the full price ($25.00)</li>
            <li> I really like this glove much more than the one I bought when buying the curling iron.</li>
            <li> You will feel the heat through the glove if you do that, not terribly and not as much without it, but the glove is not 100% heat resistant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly petite woman, so the size of the glove is a bit big, but I understand why since it is a one size fits all.</li>
            <li> It keeps the fingers cool.</li>
            <li> Not a bad glove</li>
            <li> I liked it because even though it won&#x27;t hold the heat for long (it holds for about 6 to 10 seconds), it prevented me from burning my hand by accidentally touching the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how easily I got used to not getting burned :)</li>
            <li> One of these gloves came with my HSI Flat Iron and at first it worked great.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for a good 8 months or more until I wore a couple small holes in it.  </li>
            <li> i LOVE that it really DOES heat up super quick.  </li>
            <li> This is a great heat resistant glove that does not get caught on my InStyler curler (which has teeth)/flat iron like some other heat resistant gloves have.  </li>
            <li> I saw this and thought if it&#x27;s good for keeping burns off hands from flat irons, it might work from mom.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> This glove is good for herstyler irons and the hotter flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for pressing the quilt pieces and seams, especially those tiny ones.  </li>
            <li> Oh, these are super cheap-looking too.</li>
            <li> Curling my hair goes so quickly now.</li>
            <li> Perhaps with more practice this glove will function better for me, but for now, I can only give it three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item came quick and is just as described.</li>
            <li> I had to buy another for my curling iron that only came with 3 fingers, non heat resistant and I burnt my fingers many, MANY times....</li>
            <li> Shipping was adequate and</li>
            <li> found it to be quite adequate for using my curling wand.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it will take me a while to get used to this, but I don&#x27;t think this glove provides adequate pretection from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While you can&#x27;t hold your hand against a hot tool for very long without feeling the heat, it is great for preventing quick accidental burns.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I have average size hands and it fits great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I do stick my iron inside when I&#x27;m done and even very hot</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and exactly as described!</li>
            <li> With the high temps of the modern hair irons, you&#x27;ve got to have one of these for your own safety.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use my new curling wand without it.</li>
            <li> It really keeps the heat off and is easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> I was hitting the same spot on my finger repeatedly and was working on a pretty good blister, so I went looking for a solution.</li>
            <li> Ordering was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> This glove is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m thinking of getting another one to use for my hot rollers!</li>
            <li> and I would not have been able to complete my hairstyle without it!</li>
            <li> I guess it is working pretty well for her!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> After losing it on a recent trip, I ordered this as a replacement--no more burned fingers!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to manage my hair while I use the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It would fit a large man&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> This is a great little item when working with the Curling wand that I bought.</li>
            <li> so my hair stays hot for a few seconds after flat ironing so being able to touch it immediately after is great!</li>
            <li> The special value of this glove is that it protects my wrists from getting singed by the hot iron.  </li>
            <li> It seems funny to order a special glove for curling your hair...</li>
            <li> I never had a curling iron that didn&#x27;t have a clasp before, so the whole idea of using this glove seemed totally bizarre t me.</li>
            <li> While these gloves still allow heat to penetrate to your fingers, they do fit well, and are very flexible.</li>
            <li> Comfortable glove that really protects against heat.</li>
            <li> For the cheap price, this glove works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also comes with a nice glove to handle your hot hair without burning your fingers, a very cute heat proof pouch made of red satin, and a tiny bottle of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> She had a Paul Mitchell, but says that this HSI is far better.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> she is even starting to do her own hair now that we have the glove to protect her hands.</li>
            <li> iron really is worth every dollar</li>
            <li> just enough to feel warm at times</li>
            <li> For the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> and that was a worth while investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> well worth</li>
            <li> It is really useful and does what it claims.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy, stylish and affordable - worth the money</li>
            <li> only thing I would do to improve it, would be to have it offered in sizes for a better fit.</li>
            <li> I guess this is more protection than none, because I couldn&#x27;t even hold my hand near it without it.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical with it being so cheap, but it was great!!</li>
            <li> Hopefully, in the future, more sizes can be available.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;d have better protection just wearing any old glove.  </li>
            <li> Nothing heat protective about it.doent worth 6.99$ .</li>
            <li> It helps contribute to the great styling the flat iron offers.  </li>
            <li> I was wanting to do something different to my hair other than just straightening or curling, this is the perfect tool to get the beach wave look.</li>
            <li> What I love most about them, is that they don&#x27;t leave my hair static-y when I use them like some of the other gloves I have used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I love this product is great when you use curling iron, hot rollers or flat iron, I have used it many times lately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to return these and use my own winter gloves to flat iron hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering some kind of grippy tape for my flat iron&#x27;s handle for that, but that isn&#x27;t a fault of the design of this product as that \\&quot;feature\\&quot; wouldn&#x27;t work on this side of things.  </li>
            <li> It seems the heat just goes right through it.</li>
            <li> So this was just right for me.</li>
            <li> Does its job right and to the point, just like this review</li>
            <li> I feel the heat right away.</li>
            <li> Not the right product for me.</li>
            <li> Best of all, even though the material is lightweight, it keeps me safe from unpleasant burns &amp; scorches.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if it were resistant enough to keep it from getting uncomfortably hot</li>
            <li> It fits well and offers me great protection while using the hot curling irons and flat irons.</li>
            <li> but I have to say it is very large.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this flat iron at a very reasonable price, as some of them cost well over $100.  </li>
            <li> Still better than bare hands</li>
            <li> Way Better than straightening hair with bare hands</li>
            <li> It does feels better than bare hands, but I can still feel the heat - hence the reason for 4 star</li>
            <li> and I cannot tolerate much more heat with it than I do with bare fingers.  </li>
            <li> Gave it 2 stars because it&#x27;s better than just using bare fingers.</li>
            <li> My hair does not slip any more than it does with my bare hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would be better is it was tight fitting.</li>
            <li> gloves fit my hands fine, with maybe a bit of extra room at the fingertips.</li>
            <li> They are great even when my thirteen year old uses the hot spiral curler on very long hair.</li>
            <li> Also fits great to hand other fit much bigger !</li>
            <li> after reading a whole bunch of reviews about how awesome this product was, and how fast it heated up (because who wants to stand around while their hair straightener warms up enough to actually fix your hair?)</li>
            <li> Great product for such a low price!</li>
            <li> It  works great and the only improvement I would make is to have them come in different sizes.</li>
            <li> I just received this item yesterday and only used it once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Ive had the glove now for a few months and use it daily and its held up perfect !</li>
            <li> This glove solves the problem, is reasonably priced, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I can feel some heat through the glove while lightly pressing the ends of my hair against the iron, but it is comfortable enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> what can I say,the glove was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> also want to note that I have no trouble handling my fine hair with the glove on.</li>
            <li> I have straightened my hair and also created big ringlets quickly and easily with this iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, I stumbled on the HSI glove used when curling irons are too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no difference between this glove and the kind you get from a store selling winter cotton/yarn  gloves.  </li>
            <li> It works the same as putting a sock on your hand and touching the iron.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first HSI product in the mall about 10 years ago, it lasted 6+ years.</li>
            <li> but when I really want to take my time, I put it on and it works just as described!</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no issues with feeling like my fingers were getting too warm or even close to burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I have used the glove many times since purchase &amp; have found that the extra finger length has not been a hindrance now that I am accustomed to working with it.  </li>
            <li> Heat glove as described, auick shipping - Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It gets as hot as the iron, so watch out...</li>
            <li> First of all I am not a beautician.  </li>
            <li> We crafters know just how hot our glue guns get,</li>
            <li> , if only there was heat resistant glove for my neck ... :)</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Even when she holds the hair on her wand, her hand never gets hot.</li>
            <li> I always have to try on 100 pairs of gloves to make sure that I don&#x27;t get that webbed finger look, but this glove was still too big.  </li>
            <li> I feel a bit of heat through the glove but it is not uncomfortable or burning.  </li>
            <li> also the price is very affordable!.</li>
            <li> Overall, i&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> thanks to this glove!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Tried three different gloves before this, none of them could handle heat better than this.</li>
            <li> This glove does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do keep my hand</li>
            <li> So big, I may not even be able to get any use out of it, whether it works or not.</li>
            <li> I admit to being a klutz around hot electric anythings.  </li>
            <li> I was working with because it was so hot.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li> (Get two ;-)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> how reasonably priced it was!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a bit more protection, but overall, the product functions as intended.  </li>
            <li> so I know exactly what temp to release my curl at.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> Does what it says, just doesn&#x27;t do exactly what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> I like the glove, but one came with my hot rollers so I did not need to buy it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The glove protected my fingers and allowed me to touch my hair while it was still hot.</li>
            <li> Pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, they do not perform well with higher temps.  </li>
            <li> I was going to return it, but paying for shipping really doesn&#x27;t make it worth it.</li>
            <li> I would only say that it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Even regular winter gloves worked better.  </li>
            <li> No more burns while making perfect spiral curls, this glove totally protects from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Your hand are not protected at all and are still burned by the hot rollers.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I will get a cover to put it on top once is turned on because it can burn the surface where you put it.</li>
            <li> Gives peace of mind that hot iron won&#x27;t  accidentally hit wrist.</li>
            <li> The one that came with my wand was felt, which I think works better, but it was only three fingers, and I can&#x27;t find any felt of sale.  </li>
            <li> The glove protects hands from heat while extracting  a turkey from a hot fryer.  </li>
            <li> Did not seem to work any better at resisting heat from my hot irons than a regular winter type glove.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for a product that was exactly as you advertised, and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I love the all over coverage the glove provides versus the type that only covers 3 fingers.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> My first glove was a bonus</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t actually work any better than a winter glove would.</li>
            <li> items like this that we don&#x27;t send back because it&#x27;d end up costing us more in time, effort, and shiping than we paid to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use this glove, since it was too big for my hand.</li>
            <li> This is the first heating glove I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I can grab my hair without burning and style it while its hot...</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to hold the hot end of the curling/flat iron.</li>
            <li> This curling wand does exactly what I wanted it to do</li>
            <li> Protected my hand from the heat pretty well.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how hot the curling wand I purchased for my granddaughter would get.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> On the InStyler, that is HOT.</li>
            <li> I only needed to be able to hold the ends of my hair while I curled it.  </li>
            <li> Could be more heat resistant but works well enough</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but keep in mind, I did not purposely test it by laying my finger on the hot metal.</li>
            <li> It makes using a wand curler so much easier !</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This glove works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> A heat resistant glove is pretty straight forward, right?</li>
            <li> I love this glove - I was always hitting a hot spot on my flat iron - and this glove prevents that.</li>
            <li> You will feel the heat  if you rest your fingers or hands for more than a moment on the hot flat iron or curling</li>
            <li> This glove is great, it is big enough to cover my hand and wrist so it doesn&#x27;t burn, and keeps me blister free while curling my short hair.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, it fits most hands well enough and certainly protects from the heat.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the fit, which they were a little more &#x27;heat resistant.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Turns out the little 3-finger glove that came with my wand, for free, is much more heat resistant.</li>
            <li> Before I had the glove, my fingers would be so red and very sore from touching her hot ironed hair while working on it...</li>
            <li> (obviously, don&#x27;t keep your hand on the hot piece for over 45 seconds consecutively, then you will feel the real heat), but hey 45 seconds is much more than 3 seconds before pain</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I ordered a 2nd one and now just wear both while I style my hair.  </li>
            <li> flat iron is truly amazing after I used it the first day I got it, with the included oil, my hair was soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a heat glove to use with my professional (that means super dang hot) heat tools.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too - thanks!</li>
            <li> I just knew I had to stop burning my fingers when using my hot rollers and straight iron.</li>
            <li> I really like this glove as my curling wand gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> You can feel the heat for sure, but no burning as long as you keep moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well for holding hot hair irons</li>
            <li> However, if your hands are bigger and you tend to burn yourself while using your curling or flat iron then they are a good idea.</li>
            <li> She was able to wrap her very long hair around the barrel of the iron without any burn or discomfort.</li>
            <li> The previous glove I had came with my curling iron, but I use these kind of gloves for any heat styling of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I found it easy enough to comb through my hair with the gloves on as well-</li>
            <li> The seller shipped it very quickly too; I received it on the same day as my Prime order!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s snug enough so that it&#x27;s easy to handle my hair.</li>
            <li> I found a lot of large bulky gloves that are used for industrial type work.  </li>
            <li> For a lady, I have large hands.  </li>
            <li> The glove did run large and she never said anything about it.</li>
            <li> The glove is not meant to hold on to the iron, but will certainly keep you from being burned if your fingers accidentally touch the iron.  </li>
            <li> way too large for my hands</li>
            <li> Runs large</li>
            <li> I have rather large hands for a woman, and my daughter can use the glove as well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks much for a product that makes doing what I have to do with all these hot tools much safer.</li>
            <li> This glove isn&#x27;t effective against any setting hot enough to actually curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the one I previously puchased so much</li>
            <li> My husband is a chef and sometimes needs to handle hot ramekins and other items that require more dexterity than an oven mitt/glove.  </li>
            <li> I used the curling iron for the first time and was particular not to burn my fingers.</li>
            <li> , it works so that is the main thing, I like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in COMPLETE agreement with the reviewer that stated something to the effect of, as soon as the glove starts to get too hot, your hair is done!  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m okay with that because it&#x27;s really hard to find glove sizes that fit my hand anyway</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, and was packaged</li>
            <li> I thought the whole purpose was to protect my fingers from the heat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to be concerned that the heat of the iron will cause me problems thanks to the gloves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She went on to say that thanks to the glove</li>
            <li> I can still comb my fingers through my very curly hair, while wearing these gloves.</li>
            <li> It really blocked the heat of the curling iron.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It makes styling my hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li> The item was as described and the shipment was very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you do not want to burn the counter or vanity that you are working to style your hair, this product works very well</li>
            <li> I really like this glove.  </li>
            <li> I can now freely manipulate the brush without the heat discomfort on the left hand.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable price</li>
            <li> Make curling my hair much easier now.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without it.</li>
            <li> The package included a heat resistant glove as well which made it so much easier to hold my hair while straightening it.</li>
            <li> Really helps preventing burning your hands.</li>
            <li> and it really does work.</li>
            <li> They must have been made for some beefy construction workers hands.</li>
            <li> very flimsy.</li>
            <li> This Glove does not block the heat, might as well have used a regular cheap glove from walmart.  </li>
            <li> i think that would be a selling point for anyone who wants to save time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do that...</li>
            <li> I highly suggest you purchase this one!</li>
            <li> I really had no idea what to look for in a heat resistant glove.</li>
            <li> I tried and really like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove to use with the curling iron and it protected my fingers from the heat very well.</li>
            <li> it really keeps the heat away from your fingers and makes the process of ironing your hair a lot safer</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve gone to Walmart and bought a cheap, regular pair of gloves instead of waiting for this one glove.</li>
            <li> The glove is much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see how these are any different from cheap mittens one can get at walmart?</li>
            <li> and this glove really helps.</li>
            <li> She uses it very often.</li>
            <li> One size doesn&#x27;t fit all - it&#x27;s way bigger for my hand and those extras keep getting in the way</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really even use it.  </li>
            <li> and it definitely helps to keep my hand burn free.</li>
            <li> Protects my hand very well.</li>
            <li> Too much for a glove.</li>
            <li> I really like this glove</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you worry about burning yourself while curling your hair!</li>
            <li> Really &amp;#34;takes the heat&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Makes curling my hair with a 400 degree iron much easier because I&#x27;m not as scared to burn my hand.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but ok</li>
            <li> and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> but it absolutely makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> These gloves are real hand savers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel heat really.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience using a curling iron</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried full-on holding the hot end of the wand with it, but for normal use it works well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the prompt service and delivery.</li>
            <li> Someone suggestion this glove and it works very well.....</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work because I curl my hair all the time</li>
            <li> This is really a must have when using straighteners.</li>
            <li> It makes using clipless irons much easier.</li>
            <li> Expected more.</li>
            <li> It arrived and makes using my curling rod (w/o a clip) much easier.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> My hand thanks me for getting this.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t knew what to think about it, I have never heard of it before, but I can say it works very well...</li>
            <li> and then you really start to burn.</li>
            <li> I really wished I had saved my receipt to return this.  </li>
            <li> All in all I really like these gloves</li>
            <li> This glove really works well with the clipless curling iron.  </li>
            <li> but I really think it would make sense to sell 2.  </li>
            <li> I love the results from the iron, but it used to take forever because I had to be so careful not to burn my fingers when wrapping and holding the hair around the barrel.  </li>
            <li> This glove works really well.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this glove to anyone who wants to protect themselves.</li>
            <li> But my wife absolutely loves it for doing her hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine trying to really use it.</li>
            <li> I do like my glove but wished I had listened to others and just went and bought a cheap pair of winter gloves as it is the same thing</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Really protects my hand when I&#x27;m using a clipless curling iron.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and efficient.  </li>
            <li> The iron I purchased does not have a clip to hold the hair in place, and this glove works really well.  </li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it works very well</li>
            <li> I bought this glove and it worked very well</li>
            <li> Obviously its not made to be able to hold an iron directly.</li>
            <li> However, with the glove on I was able to place my hand on the hair directly as it was curling and obviously felt a bit of heat</li>
            <li> Just exactly what we needed to go with our new curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these advertised with different curling irons and thought they would be handily when using my flat iron for curling my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, with coarse strands AND thinner strands, so I keep my iron pretty warm for the coarse parts.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and prevent burns from the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> And the quality is much better than the other glove I had before.</li>
            <li> especially if you are constantly using hot tools &#x3D;] would recommend to anyonee</li>
            <li> want to get a good glove to pretect my hand when using curing rod, see the good reviews and purchase this one, want to give it a try,  but the glove is way too small and thin, heat resistant?</li>
            <li> It was so frustrating and made it take so long to curl my hair that I just took it off and tried my best not to burn my hands.  </li>
            <li> and I normally wear large in women&#x27;s gloves and medium in men&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> What a great idea for us novices or folks who are not good with hair appliances!  </li>
            <li> This glove is no different, it doesnt have any special coating or lining</li>
            <li> Maybe a little loose, but works great.</li>
            <li> My hair falls out so quickly and I really hate using any hair spray so this works awesome for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The glove didn&#x27;t fit, finger length was too long</li>
            <li> This helps a bunch and it&#x27;s long enough to cover past your wrist, great buy!</li>
            <li> and my hands are kind of small, so</li>
            <li> Hey I am up for anything that saves my skin and finger that iron is hot also it it a professional  product</li>
            <li> in the past I have singed my fingertips before, no problems now with this handy glove.</li>
            <li> Does what I need, just use it in my left hand when I&#x27;m using the Instyller, I burned my hand so many times before because I am not very experienced using the Iron or the InsStyler, so now I can be confident I wont get burn.</li>
            <li> I like my new heat resistant glove!</li>
            <li> Since the highest setting is too hot for my fine hair, I only go up to the 2nd hottest setting (375 degrees).  </li>
            <li> In order to be one size fits all, the glove is a bit roomy, particularly in the length of the fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first glove of this type I&#x27;ve used, but it worked exactly as I expected, it fits fine and offers a balance of heat protection vs ability to feel through the glove.</li>
            <li> Static is created between hair and glove, so it&#x27;s much more difficult to manage the styling process.</li>
            <li> i can hold the styling brush longer without the blower heat burning my fingers for an extra 15 seconds , thats more than enough to do what i need to do.</li>
            <li> Super solid product.  </li>
            <li> if only my neck was so lucky...</li>
            <li> I use it mainly when I curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I love that these cover the whole hand and not just a few fingers.</li>
            <li> This glove is better than no glove, I guess, but I agree with those reviews that say that this glove seems no different from a simple, cotton glove.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have thick insulation, but it still offers good protection.</li>
            <li> I am right handed and could really use a glove for my left hand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this glove for quilters everywhere.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this glove.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> This heat resistant glove fits well and protects me from the high heat of the curling irons.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove to assist my jr. high age daughter curl her hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be thicker to keep the high heat away from your hand, but it is thinner than I thought.</li>
            <li> I am kind of new to using flat irons, lets just say I had to try quite a few to get the right one.</li>
            <li> One star off because it could be a little more heat resistant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more pricey</li>
            <li> However, we don&#x27;t even think about how we lose a lot more when we buy little &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Luckily I had my heat protection cover from a flat iron I have.</li>
            <li> Fit is as expected.</li>
            <li> It protects my fingers just as much as my crusty old winter wool gloves would.</li>
            <li> My mother in law got me an &amp;#34;ov-glove&amp;#34; to try and it completely blocks the heat, but is much bulkier than this glove.</li>
            <li> This one was huge and repeatedly got caught when I closed both my straightner and curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I normally buy a size 7.5 in gloves</li>
            <li> makes straightening my hair go by so much faster since I can actually handle the hot hair.</li>
            <li> But after about 4 months the protective coating does wear off and now it&#x27;s like a normal winter glove.</li>
            <li> It will also burn your fingers if the contact with the iron is more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I feel that this is normal.</li>
            <li> I was irritated but it didn&#x27;t seem worth sending back because it was inexpensive to begin with.</li>
            <li> But for the sake of preventing your hands from burning from the normal course of doing your hair, it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> the finger sections are a full inch too long on all of my fingers!  </li>
            <li> I can put the iron right up next to my fingers as I press the seams</li>
            <li> I put my hand right on the curling iron, which was at 400 degrees in tempature and felt only warmth.</li>
            <li> it was a little big, but i have small hand, still work perfect.</li>
            <li> She can curl her long hair using this flat iron which she cannot do as easily with the straight edge</li>
            <li> Other than the glove being HUGE, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My sewing/quilting group is always coming up with new ideas to use things new.</li>
            <li> so I searched and found the product and purchased a new one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove to work with my new curling wand.</li>
            <li> Since all of her friends comment on the new waves in her hair, she tells them about the curling wand and the glove she uses.</li>
            <li> So I went to Amazon to find a new one and ordered this product.</li>
            <li> Hoped this would help my daughter not burn herself with her new iron</li>
            <li> I would continue to burn my hand while using my new, heavier curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I would wear it while using my new hair straightener but haven&#x27;t needed it.  </li>
            <li> Bought the glove to go with a new curling iron.  </li>
            <li> It does not serve the purpose, my right thumb is feeling the pain of using my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, but you do not want to touch the Iron to much or too long, is better then the regular glove for Winter, I guess, but I never try to feel the different.</li>
            <li> There is a little light on top which is red when you first turn it on and which changes to green when the iron has heated up and is at the temperature you specified with the temperature control dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No problems so far!</li>
            <li> The glove definitely protected the hand from the hot iron.</li>
            <li> It is hot enough that it smooths my hair with one pass of the iron and it works when you twist it a bit to create and wave.  </li>
            <li> She used it on every female in the house the first day.</li>
            <li> The flat Iron holder works very well for keeping the iron off the counter while you are styling your hair, since the iron does get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I feel my hand is getting too hot when handling my hair next to the barrel.</li>
            <li> Plus, I hold my hair to the iron with this glove and when it finally gets hot on my hand, I know my hair is done.  </li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting a unique product only to open it and say &amp;</li>
            <li> So far, no burned fingers!  </li>
            <li> It is certainly not \\&quot;heat-resistant,\\&quot; which implies some sort of special material.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this flat iron on not only my hair</li>
            <li> This is all I need from now on for all sorts of styles and no more pain from touching the iron accidentally.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty happ with it.</li>
            <li> this has been the first glove that actually works for me while doing my hair!</li>
            <li> I use it to keep the hot hair off my daughter&#x27;s back when styling her hair.</li>
            <li> but you actually bet a whole pair for a Buck or two instead of one glove for $6.99!</li>
            <li> A heat resistant glove for flat irons should fit your hand snugly enough that you can use that hand to assist with your styling.  </li>
            <li> Useful for curling iron but fingers are made for a monkey.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute necessary product 2 use with ur new herstyler!</li>
            <li> The glove arrived quickly and is everything I expected.</li>
            <li> First time for me, of course not the same to feel your hair as with the bare hand, but it does what I need, preventing me from burning my hand again!!!</li>
            <li> Flat irons get hot</li>
            <li> I wish it was a tight fit to my hand, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My main critique is that there&#x27;s nothing apparently \\&quot;special\\&quot; about this glove to make it heat resistant.</li>
            <li> I tend to be clumsy and prefer to have my entire hand covered in the event that I lose my grip on the wand or inadvertently touch the wand with more than just 3 fingers!</li>
            <li> But this glove seemed to be extra large.</li>
            <li> It has certainly saved me several steamed fingers.  </li>
            <li> A must for certain curling irons, but it&#x27;s easier to use a regular curling iron and not have to deal with a the glove protection.</li>
            <li> I felt like a little kid wearing my parents cheap cotton gloves from the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because it was half of the original listing price</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve used an old cotton glove and saved money!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Quite frankly, there isn&#x27;t much of a difference between using this \\&quot;heat resistant\\&quot; glove and any generic glove that you may already have in your winter closet.</li>
            <li> Wrapping my short straight hair around a heated curling rod was burning the tips of my fingers, until I purchased this glove.</li>
            <li> this completely protected my hand from my curling wand</li>
            <li> What sold me was reading reviews from professional stylists who use this glove and like it.  </li>
            <li> Like all the others, it doesn&#x27;t completely keep the heat away, but I don&#x27;t burn myself.</li>
            <li> As clumsy as I am when it comes to using heated curling tools (as evidenced by the many burns on my hands/neck/etc.)</li>
            <li> This by far outshines them all in performance.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d known what it was like, I would have just dug up and old winter glove from my sock drawer.  </li>
            <li> They did not protect my fingers nearly as well.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t offer much protection overall.</li>
            <li> First the fingers are ridiculously long, like XL glove size.</li>
            <li> This is working well so far.  </li>
            <li> You will feel some heat through glove but use that as an indicator of when to complete your hold and release curl.  </li>
            <li> I chose to replace it with this one because it said professional.  </li>
            <li> If this is professional,  I&#x27;ll take a substandard freebie any day.</li>
            <li> Before I made that asumption, I tried it on both my husband and my adult son.  </li>
            <li> a considerable amount of the forearm.</li>
            <li> Its not for putting your hand directly on the heat tool, its for allowing you to get close without feeling the heat.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t block the heat completely, but you&#x27;re not going to be burned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also soft, lightweight, and stretchy, so it&#x27;s not cumbersome when styling.</li>
            <li> This is simple product that works really well.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came in at least two sizes, this and a smaller one.</li>
            <li> This wonderful glove has allowed me to once again curl my hair without burning the crap out  of myself.</li>
            <li> You can also pin each curl to your head so they can cool completely without gravity pulling them down.</li>
            <li> It is flexible so that I can easily handle the small</li>
            <li> I have had success using this with flat irons, curling irons especially.</li>
            <li> :) it doesn&#x27;t slide down, but its almost an inch too long on all my fingers, and my whole life I&#x27;ve been &#x27;joked&#x27; about my long piano finger hands.</li>
            <li> I use it with my curling iron and flat iron and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 y/o daughter, to use with her flat iron, and she said it works really well.</li>
            <li> She uses a flat iron and this glove makes that job so much easier.</li>
            <li> Its very helpful when working with curling and flat irons.</li>
            <li> I really like this glove, it is well made, and it helps to use when styling hair with rod curler or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I use my left hand to keep the brush steady when the hair is drying on the brush.  </li>
            <li> I use one in my sewing room when ironing, especially when I am sewing a quilt top or a small craft project.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it is way too big for my small hands, would have been better if it came in</li>
            <li> I just got my hair cut to shoulder length and have to learn how to curl the shorter hair particularly in the back.</li>
            <li> A third glove remains and I suspect it will have the same fate as the first two.</li>
            <li> As a former stylist, I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I have no other complaints besides the size!</li>
            <li> but i have small hands and it is HUGE.</li>
            <li> Makes it so much nicer to hold onto hair while flat ironing and not burning bare fingers.  </li>
            <li> so I usually alter/sew them to fit.</li>
            <li> I have small hands, and these fit even my hands rather well.</li>
            <li> They would easily fit anyone who wears a small or medium glove.</li>
            <li> I have normal sized hands for a female.</li>
            <li> I have fairly large hands and very long fingers for a woman</li>
            <li> So I see a lot of complaints about this glove not being resistant, calm down.</li>
            <li> Smooth shiny hairis the result with only a little effort.</li>
            <li> I bought this glove for my teen daughter to use with her new curling wand.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I purchased a heat resistant glove (different brand), but it was so bulky that I ended up getting rid of it as I could not move my fingers very well in coordinating with the curler.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a glove I had in the past, it has been just as good, if not better</li>
            <li> it made well, not to thick, but easy to use.</li>
            <li> This glove does all that, I even had my finger resting against a VERY hot curling iron for a few moments while I waited for my hair to curl</li>
            <li> I was getting burnt due to it getting so hot.  </li>
            <li> I tried them out the other day with my hot iron- when the iron hit my hand, I didn&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li> no regrets with this purchase!</li>
            <li> All very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone with long hair and steady hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to flat irons</li>
            <li> My daughter loves using her glove with her new flat iron.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a large barrel curling iron and realized it had no place to hold on while I curled my long hair.  </li>
            <li> Not for a prolonged hold, but great for insurance against bad accidental burns.</li>
            <li> Pick one up from a dollar general and save some money.</li>
            <li> No more heat resistant than a regular cheap cotton glove.  </li>
            <li> Now you have an extra if one is old or get lost.</li>
            <li> Feels just like a regular old cotton glove.  </li>
            <li> and I barely felt the heat at all..</li>
            <li> I have used it several times so far</li>
            <li> Since I can no longer feel the heat from my hair, I just need to be careful not to apply too much heat.  </li>
            <li> I can touch the curling iron and barely feel any heat from the iron.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my ten year old daughter to curl her hair.</li>
            <li> The glove works, but just barely.  </li>
            <li> I might as well put my bare hands on here, because it wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, protects from the heat and isn&#x27;t too thick to know what you&#x27;re doing with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who especially use the high heat flat irons</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made out of a knit, sweater type of fabric that renders the glove too big and bulky to work with, particularly the fingertips where the seams and extra cloth prohibit proper grip on your hair as you wrap it around the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> So, when I try to use a hot tool to fix my hair, I end up feeling clumsy and like I can&#x27;t get a decent hold on anything.  </li>

            <li> [[ASIN:B00563K6VO HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron.</li>
            <li> This glove is so thin and pointless, I would have had more success using an oven mit.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive hands due to medical issues and the gloves I purchased really help when I am using my flat iron.</li>
            <li> At least with a regular glove they stretch to fit your hands.</li>
            <li> I recently went on a trip and accidentally left my old glove at a hotel.</li>
            <li> She gave one to a friend who reached the same conclusion and took the same action.  </li>
            <li> Once I feel a little bit of heat through the glove, I know the hair is ready!</li>
            <li> She said the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove is thin enough to fit comfortably but thick enough to protect her hand and fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where the super dry climate makes hair really hard to manage.</li>

            <li> My hair stayed straight for 3 days instead of poofing up after only 1 with the other irons that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gloves are slightly too large but will work for curling hair.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t be bothered to return it - $13 down the drain.</li>
            <li> Some are made from a very scratchy plastic - somewhat like a dish washing scratch pad, and have thick wide seams that make it hard to feel effectively.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning it&#x27;s great and unlike the previous bad review it DOES protect your hand and is not your normal run of the mill winter glove.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not worried about starting a fire, I&#x27;m worried about comfort from major heat and possibly a burn.</li>
            <li> I like that the glove is long, it is not tight around my wrist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard as it is to use a curling wand with precision let alone some flimsy gloves that don&#x27;t fit - fingers too long.</li>
            <li> only gripe is that it is too big for my hand which makes it a little awkward, so having this in a smaller size would be ideal.</li>
            <li> My 18 year old younger but larger brother (much taller and bigger than me 6&#x27;2, football built big hands) tries it on and the finger part of glove are still to long for him!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The glove is a little large on my hands (and my hands are probably medium size), but I have gotten used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> think I have average-sized hands for a woman, but this glove was a little large.</li>
            <li> Just a very little warmth felt, but curling iron is EXTREMELY HOT &amp; w/out glove, would give &gt; 3rd degree burns (if a measure of &gt;3rd degree existed)!!  </li>
            <li> So, good for heat, bad for women&#x27;s size hand.</li>
            <li> The worse part is how huge it is.</li>
            <li> works well with the black high heat curling iron &amp;#34;Her Styler&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Needed something to wear to ward off occasionally burns due to clumsiness and unexpected steam spitting.</li>
            <li> Every heat resistent/proof glove that I found were bulky, thick and/or very large; made for men doing welding, BBQing, lighting firecrackers or whatever.  </li>
            <li> Only reason i&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is a bit large for my small hands.</li>
            <li> I am a quilter and had been searching a long time for a glove to protect my hand from the edge of a hot iron while ironing open the small seams of quilt pieces.</li>
            <li> I told several friends who then went an purchased a flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I feel it will run long and overall big for smaller hands.</li>
            <li> and there is no room for error when flat ironing the back pieces close to my neck.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these gloves with the specific intent of using them in conjunction with Keratin treatments, which require a 450 degree flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Second, it does nothing to protect my skin from the heat, even just holding my hair after flat ironing, might as well wear nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> My flat iron is a bit slippery in the grip if I have to transfer hands to adjust my hair before going back to styling.  </li>
            <li> Definitely helps when flat ironing/curling your hair.</li>
            <li> So someone with small hands might find it to be too large.</li>
            <li> also was large on my small hands.</li>
            <li> : a bit too large for my hand (I wear small</li>
            <li> Glove is a tad large for my small hand.</li>
            <li> The glove that came with my curling iron was huge on my hand, so uncomfortable and not long enough to protect the wrist.</li>
            <li> No matter how careful you are, all it takes is one slip to burn yourself due to the high heat.  </li>
            <li> I have about an extra half inch of fabric just flopping at the tips of my fingers when I have it on as far as it will go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loses feeling in her hands and kept getting blisters from hot food  from</li>
            <li> It is too big for my hand and fingers are way too long for anybody.</li>
            <li> and they are plenty long enough up the wrist.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have, well-made accessory for anyone using the flat iron technology.  </li>
            <li> Durable long lasting material.</li>
            <li> just with practice you will master the use of your flat iron.</li>
            <li> I was burning my hand when flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t hold your hand in the same place for too long or you feel the heat.</li>
            <li> I use it wit my flat iron , my curling iron and my spin brush.</li>
            <li> Have you ever straightened your hair and as soon as the flat iron plates run through your hair you grab it and then get burned?  </li>
            <li> I run the flat iron through my hair and then touch my hair, and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not even wearing a glove at all.</li>
            <li> Also, when I spray my hair before using the flat iron - my hand doesn&#x27;t get all yucky.  </li>
            <li> I even use it when using the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I always burn myself with my flat iron and curling wand</li>
            <li> It does protect your fingers from heat while using a curling or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the HSE glove along with a flat iron for my granddaughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> You will still feel the heat of the iron if you hold your curling rod long enough.  </li>
            <li> When using a curling iron or flat iron</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron and have never quite gotten the hang of ironing my hair without burning wrist and fingers.</li>
            <li> I set my flat iron heat at 450 degrees</li>
            <li> This glove lets through all the heat from the flat iron.</li>
            <li> would have given 4 stars but the seam opened in the web of one glove and I ended up with a burned thumb ... from my hair, not the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Makes  it easier to apply heat from flat iron to hair longer without burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m wrong and most of these heat gloves are cotton, but if that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;d advise you to dig out an old mate-less winter glove and save a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> This glove is also pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> This had good reviews and I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> No burned fingers while curling or flat ironing my hair!</li>
            <li> I can curl and flat iron without any worries!</li>
            <li> What I noticed is that some of the flat irons have plates that are very pronounced, the are really thick, especially the 1 inch plates on the Sedu</li>
            <li> I have already used it several times without a single burn specially&lt;</li>
            <li> I have owned several high-end flat irons and this one was less expensive and works better.  </li>
            <li> bulky and loose for smaller hands.</li>
            <li> I guess if I held the barrel of the iron for a long time I would find that the glove is merely &amp;#34;heat resistant&amp;#34; (as advertised) and not &amp;#34;heat proof&amp;#34;, but for my purposes it works just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bulky and made the job hard to do but it does protect your hand well.</li>
            <li> but beware if your brush has plastic handle , it will be hard to twirl brush as this glove on plastice is very slippery.</li>
            <li> The burns you get off the high temp irons isn&#x27;t just a superficial burn, it is 2nd degree at the least.  </li>
            <li> However it was so cheap ill just keep it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> Not completely heat resistant.</li>
            <li> and I have long fingers.</li>
            <li> so I knew I would be curling a long time.</li>
            <li> and I have long fingers to begin with</li>
            <li> WAAAAAAYYYY easier in the long run.</li>
            <li> It does have long fingers***but</li>
            <li> Who has fingers 6 inches long???</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t hold the heat for long.</li>
            <li> If you have long fingers, this glove is for you.</li>
            <li> As the description said you can&#x27;t hold it to the heat source for long</li>
            <li> Some gloves I&#x27;ve seen are too big and bulky, which makes it harder to separate hair into sections.</li>
            <li> I have long fingers and this product was still a bit long for me.</li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;piano player\\&quot; hands with long, tapered fingers.</li>
            <li> the fingers are too long.  </li>
            <li> Way too long.</li>
            <li> My curling wand came with one of those weird half-gloves that only covers your thumb and pointer finger, and I was looking for a full glove.</li>
            <li> the purpose of this glove is to hold your hair not to hold the iron or whichever tool you may be using, if you really want a heat resistant glove that is bulky and thick then get some welding gloves.</li>
            <li> The glove is thin enough to easily style your hair and thick enough to protect your hand.  </li>
            <li> I mean, what would a glove that could withstand 500 degrees for 10 minutes really look like?  </li>
            <li> I was excited when I finally received it and was quickly disappointed that this was literally just a normal glove.</li>
            <li> and I realized it was plain old cotton.  </li>
            <li> Other gloves I&#x27;ve gotten in Sally&#x27;s and other beauty supply stores don&#x27;t extend far enough down my arm and so there is a risk of getting burned.  </li>
            <li> The only downside that i saw in this was that to me it seemed a little bit big to use.</li>
            <li> I received the glove earlier than expected and am thinking about getting another one!</li>
            <li> This little glove makes a big difference since my short hair cut.</li>
            <li> I compared this glove with other heat resistant gloves and ultimately decided to put this one in my cart.</li>
            <li> the glove definitely protects from heat like advertised, would have been five stars but it is a little big on me</li>
            <li> You can still feel some of the heat, but not hot enough to burn you.  </li>
            <li> As others have stated, it is not completely heat proof, and it doesn&#x27;t claim to be!</li>
            <li> , I would be extremely upset at it&#x27;s total lack of usability.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s getting older and is a little less coordinated that she used to be.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly hair, and I use this daily.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair</li>
            <li> The extra length was an issue a couple of times in making it awkward to easily secure hair around the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> My old one looked small but it comfortably stretched.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps when using the curling wand but only for a few seconds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent as a heat resistant glove; at least it covers all five fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an average height female (5&#x27;6) and the fingers are very long.</li>
            <li> I have average size hands and regular finger length</li>
            <li> I bought this extremely affordable glove to keep from burning my hand while flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> This glove was too big for the average woman&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> It is sized for a woman&#x27;s hands, soft cotton feel and thin enough for control while pressing open seams or winding hair around a curing iron rod.  </li>
            <li> Still, the glove extends about 1/2 inch beyond the top of each finger, making it very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> which is give my hair loose, bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d offer this glove in a few different sizes, as my hands are smaller and this glove is a little big.  </li>
            <li> I should have bought two because I&#x27;m a bit clumsy learning how to use my new curling iron.</li>
            <li> Black and red</li>
            <li> I thought I could get the same results for a lot less money if I could just find a glove like that and use a cheaper curling wand.</li>
            <li> Previously I had one of the hand protectors that only covered your thumb and pointer finger which wouldn&#x27;t stay in place, so I was on the lookout for an inexpensive glove.  </li>
            <li> I would send it back, but it&#x27;s not worth what I would be refunded minus having to pay the shipping.  </li>
            <li> Black and red]]</li>
            <li> The only thing I would consider adjusting is making the fingers slightly shorter.</li>
            <li> Instead, I just pushed the small bit of extra length further onto my fingers.</li>
            <li> Black and red]]</li>
            <li> This is a super cheap, terrible glove.</li>
            <li> It is also a bit tight on my smaller than 7-inch wrist</li>
            <li> but, I still get burned every time I press down on my mini flat iron.  </li>
            <li> People who have a tendency to accidentally touch their hot curlers, flat or curling irons probably would benefit from this glove but it is useless for craft work that involves heat.</li>
            <li> I have used several flat irons in the past.  </li>
            <li> but I will look for something maybe a little thicker and stretchier to accommodate different hand sizes when I eventually replace this one.</li>
            <li> Glove is a little big</li>
            <li> Just a little bit slippery when trying to grab your short hair,</li>
            <li> It slips off and leaves little tips above the fingers so they are puffed out.</li>
            <li> I have only used the glove a few times</li>
            <li> You still have to be careful as it&#x27;s not a miracle glove</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> I can go faster because I don&#x27;t have to be so careful.</li>
            <li> I found this easier to use than the partial glove that I would often work off my hand and risk being burned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this glove does not really protect from the heat of the curling wand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and stretchy, fits either hand, and offers enough protection.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect heat proof, but I did expect something other than one of those 99cent winter gloves that are basically cotton and loosely woven.</li>
            <li> The little individual strands of my hair don&#x27;t get caught along the edge like it used to with other irons.</li>
            <li> Expensive doesnt always mean better product, I learned</li>
            <li> This little item is just the thing to avoid burning your fingers when you are using a curling or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin enough for her to grasp dishes and not drop them, and keeps heat off her hands just long enough to set it on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All of the fingers were extremely long and it was hard to keep it on my hand properly.</li>
            <li> I wish it came down my arm a little bit further.</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the pakage, I didn&#x27;t even register that it was a plain old cotton glove, even though there was at least a half dozen strings coming from various places and a couple snags.</li>
            <li> I have normal sized women&#x27;s hands and was shocked by how much fabric came over my fingertips.</li>
            <li> This is a one size fits all product, and the fingers are a little long for my hand.  </li>
            <li> The fingers were a little long for me, though I \\&quot;trimmed\\&quot; them with some needle and thread work.</li>
            <li> I bought this glove to protect my hand while using my new Conair hair wand, which I love, and it was awful.</li>
            <li> This is somewhat heat resistant but basically it&#x27;s just like any other glove.</li>
            <li> i should have taken the advice from the other reviews</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely curly and she is always wanting me to straighten it for her.  </li>
            <li> This glove is roomy so girls with small hands (it might be a bit big)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the quality wasn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li> After about a month or two of use though, it is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers state, it is heat resistant, not heat-proof.</li>
            <li> and that was extremely annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have small hands and the glove as is, is a bit big.</li>
            <li> No more red fingers!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever made. :-p</li>
            <li> DUE TO A STROKE, AND</li>
            <li> I also use it for pressing small items on different crafts I work on.  </li>
            <li> I simply used the glove while styling my hair as usual, and for once didn&#x27;t burn myself.</li>
            <li> Glove a little loose.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it&#x27;s not really a one-size-fits-all sort of glove.  </li>
            <li> I bought this glove for help with my mini flat iron as it is very little.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this glove at the hottest setting (400 degrees) if you have to hold a very thin section of hair against a hot iron for any length of time.</li>
            <li> It does seem a bit long for my shorter fingers, not sure if it comes in other sizes, but that would be helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big for my hand and makes everything harder to grip, the hair slides off and I turn into a clumsy mess.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to use any hot appliances on my hair without this glove now!  </li>
            <li> This keeps the little slip ups from becoming painful burns.  </li>
            <li> Having kids to manage leaves me with little time to fix my hair, and when I get to it I am often distracted by my little one which usually resulted in nasty burns by touching the hot iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does manage to keep my from burning myself, but with the extra fabric, it&#x27;s hard to manage my hair.</li>
            <li> A little big for my small hands.  </li>
            <li> I consider any flat iron that can tame hair living in Arizona to be superlative!</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> I have a curling rod which gets really hot resulting in several ugly burns on my hand.  </li>
            <li> REALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY.....</li>
            <li> This is not worth buying.  </li>
            <li> I am average size, and I wear medium latex gloves.</li>
            <li> and it is less than half the price of some of the other wands this size.</li>
            <li> It appear to have been designed for someone with very narrow wrists and extremely long fingers.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t let the curled hair fall after you pull it off the iron, hold it in your heat proof glove until it&#x27;s cooled down a bit.</li>
            <li> I got it for when I was doing a wedding updo on hair down to their butt</li>
            <li> and they cover down over your wrist</li>
            <li> I mean the heat comes instantly through.</li>
            <li> I seriously burned the inside of my left wrist with a curling wand</li>
            <li> This glove probably cost less than 1 dollar to generate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this glove for less than 3 months and there are holes in two of the fingers already.  </li>
            <li> i had about a half inch of room on each finger of overhang</li>
            <li> I used them for maybe half the time, and in all fairness I didn&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> Only heat resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than the three fingered glove my iron came with but not real impressed with this.</li>
            <li> It seems like a typical glove to me, except with a longer length to cover the wrists.</li>
            <li> Black and red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this with my T3 Sing Pass Whirl (a clip less wand)</li>
            <li> I like that they are black.</li>
            <li> Black and red]]&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I got this liking the wrist protection, and was disappointed to see that it was HUGE.</li>
            <li> I have a curling wand that came with a little half glove.</li>
            <li> I do not have short fingers, and my hands are average to thin in width.</li>
            <li> I had bought one of those curling irons that don&#x27;t have a clamp, for \\&quot;beachy curls\\&quot;, and it came with a little 3-finger protector.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what all the other reviewers are talking about.</li>
            <li> yes, but you can still feel the heat a little.</li>
            <li> The ends of the fingers were like little flaps that kept getting between my fingers and the hair.  </li>
            <li> I can feel a little heat</li>
            <li> Along came this little miracle glove and BINGO, problem solved.  </li>
            <li> Just add a little catnip,  rubberband it shut</li>
            <li> Seriously, you shouldn&#x27;t be holding your hair with that heat for long periods of time anyways.  </li>
            <li> If it were completely heat proof it would be very thick and hard to move your hand in.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs down!</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s a little thick, so it was hard to hold onto my hair, especially since the fingers of the glove were longer than my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for a curling iron that had a narrow tip.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I use mine on a relatively low heat because of my thin hair</li>
            <li> so a waste of $9.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I recommend burning yourself a few times but learning with out a glove.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing a clamp-less curling iron, I found the glove it came with to be too thin to protect my hand properly when styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Glove does not fit firmly..</li>
            <li> Product showed up within a few days, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not really important considering its purpose.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> After a few times, you get the hang of it and appreciate how you do not have to worry about burning the tips of your fingers.</li>
            <li> After burning my hand a few times while winding my hair around my curling wand, I saw this glove being advertised on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> i definitely had to try it after using an annoying straightener for much too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough to protect you from getting a burn, but not so thick that you can&#x27;t use your fingers to maneuver your hair.</li>
            <li> Ripped really quickly :(</li>
            <li> This glove is too thin to protect from direct heat and too thick to do anything with small pieces.  </li>
            <li> I actually got two of these gloves for myself because I am very bad with hot styling tools</li>
            <li> There is no special heat protection!  </li>
            <li> Too small did not fit Comfotably.</li>
            <li> If you have small petite hands it will not fit you.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and hard to manage hair that takes forever to straighten but, with this iron it only took me about an hour to do it.</li>
            <li> It looks and fits like knit stretchy winter gloves (you know the kind, they get soaked in bad weather and don&#x27;t protect you if it&#x27;s too cold out).</li>
            <li> I went looking for a heat resistant glove to keep from burning our fingers when pressing extremely small applique pieces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened to the product I purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> I am a quilter and iron a lot of small pieces of fabric and strips of fabric where my hand is close to the iron.  </li>
            <li> no more burnt fingers.</li>
            <li> The seams are small</li>
            <li> not sure, so I still use the glove come with curing rod, that one is thinker.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> But even once you&#x27;re past that bridge, it still seems to serve zero purpose.</li>
            <li> It may look like an ordinary glove, but it works.</li>
            <li> they are just an ordinary glove.</li>
            <li> No more burns.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is from Haiti and her hair is extremely difficult to curl with a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> no more burns on my thumbs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an ordinary knit glove.</li>
            <li> It does offer some protection from the heat from my iron but not a lot and probably not more than a set of mittens from the dollar store.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often use my curling iron, but when I do I usually end up burning myself.  </li>
            <li> well it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting :/</li>
            <li> and we now have no more burnt fingers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> but I have extremely small hands.</li>
            <li> No more burnt fingers.....</li>
            <li> No better than wearing a winter glove when trying to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> Sorry about the goof, we ordered both at the same time.</li>
            <li> No more burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> No more burns...</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to (grabbing your hair and holding it) but no more burns!  </li>
            <li> Not suitable for small womens hands</li>
            <li> I held my pointer finger on my flat iron for about 15 seconds before I felt the heat become uncomfortable-</li>
            <li> I have all this extra fabric at my fingertips which is a little awkward when trying to wrap my hair around the barrel.  </li>
            <li> Which didn&#x27;t do anything at all except twist around or fall off (also left the rest of my hand unprotected), and I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to handle the curling iron AND the stupid fingerglove at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say about this product is that it feels weird to wear a glove while doing my hair.</li>
            <li> people said beauty cost not true it is pleasure!!</li>
            <li> The fingers are too long, making it practically useless for me.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find a heat resistant glove.</li>
            <li> The fabric makes it hard to sense where you are holding your hair.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 year old daughter because she wanted a curling iron so bad, but was nervous about burning herself.  </li>
            <li> UPDATE in response to negative comments.</li>
            <li> oh wow, so ugly it doesn&#x27;t belongs on anyone&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> At least I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I can still feel quite a bit of heat but at least I&#x27;m not burning my fingers.  </li>
            <li> for the price thay couldnt at least give you a pair?</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t complained yet about burning her hands, so</li>
            <li> Also thin enough that it doesn&#x27;t make it too difficult to curl your hair while wearing the glove.</li>
            <li> would recommend if you&#x27;re clumsy like me and want to protect your hand from burns when curling.</li>
            <li> This glove is WAY to big and will never be used unless one hand happens to be chilly. &#x3D;|</li>
            <li> it was too late to return.</li>
            <li> I ordered late, thinking it would not arrive in time</li>
            <li> The problem is that with the thick glove I can&#x27;t feel where the tip of my hair is, so I keep dropping my hair and have to re-wind around the barrel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick that it limits you during use</li>
            <li> This sucks - This is NOT one size fits all if you have small hands!</li>
            <li> No more burnt fingers!</li>
            <li> No more burned fingers!</li>
            <li> No more burn scares!</li>
            <li> When I did my search on Amazon, I was skeptical purchasing this glove because of how inexpensive it is compared to other gloves.</li>
            <li> but since I got this glove, NO MORE BURNED FINGERS!  </li>
            <li> No more burnt fingertips from being too cavalier with my curling wand!  </li>
            <li> Burns and scars are not cute, protect your skin!</li>
            <li> No more burnt fingers!</li>
            <li> No more burnt body parts here!</li>
            <li> No more burnt fingers!</li>
            <li> No more burnt fingers!</li>
            <li> There should be different sizes, one size does not fit all in this case. :(</li>
            <li> but it was very small and wasn&#x27;t convenient.  </li>
            <li> I have a very small hand.  </li>
            <li> If you have short fingers though, they might be a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Using the Jose Eber irons puts you in a position of getting seriously burned.</li>
            <li> So ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> This glove is thin enough that you can tell what you&#x27;re doing with your hair, but thick enough to save you from a nasty burn!</li>
            <li> The heat gets a little concentrated and the heat can get uncomfortable on my hand.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel too bad about not using it since it was only $10, but still...</li>
            <li> Added on 10/23/2012 Please do not buy this, you will be sorry that your money is wasted.  </li>
            <li> The glove does not fair well with the heat from a straightner.  </li>
            <li> , it is not too thick, not too thin</li>
            <li> It would be hard to use it without this glove, as you may burn your hand!</li>
            <li> I feel so dumb sitting here with my very expensive single glove.  </li>
            <li> Must have for clumsy people!</li>
            <li> At least with this glove, all my fingers are protected!</li>
            <li> I hate burning my fingertips when I work on the back of my hair</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> got this glove confused with another glove (the charcol glove for BBQing).  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, particularly in the misleading product information.  </li>
            <li> I dont have anything bad to say about this glove, other than its a heat RESISTANT glove.</li>
            <li> Very awkward, and curling your hair takes twice as long because you keep dropping the hair.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not good for a product that&#x27;s supposed to keep you from getting burned!  </li>
            <li> and I have small-ish hands which makes handling the curling wand and hair quite clumsy, and potentially dangerous if you lose your grip.</li>
            <li> No more burning my fingers!!!</li>
            <li> This is a useless product.</li>
            <li> I use a steamer to get wrinkles out of my shirts and it had been difficult trying to keep from burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this glove</li>
            <li> I saw an expensive curling wand on a shopping channel that came with a glove like this.</li>
            <li> This is a useless product.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m tired of burning my fingertips!)</li>
            <li> I must have ordered the wrong product -</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> They were useless.</li>
            <li> The iron included some lame two-finger type of protection which promptly fell off and how I burned my thumb.  </li>
            <li> i cannot review how this protects against heat as i was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of using a \\&quot;gloved hand\\&quot; to hold hair against an iron and was skeptical of the idea.</li>
            <li> I think it was expensive for the pour quality ..</li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> Having never used one, I had to learn how to section my hair without my fingers as it is difficult to do with the glove on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this glove is not heat resistant.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for each hand, as I have a horrible habit of burning one hand on my hair and the other on the wand when I use my styling wand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible sized glove, and i have no idea what the previous reviews are talking about.</li>
            <li> and I am always afraid of getting burnt.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re afraid of getting burned, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase, what a waste!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
            <li> This glove does not work well - you can feel the heat through it and it makes it very difficult to style your hair with the glove on.</li>
            <li> I purchased a very expensive curler that came with a glove for styling.  </li>
            <li> This glove is bad.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> I burned my hand badly before buying the glove.  </li>
            <li> I have a shorter glove from another kit but always ended up with painful burns on the exposed areas.</li>
            <li> once u get it looks all ugly</li>
            <li> I was sincerely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is just a stupid glove - might as well buy garden gloves.</li>
            <li> - this is stupid.</li>
            <li> and it was so annoying using this</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> but hate getting my fingers burned.</li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to be without it when curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my wife and she said it was worthless, her hand got burned and she tossed it.  </li>
            <li> I always hated burning my hand while I was straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately I&#x27;m very disappointed in this.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This glove keeps me from getting those nasty burns!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it says 👎</li>
            <li> I recently purchased *HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron. I am not at all impressed with this product. It looks like a shower mitt and you can still easily get burned through it. It does nothing to protect your hand from the heat of styling products.</li>
            <li> Great product, just what I was looking for to use with my new curling iron which came with a two-fingered heat resistant glove, but I knew I&#x27;d be more comfortable with a full glove.  Fast shipping too - thanks!</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, and was packaged well however when I use my wand curlers I still feel the heat. I thought the whole purpose was to protect my fingers from the heat. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed I could of used my winter gloves. However it was so cheap ill just keep it.</li>
            <li> very nice, very worth having</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive hands due to medical issues and the gloves I purchased really help when I am using my flat iron. I don&#x27;t have to be concerned that the heat of the iron will cause me problems thanks to the gloves. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This is somewhat heat resistant but basically it&#x27;s just like any other glove.</li>
            <li> I purchased the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for my girlfriend and this is what she told me about the item when she used it the first time (with a huge smile on her face), and I quote \\&quot;this glove is great, it is not too thick, not too thin and it fits perfect!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She went on to say that thanks to the glove she no longer burns her fingers when she curls her hair and she can now do a better job on her hair because she does not have to worry about the heat from the curling wand.  She said the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove is thin enough to fit comfortably but thick enough to protect her hand and fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that when she did not have a Heat Resistant Glove she would do her hair and she would always struggle it seemed because she would always burn herself with the curling wand atleast once during the process... now I noticed that with the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove on she is way more happy and jipper doing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Girlfriend, Happy Boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This glove is very effective at resisting heat. I always used to burn the tips of my fingers when curling my hair (since using the clamp became passe). In order to be one size fits all, the glove is a bit roomy, particularly in the length of the fingers. I have fairly large hands and very long fingers for a woman and I still have a bit of room. So someone with small hands might find it to be too large. Otherwise, awesome product!</li>
            <li> The heat glove is great!  I bought it for my teenage daughter.  They are comfortable and prevent burns from the flat iron.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Item arrived earlier than expected.  It does not serve the purpose, my right thumb is feeling the pain of using my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove didn&#x27;t fit, finger length was too long but I still tried using it and it still didn&#x27;t make a big difference.</li>
            <li> This heat-resistant glove is fantastic! The material of this glove makes for easy styling, you can separate hair sections without static or catching. This product helps guard against burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove fit is great for me as I have longer fingers. I like that the glove is long, it is not tight around my wrist. I also like that the material is uniform over the entire glove.  I definitely recommend this glove for anyone using a curling wand.</li>
            <li> It felt like a glove I could buy at walmart or target.  Its also a bit cumbersome. Had to take off each time I shifted to flatiron another piece of hair.  I did feel it wick away heat, but i could still feel heat through it.  Didnt burn my fingers though</li>
            <li> I seriously burned the inside of my left wrist with a curling wand so I ordered this glove so it wouldn&#x27;t happen again.  I love it so much, I ordered a 2nd one and now just wear both while I style my hair.  It&#x27;s great and doesn&#x27;t make it harder to feel your hair like you might think it would.  I can still comb my fingers through my very curly hair, while wearing these gloves.</li>
            <li> My husband is a chef and sometimes needs to handle hot ramekins and other items that require more dexterity than an oven mitt/glove.  This heat resistant glove is perfect for the task! It also washes nicely. He would probably wear a size large in men&#x27;s gloves and has no problem fitting into this one-size-fits-all glove.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> My sewing/quilting group is always coming up with new ideas to use things new. We were working on an applique project. I am the one in the group that enjoys cruising the internet for things. I went looking for a heat resistant glove to keep from burning our fingers when pressing extremely small applique pieces. I found a lot of large bulky gloves that are used for industrial type work.  Then, I stumbled on the HSI glove used when curling irons are too hot to handle.  I bought one glove on amazon and took it to one of our Saturday Sews. It was a HUGE hit.  I ended up ordering more. The news started moving through the quilting community and now I hear that quilters around the tri-state area (Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana) are buying it for sewing projects. The nice thing is that there are a lot of quilters that also have new hair styles!  I highly recommend this glove for quilters everywhere.</li>
            <li> while you can still feel the heat, it&#x27;s better than not having a glove.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no difference between this glove and the kind you get from a store selling winter cotton/yarn  gloves.  To give it the benefit of the doubt I turned on my curling iron and put the glove on and touched the iron to see.  It works the same as putting a sock on your hand and touching the iron.  There is no special heat protection!  I felt a lot of heat come through.  The people shipping this must be laughing all the way to the bank.  They probably go to a local store buy gloves and then sell each one separately and slap on the tag.  I feel so dumb sitting here with my very expensive single glove.  OH well hopefully others will learn from my mistake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend buying two of these. It&#x27;s a lot easier to curl if both hands are protected.</li>
            <li> No burned fingers while curling or flat ironing my hair! Love this gloveâ˜ºï¸</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron. It heats up very quickly and straightens (or curls) the hair effectively leaving it smooth, shiny and soft. My hair is naturally wavy, dry and frizzy. I live in Arizona where the super dry climate makes hair really hard to manage. I consider any flat iron that can tame hair living in Arizona to be superlative! And this one does it. I have straightened my hair and also created big ringlets quickly and easily with this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron has a dial to regulate the temperature of the iron from 140 to 410 degrees F. There is a little light on top which is red when you first turn it on and which changes to green when the iron has heated up and is at the temperature you specified with the temperature control dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a nice glove to handle your hot hair without burning your fingers, a very cute heat proof pouch made of red satin, and a tiny bottle of Argan oil. All very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is a useless product. It is too big for my hand and fingers are way too long for anybody. It is not heat resistant either. I recommend to get well fitting, comfortable pair of glove from a store. Now you have an extra if one is old or get lost. Added on 10/23/2012 Please do not buy this, you will be sorry that your money is wasted.  You probably end up keeping in you junk pile; what a hassle is it to return an item! I paid the shipping cost to show them that there are some people would not buy into this kind of fraud. I paid about $10.00 then I thought it was a rip off. Now asking price is almost doubled! Believe me. This glove probably cost less than 1 dollar to generate it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have a clipless curling iron that didn&#x27;t come with one. I found this glove as being the most reasonably priced. When I received it, I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it! It fit perfectly and made my curling experience so much better because I didn&#x27;t burn my fingers. You can feel warmth through the glove, but that was it. It really blocked the heat of the curling iron. I recommend this product for anyone who has a clipless curling iron.</li>
            <li> I bought my first HSI product in the mall about 10 years ago, it lasted 6+ years. I was so please I told several friends who then went an purchased a flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I purchased another one from the mall and it broke with in 3 months the ceramic plates came off. I was then told about amazon so I searched and found the product and purchased a new one. That one broke again the ceramic plates came off about 6 months after I purchased it. This is my final try at the product. I&#x27;m not sure what happened to the product I purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it! She had a Paul Mitchell, but says that this HSI is far better. Product came just as described and is the best BANG for the BUCK that I could find anywhere!</li>
            <li> A heat resistant glove is pretty straight forward, right? You want to be able to wear it and grip your hair without burning your hand.  This glove does all that, I even had my finger resting against a VERY hot curling iron for a few moments while I waited for my hair to curl and I didn&#x27;t feel the heat at all.  So it definitely works well and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This glove has been a life saver to my fingers when curling my hair. I don&#x27;t use it every time I curl my hair but when I really want to take my time, I put it on and it works just as described!</li>
            <li> Love it use it with my chi hand dryer keep me from burning my hand while doing blowouts</li>
            <li> works perfect when curling hair</li>
            <li> Wish it fit perfectly but it won&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> I used it right away, and i works great! You can feel some heat through the glove, to be able to tell if your hair is burning or not, but it never got too hot! No problems so far!</li>
            <li> Surely a finger saver.</li>
            <li> great seller and items.</li>
            <li> Not a bad glove but I still had to wear another glove over it in order to not get burned.</li>
            <li> Too small did not fit Comfotably.</li>
            <li> The glove definitely protected the hand from the hot iron. It was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a simple glove it DID NOT keep my fingers from getting burnt only difference is i didn&#x27;t get a sore i should have taken the advice from the other reviews</li>
            <li> The glove definitely saves your fingers from being burned. However, you do feel the heat if you have your hand/fingers on the hotiron/curliron.  The glove definitely works though.  It allows you to style your hair without getting in the way too.</li>
            <li> Perfect - does what it says.  I needed a second heat-resistant glove because with just the one that came with my curling iron I found myself picking it up with the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; hand.  So now I wear two gloves - perfect curls and no burns.  I guess if I held the barrel of the iron for a long time I would find that the glove is merely &amp;#34;heat resistant&amp;#34; (as advertised) and not &amp;#34;heat proof&amp;#34;, but for my purposes it works just fine.</li>
            <li> The glove had threads coming out of it which caused holes in it so I asked for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know the HS curling iron came with a glove. I tried both gloves and HS&#x27;s was better (thicker).</li>
            <li> I bought this for a curling iron that had a narrow tip. I feel no heat at all when wearing this glove...works great!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have used.  It is hot enough that it smooths my hair with one pass of the iron and it works when you twist it a bit to create and wave.  I love this tool and would recommend it to anyone.  I have owned several high-end flat irons and this one was less expensive and works better.  The little individual strands of my hair don&#x27;t get caught along the edge like it used to with other irons.</li>
            <li> This is a neat glove.  It makes styling my hair so much easier.  It fit good and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Ok i am not in the hair business.  I am a quilter and iron a lot of small pieces of fabric and strips of fabric where my hand is close to the iron.  I was always getting burnt.  Not any more this glove is awsome.  no more burnt fingers. The glove also fits comfortably and does not make my hand sweat.</li>
            <li> I love this glove.  Makes it so much nicer to hold onto hair while flat ironing and not burning bare fingers.  Wish I would have know about this years ago.</li>
            <li> Works great -- keeps me from burning my hand while straightening/spiking hair. It&#x27;s the first glove of this type I&#x27;ve used, but it worked exactly as I expected, it fits fine and offers a balance of heat protection vs ability to feel through the glove.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my niece and she seems to be happy with it. I can&#x27;t say more than that for I am not the one using this product. But I did like  the price and the prompt arrival of the glove. I would by another if ever needed.</li>
            <li> Great product for curling iron that did not come with a glove! Is perfectly fitted and covers the wrist area, which will help protect my skin</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife after multiple burns from a curling wand and she absolutely loves it!  Exactly as described, shipped fast, excellent price, and great protection for her hands, thanks!!</li>
            <li> My grand daughter loves it. She&#x27;s 12. She used it on every female in the house the first day. It came on time and does what it says.</li>
            <li> Does the job in preventing hand burns when curling hair. Nice feel and light weight. It fitted nicely my daughter&#x27;s hand (tall 5&#x27;11 with proportionate hands). I feel it will run long and overall big for smaller hands. It would be nice if it came in at least two sizes, this and a smaller one.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  This glove is perfect for the curling iron wand I just bought.  It keeps my hands safe from the extremely hot temperature of the iron.  I always used to burn my hand on it, now I don&#x27;t have to worry!</li>
            <li> I am a quilter and had been searching a long time for a glove to protect my hand from the edge of a hot iron while ironing open the small seams of quilt pieces. Every heat resistent/proof glove that I found were bulky, thick and/or very large; made for men doing welding, BBQing, lighting firecrackers or whatever.  None worked for me.  Curling iron gloves sounded like a perfect thing but good ones have been hard to find.  Some are made from a very scratchy plastic - somewhat like a dish washing scratch pad, and have thick wide seams that make it hard to feel effectively.  I found some have only a couple fingers and are so short in length that they tend to slip up and off the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that I found the HSI Professional glove.  It is sized for a woman&#x27;s hands, soft cotton feel and thin enough for control while pressing open seams or winding hair around a curing iron rod.  The seams are small so they don&#x27;t bulk around the finger tip and they are plenty long enough up the wrist. And, oh yes, heat protection too!  I don&#x27;t feel the heat from the side of the iron or curling iron rod.  It is perfect for my clothes and curling ironing needs.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have, well-made accessory for anyone using the flat iron technology.  It helps contribute to the great styling the flat iron offers.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be thicker. Could have used one of my winter gloves to get same effect.</li>
            <li> Works great.  No more burnt fingers! I have average size hands and it fits great.  It&#x27;s heat resistant, not heat-proof, but it works great for use with a curling iron.  Also received in record time with great communications from the seller.</li>
            <li> The flat Iron holder works very well for keeping the iron off the counter while you are styling your hair, since the iron does get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and would buy again from this store.  The item was as described and the shipment was very quick.&lt;br /&gt;If you do not want to burn the counter or vanity that you are working to style your hair, this product works very well, that is why I am giving the holder five stars.</li>
            <li> Protects you from the heat..  Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove to work with my new curling wand. I&#x27;m so glad I did as I would have burned myself for sure after using this new tool. The glove is a little large on my hands (and my hands are probably medium size), but I have gotten used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I feel very safe using it. And the quality is much better than the other glove I had before.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves how it blends!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this glove.  I use it with my curling iron and flat iron and it works very well.  What I especially like it for, is when I use my brush blow dryer.  I use my left hand to keep the brush steady when the hair is drying on the brush.  The heat gets a little concentrated and the heat can get uncomfortable on my hand.  Using this brush has eliminated this problem. I can now freely manipulate the brush without the heat discomfort on the left hand.  I purchased 2 of the gloves, and I am glad I did.  I use one in my sewing room when ironing, especially when I am sewing a quilt top or a small craft project. No more burned fingers! I recommend this glove.</li>
            <li> This is going to be a great tool this summer. I was wanting to do something different to my hair other than just straightening or curling, this is the perfect tool to get the beach wave look. The only downside that i saw in this was that to me it seemed a little bit big to use. But after looking at Youtube videos and some online tips this really makes my hair look really nice. I like that it gave me waves and not that deep permed look.</li>
            <li> This is a super cheap, terrible glove. It&#x27;s Wal-mart quality, and does not resist heat AT ALL. I mean the heat comes instantly through. It&#x27;s not even knit well, as there are lots of open spaces between stitchings, so heat from the metal radiates immediately through. Do NOT buy this. I was sincerely disappointed in this product. I burnt my fingers twice before I just threw the product out. It is not worth the money at all. This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> Works really great. Already used it to curl my hair and I didnt have to worry about getting burned. I received the glove earlier than expected and am thinking about getting another one! Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I like my new heat resistant glove! I have a no-clamp curling iron, and this is a MUST for anyone who owns one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen the forefinger-and-thumb only \\&quot;gloves\\&quot;, and they look like blisters waiting to happen to my middle, ring, and pinkie fingers. With this glove, I wrapped the ends of my hair around the curling iron and held it there until it was beautifully curled and shiny. My hair is naturally curly, with coarse strands AND thinner strands, so I keep my iron pretty warm for the coarse parts. I have had absolutely no issues with feeling like my fingers were getting too warm or even close to burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this glove. Check around -- it&#x27;s a great price, too. You can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
            <li> I had bought one of those curling irons that don&#x27;t have a clamp, for \\&quot;beachy curls\\&quot;, and it came with a little 3-finger protector.  Which didn&#x27;t do anything at all except twist around or fall off (also left the rest of my hand unprotected), and I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to handle the curling iron AND the stupid fingerglove at the same time.  So the curling iron went into a drawer.  When I saw this glove, I thought \\&quot;oh well, give it a try\\&quot; -- and what do you know, it works great!  I don&#x27;t have to think about the glove, so I can focus on curling my hair, and it can take a lot of heat too (while I wait for the stubborn hair to curl).  A great bargain, too.</li>
            <li> The HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove works well, &amp; I am very happy with this purchase.  This is a one size fits all product, and the fingers are a little long for my hand.  The extra length was an issue a couple of times in making it awkward to easily secure hair around the curling iron.  However, I have used the glove many times since purchase &amp; have found that the extra finger length has not been a hindrance now that I am accustomed to working with it.  Several years ago I purchased a heat resistant glove (different brand), but it was so bulky that I ended up getting rid of it as I could not move my fingers very well in coordinating with the curler.  In contrast this HSI glove is made of a comfortable lightweight material that allows me to move my fingers freely when styling my hair.  Best of all, even though the material is lightweight, it keeps me safe from unpleasant burns &amp; scorches.  Very pleased with the glove.</li>
            <li> Needed something to wear to ward off occasionally burns due to clumsiness and unexpected steam spitting. These fit the bill!</li>
            <li> Worth every dollar! My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely curly and she is always wanting me to straighten it for her.  Before I had the glove, my fingers would be so red and very sore from touching her hot ironed hair while working on it... sometimes to the point of blistering the tips of my fingers.  We are both a lot happier... she is even starting to do her own hair now that we have the glove to protect her hands. This glove does not compromise your dexterity whatsoever... It&#x27;s just like working without one on.</li>
            <li> Heat glove as described, auick shipping - Thanks!</li>
            <li> The glove is great and really keeps me from burning my fingers when heat styling. I have only used the glove a few times but I have had perfect curls each time. Great product</li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 y/o daughter, to use with her flat iron, and she said it works really well. Good for me for peace of mind! I would recommend to anyone who especially use the high heat flat irons</li>
            <li> Must have for clumsy people! I can curl hair without burning my hand. Why didn&#x27;t I find this product years ago..?</li>
            <li> I have a curling rod which gets really hot resulting in several ugly burns on my hand.  This glove is the perfect remedy.  No burns since I started using it.  And it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy the way some gloves do.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Not completely heat resistant. Starts to burn your hand after about 15-20 seconds.</li>
            <li> Durable long lasting material. Perfect for handling all things hot! Great for hairdressers as it makes handling hot styling tools an ease!</li>
            <li> I dont have anything bad to say about this glove, other than its a heat RESISTANT glove. A lot of people say that when you wear the glove, you still get burnt. Obviously its not made to be able to hold an iron directly. You still feel warmth when wearing it. This saves me from so many burns! Glad I purchased it. I bought this with the Herstyler 3 piece set to find out that the set comes with the same glove &#x3D;P This glove is roomy so girls with small hands (it might be a bit big)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this glove for less than 3 months and there are holes in two of the fingers already.  I&#x27;m disappointed that the quality wasn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li> just with practice you will master the use of your flat iron. this item will help you to prevent burn yourself at the time of beauty. people said beauty cost not true it is pleasure!!</li>
            <li> Great fit! Nice quality! Perfect!</li>
            <li> These are great for making sure your hands aren&#x27;t burned! Warning, this only comes as one glove so you will have to order two if you want both hands covered.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price! Great service also!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and it did it&#x27;s job. Make curling my hair much easier now.</li>
            <li> Its a fraud... It gets as hot as the iron, so watch out... You can burn yourself</li>
            <li> Protects your hand as necessary.  If you begin to feel the heat when curling your hair then you know it&#x27;s definitely time to stop (at that point, you&#x27;re burning your hair)</li>
            <li> First of all I am not a beautician.  I bought HSI&#x27;s glove as I always burned myself when I curled my hair.  This glove is FANTASTIC!! I can now curl my hair with an iron that has a clip, or I can choose to use a tapered wand and hold it with my gloved hand.  I have burned myself so many times on my forehead or neck, and now I don&#x27;t worry about it. You can smooth your hair while it is being curled and with this glove you won&#x27;t get burned. I use it everyday and I really don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without it. It workd great on your bangs, when you want to get close to your skin. You just put your gloved hand either around the barrel or lay it on your forehead while you rest the curling iron on top of it.  I will never be without this glove again. Now, I also found another use for this great product. For those of you who do alot of crafts, this is a MUST HAVE.  We crafters know just how hot our glue guns get, our embossers etc. This glue works great for all the hot tools you use to craft with.  To state it easily &amp;#34;I will Never be without this Glove again.&amp;#34; A big thanks to HSI for a wonderful product..</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, and as such, I had her write this review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is truly amazing after I used it the first day I got it, with the included oil, my hair was soft and silky. I have never had my hair feel and look like that before. The package included a heat resistant glove as well which made it so much easier to hold my hair while straightening it. I have very thick and hard to manage hair that takes forever to straighten but, with this iron it only took me about an hour to do it. My hair stayed straight for 3 days instead of poofing up after only 1 with the other irons that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron really is worth every dollar and I am extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> want to get a good glove to pretect my hand when using curing rod, see the good reviews and purchase this one, want to give it a try,  but the glove is way too small and thin, heat resistant? not sure, so I still use the glove come with curing rod, that one is thinker.</li>
            <li> These gloves are too big for my hands but they are still much better than burning your hands! I can use these with my double barrel curling iron with enough ease to get the job done faster than without. I use mine on a relatively low heat because of my thin hair but I feel my hand is getting too hot when handling my hair next to the barrel. Still better than bare hands but I will look for something maybe a little thicker and stretchier to accommodate different hand sizes when I eventually replace this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent product just as displayed! Fast delivery!!! reliable &amp; I recommend!!! thank you! Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with the curling wand I was also purchasing and it works great! The curling wand gets super hot and with the glove I was able to touch the wand to help me curl my hair without getting burnt.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for small womens hands i had about a half inch of room on each finger of overhang however it protected my hands nonetheless.</li>
            <li> This little glove makes a big difference since my short hair cut. It helps me get the curling iron in the best position for a good curl, without burning my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if only there was heat resistant glove for my neck ... :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for if you need a gloove, just want one for all hair irons, or want a second glove!</li>
            <li> I am kind of new to using flat irons, lets just say I had to try quite a few to get the right one. What I noticed is that some of the flat irons have plates that are very pronounced, the are really thick, especially the 1 inch plates on the Sedu and I burned my hand alot when trying to flip my hair, this glove was the perfect remedy for use with my flat iron, now I can grip the iron closer to the plate area which gives me more comtrol and allows me to get my hair even straighter. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  I have a shorter glove from another kit but always ended up with painful burns on the exposed areas. You still have to be careful as it&#x27;s not a miracle glove but it does provide much better coverage and so far works great.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Glove is well made.  Fit is as expected.</li>
            <li> Very good item, could not curl my hair without these gloves. Big size fits all hands. Really helps preventing burning your hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this glove for help with my mini flat iron as it is very little.  I was getting burnt due to it getting so hot.  But at the same time the material feels to scratchy. I am assuming there is no way to make it fel better, but I just can not give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I use a steamer to get wrinkles out of my shirts and it had been difficult trying to keep from burning my fingers. With these gloves I can work quicker and better and not get any burns.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work to protect hands from curling wand at all.  Feels just like a regular old cotton glove.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> After seeing a guest on a quilting show use this glove, I decided to order one.  It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for pressing the quilt pieces and seams, especially those tiny ones.  I can put the iron right up next to my fingers as I press the seams and I can&#x27;t feel the heat of the iron.  I keep the glove on the legs of the ironing board so it is always handy.  Easy to slip on and off also.  Both my fingers and I are happy with this heat resistant glove!</li>
            <li> UPDATE in response to negative comments. Unless they changed the product from the time I bought it... it does work. It&#x27;s not heat proof, it&#x27;s just to help you avoid burning yourself. It won&#x27;t help you if you are holding your hand to a 400 degree iron for more than 3-4 seconds. Also, ALL OF THE GLOVES are the same material. I have 3 different ones and they are all the same, just different colors.  Original review: Not sure what all the other reviewers are talking about. I like this glove a lot. If it were completely heat proof it would be very thick and hard to move your hand in. Plus, I hold my hair to the iron with this glove and when it finally gets hot on my hand, I know my hair is done.  Then I do another trick which works great, don&#x27;t let the curled hair fall after you pull it off the iron, hold it in your heat proof glove until it&#x27;s cooled down a bit. You can also pin each curl to your head so they can cool completely without gravity pulling them down. You may not realize this but as it hangs and cools, it releases a lot of curl. My hair falls out so quickly and I really hate using any hair spray so this works awesome for me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I would highly recommend this.  It will keep your hands from getting burnt!</li>
            <li> It blocks the heat as stated!!</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting a unique product only to open it and say &amp;#34;that&#x27;s it? I could&#x27;ve used an old cotton glove and saved money!&amp;#34; Ha. oh well. I use the darn thing and my finger doesn&#x27;t get burned. It does get warm from the iron though. Save yourself the money and get $1 cotton gloves from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a glove.....nothing special about it. My winter gloves offer the same protection. Plus as everyone else said it is HUGE!  I normally buy a size 7.5 in gloves and I have long fingers. This thing flaps around on my hand. REALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY.....back it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to the dollar store and buy a pair of cheap winter gloves, you&#x27;ll get the same protection, a better fit and TWO gloves to boot!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this glove but i tried it out and it really does work. I would def be using it</li>
            <li> Meh, I don&#x27;t feel like this glove is anything special. I got it for when I was doing a wedding updo on hair down to their butt so I knew I would be curling a long time. This glove was more hassle than it was worth. I have average size hands and regular finger length and I was swimming in these. They must have been made for some beefy construction workers hands. I used them for maybe half the time, and in all fairness I didn&#x27;t get burned. If they fit your hand I could see liking them, but I just don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this flat iron at a very reasonable price, as some of them cost well over $100.  It works great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you use any type of hot iron on your hair and i wore mine ironing clothes yesterday because sometimes the steam heart will catch my fingers if I am ironing collars, cuffs, etc.  I am somewhat of a clutz when it comes to heated products and my hair, lots of neck burns, finger burns, etc.  You will love it[[ASIN:B00563K6VO HSI PROFESSIONAL Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron. Black and red</li>
            <li> Maybe a little loose, but works great.</li>
            <li> I saw an expensive curling wand on a shopping channel that came with a glove like this. I thought I could get the same results for a lot less money if I could just find a glove like that and use a cheaper curling wand. This glove fits the bill! And it&#x27;s ambidextrous, so I can curl either direction with either hand.</li>
            <li> I was burning my hand when flat ironing my hair. My friend suggested I get a heat glove, it works famously.</li>
            <li> oh wow, so ugly it doesn&#x27;t belongs on anyone&#x27;s hand. very flimsy. This product is made for men....or for a woman with a BIG HAND!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to return these and use my own winter gloves to flat iron hair. My fingers still burnt just as though I were wearing cheap and thin winter gloves. Oh, these are super cheap-looking too.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I love this product is great when you use curling iron, hot rollers or flat iron, I have used it many times lately and I just love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Ever since I purchased this product I have not burned myself once. Having kids to manage leaves me with little time to fix my hair, and when I get to it I am often distracted by my little one which usually resulted in nasty burns by touching the hot iron. This product has helped avoid those burns it is trully a great product!!</li>
            <li> This Glove does not block the heat, might as well have used a regular cheap glove from walmart.  Sewed on the mini 3 finger glove to the full glove and it works okay!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I love this glove ,now I don&#x27;t burn my fingers or my hand when I&lt;br /&gt;style my hair.No more burn scares! I do recommend it to everyone .</li>
            <li> after reading a whole bunch of reviews about how awesome this product was, and how fast it heated up (because who wants to stand around while their hair straightener warms up enough to actually fix your hair?) i definitely had to try it after using an annoying straightener for much too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it met my expectations (all the reviews i read about how it was great was were true) and i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  i LOVE that it really DOES heat up super quick.  i think that would be a selling point for anyone who wants to save time.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! Works great. My brother&#x27;s girl friend is a hair stylist and recommended it. Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I got these to prevent myself from burning my hand while hair drying my clients. While you can still feel some heat, it&#x27;s not the burn/hurt type of heat. The material might fool you into thinking that it&#x27;s just another winter kind of glove that you can get anywhere and that it won&#x27;t work. It does work and it&#x27;s sturdy. I have used it every day since I purchased it and it&#x27;s still intact. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a useless product. Quite frankly, there isn&#x27;t much of a difference between using this \\&quot;heat resistant\\&quot; glove and any generic glove that you may already have in your winter closet. At least I can&#x27;t tell the difference. In the beginning, it takes some getting used to using a glove while styling your hair. Static is created between hair and glove, so it&#x27;s much more difficult to manage the styling process. But even once you&#x27;re past that bridge, it still seems to serve zero purpose. I purchased it thinking that it would protect my fingers while using my curling iron. Guess what? It doesn&#x27;t really do that...(and yes, I know heat resistant is NOT heat-proof). My main critique is that there&#x27;s nothing apparently \\&quot;special\\&quot; about this glove to make it heat resistant. It protects my fingers just as much as my crusty old winter wool gloves would. As such, I don&#x27;t even use it anymore (as I said, it makes the styling process more difficult) and I consider it a loss. Definitely would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove to go with my curling iron I ordered.  It works great as you can hold on to your hair and touch the curling iron and not get burnt.  There was a glove that came with the curling iron, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as this one does.  I highly suggest you purchase this one!</li>
            <li> The glove fits very well and resists heat fairly well but after about 10 min of straightening hair it gets a bit hot. It would be nice if it were resistant enough to keep it from getting uncomfortably hot</li>
            <li> I tested this against my $2 walmart gloves because they felt remarkably similar and no difference!  i feel foolish for buying this, i guess i thought it would have some special material.  does it work?  yes, but you can still feel the heat a little.</li>
            <li> I like the glove but, I still get burned every time I press down on my mini flat iron.  It seems the heat just goes right through it.</li>
            <li> This glove does the job it was intended to.  Just wish it could be used on both hands. I am right handed and could really use a glove for my left hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this glove for my teen daughter to use with her new curling wand. She loves the glove because her wand heats up to 450 degrees. Even when she holds the hair on her wand, her hand never gets hot. Since all of her friends comment on the new waves in her hair, she tells them about the curling wand and the glove she uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product purchased for my daughters for Christmas and will be put to great use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> only one glove came in the mail instead of a pair of gloves</li>
            <li> This glove is exactly what I wanted! When I did my search on Amazon, I was skeptical purchasing this glove because of how inexpensive it is compared to other gloves. I really had no idea what to look for in a heat resistant glove. I never used one before. I just knew I had to stop burning my fingers when using my hot rollers and straight iron. I am very glad that I did decide to purchase this glove. It fits great and completely protects my fingers. Not bulky at all. It looks and fits like knit stretchy winter gloves (you know the kind, they get soaked in bad weather and don&#x27;t protect you if it&#x27;s too cold out). The only negative thing I can say about this product is that it feels weird to wear a glove while doing my hair. So I just need to get use to it. Great product for such a low price!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed after a massive burn on my wrist!</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of people talking about this glove. I tried and really like it. No more burning my fingers!!!</li>
            <li> It may look like an ordinary glove, but it works. Just don&#x27;t hold your hand in the same place for too long or you feel the heat. I use it wit my flat iron , my curling iron and my spin brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my tapered curling iron.  Previously I had one of the hand protectors that only covered your thumb and pointer finger which wouldn&#x27;t stay in place, so I was on the lookout for an inexpensive glove.  For a lady, I have large hands.  I always have to try on 100 pairs of gloves to make sure that I don&#x27;t get that webbed finger look, but this glove was still too big.  The ends of the fingers were like little flaps that kept getting between my fingers and the hair.  It was so frustrating and made it take so long to curl my hair that I just took it off and tried my best not to burn my hands.  It worked better that way.</li>
            <li> Have you ever straightened your hair and as soon as the flat iron plates run through your hair you grab it and then get burned?  It has happened to me more times than I can count.  That is why I am so happy to have the HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove.  I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often because I am in love with my bouncy curls but every once in a while I like a change.  This glove is great because it provides the protection I need to straighten my hair without burning my hands while I do it.  The glove is a bit big for my hand but it&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to manage my hair while I use the flat iron.  It is heat resistant, not heat proof.  I feel a bit of heat through the glove but it is not uncomfortable or burning.  This glove have made styling my hair more manageable.  It is a good addition use with any heat styling tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products. I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent gloves resistant the heat. So, i bought two from it. I am strongly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Perfect for protecting fingers while curling hair. Personally, I have short hair and use a curling brush. Wrapping my short straight hair around a heated curling rod was burning the tips of my fingers, until I purchased this glove. Provides great protection.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this item.  Every woman should have it at home as a tool for her beauty. also the price is very affordable!.</li>
            <li> This is a cheaply made material for this purpose, unravelled within a couple of uses.  And not even a pair, just one... so a waste of $9.  Am now using a regular pair of gloves and it&#x27;s still in-tact.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with my her styler wand and I used it maybe once. It&#x27;s very bulky and made the job hard to do but it does protect your hand well. Would be better is it was tight fitting.</li>
            <li> Totally saves my hands</li>
            <li> Item As described good fit</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove to use with the curling iron and it protected my fingers from the heat very well. I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> One of these gloves came with my HSI Flat Iron and at first it worked great. After about a month or two of use though, it is pretty much useless. I run the flat iron through my hair and then touch my hair, and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not even wearing a glove at all. My fingers feel the heat immediately and it burns. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay money for this glove.</li>
            <li> works perfectly. Super easy to use, and you won&#x27;t feel the heat. Its not too big and its a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my curling iron, but started using it for everything else (i&#x27;m tired of burning my fingertips!) It holds up well with my straightening iron (450 degree max) and i&#x27;m thinking of getting another one to use for my hot rollers! Overall, i&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> it really keeps the heat away from your fingers and makes the process of ironing your hair a lot safer</li>
            <li> Love love.  Perfect while  I&#x27;m using my hot rollers.  I use them every time.  Don&#x27;t know what I would do without these.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Saves my burnt fingers - HOORAY!</li>
            <li> this completely protected my hand from my curling wand and I barely felt the heat at all..just enough to feel warm at times</li>
            <li> This was too big for my hand and it was so annoying using this, I just took my risk of burning myself.  I couldn&#x27;t even curl my hair with this on because it&#x27;s so frumpy.  I wish it was a tight fit to my hand, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I must have ordered the wrong product - I was sure the description said \\&quot;heat resistant\\&quot;.  No more heat resistant than a regular cheap cotton glove.  I was very disappointed, particularly in the misleading product information.  I really can&#x27;t be bothered to return it - $13 down the drain.</li>
            <li> This item came on time and was just as described. It works great! I am used to burning my fingers when using an iron and now I no longer have to worry about this!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers state, it is heat resistant, not heat-proof. However, with the glove on I was able to place my hand on the hair directly as it was curling and obviously felt a bit of heat but without any of the pain. It&#x27;s good for holding the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> What a great idea for us novices or folks who are not good with hair appliances!  What sold me was reading reviews from professional stylists who use this glove and like it.  I took it into my salon and it got good comments from the stylists there.  So far, no burned fingers!  The seller was great, too, and this was a smooth transaction all the way.</li>
            <li> I love this glove - I was always hitting a hot spot on my flat iron - and this glove prevents that. Also, when I spray my hair before using the flat iron - my hand doesn&#x27;t get all yucky.  Saves my hand in two great ways!</li>
            <li> I recently went on a trip and accidentally left my old glove at a hotel. So I went to Amazon to find a new one and ordered this product. The product is great! I have used it several times so far and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I compared this glove with other heat resistant gloves and ultimately decided to put this one in my cart. Since it was an \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; item. It stayed there for a while until I reached the amount needed in my cart to ship. I was excited when I finally received it and was quickly disappointed that this was literally just a normal glove. I have used it and it does do the job but I was expecting it to be different. I wish I would&#x27;ve gone to Walmart and bought a cheap, regular pair of gloves instead of waiting for this one glove.</li>
            <li> This glove should be taken off the market!! It gets hitched in the comb everytime I tried to palm the comb to make a curl</li>
            <li> I know some of the reviews had this glove as not being protective enough.  However, to me it perfectly combined protection with ease of use.  I mean, what would a glove that could withstand 500 degrees for 10 minutes really look like?  I have one for my oven and no way could I use it to do my hair with!  I&#x27;m in COMPLETE agreement with the reviewer that stated something to the effect of, as soon as the glove starts to get too hot, your hair is done!  Seriously, you shouldn&#x27;t be holding your hair with that heat for long periods of time anyways.  So this was just right for me.</li>
            <li> This product is great for helping with  a curling iron.  I had one that was just fingertips and did not like it.  The glove is much easier to use.  The seller shipped the product quickly and it was a good price.</li>
            <li> the glove definitely protects from heat like advertised, would have been five stars but it is a little big on me and I have long fingers to begin with</li>
            <li> It does help in protecting my fingers from getting burn while using the Marcel curling iron on my clients. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I thought one of these gloves was going to absolutely necessary when I started using a wand curling iron but while it did it&#x27;s job and protected my fingers and hand, it also made my hair staticy and that was extremely annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I recommend burning yourself a few times but learning with out a glove. WAAAAAAYYYY easier in the long run.</li>
            <li> I work with flatirons 5 days a week and the heat resistant glove works great.  Keeps heat on the hair, not on my hands.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a curling wand for my hair. I was hoping this would help solve the problem of burning my fingers but this is a piece of junk. It&#x27;s just a regular glove (something you could purchase for $1). I see nothing special about it or even heat resistant! The worse part is how huge it is. It would fit a large man&#x27;s hands. The reason I got a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; glove was because the two finger thing that came with the curler was also too big. It&#x27;s not like I have huge hands. I have normal sized hands for a female. Lame.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item to replace the one that came with the curling wand and this one is FAR superior. I can&#x27;t even feel the heat when my iron is set at 400 degrees!</li>
            <li> Love this glove! It&#x27;s lightweight but durable. I hate burning my fingertips when I work on the back of my hair but since I got this glove, NO MORE BURNED FINGERS!  It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> One star off because it could be a little more heat resistant. It&#x27;s not an oveglove but it works pretty well. For the price it was worth it. I don&#x27;t think you would need two of them.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped with foundation.  The foundation was not sealed and got all over the glove.  After washing the glove I was able to use it without any issue.  I can still feel quite a bit of heat but at least I&#x27;m not burning my fingers.  Okay product.</li>
            <li> Great tool it really made the difference heat resistant. it was a little big, but i have small hand, still work perfect.</li>
            <li> The previous glove I had came with my curling iron, but I use these kind of gloves for any heat styling of my hair.  The special value of this glove is that it protects my wrists from getting singed by the hot iron.  Other gloves I&#x27;ve gotten in Sally&#x27;s and other beauty supply stores don&#x27;t extend far enough down my arm and so there is a risk of getting burned.  This glove is also pretty thick.  Of the ones I have tried I would definitly recommend this one.  It&#x27;s a little more pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This glove worked well to protect my hand from the heat of my curling iron. I even use it when using the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Does its job right and to the point, just like this review</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but I love it. The glove fits well and the unique fabric breathes!! .... so it&#x27;s very comfortable too. Great buying experience.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 stars because it was great quality. I loved that I could set my curling wand&#x27;s heat setting to the highest setting and I would not get burnt ! thanks to this glove! It was comfortable to wear and really useful.</li>
            <li> This glove does the job.  You can still feel some of the heat, but not hot enough to burn you.  Makes it easy to handle the curling wand without any problem.</li>
            <li> Using the Jose Eber irons puts you in a position of getting seriously burned. The iron comes w/one glove, but because i wrap w/both hands i purchased the 2nd glove for safety sake and that was a worth while investment.&lt;br /&gt;i also bought a second glove for our Dear Daughter.</li>
            <li> I really like this glove as my curling wand gets really hot.  I actually put the three-finger glove that came with the iron underneath this glove and I can still feel the heat, but it&#x27;s tolerable.  At least with this glove, all my fingers are protected!</li>
            <li> loved this glove...its a must have !!! especially if you are constantly using hot tools &#x3D;] would recommend to anyonee</li>
            <li> Very good product it&#x27;s absolutely necessary</li>
            <li> This glove works great for protecting your hand from the heat of curling iron, flat iron, etc.  Especially great for younger girls just learning to use them on their hair!</li>
            <li> With the high temps of the modern hair irons, you&#x27;ve got to have one of these for your own safety.  The burns you get off the high temp irons isn&#x27;t just a superficial burn, it is 2nd degree at the least.  I do wish the gloves went up to the elbow since I am rather a klutz but it covers the wrist area totally.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the fit, which they were a little more &#x27;heat resistant.&#x27; I feel the heat right away. This had good reviews and I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> for the price thay couldnt at least give you a pair? lol i use it to blow drow my hair so in that  sense it does a so so job of keeping heat off fingers. i can hold the styling brush longer without the blower heat burning my fingers for an extra 15 seconds , thats more than enough to do what i need to do. but beware if your brush has plastic handle , it will be hard to twirl brush as this glove on plastice is very slippery. i would suggest putting some grip tape on your brush or getting a brush with a rubber handle not plastic. overpriced for what it is basically a glove</li>
            <li> This glove does help protect my fingers but I was still getting burnt.  My mother in law got me an &amp;#34;ov-glove&amp;#34; to try and it completely blocks the heat, but is much bulkier than this glove.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described. I can feel a little heat but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, definitely protects the skin. A must have for Want curling irons.</li>
            <li> Glove is a little big but it does the job.</li>
            <li> The greatest invention ever!</li>
            <li> Great product! Tried three different gloves before this, none of them could handle heat better than this. Expensive doesnt always mean better product, I learned that after wasting money twice.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my curling wand needs. A touch big on my hand but manageable.</li>
            <li> This glove does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It protected my hand from the heat of my curling iron.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see how these are any different from cheap mittens one can get at walmart? I could still feel the heat coming through. They were useless.</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...</li>
            <li> The is just a standard wool glove. Pick one up from a dollar general and save some money.</li>
            <li> makes straightening my hair go by so much faster since I can actually handle the hot hair. It&#x27;s also great for my styling wand. I like to use 450 degrees for both and this glove really helps.</li>
            <li> This is basically just a cheap cotton glove. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works fine to protect your hand from being burned.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the curling wands!! Love this so much!</li>
            <li> Not the right product for me.Was still burning fingers and could not work with the glove on; will pass on another one.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do keep my hand burn free!!! Would totally recommend. Gave it as a gift with the herStyler wand and it was a hit.</li>
            <li> Have really enjoyed the glove! It does keep the heat away from hand. It came quickly also! have purchased two already, one for me and one for a friend!</li>
            <li> So big, I may not even be able to get any use out of it, whether it works or not.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all of my life! This wonderful glove has allowed me to once again curl my hair without burning the crap out  of myself. It  works great and the only improvement I would make is to have them come in different sizes. I have small hands and the glove as is, is a bit big.</li>
            <li> The tip on my favorite curling iron broke &amp; this is the perfect glove to use in the event I forget. It does have long fingers***but I just push them up and it&#x27;s just fine; better than burning my ffinger tips!</li>
            <li> I burned my hand using this supposedly heat resistant glove when using it with my curling iron. they are just an ordinary glove. Nothing heat resistant about them.</li>
            <li> the glove works great and it arrived very quickly, and as ordered. it definitely helps prevent burns when using the curling iron.</li>
            <li> Got this glove for the wife and she likes it. She uses it very often. It is well made and she recommends it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Works great</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t give a comprehensive review of this product. It was a gift for my daughter along with a styling wand. The glove did run large and she never said anything about it. Sorry I couldn&#x27;t be more helpful.</li>
            <li> bulky and loose for smaller hands.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a large barrel curling iron and realized it had no place to hold on while I curled my long hair.  Bought this glove and very happy!  Now I have no more burns, glove works great!</li>
            <li> You can still feel some heat through this glove; however, I had lots of hair to curl and I would not have been able to complete my hairstyle without it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife so she doesn&#x27;t burn her hands while she&#x27;s curling her hair.  She hasn&#x27;t complained yet about burning her hands, so I guess it is working pretty well for her!</li>
            <li> Works great. Good price.  Nice packaging.  Received it within a week of ordering.</li>
            <li> works great - no burns, even when learning to use the curling iron, this saved me!&lt;br /&gt;Received Quickly and exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> It does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I never had a curling iron that didn&#x27;t have a clasp before, so the whole idea of using this glove seemed totally bizarre t me. However, my new curling iron and this glove are super effective and easy to use. Recommend to anyone with long hair and steady hands.</li>
            <li> Great Glove, Does what it needs to do and prevents me from burning my fingers on my curling wand.  Only reason i&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is a bit large for my small hands.</li>
            <li> No more burns.  I admit to being a klutz around hot electric anythings.  The iron included some lame two-finger type of protection which promptly fell off and how I burned my thumb.  Figured I&#x27;d never use the curling iron.  Along came this little miracle glove and BINGO, problem solved.  Love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how anyone does there hair without this glove.  It works great and it does not seem to get in the way of me trying to style my hair.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Way Better than straightening hair with bare hands&lt;br /&gt;2. On time delivery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. One size doesn&#x27;t fit all - it&#x27;s way bigger for my hand and those extras keep getting in the way&lt;br /&gt;2. It does feels better than bare hands, but I can still feel the heat - hence the reason for 4 star</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed!  My hair holds onto heat so I often had to drop a section of hair I was working with because it was so hot.  The glove fits perfectly and is not bulky clumsy.  My only concern is that the glove may work too well!  Since I can no longer feel the heat from my hair, I just need to be careful not to apply too much heat.  However, I think that&#x27;s an issue I can work out in time.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It really works. I always burn myself with my flat iron and curling wand and this works wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! I like that I can now curl my hair without burning my hand or wrist!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t protect from heat well enough. I could not hold the curling iron for more than 1-2 seconds. I had another one which was more resistant to heat.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is just as promised. The fit was perfect. I used it for work and its performance was great</li>
            <li> Only heat resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than the three fingered glove my iron came with but not real impressed with this. Meh.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t mastered the curling iron with no clamp, the glove is phenomenal!  One came with the iron but it was very small and wasn&#x27;t convenient.  This one works great!</li>
            <li> A good glove for curling irons (just purchased one). It seems like a typical glove to me, except with a longer length to cover the wrists. Nevertheless, it works wonderfully to prevent burns from occurring. Very useful purchase!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big for my hand and makes everything harder to grip, the hair slides off and I turn into a clumsy mess.</li>
            <li> Hoped this would help my daughter not burn herself with her new iron</li>
            <li> Great value!  Fast Shipping!  Great Item!</li>
            <li> The glove works great for about 4 months but then whatever protects your hand from the heat wears off.  In the beginning it&#x27;s great and unlike the previous bad review it DOES protect your hand and is not your normal run of the mill winter glove.  But after about 4 months the protective coating does wear off and now it&#x27;s like a normal winter glove.</li>
            <li> This glove is too thin to protect from direct heat and too thick to do anything with small pieces.  It&#x27;s also too big for my hand and I normally wear large in women&#x27;s gloves and medium in men&#x27;s.  I used it with a rhinestone setter and I cannot tolerate much more heat with it than I do with bare fingers.  People who have a tendency to accidentally touch their hot curlers, flat or curling irons probably would benefit from this glove but it is useless for craft work that involves heat.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, that&#x27;s for sure.  I can&#x27;t really even use it.  The glove fits alright except for the finger sections are a full inch too long on all of my fingers!  So, when I try to use a hot tool to fix my hair, I end up feeling clumsy and like I can&#x27;t get a decent hold on anything.  That&#x27;s not good for a product that&#x27;s supposed to keep you from getting burned!  I would send it back, but it&#x27;s not worth what I would be refunded minus having to pay the shipping.  Ultimately I&#x27;m very disappointed in this.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if the fingers weren&#x27;t so long or perhaps came in two or three sizes: S M L.  Having said that, it fits most hands well enough and certainly protects from the heat. Terrific. (Get two ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered this along with my hot iron. I would burn my hand without it.</li>
            <li> Keeps hand from heat burns. Sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t protect you from heat. Fingers Still get pretty warm.</li>
            <li> This is a great styling tool. I recommend for use with a curling iron with no clamp. It will keep your hand safe.</li>
            <li> I bought this styling glove for use with a curling wand and it definitely helps to keep my hand burn free. Styling wands can be tricky to use without receiving burns on your hands and wrist, but this glove will keep your skin safe. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a glove I had in the past, it has been just as good, if not better</li>
            <li> This glove works great. I have a curling wand that came with a little half glove. I decided to look for a full glove to keep my ring finger and pinky from getting burned. This did the trick! It&#x27;s generous in size and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Well made, soft, smooth, great to use with hot air dryer &amp; brushes or curling iron. Great product!  Love it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find a heat resistant glove. This one works well, but I can feel some heat. But, overall it is great.</li>
            <li> works well with the black high heat curling iron &amp;#34;Her Styler&amp;#34;. No problem with curling hair. I felt this was easy to use and well worth it made well, not to thick, but easy to use. protects your hands and fingers , so you don&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li> .HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron. Black and red.&lt;br /&gt;Great product I&#x27;m enjoying the use of it.</li>
            <li> It does protect your fingers from heat while using a curling or flat iron.  However, it made it more difficult to hold my hair, probably because I am not used to it yet.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new glove.</li>
            <li> I got this liking the wrist protection, and was disappointed to see that it was HUGE. i think it was designed for a lumberjack. I have normal sized women&#x27;s hands and was shocked by how much fabric came over my fingertips. As you know you have to grab your hair with the gloved hand, and that wouldn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i cannot review how this protects against heat as i was unable to use it. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this glove.  I no longer burn my fingers!!!!</li>
            <li> Great glove - works just like described.</li>
            <li> The Glove works fine. It does protect your hands from burning. I used the curling iron for the first time and was particular not to burn my fingers. Glad that the glove served its purpose effectively. It&#x27;s a bit big for my fingers but still I am able to use the curling iron with ease.</li>
            <li> It is really useful and does what it claims. Fits comfortably.</li>
            <li> Protects my hand very well. I love it&#x27;s quality and how reasonably priced it was!</li>
            <li> I bought this glove to protect my hand while using my new Conair hair wand, which I love, and it was awful. It literally did not protect against the heat at all. If I accidentally touched it, it still burned me through the glove. Very disappointed with this purchase, what a waste! Don&#x27;t bother buying this product. Turns out the little 3-finger glove that came with my wand, for free, is much more heat resistant.</li>
            <li> Too much for a glove. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but when I do it will be better than fingertip burns.</li>
            <li> Good but not as heat resistant as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I really like this glove but i have small hands and it is HUGE. If you have small petite hands it will not fit you.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s one size only, it&#x27;s too big for my hands. But I&#x27;m okay with that because it&#x27;s really hard to find glove sizes that fit my hand anyway so I usually alter/sew them to fit.</li>
            <li> Does not protect well from heat. Tore after one use</li>
            <li> worked great with my keratin treatment for the 450 degree flat iron!</li>
            <li> Works well enough. Like all the others, it doesn&#x27;t completely keep the heat away, but I don&#x27;t burn myself.</li>
            <li> Super solid product.  The glove is not meant to hold on to the iron, but will certainly keep you from being burned if your fingers accidentally touch the iron.  I was hoping for a bit more protection, but overall, the product functions as intended.  It feels a lot like a regular inexpensive gloves people buy every winter for a couple bucks, I wonder if those would suffice as well.</li>
            <li> Who has fingers 6 inches long??? This glove is bad. It will also burn your fingers if the contact with the iron is more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This is a great glove! no, it won&#x27;t change your life, but it does work, and it works well. As others have stated, it is not completely heat proof, and it doesn&#x27;t claim to be! It&#x27;s called heat &amp;#34;resistant&amp;#34;, and it does just that. I have very thick, very curly hair, and I use this daily. It works great, and by the time the heat gets to my finger tips, I know to release my hair from the wand since it is thoroughly heated at this point. I then hold the curl in my gloved hand while it cools and it is perfect. The fact that the glove is not heat proof works as a built in timer for me so I know exactly what temp to release my curl at. Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great glove to use when straightening your hair !! Keeps hands cool and let you manage your hair</li>
            <li> I ordered the HSE glove along with a flat iron for my granddaughter for Christmas. I had never heard of using a \\&quot;gloved hand\\&quot; to hold hair against an iron and was skeptical of the idea. But it worked! She was able to wrap her very long hair around the barrel of the iron without any burn or discomfort. What a great idea!</li>
            <li> i bought this iron for myself and my daughter to use.  We love it. It&#x27;s a great iron.  Both of us love the size and shape.  My daughter has very long hair and she loves the rounded edge.  She can curl her long hair using this flat iron which she cannot do as easily with the straight edge irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received the item by the estimated date.  Well packaged.  The iron was in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product. I recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love this glove! No more burnt fingertips from being too cavalier with my curling wand!  Curling my hair goes so quickly now. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who uses a curling wand, iron or straightener.  This is a must-have for heat styling! Burns and scars are not cute, protect your skin!</li>
            <li> This glove works well.  You will still feel the heat of the iron if you hold your curling rod long enough.  I feel that this is normal.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with the product. 5 stars without a comment. iron is working just great and the glove perfectly resists from heat and burning fingers. also, I liked argan oil sample so much that ordered biggest bottle yesterday.</li>
            <li> As clumsy as I am when it comes to using heated curling tools (as evidenced by the many burns on my hands/neck/etc.) any device that makes curling my hair safer is a blessing. While these gloves still allow heat to penetrate to your fingers, they do fit well, and are very flexible. Perhaps I&#x27;ll try wearing two gloves on one hand next to see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I actually got two of these gloves for myself because I am very bad with hot styling tools and I figured I had better protect both hands. I tried them out the other day with my hot iron- when the iron hit my hand, I didn&#x27;t feel it. You will feel the heat  if you rest your fingers or hands for more than a moment on the hot flat iron or curling iron- I held my pointer finger on my flat iron for about 15 seconds before I felt the heat become uncomfortable- but it still didn&#x27;t feel painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves fit my hands fine, with maybe a bit of extra room at the fingertips. It also does protect your wrists, which is nice. I found it easy enough to comb through my hair with the gloves on as well- a feeling to get used to, but it doesn&#x27;t hinder you at all.</li>
            <li> The glove works great when curling my hair using a wand.  I can get close to the end without burning my finger.  Once I feel a little bit of heat through the glove, I know the hair is ready!</li>
            <li> No matter how careful you are or experienced you are, you can get a burn from a curling iron/rod! This glove is thin enough that you can tell what you&#x27;re doing with your hair, but thick enough to save you from a nasty burn! I highly recommend this product if you worry about burning yourself while curling your hair! There&#x27;s no reason to pay the price for beauty by burning yourself!</li>
            <li> Perfect glove, does exactly what it&#x27;s intended for. It keeps my hand from getting burned while using my wand. And I also use it to lay my curling wand on so the heat doesn&#x27;t get in contact with my dresser</li>
            <li> Really &amp;#34;takes the heat&amp;#34;. A must for all styling tools that don&#x27;t have a clamp</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and flexible. However, it doesn&#x27;t hold the heat for long. I liked it because even though it won&#x27;t hold the heat for long (it holds for about 6 to 10 seconds), it prevented me from burning my hand by accidentally touching the curling iron. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great. It&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
            <li> Makes curling my hair with a 400 degree iron much easier because I&#x27;m not as scared to burn my hand.  It doesn&#x27;t fit super snugly but it keeps me from burning myself, so it gets 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Love it! It works great for doing your hair with a HOT styling wand! Great product!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but ok</li>
            <li> This glove is great for curling your hair with a clipless curling wand. While you can&#x27;t hold your hand against a hot tool for very long without feeling the heat, it is great for preventing quick accidental burns. Also thin enough that it doesn&#x27;t make it too difficult to curl your hair while wearing the glove.</li>
            <li> Its a great glove... very durable and i can curl my hair without burning my fingers!!! if only my neck was so lucky...</li>
            <li> This is not worth buying.  I still feel the heat through the glove and burn my fingers.  I could have used a winter mitten or knit glove and it would be the same thing.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the HSI PROFESSIONAL Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron and it works really well.  It does not entirely block the heat from the curling wand but it absolutely makes a difference.  My daughter is from Haiti and her hair is extremely difficult to curl with a regular curling iron.  However, I have found that a curling wand does an excellent job.  The only problem, I have to hold the ends of her hair on the wand to keep them from being frizzy.  This product is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I can vouch for them and say that it actually works and I didn&#x27;t get burnt thank God.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy, stylish and affordable - worth the money and I save time when doing my hair now.</li>
            <li> These gloves are real hand savers. They are great even when my thirteen year old uses the hot spiral curler on very long hair. She wouldn&#x27;t be able to do her own hair without the protection of the heat glove. Great product and very reliable seller!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and it&#x27;s exactly what I ordered. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, protects from the heat and isn&#x27;t too thick to know what you&#x27;re doing with your fingers. Very happy.</li>
            <li> no more burns on my thumbs</li>
            <li> Bought as presents for my daughters - and they both love the glove and curling iron!</li>
            <li> This is a great glove.  Don&#x27;t feel heat really. Just a very little warmth felt, but curling iron is EXTREMELY HOT &amp; w/out glove, would give &gt; 3rd degree burns (if a measure of &gt;3rd degree existed)!!  Fits hand well &amp; I have a very small hand.  Shipped VERY fast!!!  Very good vendor.  Would purchase from vendor again in a heartbeat!  Had reason to contacted vendor about something unrelated to product &amp; got a timely response w/ an added perk.  Thank you for a pleasant surprise!!  :)</li>
            <li> The glove works great. I can touch the curling iron and barely feel any heat from the iron. This has been a great tool as I need to be hands on when curling my short hair.  Very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience using a curling iron so I ordered this glove after reading some reviews. I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> It does what it says, which is to keep your fingers from getting burnt.  Unfortunately, I was hoping to be able to get the ends of my hair wrapped all the way around my iron barrel without burning my fingers.  The problem is that with the thick glove I can&#x27;t feel where the tip of my hair is, so I keep dropping my hair and have to re-wind around the barrel.  Does what it says, just doesn&#x27;t do exactly what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> The heat resistance was just what I needed to do my keratin treatments at home without burning my fingers or melting combs. With this glove I was able to finish with No burns! What I don&#x27;t like is the size of the glove. I am average size, and I wear medium latex gloves. But this glove seemed to be extra large. All of the fingers were extremely long and it was hard to keep it on my hand properly. Because of this, I had to stop in the middle of straightening to tug and pull the glove back into place. So, good for heat, bad for women&#x27;s size hand.</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing a clamp-less curling iron, I found the glove it came with to be too thin to protect my hand properly when styling my hair.  I opted to purchase this glove because I hoped it would provide more protection from the heat.  It works better than the glove my iron came with but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being totally honest, I&#x27;m still new to using my clamp-less iron.  Perhaps with more practice this glove will function better for me, but for now, I can only give it three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a bright note, shipping was INCREDIBLY fast!</li>
            <li> I bought it to protect my hand whilst using a curling wand.  It does that just fine.  It&#x27;s thin and stretchy, fits either hand, and offers enough protection.  I haven&#x27;t tried full-on holding the hot end of the wand with it, but for normal use it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this extremely affordable glove to keep from burning my hand while flat ironing my hair. I&#x27;m an average height female (5&#x27;6) and the fingers are very long. I have about an extra half inch of fabric just flopping at the tips of my fingers when I have it on as far as it will go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does manage to keep my from burning myself, but with the extra fabric, it&#x27;s hard to manage my hair. If you have long fingers, this glove is for you.</li>
            <li> Other than the glove being HUGE, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. No more red fingers!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works well. Bought it for my ten year old daughter to curl her hair. No problems.</li>
            <li> The gloves are slightly too large but will work for curling hair. I thought they would be more heat resistant than they are but they will do. Thanks for the prompt service and delivery. Overall, I like this product.</li>
            <li> Item came quick and is just as described. Keeps me from burning my fingers and my hands while I use my stick curling iron.</li>
            <li> This glove I bought to try since I have never used one.  This is an awesome product. I have told a lot of people about this product. I don&#x27;t burn myself anymore which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this glove! It&#x27;s 100% heat resistant and fits my hand perfectly. The glove that came with my curling iron was huge on my hand, so uncomfortable and not long enough to protect the wrist. So I had to go on Amazon.com and order a separate glove. It was a great decision!</li>
            <li> I use this glove with the type of curling iron that has no clip, which necessitates holding the ends of the hair against the barrel. This glove protects my hand against the heat of a 425 degree iron. The glove is a one size fits all, similar in texture to a nylon, knitted shower glove, (but it can&#x27;t be nylon, could it?, or I guess it would melt, which it doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would do to improve it, would be to have it offered in sizes for a better fit.</li>
            <li> When using a curling iron or flat iron these are great for not getting burnt. You will agree and the price is perfect too.</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron and have never quite gotten the hang of ironing my hair without burning wrist and fingers. I use one on both hands. I can go faster because I don&#x27;t have to be so careful. Great invention.</li>
            <li> I like the glove, but one came with my hot rollers so I did not need to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is way too big for my small hands, would have been better if it came in different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;But, it works so that is the main thing, I like it!</li>
            <li> Great for styling hair without getting burned</li>
            <li> It does an ok job of protecting my hand from the heat, for the price, I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I would continue to burn my hand while using my new, heavier curling iron.  Someone suggestion this glove and it works very well.....have not burned my hand once since using it!  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> There is no difference between this glove and the knit gloves you can buy for $4 in any supermarket. It is certainly not \\&quot;heat-resistant,\\&quot; which implies some sort of special material. It&#x27;s just an ordinary knit glove. Those who are saying it&#x27;s \\&quot;100% heat resistant\\&quot; are out of their minds.</li>
            <li> The product was really great. I have already used it several times without a single burn specially&lt;br /&gt;when I use it with my travel straightener that is much smaller then the regular one.</li>
            <li> I have used several flat irons in the past.  This by far outshines them all in performance.  The glove is an essential part of its use and the instructions should be adhered to.  I really enjoy using this flat iron on not only my hair but on my lace wigs as well.  A truly great product for home use and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The glove was not as heat resistant as I thought it would be, but it still worked out. I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use my new curling wand without it.No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Although I prefer the glove that came with the Bed Head Iron I got. I purchased this as a back up. It&#x27;s a good size glove.</li>
            <li> I just received this item yesterday and only used it once, but so far so good. I recently cut my hair very short and there is no room for error when flat ironing the back pieces close to my neck. The glove protected my fingers and allowed me to touch my hair while it was still hot. I set my flat iron heat at 450 degrees so my hair stays hot for a few seconds after flat ironing so being able to touch it immediately after is great!</li>
            <li> This heat resistant glove fits well and protects me from the high heat of the curling irons.  It is easy to put on, light weight and it does not slip off when moving around with it.</li>
            <li> I use this to curl my hair and need the curling iron on the highest setting. I can only hold my hand to it for about 10 seconds before my hand starts burning through the glove. waste of money. also was large on my small hands.</li>
            <li> Works great! Protects me from burning my fingers when using my curling wand. You need to have one of these if you use heat to style your hair!</li>
            <li> My curling wand came with one of those weird half-gloves that only covers your thumb and pointer finger, and I was looking for a full glove. This works great! I can use my curling wand without worrying about burning myself. The seller shipped it very quickly too; I received it on the same day as my Prime order!</li>
            <li> Perfect accompaniment for wand curlers or extremley hot situations. Works almost well enough to be an oven mitt. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I defintley recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery! Great buying experience! The glove is just as advertised, and does the job for which it&#x27;s intended. Heat resistant and sturdy. Ok quality. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This glove is a fantastic addition when purchasing any hair iron! No more burnt fingers! I bought the Nano Titanium by BaByliss Pro and it works perfect together!!! This is all I need from now on for all sorts of styles and no more pain from touching the iron accidentally. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage cousin with a curling wand for Christmas and she said it&#x27;s perfect for when she curls her hair.</li>
            <li> This glove is not heat resistant.  If I&#x27;d known what it was like, I would have just dug up and old winter glove from my sock drawer.  This glove is just a regular glove.</li>
            <li> Hate it. Doesn&#x27;t work, burnt my hand multiple times with it on</li>
            <li> A must for every woman....nor  more burns using the curling iron.  Great Product!</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this glove I need to order another one as I use it a lot with my straighteners</li>
            <li> This glove lets through all the heat from the flat iron. Two thumbs down! Very disappointing. I really wanted this to work because I curl my hair all the time</li>
            <li> I bought this heat resistant glove to use with my curling wand as I am quite clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: provides full coverage to curling hand and heat protection (tested up to 330 degrees).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: a bit too large for my hand (I wear small gloves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend if you&#x27;re clumsy like me and want to protect your hand from burns when curling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these advertised with different curling irons and thought they would be handily when using my flat iron for curling my hair.  So far so good.  As the description said you can&#x27;t hold it to the heat source for long but it is great for those glancing burns.  If nothing else it helps me not to be as nervous, allowing me to make better curls.  Came very quickly and with no issues.</li>
            <li> I am a klutz when it comes on to curling my hair and I am always afraid of getting burnt.  This glove makes it easier to avoid those situations.  It may be tricky to maneuver but with practice you will get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Love this glove! It has saved my hand! It is much better than the finger gloves that came with my curling iron.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the glove.  I have used it while straightening my daughter&#x27;s hair and it worked well.  A quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought this glove so I would have extra protection while holding on to a 450 degree curling iron. No burn works great to protect between ears neck forehead. Two gloves now and they cover down over your wrist perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to flat irons so I have had several friends check it out. They all said it is a very good iron. It w hearts up instantly and works awesome. Smooth shiny hairis the result with only a little effort.</li>
            <li> Good quality &#x3D; happy mom and thrilled teenager!! I purchased this to go with the styling wand so she wouldn&#x27;t burn herself.</li>
            <li> The glove works, but just barely.  It&#x27;s made out of a knit, sweater type of fabric that renders the glove too big and bulky to work with, particularly the fingertips where the seams and extra cloth prohibit proper grip on your hair as you wrap it around the curling iron.  Very awkward, and curling your hair takes twice as long because you keep dropping the hair.  Also, there is not that much heat resistance as opposed to the better fitting neoprene gloves, which cost just about the same, are more maneuverable and grip the hair better.  Had this glove not been on sale and I had to pay the full price ($25.00), I would be extremely upset at it&#x27;s total lack of usability.  I would not recommend this glove to others.  As it is, I&#x27;ll just put up with it until I can invest in a Neoprene glove.</li>
            <li> This glove isn&#x27;t effective against any setting hot enough to actually curl my hair. Pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one two three four.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these gloves with the specific intent of using them in conjunction with Keratin treatments, which require a 450 degree flat iron.  I used the gloves a number of times with the iron set at 392 and 419.  They worked fairly well.  You can feel the heat for sure, but no burning as long as you keep moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they do not perform well with higher temps.  I did my Keratin treatment today and set the iron at 455. They did not protect my fingers nearly as well. However, I would not have been able to do the job at all without the gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given 4 stars but the seam opened in the web of one glove and I ended up with a burned thumb ... from my hair, not the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Does the job, works like its supposed to! Keeps my fingers from being burned while using the herstyler baby curls curling iron. I didn&#x27;t see the ppl at the mall who do the demonstrations using a glove but I definetly needed it and protects my hands.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I use it with my conair you curl (curling iron with no clamp), so obviously you need something to protect your hand. It&#x27;s thick enough to protect you from getting a burn, but not so thick that you can&#x27;t use your fingers to maneuver your hair. Great buy!</li>
            <li> The glove is big on my hand but definitely helps when I&#x27;m using my curling wand. No more burnt body parts here!</li>
            <li> This glove does not work well - you can feel the heat through it and it makes it very difficult to style your hair with the glove on. I was going to return it, but paying for shipping really doesn&#x27;t make it worth it.</li>
            <li> great glove.  it worked great. What a deal! i love it it is a good piece of hw and i would reccomend it any one else who would want one!</li>
            <li> I would only say that it&#x27;s ok.  It does offer some protection from the heat from my iron but not a lot and probably not more than a set of mittens from the dollar store.  If I&#x27;m holding my hand close to the iron, the heat coming from the iron is even enough to make it uncomfortable without even touching it.  I guess this is more protection than none, because I couldn&#x27;t even hold my hand near it without it.  I do stick my iron inside when I&#x27;m done and even very hot it doesn&#x27;t melt the glove or burn it, so it&#x27;s heat resistant like the description but it doesn&#x27;t offer much protection overall.</li>
            <li> I love this glove. I use this with my curling wand and never gave to worry about burning off my fingers!  Love!</li>
            <li> First the fingers are ridiculously long, like XL glove size. Second, it does nothing to protect my skin from the heat, even just holding my hair after flat ironing, might as well wear nothing at all.  Even regular winter gloves worked better.  Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> GREAT GLOVE!!! I had to buy another for my curling iron that only came with 3 fingers, non heat resistant and I burnt my fingers many, MANY times....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with it being so cheap, but it was great!! Burning your hands on curling irons is no joke.. This helps a bunch and it&#x27;s long enough to cover past your wrist, great buy!</li>
            <li> This is really a must have when using straighteners. I was surprised how easily I got used to not getting burned :)</li>
            <li> No more burns while making perfect spiral curls, this glove totally protects from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and use your spiral or conical curling iron, where you wrap the piece of hair around the barrel, WITHOUT THIS!</li>
            <li> It was okay, does the job. Nothing fancy but it was not supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Glove does not fit firmly..a snug fit would be better</li>
            <li> I should have bought two because I&#x27;m a bit clumsy learning how to use my new curling iron. Wearing the glove while curling your hair takes some getting used to. Overall I&#x27;m pretty happ with it.</li>
            <li> The glove was way too big. Our son in law even tried it in and it was too big for him. It needs to come in size choices.</li>
            <li> Your hand are not protected at all and are still burned by the hot rollers. Worst product ever made. :-p</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often use my curling iron, but when I do I usually end up burning myself.  (Probably because I don&#x27;t use it often.)  I ordered this after seeing a lot of women in youtube hair styling tutorials using one, so I decided this might do me good.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, but I&#x27;m kind of disappointed because it&#x27;s not much more heat resistant than a cheap drugstore glove.  It&#x27;s also one size and my hands are kind of small, so I have all this extra fabric at my fingertips which is a little awkward when trying to wrap my hair around the barrel.  At least with a regular glove they stretch to fit your hands.</li>
            <li> Product showed up within a few days, which is a plus.  Only complaint is that it&#x27;s not really a one-size-fits-all sort of glove.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with stubby fingers</li>
            <li> This heat glove has been the best thing I bought to use with my curling iron to protect my hands from being burned.  They fit my hand really good even though I have a smaller size hand.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it without these gloves again.  [[ASIN:B00563K6VO HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron. Black and red]]</li>
            <li> The glove arrived quickly and is everything I expected. I can do my hair without worrying that I will get hurt. I use it mainly when I curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with the goal of doing a hair style for a wedding that I was attending the following week. The product came on time. Since I never owned a curling iron I couldn&#x27;t wait and tried it at work with a piece of my hair. Then when I got home I did some more curls and I loved it. I have thin curly hair. I love the fact that I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was going to burn or anything like that. The product is so easy to work with and handle. The only thing is that I will get a cover to put it on top once is turned on because it can burn the surface where you put it. Luckily I had my heat protection cover from a flat iron I have.</li>
            <li> I have purched it for my waif and she like it nice producte</li>
            <li> I really like this glove much more than the one I bought when buying the curling iron. The glove itself is made well and has really good heat resistance, but to me the best feature is a bit of a longer cuff. Gives peace of mind that hot iron won&#x27;t  accidentally hit wrist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as a knitted glove can be.  The one that came with my wand was felt, which I think works better, but it was only three fingers, and I can&#x27;t find any felt of sale.  So, this is the best glove I can find!</li>
            <li> This is working well so far.  No issues.  Delivered on time as well.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit slippery when trying to grab your short hair, but I love the fact that I don&#x27;t get burned any longer!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will. Kept my hands from getting fried when styling my hair. would buy again</li>
            <li> A heat resistant glove came with my wand. Worked well but was getting a lot of pulls in it. Saw this one and thought I would give it a try. The weave is tighter and I think it is a better quality than the one that came with my wand. It works very well and I am so glad I ordered 2! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I might as well put my bare hands on here, because it wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference. This glove is so thin and pointless, I would have had more success using an oven mit. Also, it&#x27;s kind of huge, which is a problem when you&#x27;re trying to maneuver, because the fingers keep getting bunched up, which makes yur hair slip off the rod and you have to start over again.</li>
            <li> Love protecting ny pretty hands from burns. This glove worked out get.</li>
            <li> The fingers are too long, making it practically useless for me.</li>
            <li> This protects my hand well and fits great.  My flat iron is a bit slippery in the grip if I have to transfer hands to adjust my hair before going back to styling.  It would be nice if it weren&#x27;t so slippy for those transfers, but I don&#x27;t see a way around that since any kind of \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; coating would also cause it to catch on your hair.  I&#x27;m considering some kind of grippy tape for my flat iron&#x27;s handle for that, but that isn&#x27;t a fault of the design of this product as that \\&quot;feature\\&quot; wouldn&#x27;t work on this side of things.  I am very happy with this glove and haven&#x27;t felt any heat through it.  It does the job well!</li>
            <li> These heat gloves are wonderful.will order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this glove. It makes using clipless irons much easier. No more burnt fingers! The fit is good for me. It&#x27;s snug enough so that it&#x27;s easy to handle my hair. Some gloves I&#x27;ve seen are too big and bulky, which makes it harder to separate hair into sections.</li>
            <li> The glove protects hands from heat while extracting  a turkey from a hot fryer.  Fits well and does what it is suppose to do.  Shipping was adequate and cost of the glove was appropriate.</li>
            <li> I think it was expensive for the pour quality .. I can still feel the heat from the iron... In the picture it looks really nice n once u get it looks all ugly n bad well it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting :/</li>
            <li> It is a very good product and very easy to use. The waves you get are great they look like they were done in a saloon</li>
            <li> Did not seem to work any better at resisting heat from my hot irons than a regular winter type glove.  Was too big for my hand also.  Expected more.</li>
            <li> I love the interchangeable sizes and being able to adjust the temperature. it worked great on my hair and the curls lasted all day!</li>
            <li> My wife was constantly burning her hands when curling her or my daughters hair. Found this glove online and ordered it for her. She uses it everytime and loves how she can touch the iron and experience no burn.</li>
            <li> So I see a lot of complaints about this glove not being resistant, calm down. the purpose of this glove is to hold your hair not to hold the iron or whichever tool you may be using, if you really want a heat resistant glove that is bulky and thick then get some welding gloves.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a product that was exactly as you advertised, and arrived promptly. The glove works wonderfully well and we now have no more burnt fingers.</li>
            <li> This is not a heat-protective glove. It is just a glove, same as you could buy for about $2 at the big box store. It affords some protection against heat, as would any covering over your hand. I use butterfly clips for my hot-rollers. The clips keep getting stuck in the glove material. I am better off burning my fingers than hassling with this thing.</li>
            <li> Delivered by mail. Comfortable, a must with the curling iron. These gloves work great. Nice fit and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This glove was too big for the average woman&#x27;s hand. It slips off and leaves little tips above the fingers so they are puffed out. I don&#x27;t recommend this glove. I haven&#x27;t even used it once, it just sits in the drawer. I don&#x27;t feel too bad about not using it since it was only $10, but still...</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove based on the reviews being mostly positive and thought this would be effective using a wand… but i can&#x27;t believe that this glove fits any women&#x27;s hand. My 18 year old younger but larger brother (much taller and bigger than me 6&#x27;2, football built big hands) tries it on and the finger part of glove are still to long for him! My hand have about 1 1/2 inches of room on the finger tips when the glove is on which interferes with parting my hair. It&#x27;s a horrible sized glove, and i have no idea what the previous reviews are talking about. This glove is WAY to big and will never be used unless one hand happens to be chilly. &#x3D;|</li>
            <li> For anyone using the wand style curling irons, you obviously need protection to keep from burning your fingers. I love the all over coverage the glove provides versus the type that only covers 3 fingers. I tend to be clumsy and prefer to have my entire hand covered in the event that I lose my grip on the wand or inadvertently touch the wand with more than just 3 fingers! Would buy again... no regrets with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to make sure that I have gloves for both hands for using my curling wand. I am happy with the purchase and use of this item. I can now curl my hair without regards to the temperature of the curling wand or iron.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t even keep the heat off my hands. I don&#x27;t even use this product w/ my hair curler anymore! don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Fantastic customer service and great product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is a diabetic with arthritis.  She loses feeling in her hands and kept getting blisters from hot food  from the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;Pot holders were too bulky and she would drop things.  I saw this and thought if it&#x27;s good for keeping burns off hands from flat irons, it might work from mom.&lt;br /&gt;It works great!  It&#x27;s thin enough for her to grasp dishes and not drop them, and keeps heat off her hands just long enough to set it on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Item was as requested and works.  No problems with ordering and receiving process!</li>
            <li> I have had success using this with flat irons, curling irons especially. Love it. Makes life easier</li>
            <li> Does what I need, just use it in my left hand when I&#x27;m using the Instyller, I burned my hand so many times before because I am not very experienced using the Iron or the InsStyler, so now I can be confident I wont get burn. First time for me, of course not the same to feel your hair as with the bare hand, but it does what I need, preventing me from burning my hand again!!!</li>
            <li> Love the glove.  Makes  it easier to apply heat from flat iron to hair longer without burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!  USED THIS MORNING AND WORKS GREAT.  I HAVE A REDUCED SENSE OF FEELING IN MY LEFT HAND, DUE TO A STROKE, AND THIS ADDED PROTECTION MAKES ME FEEL SAFE.</li>
            <li> No problems with this glove! It arrived and makes using my curling rod (w/o a clip) much easier. I can curl my hair faster w/o worrying about burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> Heat still goes through</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! She uses a flat iron and this glove makes that job so much easier.</li>
            <li> havnt been able to get use to it i would have liked it if it was tighter</li>
            <li> This was a gist for my niece and she absolutely loves it.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Just what I needed! Fast delivery, great price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this glove to help someone get used to a heat appliances.  If a curling iron or straightener slips and hits the skin the glove definitely prevents burns.  It&#x27;s not heat resistant enough to not feel the heat through the glove if holding onto the curling iron, like I&#x27;ve seen some girls do when trying to heat a curl.  They wrap the hair around the curling iron and then squeeze the hair around the barrel to quicken the curling process. You will feel the heat through the glove if you do that, not terribly and not as much without it, but the glove is not 100% heat resistant.  I got this for my 12 year old daughter because she wanted a curling iron so bad, but was nervous about burning herself.  This definitely did the trick to build her confidence with the appliance.</li>
            <li> Bought this when I purchased a curling wand so that I wouldn&#x27;t burn my fingers off.  It works like a charm!  Good product!</li>
            <li> Great product, prevents little burns I&#x27;ve had with my curling iron; also amazingly fast and good service. Highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> Works great, especially when first learning to use a curling wand.  You will feel some heat through glove but use that as an indicator of when to complete your hold and release curl.  I found this easier to use than the partial glove that I would often work off my hand and risk being burned.</li>
            <li> I just got my hair cut to shoulder length and have to learn how to curl the shorter hair particularly in the back. Using this glove prevents me from burning not only the back of my neck but my hands as well in placing the shorter hair in my curling iron.  I knew of nothing else that would work such as this. As a matter of fact, I can use this glove when using an iron while pressing fabrics when I sew in creating quilts, fabric purses, etc.  The only thing I would consider adjusting is making the fingers slightly shorter. Instead, I just pushed the small bit of extra length further onto my fingers. Thanks much for a product that makes doing what I have to do with all these hot tools much safer.</li>
            <li> Keeping my hands safe!</li>
            <li> Works for my daughter. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the stylist I use for my photoshoots, but she&#x27;s so experienced she didn&#x27;t need it! However, I&#x27;m learning to use a Marcel iron and this comes in very handy...no burns yet!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and exactly as described! All I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Wow...Total hot mess. Pun intended!  My first glove was a bonus w\purchase item. I&#x27;m noting that because I had no idea regarding quality.  It worked fine for a good 8 months or more until I wore a couple small holes in it.  I chose to replace it with this one because it said professional.  What a joke? If this is professional,  I&#x27;ll take a substandard freebie any day. I&#x27;m not an expert but I&#x27;m thinking there has to be two qualities that are a must. 1) It should work, and 2) It should fit.  My old one looked small but it comfortably stretched. Before I made that asumption, I tried it on both my husband and my adult son.  It fit perfectly.  This one was huge and repeatedly got caught when I closed both my straightner and curling iron.  Also, it didn&#x27;t actually work any better than a winter glove would. There is a great reason for this, it is basically a winter glove. It looked, felt, and protected my hand like a knit cotton glove. When I took it out of the pakage, I didn&#x27;t even register that it was a plain old cotton glove, even though there was at least a half dozen strings coming from various places and a couple snags. I was irritated but it didn&#x27;t seem worth sending back because it was inexpensive to begin with. Then I used it and I realized it was plain old cotton.  Maybe it&#x27;s flame retardent like a child&#x27;s pjs (though I doubt it), but who cares. I&#x27;m not worried about starting a fire, I&#x27;m worried about comfort from major heat and possibly a burn. I actually dug out one of those one size fits all gloves, hanging at the checkouts at target and Walmart and Target. There was no difference in comfort from heat and the cheap checkout glove fit and didn&#x27;t get caught in my styling tools. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong and most of these heat gloves are cotton, but if that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;d advise you to dig out an old mate-less winter glove and save a few bucks.  I can&#x27;t wait to talk about this with my stylist.  Maybe you&#x27;re asking why I even wrote this lengthy review for a $7 product....Most of us Wil never be robbed by a guy in a mask holding a weapon.  However, we don&#x27;t even think about how we lose a lot more when we buy little &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34;  items like this that we don&#x27;t send back because it&#x27;d end up costing us more in time, effort, and shiping than we paid to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;I did find a use for this glove though.  Just add a little catnip,  rubberband it shut and your cat will play with it for hours.</li>
            <li> Has saved my fingers from countless burns. Lifesaver for sure!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use this glove, since it was too big for my hand. Hopefully, in the future, more sizes can be available.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She says it works well and keeps her from burning her fingers when styling her short hair.</li>
            <li> Glove a little loose.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Received promptly. My hand thanks me for getting this. Have been trying to make pincurls by flatiron ing them but fingers were getting burned. This does the trick.</li>
            <li> The gloves are perfect. They protect my fingers from heat styling tools and the heat that my hair still holds after I&#x27;ve passed the tool through my hair. I love that these cover the whole hand and not just a few fingers. I can still move my hands easily through my hair - no snags, no problems from the gloves. These are a great buy at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worked as described.</li>
            <li> way too large for my hands</li>
            <li> This is the first heating glove I&#x27;ve ever had. It works well. I&#x27;m a fairly petite woman, so the size of the glove is a bit big, but I understand why since it is a one size fits all. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great little item when working with the Curling wand that I bought. It would be hard to use it without this glove, as you may burn your hand!</li>
            <li> It seems funny to order a special glove for curling your hair...but it is so needed!  I burned my hand badly before buying the glove.  The glove is thin enough to easily style your hair and thick enough to protect your hand.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> I have bought this glove to prevent burns in my hands when im curling my hair... I really didn&#x27;t knew what to think about it, I have never heard of it before, but I can say it works very well... I can grab my hair without burning and style it while its hot... I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Does not work at all! Might as well wear a glove and try to protect your hands. I used this glove while curling and it burned my hands!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I love this glove. Protects my hand and arm from getting burned. My daughter and I both use it. Won&#x27;t ever curl my hair without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom. She&#x27;s getting older and is a little less coordinated that she used to be. She kept burning her fingers on her curling iron.  This keeps the little slip ups from becoming painful burns.  Don&#x27;t use this like a pot holder- I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to hold the hot end of the curling/flat iron.</li>
            <li> This glove does not work at all.  It is meant to protect your fingers from the heat of a curling iron and it does not.  At all.  I hope I can return it.</li>
            <li> this has been the first glove that actually works for me while doing my hair! I don&#x27;t get burnt! (obviously, don&#x27;t keep your hand on the hot piece for over 45 seconds consecutively, then you will feel the real heat), but hey 45 seconds is much more than 3 seconds before pain</li>
            <li> If you own any winter gloves that look like this use them.  This glove is no different, it doesnt have any special coating or lining it&#x27;s honestly no different then a winter glove but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps when using the curling wand but only for a few seconds and then you really start to burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times and it helps a lot from me scorching my fingers. I can still feel the warmth somewhat, but it&#x27;s nothing unbearable. Definitely helps when flat ironing/curling your hair. I do end up taking it off a lot so I can part my hair sections better.</li>
            <li> Good Glove fits me perfectly &amp; the color is as shown in the picture, most comfortable brand I wear (only one piece ), thank you seller.</li>
            <li> This is just a stupid glove - might as well buy garden gloves. I got a really great glove with a curling iron - I thought this would be like that  - this is stupid.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product.  It fits well and offers me great protection while using the hot curling irons and flat irons.</li>
            <li> This is a great heat resistant glove that does not get caught on my InStyler curler (which has teeth)/flat iron like some other heat resistant gloves have.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it should come in different sizes.  This glove is rather big on my hand.</li>
            <li> Glove is heat resistant and does the job.  We wish it was a bit smaller but that&#x27;s not really important considering its purpose.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find a glove that keeps you from burning your fingers. I curl and straighten my girls hair all the time but hate getting my fingers burned. This glove makes sure that doesn&#x27;t happen. It keeps the fingers cool. I might have to buy another for those times when I use both hands. (I don&#x27;t do that as often). I wish every hair heating appliance came with these, or that they were easier to find. Amazon.com, yet again you ROCK!! I only wish this product came in different sizes. I have long fingers and this product was still a bit long for me. I would have to say that is the only down-side I can think of.</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d offer this glove in a few different sizes, as my hands are smaller and this glove is a little big.  It does, however, work great with my spiral iron.  I am afraid to use any hot appliances on my hair without this glove now!  I have no other complaints besides the size!</li>
            <li> This curling wand does exactly what I wanted it to do which is give my hair loose, bouncy curls.  Easy to use,  although I bought a separate heat glove. Very pleased with this product and it is less than half the price of some of the other wands this size.</li>
            <li> I purchased a very expensive curler that came with a glove for styling.  This glove matches it&#x27;s comfort and ease of styling while wearing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for use with styling wand! Quick shipment and great price!</li>
            <li> Hey I am up for anything that saves my skin and finger that iron is hot also it it a professional  product so I needed that glove it is a big life saver I am a klutz what can I say,the glove was a very reasonable price. I would like to thank the person who invented it!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really wished I had saved my receipt to return this.  I can&#x27;t believe they say this is heat resistant.  It&#x27;s just a normal cheap glove!! It doesn&#x27;t repel heat at all.  So ridiculous.  I wish I had my honey back.</li>
            <li> Protected my hand from the heat pretty well. The fingers were a little long for me, though I \\&quot;trimmed\\&quot; them with some needle and thread work. After I got the hang of it (using a curling wand), I stopped using the glove, but for training purposes, it did the job.</li>
            <li> No more burnt fingers, so I&#x27;m really happy with the gloves, I used curling and flat iron work perfect on both</li>
            <li> As a former stylist, I highly reccomend this product. I got this curling that had no guard on it. so i was constantley burning my hands. I will by this product again. Thank you</li>
            <li> The item came well before the estimated time. Does exactly the job it is suppose to do, was new and in perfect condition as described on product description! Would order again!</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again, very similar to a regular knit mitten. Could not touch iron for more than 10 seconds before getting burned. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Runs large but I have extremely small hands.</li>
            <li> A great quality glove for the price.  Merchant ships timely and a pleasure to deal with. No more burnt fingers.....I&#x27;m a happy girl!!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this with my T3 Sing Pass Whirl (a clip less wand) I HAVE to have these gloves when I use it, otherwise I burn my hands. I&#x27;ve also found they are great to use with straightening irons as well. All in all I really like these gloves (actually, there is now way I can use my tools without them) and I like that they are black. They work great.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality glove. It&#x27;s not too thick that it limits you during use but it protects your hand wonderfully.  I found the price reasonable &amp; I loved the FREE shipping!</li>
            <li> Ripped really quickly :(</li>
            <li> The product is fine, unless you sit there holding onto the iron. But for the sake of preventing your hands from burning from the normal course of doing your hair, it serves its purpose. I bought it because it was half of the original listing price and I don&#x27;t think I would have bought it if it was not discounted.</li>
            <li> This glove really works well with the clipless curling iron.  Prevents burns to the fingers while holding the hair around the iron.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute necessary product 2 use with ur new herstyler! Your herstyler comes with one but its always good 2 have a backup!</li>
            <li> I like this product but I find that it gets in my way when I&#x27;m curling my hair. So, I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re afraid of getting burned, this is the way to go. Not for a prolonged hold, but great for insurance against bad accidental burns.</li>
            <li> This glove keeps me from getting those nasty burns!  I love it!</li>
            <li> bought this with my her styler and it works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I was expecting, and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great with the her styler curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love this Item I always burned my fingers wile styling my hair now I can curl and flat iron without any worries! Also fits great to hand other fit much bigger !</li>
            <li> This glove is great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It works very well for holding hot hair irons</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on this glove, some people seemed concerned that the glove may not resist heat enough.&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be quite adequate for using my curling wand. It protects not just my fingers, but also&lt;br /&gt;covers a considerable amount of the forearm. This was important to be as I&#x27;ve burned that area previously.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have thick insulation, but it still offers good protection. It does seem a bit long for my shorter fingers, not sure if it comes in other sizes, but that would be helpful. I use this glove every time I curl, and it keeps my skin safe from accidental burns.</li>
            <li> this allows me to get close to my wand without fear of getting burnt. Its not for putting your hand directly on the heat tool, its for allowing you to get close without feeling the heat.</li>
            <li> Glove is as described but I really think it would make sense to sell 2.  Flat irons get hot but so does your hair as you are styling it.</li>
            <li> The glove works better than the glove that came with my curling iron. The item arrived really quickly and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent as a heat resistant glove; at least it covers all five fingers. :) it doesn&#x27;t slide down, but its almost an inch too long on all my fingers, and my whole life I&#x27;ve been &#x27;joked&#x27; about my long piano finger hands. I do not have short fingers, and my hands are average to thin in width. I will have to sew off a significant piece of the finger length and cut it shorter. It got stuck in the hair because of the excess finger length, and I kept on sticking the bobby pins through the tips... Annoying. There should be different sizes, one size does not fit all in this case. :(</li>
            <li> I did not realize how hot the curling wand I purchased for my granddaughter would get.  So I purchased this heat resistant glove and was happy I did. It makes using the wand safer</li>
            <li> I ordered this glove because the one that came with my curling wand didn&#x27;t work well.  This glove is great, it is big enough to cover my hand and wrist so it doesn&#x27;t burn, and keeps me blister free while curling my short hair.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove to use with a clamp-less curling iron. I love the results from the iron, but it used to take forever because I had to be so careful not to burn my fingers when wrapping and holding the hair around the barrel.  This glove works really well. It doesn&#x27;t block the heat completely, but you&#x27;re not going to be burned. It&#x27;s also soft, lightweight, and stretchy, so it&#x27;s not cumbersome when styling. Great time saver for me!</li>
            <li> Perfect for use with a curling wand. You can feel the heat through it, but you won&#x27;t get burnt!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I returned this glove.  It is not usable.  No better than wearing a winter glove when trying to curl hair.  I searched for a video that shows how to use a glove for short hair but could find none.  So I returned it!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was going to be.  It helps some with protecting my fingers when I use my curling wand, but I am still looking for a better product.  It&#x27;s basically just a knit glove--don&#x27;t think there is any &amp;#34;thermal&amp;#34; quality to it that would help diffuse the heat.</li>
            <li> .....I wish I had. I didn&#x27;t expect heat proof, but I did expect something other than one of those 99cent winter gloves that are basically cotton and loosely woven. Fail.</li>
            <li> It does its job!  I&#x27;d hate to be without it when curling my hair.</li>
            <li> This is simple product that works really well. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Nice glove.  A little big for my small hands.  I bought this thinking I would wear it while using my new hair straightener but haven&#x27;t needed it.  However, if your hands are bigger and you tend to burn yourself while using your curling or flat iron then they are a good idea.</li>
            <li> Glove is a tad large for my small hand. Does do a good job of heat shielding.</li>
            <li> This glove is perfect paired with the new Infiniti Pro by Conair curling iron I just bought.  No more burnt fingers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a heat glove to use with my professional (that means super dang hot) heat tools. Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that I don&#x27;t have to first buy yet another curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glove is a bit oversized, but that works well for me because I have big hands. If your hands are tiny, it may be too big. But its size makes it easy to take on and off to switch hands. The finger tips are a bit bulky with seams. Having never used one, I had to learn how to section my hair without my fingers as it is difficult to do with the glove on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it and happy with the price.</li>
            <li> This glove is a great product for protecting your hands. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this glove to anyone who wants to protect themselves. Ive had the glove now for a few months and use it daily and its held up perfect !</li>
            <li> This sucks - This is NOT one size fits all if you have small hands! I felt like a little kid wearing my parents cheap cotton gloves from the 80&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s hard as it is to use a curling wand with precision let alone some flimsy gloves that don&#x27;t fit - fingers too long.</li>
            <li> Not heat resistant. It is literally just a cotton glove. I have yet to find a glove from any company thats actually heat resistant. Gave it 2 stars because it&#x27;s better than just using bare fingers.</li>
            <li> I used this with the InStyler when I do my own and my daughter&#x27;s hair. From using a curling iron I like to grab the end. On the InStyler, that is HOT. I use it to keep the hot hair off my daughter&#x27;s back when styling her hair.</li>
            <li> This glove fits snugly and let&#x27;s your hand move easily.  It totally blocks the heated iron from burning your hand.  Wish I had this years ago.  Great product and good value.</li>
            <li> My hair holds heat and with this glove I am able to style without burning my finger-tips.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone that uses heat styling equipment.</li>
            <li> This little item is just the thing to avoid burning your fingers when you are using a curling or flat iron.  The material takes some getting used to, since the glove is not form fitting.  After a few times, you get the hang of it and appreciate how you do not have to worry about burning the tips of your fingers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stop my hand from burning while using my blow dryer</li>
            <li> Just exactly what we needed to go with our new curling iron.  Does a great job, much nicer then the glove included with the iron.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter to use with her waver but you&#x27;d have better protection just wearing any old glove.  I bought because the reviews had been good, so maybe mine is a flaw.  By the time she told me it didn&#x27;t work (she didn&#x27;t want to hurt my feelings) and I tried for myself it was too late to return.</li>
            <li> The material of this glove is fine - you won&#x27;t burn your fingers with it on. The problem is the shape of the glove. It appear to have been designed for someone with very narrow wrists and extremely long fingers. I have \\&quot;piano player\\&quot; hands with long, tapered fingers. Still, the glove extends about 1/2 inch beyond the top of each finger, making it very uncomfortable to use. It is also a bit tight on my smaller than 7-inch wrist so I don&#x27;t think it was meant for someone with bigger hands. I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> I bought this glove to help protect my hand when using a curling wand. It works great, exactly as it should. My only criticism is that it&#x27;s quite big and I have small-ish hands which makes handling the curling wand and hair quite clumsy, and potentially dangerous if you lose your grip.</li>
            <li> My wife had one of these gloves for doing her hair, however I also found it worked better than oven mitts when grabing something hot from the oven as I got a better grip. So now my wife has her&#x27;s for her hair, and I have mine for the oven.  Very handy glove.  Also Blue Novelties, the company I purchased from is a excellent company to do business with, as they not only shipped fast, but also follow up with an email to make sure you are satisfied with your purchas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 6/21/2013&lt;br /&gt;I got this glove confused with another glove (the charcol glove for BBQing).  No, I don&#x27;t use this one for taking things in and out of the oven, it&#x27;s too light for that.  But my wife absolutely loves it for doing her hair.  Still 100% rating for the glove and service.  Sorry about the goof, we ordered both at the same time.</li>
            <li> My curling wand came with a three-fingered glove, and I always ended up burning the fingers that weren&#x27;t protected.  After losing it on a recent trip, I ordered this as a replacement--no more burned fingers!  Works perfectly.  Glad I lost the original!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this glove is not heat resistant. I only needed to be able to hold the ends of my hair while I curled it.  It does not work.  I can&#x27;t imagine trying to really use it.</li>
            <li> Great all around! Love how it feels on a hand (not sratchy).</li>
            <li> Still burn my fingers but not burn my flesh off burning like before I got a glove. Could be more heat resistant but works well enough</li>
            <li> The item is nice, it helped me the burden of heat on my hand,</li>
            <li> Glove made straightening quicker and easier!  No more burning my fingers. Perfect.</li>
            <li> This glove is a BIG help as I try to figure out how to work with my curly/wavy/messy hair! Try this, try that, &amp;#34;OOh, my fingers are burning!&amp;#34;  Not anymore!  It really keeps the heat off and is easy to put on and take off.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I actually am using my glove for ironing applique.  I also use it for pressing small items on different crafts I work on.  It has certainly saved me several steamed fingers.  I would buy another if I ever need one.  It is flexible so that I can easily handle the small items.[[ASIN:B00563K6VO HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron. Black and red]]</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. A must for certain curling irons, but it&#x27;s easier to use a regular curling iron and not have to deal with a the glove protection.</li>
            <li> I do like my glove but wished I had listened to others and just went and bought a cheap pair of winter gloves as it is the same thing but you actually bet a whole pair for a Buck or two instead of one glove for $6.99!</li>
            <li> I bought this glove because it was recommended with the curling wand that I bought, and reviewers for the curling wand recommended getting a heat glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this glove does not really protect from the heat of the curling wand. Maybe it helps a tiny bit, but my fingertips still felt like they were starting to burn. The curling wand came with a three-finger glove and that also didn&#x27;t protect enough from the heat. I used both together (three finger glove on first, then this glove on top of it) and still felt like my fingertips were getting burned. Perhaps it will take me a while to get used to this, but I don&#x27;t think this glove provides adequate pretection from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have average-sized hands for a woman, but this glove was a little large. In addition, it&#x27;s a little thick, so it was hard to hold onto my hair, especially since the fingers of the glove were longer than my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to find a better, thinner glove that provides better protection from the heat. This glove is better than no glove, I guess, but I agree with those reviews that say that this glove seems no different from a simple, cotton glove. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any special heat-resistant properties.</li>
            <li> The glove does not fair well with the heat from a straightner.  It said good for up to 400 degrees and I am burning my hand when my straightener is at 360&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves using her glove with her new flat iron. I don&#x27;t have to worry about her burning her hand. Thanks</li>
            <li> A heat resistant glove for flat irons should fit your hand snugly enough that you can use that hand to assist with your styling.  This is is floppy and the fingers are too long.  The fabric makes it hard to sense where you are holding your hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  I am tempted to see if it can be used as a potholder.  If not, it will be gone.</li>
            <li> It is like  same as a glove we get at any gas station.Nothing heat protective about it.doent worth 6.99$ .</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove to use with a curing wand. This glove is much better than the one that came with the wand. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like to use a glove when curling my hair so I can get it perfect. This does a great job without feeling like my hand precision is limited.</li>
            <li> Looks like a regular hardware glove. Does what it is meant for. Don&#x27;t think you need two of these.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00563K6VO HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron. Black and red]]&lt;br /&gt;Love the glove. I want another one for my left hand.  I put my hand right on the curling iron, which was at 400 degrees in tempature and felt only warmth.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought a larger heated styling brush that is 1.25&amp;#34; in diameter. There aren&#x27;t many rows of bristles, which allow a lot of exposed metal, and so I&#x27;m my always burning my finger when I&#x27;m styling my hair. I was hitting the same spot on my finger repeatedly and was working on a pretty good blister, so I went looking for a solution. Initially I thought I&#x27;d have to resort to an Ove Glove, but while searching came across this heat resistant glove made for hair styling tools. Didn&#x27;t know they made things like this, figuring everyone else was just better at using these tools. Not only was I happy to find a product like this, but really happy that it works! No more burns...but keep in mind, I did not purposely test it by laying my finger on the hot metal. I simply used the glove while styling my hair as usual, and for once didn&#x27;t burn myself. The glove fit fine and didn&#x27;t impede my use in any way. Very pleased with the product and how fast I received my order.</li>
            <li> Bought the glove to go with a new curling iron.  Works really well.</li>
            <li> Really protects my hand when I&#x27;m using a clipless curling iron.</li>
            <li> It makes using a wand curler so much easier !</li>
            <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Comfortable glove that really protects against heat.</li>
            <li> Excellent heat resistance!  I liked the one I previously puchased so much I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> I ordered late, thinking it would not arrive in time but it did. This glove was for my grand-daughter .  I am sure it works and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> It does the job and doesn&#x27;t add significant bulk to my hands.</li>
            <li> For the cheap price, this glove works very well. Its very helpful when working with curling and flat irons.</li>
            <li> Works great. I used my daughter&#x27;s curling wand once without this and burned myself several times. This glove solves the problem, is reasonably priced, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The glove works great.  Just as described.  I have long fingers and the glove stretches to fit perfectly.  No complaints!  Shipping was fast and efficient.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I always hated burning my hand while I was straightening my hair.  It is something to get used to - wearing a glove while working with your hair.  But you will and you will appreciate no longer burning your hands.</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove to assist my jr. high age daughter curl her hair.  The iron I purchased does not have a clip to hold the hair in place, and this glove works really well.  It seems to be adaptable to most any size hand.  I have rather large hands for a woman, and my daughter can use the glove as well.  ULTA does not sell thermal gloves in their store, so I had to order on-line.  I&#x27;m sure glad I did!</li>
            <li> I bought this glove to use with a tapered clipless curling iron.  My iron has 4 heat settings. Since the highest setting is too hot for my fine hair, I only go up to the 2nd hottest setting (375 degrees).  I can feel some heat through the glove while lightly pressing the ends of my hair against the iron, but it is comfortable enough to get the job done. I would not recommend this glove at the hottest setting (400 degrees) if you have to hold a very thin section of hair against a hot iron for any length of time. The thicker the section of hair the more protection you have using the glove this way. This glove will prevent burns from brushing your fingers across the iron. The iron I use is called the infinity \\&quot;You Curl.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note that I have no trouble handling my fine hair with the glove on. My hair does not slip any more than it does with my bare hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> El producto es excelente, de muy buena calidad, Entregado en perfectas condiciones. Envio rapido y oportuno.  Recomenendado 100 % .</li>
            <li> Comfortable glove. Really works. Prevents burning hands &amp; fingers while still able to grip iron or styling tools. Great value</li>
            <li> After burning my hand a few times while winding my hair around my curling wand, I saw this glove being advertised on Amazon.  I figured I would give it a try.  It takes a little getting used to (grabbing your hair and holding it) but no more burns!  I love this glove and would recommend it very highly to anyone suffering from burning their hands while trying to curl their hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> great product, does a good job of resisting the heat!</li>
            <li> I bought this and it works very well but I have to say it is very large. I have very big hands for a girl and they were big on me.</li>
            <li> Great glove. Ordering was fast and easy. Would recommend product and company. The glove was the right size and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Before I recieved my glove I used my wand on my hair and my daughters. I managed to not only burn my fingertips, but my wrist as well! Guess I&#x27;m not as talented as I thought... This glove is great! It was an awesome price, and was delivered super quick!! I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for each hand, as I have a horrible habit of burning one hand on my hair and the other on the wand when I use my styling wand. I have small hands, and these fit even my hands rather well. They would easily fit anyone who wears a small or medium glove. If you have short fingers though, they might be a little annoying. They aren&#x27;t heatproof, but when they start to warm up, you know your hair is done. Easy to work with. What I love most about them, is that they don&#x27;t leave my hair static-y when I use them like some of the other gloves I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten into a couple of close calls while using my curling iron and actually burned myself recently using my straightener.  No matter how careful you are, all it takes is one slip to burn yourself due to the high heat.  I bought this glove and it worked very well - I have no chance of burning myself while using it.  If your gloved finger gets too close to the heat, you will start to feel it and be able to pull away.  I am very happy with how effective the glove is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that it is too big for my hand which makes it a little awkward, so having this in a smaller size would be ideal.</li>
            <li> This glove is good for herstyler irons and the hotter flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them for my self and teenagers. Great protector to keep from burning&lt;br /&gt;your fingers.</li>
            <li> Useful for curling iron but fingers are made for a monkey. Way too long.</li>
            <li> I really like this glove, it is well made, and it helps to use when styling hair with rod curler or flat iron.  in the past I have singed my fingertips before, no problems now with this handy glove.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my wife and she said it was worthless, her hand got burned and she tossed it.  She gave one to a friend who reached the same conclusion and took the same action.  A third glove remains and I suspect it will have the same fate as the first two. There has to be a better and more effective product out there.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Protect your hands Yes, but you do not want to touch the Iron to much or too long, is better then the regular glove for Winter, I guess, but I never try to feel the different. Is good price, just do not expect to hold a curl more then a 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> This glove works pretty well.  I thought it would be thicker to keep the high heat away from your hand, but it is thinner than I thought.</li>
            <li> I wish it came down my arm a little bit further. I kept on burning myself in one spot. I guess I was looking at the same spot in the mirror. Ugh</li>
