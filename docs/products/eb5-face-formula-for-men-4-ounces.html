            <li>my wife says I look better when using it.</li>
            <li>but im glad amazon has it.</li>
            <li>they make it for more than 25 years, since it&#x27;s old-fashioned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has something to do with the product</li>
            <li>I have used eb5 for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this for many years.  </li>
            <li>Sells in JC penny for about $ 10.00 more.</li>
            <li>and it really feels great after a shave.</li>
            <li>Unbeknown to my wife I started using this 3 weeks ago and today she commented that my skin was looking really healthy and youthful</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>so I am pleased that I can get it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Do not use more or it feels greasy.</li>
            <li>Rub it in your skin well and you will be pleased with this product</li>
            <li>I have also given this as a gift to many of my guy friends, as a hint and a gift.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many years cuz</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>This does not leave my skin geesy or dry, its perfect.</li>
            <li>It help me keep my face smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer but there are many good moisturizers out there for much less money.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good face product/lotion for men I highly endorse the product.</li>
            <li>well, I am a lucky guy!</li>
            <li>luckily I was able to get a refund and do appreciate that.</li>
            <li>great product, been using for several years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>She was right again!</li>
            <li>and I truely see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s noticeable</li>
            <li>Does not leave a shine, or greasy residue, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>eb5 gives my skin a healthy look and softness without the high shine.</li>
            <li>I am a 55 year old man and many people ask me how I have kept my skin in such good shape.</li>
            <li>but it is certainly worth the price in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Before using this, I was beginning to have some roughed, sun aged skin that wasn&#x27;t looking to good.</li>
            <li>I read rave reviews from other people, but for the price, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great.  </li>
            <li>She now wants me to order the original eb5 formula for her based on my results.</li>
            <li>People say I look more than 10 years younger than my mid-50&#x27;s true age.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just full of moisture without too much chemical</li>
            <li>It really gives my skin a smooth texture once applied and over the years I really do think it has help with keeping the wrinkles and lines to a minimum.   </li>
            <li>I can image it being good for really old men with dry skin who need something super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Over the years i have tried many different ones and they all had some issues.</li>
            <li>Already, I notice a better complexion overall.</li>
            <li>People often guess that I am 10 or more years younger than I am.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>I look 10 years younger than most men</li>
            <li>This cream is great as an after shave soother and as a moisturizer for dry skin, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what its intended to do, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday after I shave and love it!</li>
            <li>It was much more pricey than I&#x27;d typically spend, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I feel the first application normal, but in the third week you feel changes normal, I change for a one better</li>
            <li>Very high quality, dense</li>
            <li>Best cream I have ever used on my old face--doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, and seems to help (look worse without it!).</li>
            <li>Very soothing after a shave without the bite.</li>
            <li>Its very pricy at macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it improved or reduced my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find a good face cream or lotion for men.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I am an old Aqua Velva man who switched to eb5 about 10 years ago and really like it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say wrinkles went away but definatly keeps new ones away.</li>
            <li>The 4.5 ounce tube will last longer than you think because it doesn&#x27;t take much to apply to your whole face.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling very soft and natural looking.  </li>
            <li>but i like how this one is clearly for men.</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old.    </li>
            <li>So far I cannot find it retail in my market area.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference when used Daily on your face.  </li>
            <li>BTW I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old</li>
            <li>My husbands father and sister both developed bags under their eyes..........</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old now and get mistaken for a 30 something quite often.  </li>
            <li>I have been using eb5 Face Formula for Men for several years and highly recommend it for any man.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 25 years, as an after-shave cream, and my oldest son-56 years old, continues to comment on how young his 79 year old dad looks, especially as compared to his father-in-law of comparable age.</li>
            <li>Does not take much so lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently 30 years old but always looked young for my age.</li>
            <li>This product really does last a long time.</li>
            <li>The cream is also really thick and takes some time to smooth over the face.</li>
            <li>As I said, very dense unliked any other face cream today.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be surprised by the size, it lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li>A little cream can cover your whole face.</li>

            <li> A little cream can cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> Seems a little heavy and not as rich as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> The Neutrogena  moisturizer I tried in the past made my oily skin very shiny and gave me occasional acne.</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I had to stop using since it caused me a small red rash near the lip.</li>
            <li> A liitle bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as long as I can</li>
            <li> Will go back to my other cream.</li>
            <li> Some would be too greesy and some are too dry.</li>
            <li> The supply lasts for quite a long time, as you use only a small amount daily.  </li>
            <li> Literally less than a dime size will treat your entire face.</li>
            <li> This formula is thick and one needs a little dab for your whole face.</li>
            <li> There is not much out there for men.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have looked at other products on the shelf and never find anything that compares to this.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products yet,  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it to other men..</li>
            <li> I feel that this is partially due to this product.  </li>
            <li> If you are wondering around, give it a try, it won&#x27;t let you down</li>
            <li> No more dry looking facial skin from too harsh of cleansers or common soaps.</li>
            <li> I typically get 6 months usage out of a tube for less than $40.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all and a just a little bit on the fingertip goes along way.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it on your lips (or eye lids) as it will cause them to burn a little.</li>
            <li> I just finished this product a few weeks ago.</li>

            <li> I have tried several products such as kielh&#x27;s or biotherm but this one works best. It smooths skin and make the skin looks really healthy! Just as someone else said it could tell when I stopped using it! If you are wondering around, give it a try, it won&#x27;t let you down</li>
            <li> my wife says I look better when using it. There is not much out there for men. this one works for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 25 years, as an after-shave cream, and my oldest son-56 years old, continues to comment on how young his 79 year old dad looks, especially as compared to his father-in-law of comparable age.</li>
            <li> Best cream I have ever used on my old face--doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, and seems to help (look worse without it!).</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Easy to apply--men will love it and look good wearing it.  Buy it now or else you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 8 years.  I am 47 years old.    Recently JC Penny stopped carrying the product and I was really unable to find it locally, anywhere!  So I search and found it on Amazon for a good price and free shipping.  This product is very helpful in dryness of skin for men that occurs with everyday shaving.  No perfumes and therefore NO burning when it is applied. It really gives my skin a smooth texture once applied and over the years I really do think it has help with keeping the wrinkles and lines to a minimum.   It is not greasy at all and a just a little bit on the fingertip goes along way.  I typically get 6 months usage out of a tube for less than $40.  I have looked at other products on the shelf and never find anything that compares to this.  Unfortunately there are never coupons associated with the product or deals but it is certainly worth the price in my opinion.  Walmart actually carries a ladies version, I just wish they would distribute the men&#x27;s formula for retail purchase again.  So far I cannot find it retail in my market area. If you are looking for a good face product/lotion for men I highly endorse the product.</li>
            <li> Truly the best face cream formulated for use by men. I  Have been  using EB5 for many years with great results. Used every day twice a day is the secret. A liitle bit goes a long way. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am an old Aqua Velva man who switched to eb5 about 10 years ago and really like it. I honestly believe that it has helped reduce wrinkling.  Very soothing after a shave without the bite. Started buying it from Amazon when JC Penney dropped the line. Glad I did since the price is better with quick shipping and good Amazon service.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 years.  I have tried other products yet,  I think it is the best mouisturizer for Men that is available. I hope you like it too.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a good face cream or lotion for men. Females have tons of stuff but i like how this one is clearly for men. Over the years i have tried many different ones and they all had some issues. Some would be too greesy and some are too dry. I have offically found the perfect cream and im sticking to it. It is worth every penny. Don&#x27;t be surprised by the size, it lasts a LONG time. A little cream can cover your whole face. This imporved my skin a lot, my girlfriend says it gave my skin a glow over the years and i would like to think i look younger. This does not leave my skin geesy or dry, its perfect. This cream lasts me almost a year with regular use. Its very pricy at macy&#x27;s but im glad amazon has it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost three weeks, once per day. Already, I notice a better complexion overall. Before using this, I was beginning to have some roughed, sun aged skin that wasn&#x27;t looking to good. This product has gotten rid of the roughness and has made the skin smoother. Don&#x27;t get it on your lips (or eye lids) as it will cause them to burn a little.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT Product!!!  I have been using eb5 Face Formula for Men for several years and highly recommend it for any man.  It really makes a difference when used Daily on your face.  You will see the difference in a very short time.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with this lotion.  My skin is incredible sensitive and I break-out very easily.  I also can&#x27;t stand to have the oily/greasy feeling on my face.  This lotion does not leave an oily residue and hydrates all day.  Leaves my skin feeling very soft and natural looking.  It was much more pricey than I&#x27;d typically spend, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> No more dry looking facial skin from too harsh of cleansers or common soaps. It moisturizes but is not greasy.</li>
            <li> great product, been using for several years</li>
            <li> This formula is thick and one needs a little dab for your whole face. It has not caused break outs! Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Pleasant but not too strong smell.  Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave greasy. Does not take much so lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> very good cream for men</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over a year and while I can&#x27;t claim to have reduced any wrinkles etc., maybe it has slowed them from inviting a bunch of their friends.  I use it every day after shaving and it works awesome as an after shave cream.  Keeps my face from drying out, isn&#x27;t greasy at all and has no scent to speak of.  A little goes a long way and I can get about 4 months out of one tube.  I signed up for the regular shipments here on Amazon as I don&#x27;t see myself ever being without it.</li>
            <li> SHOULD BE A 6TH STAR FOR  THIS  EB - 5</li>
            <li> I bought a few face moisturisers from several brands, none is bad but only this one I&#x27;m going to purchase again. Very high quality, dense and I truely see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s noticeable they make it for more than 25 years, since it&#x27;s old-fashioned. As I said, very dense unliked any other face cream today. I think it&#x27;s just full of moisture without too much chemical crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I had to stop using since it caused me a small red rash near the lip. I&#x27;m sure it has something to do with the product since once it appeared I stoped using and within 3 days the rash was gone (I used it only once a day prior sleep). After two weeks I started using the product again and bamm, I applied and in the morning after the rash came back. I&#x27;d even say it seemed like a small fungus (which made me anxious a bit), but disappeared once I stopped using.&lt;br /&gt;I must say, don&#x27;t judge the product just according that. I really liked it and it&#x27;s a good value, try it - if your skin doesn&#x27;t react like mine I&#x27;d go for it. BTW I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used eb5 for many years.  I am 55 years old and I have NO wrinkles, compared to my peers. People often guess that I am 10 or more years younger than I am. The supply lasts for quite a long time, as you use only a small amount daily.  This is one of those items that, once you use it, you will be hooked with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for many years.  It is a great product. It is also a great buy.  Sells in JC penny for about $ 10.00 more.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and a little goes a long way. I like the way it goes on and it really feels great after a shave. Can&#x27;t say wrinkles went away but definatly keeps new ones away.</li>
            <li> Unbeknown to my wife I started using this 3 weeks ago and today she commented that my skin was looking really healthy and youthful especially the area around my eyes and forehead where wrinkles are beginning to appear.  The Neutrogena  moisturizer I tried in the past made my oily skin very shiny and gave me occasional acne. eb5 gives my skin a healthy look and softness without the high shine. She now wants me to order the original eb5 formula for her based on my results.</li>
            <li> Product met expectations as usual.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  I look 10 years younger than most men my age and the woman.....well, I am a lucky guy!</li>
            <li> I feel the first application normal, but in the third week you feel changes normal, I change for a one better</li>
            <li> My husbands father and sister both developed bags under their eyes.......... fathers were removed by a DR. When my husband started getting them he started using this product and they have gone away!!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why i haven&#x27;t purchased another one, but i am today. i felt like lines were being softened up and my skin was the absolute best it could be.  combined with getting better sleep, i looked the best i had in years.  love it.</li>
            <li> This product seems to last forever. I purchased this awhile back and I still have about 1/2 left. The cream is also really thick and takes some time to smooth over the face. I&#x27;m currently 30 years old but always looked young for my age. I&#x27;m hoping this product will continue on maintaining my youth and will follow up with an updated review once I finish the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: April 21, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow it has been over an year since my last review. I just finished this product a few weeks ago. This product really does last a long time. I can&#x27;t really say it improved or reduced my wrinkles. However what I can say is for someone with oily skin, this moisturizer did not leave a shine or make my skin oily. Overall, this product still gets 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 20 years and my wife says that my skin looks very smooth.  I can no longer find it in the local stores so I am pleased that I can get it from Amazon.  I will continue to use it as long as I can and I recommend it to other men..</li>
            <li> Literally less than a dime size will treat your entire face. Do not use more or it feels greasy. Rub it in your skin well and you will be pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old man and many people ask me how I have kept my skin in such good shape. I always recomment EB5. I have also given this as a gift to many of my guy friends, as a hint and a gift. I use it everyday after I shave and love it!</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing cream. Does not leave a shine, or greasy residue, and absorbs quickly. No issues with any breakouts or any irritation. Does exactly what its intended to do, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have been using eb5 for years and it great for my skin.  It help me keep my face smooth and healthy.  Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  I read rave reviews from other people, but for the price, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but don&#x27;t regret trying it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use anything eb5 because it has left a very bad taste in my mouth, as it were.</li>
            <li> Have been using a different cream and thought I would give this a chance because of price per ounce.  Seems a little heavy and not as rich as I had hoped.  Will go back to my other cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years cuz&lt;br /&gt;my wife got it for me as a X-mas gift, and&lt;br /&gt;I love it.. Man believe me, &amp;#34;Wives Know Best&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;But shop around.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer but there are many good moisturizers out there for much less money.  One and done.</li>
            <li> This cream is great as an after shave soother and as a moisturizer for dry skin, especially during the winter. I used to use two different creams, but now have to use only one, saving time and money. I would recommend this to all men, regardless of age. My wife uses the women&#x27;s formula and recommended the men&#x27;s to me. She was right again!</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years, every day and it makes a big difference in aging skin.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used eb5 Face Formula for Men for over 5 years, after my Mother bought me a tube - she had been using the Women&#x27;s version for years with great success.  I think the Men&#x27;s version works, and optimizes my complexion.  People say I look more than 10 years younger than my mid-50&#x27;s true age.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years now, after a friend told me I was getting crows feet.  I am 43 years old now and get mistaken for a 30 something quite often.  I feel that this is partially due to this product.  The 4.5 ounce tube will last longer than you think because it doesn&#x27;t take much to apply to your whole face.  It usually lasts a few months.</li>
            <li> This product is on the expensive side, but seems to work well.  It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on smoothly. I don&#x27;t know if it makes your skin &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34;, but it definitely moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I returned this product made my face look like an oil slick. luckily I was able to get a refund and do appreciate that. I can image it being good for really old men with dry skin who need something super moisturizing. seemed qulity just not something for my stage of life. I&#x27;m 30 and currently use Acure organic products on my skin.</li>
