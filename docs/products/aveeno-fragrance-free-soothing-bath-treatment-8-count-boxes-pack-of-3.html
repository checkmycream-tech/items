            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Great deal on a product that helps relieve itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>It has been around forever and for good reason - it is very effective for skin itching/irritation.  </li>
            <li>daughter says \\&quot;It feels good on my skin</li>
            <li>great for heat rash or exzema and kind of itchy rash poison oak and ivy included softens skin too , even if you have no rash</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>ALSO, really good for therapeutic use (ie soothing hives, poison ivy rashes and more)</li>
            <li>While the virus has to run its course, it&#x27;s nice to find a product that helps to manage the symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the plus side, you exit your bath smelling like oatmeal, making you popular with pets.</li>
            <li>Like most people (I would guess)</li>
            <li>Our family has used it for many years and it has always provided reliable relief.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>(Most generics work just as well, but some settle to the bottom.)</li>
            <li>so glad it&#x27;s available in this three pack.</li>
            <li>Not only is it an enjoyable way to relive your itch (who doesn&#x27;t love a good soak in the tub)</li>
            <li>this product is fantastic at relieving the urge to scratch.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, especially for chldren with eczema.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin or has experienced itchy skin problems.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does leave a ring around the tub, but no worse than many of the bubble baths or herbal bath soaks on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>Ok, true, you do have to wipe your tub down after using the product because of the residue, but that&#x27;s nothing in consideration of having such wonderful relief from medicinal itching.  </li>
            <li>I remember my great grandmother putting me in a bath with just plain oatmeal</li>
            <li>The Colloidal oatmeal is much smoother and comfortable than the old days of oatmeal bath treatments.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema and this helps soooo much.</li>
            <li>really softens skin.</li>
            <li>it really softens the skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is the same oatmeal you&#x27;ll find in the baby version, you just get alot more for your dollar by buying the adult version.  </li>
            <li>Of course it does make the tub a little \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;, but a quick rinse and scrub and it is fine.  </li>
            <li>fold the top down and use a chipclip to close.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for medicinal side effects of itching.  </li>
            <li>The little extra work is more than worth it for the results.</li>
            <li>We use this to bathe our baby in and it leaves his skin so soft!  </li>
            <li>Then I found the Aveeno Natural Colloidal Bath product.  </li>
            <li>The washcloth gets soft and squishy too!\\</li>
            <li>it made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Finally, a product that doesn&#x27;t dry out my super sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>by Johnson &amp; Johnson, this is a product that&#x27;s been around for a long time, and really helps to soothe irritated skin of all types.</li>
            <li>It worked like a charm to help my daughter feel less itchy and seems to have helped to calm the redness as well.</li>
            <li>Often caught in school or daycare, the first sign of this crud is red cheeks (like they&#x27;ve been slapped) and later a bumpy, red rash that can be all over their bodies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent 30 plus years trying over the counter soaps, natural soaps, and various home remedies for my highly reactive skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and you must be extra careful getting in especially.  </li>
            <li> It is a must for dry itchy winter skin....</li>

            <li> Finally, a product that doesn&#x27;t dry out my super sensitive skin!  I use this in the shower by pouring some in my hands and scrubbing the product over my body.  I can even use this on my face!  I&#x27;ve spent 30 plus years trying over the counter soaps, natural soaps, and various home remedies for my highly reactive skin.  I&#x27;m hooked on this!  It&#x27;s especially wonderful for rashes of most kinds!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but Walgreens, CVS have stopped carrying this and Amazon was the only place i can get it. It is a must for dry itchy winter skin....sweaters were driving me crazy so glad it&#x27;s available in this three pack.</li>
            <li> did not care for this product. after soaking feet for 45 minutes this bath seemed to dry my feet out. Not a nice feeling</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this helps soooo much. Thank you aveeno.</li>
            <li> We use these very often in our children&#x27;s bath when they show signs of serious dry skin patches. Instantly they show signs of relief.</li>
            <li> It has been around forever and for good reason - it is very effective for skin itching/irritation.  Like most people (I would guess) I first learned of Aveeno when I had chicken pox when I was young and into the bathtub I went.  Since then I have used it for my family and it helps with a wide range of skin issues and reducing itching.  Of course it does make the tub a little \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;, but a quick rinse and scrub and it is fine.  The little extra work is more than worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> We use this to bathe our baby in and it leaves his skin so soft!  It is great!  We will continue to purchase.  You will need to rinse the tub out afterward though.</li>
            <li> great product. really softens skin. ALSO, really good for therapeutic use (ie soothing hives, poison ivy rashes and more)</li>
            <li> If you have any form of itching (poison oak/ivy, allergies, eczema, etc...) this product is fantastic at relieving the urge to scratch.  Our family has used it for many years and it has always provided reliable relief.</li>
            <li> I take a pain killer everyday, oxycodone, which has a nasty side effect of making you itch.  It feels like you want to scratch your entire skin off.  It&#x27;s horrible.  So I had to do something about it.  Of course Benedryl was recommended but it made me sleepy and nauseous.  Then I found the Aveeno Natural Colloidal Bath product.  Not only is it an enjoyable way to relive your itch (who doesn&#x27;t love a good soak in the tub) but my itching stopped just like that, and my skin felt softer and smoother than before.  Ok, true, you do have to wipe your tub down after using the product because of the residue, but that&#x27;s nothing in consideration of having such wonderful relief from medicinal itching.  When I was a child with chicken pox I remember my great grandmother putting me in a bath with just plain oatmeal, it made me wonder if I was being cooked for breakfast.  The Colloidal oatmeal is much smoother and comfortable than the old days of oatmeal bath treatments.  Throw your Benedryl away and reach out for some Aveeno Colloidal Oatmeal Bath.  I highly recommend this product for medicinal side effects of itching.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is the same oatmeal you&#x27;ll find in the baby version, you just get alot more for your dollar by buying the adult version.  We stopped using soap when my son was a few months old and switched to only oatmeal powder in the bath, and it helps ALOT. We never skip this.  (Most generics work just as well, but some settle to the bottom.)</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter recently came up with Fifth&#x27;s Disease (the parvo virus that also causes the measles) which according to her pediatrician is very common with babies up through elementary school aged children. Often caught in school or daycare, the first sign of this crud is red cheeks (like they&#x27;ve been slapped) and later a bumpy, red rash that can be all over their bodies. By the time the rash appears, they are no longer contagious, but they are itchy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Aveeno Fragrance Free Soothing Bath Treatment as I remembered my mother using it on me 30 years ago when I had the chicken pox. Boy, am I glad I did! It worked like a charm to help my daughter feel less itchy and seems to have helped to calm the redness as well. While the virus has to run its course, it&#x27;s nice to find a product that helps to manage the symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter says \\&quot;It feels good on my skin and I like the oatmeal smell. The washcloth gets soft and squishy too!\\&quot; The active ingredient is Colloidal oatmeal, a skin protectant. Yes, it does leave a ring around the tub, but no worse than many of the bubble baths or herbal bath soaks on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made by Johnson &amp; Johnson, this is a product that&#x27;s been around for a long time, and really helps to soothe irritated skin of all types.</li>
            <li> No noticeable effect on my bug bites and plant allergies. On the plus side, you exit your bath smelling like oatmeal, making you popular with pets.</li>
            <li> helped me when I had rash.  only problem is that it makes the tub slippery and you must be extra careful getting in especially.  it recommends using a bath mat but i didn&#x27;t have one.  it made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount in my footbath.  it really softens the skin.  fold the top down and use a chipclip to close.</li>
            <li> great for heat rash or exzema and kind of itchy rash poison oak and ivy included softens skin too , even if you have no rash</li>
            <li> Great deal on a product that helps relieve itchy skin.  Cheaper here than in the store.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin or has experienced itchy skin problems.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, especially for chldren with eczema. We&#x27;ve used this on my son for several years now whenever he has flare ups. I highly recommend it!</li>
