    <ol>
            <li>This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This works best for me on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product and great price!</li>
            <li>To get 2 cases for $22, that&#x27;s a real nice deal.</li>
            <li>To get 2 cases for $22, that&#x27;s a real nice deal.</li>
            <li>Great hold, great shine.</li>
            <li>Even the strength of the hold is not as good.</li>
            <li>Good hold</li>
            <li>I was using Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Styling Wax, but I find this just as good.</li>
            <li>and i liked it,</li>
            <li>The absolute best hair product made!</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best and strongest hair products that I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 46 year old man with fine hair and this has been the best product to give my hair some texture and body.  </li>
            <li>so I came online to try and find it at a better price.  </li>
            <li>Basically the real stuff is great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, for the facts: This grooming cream is more like a wax</li>
            <li>The hold and shine of the cream have allowed me to get the most out of</li>
            <li>I love this stuff hold mys hair all day</li>
            <li>At runs about $17 on the shelf at most salons.</li>
            <li>And, I have found most alternative products to be as much or more.</li>
            <li>which I thought gave it a more formal look, to an almost satin finish.  </li>
            <li>and I needed something that still had a lot of shine, but even more hold.</li>
            <li>Remember, you can always add more....</li>
            <li>wish it held my style a bit better, but I&#x27;m told that that&#x27;s an issue with how my hair grows out and not the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have found that using the smallest amount on a fingertip worked through dry hair gives the best results.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t dry/crust up, and it lasts until you wash it out, but it also washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily</li>
            <li>if: You have fine hair or don&#x27;t want to have immovable waxy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been happily using the American Crew Pomade for a year or so, but I got a super-short pixie</li>
            <li>Thanks to all the honest 5 star sellers &amp; the reliability with sales &amp; delivery.</li>
            <li>and it holds great without leaving you feeling extra greasy.  </li>
            <li>This stuff rocks and smells clean.</li>
            <li>Gives you a clean polished look.</li>
            <li>Using too much of the stuff makes it look as if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for at more than 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Gets greasy very quickly and the overt shine can give the appearance of sweat and grease if too much product is applied.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years now and decided to order it online for considerable savings.</li>
            <li>I remember the first time I bought a case, it was close to $20.</li>
            <li>I remember the first time I bought a case, it was close to $20.</li>
            <li>AMerican Crew creams are absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Washing your hair every other day is better for it, promise!</li>
            <li>Remember the smaller the quantity the better.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as AXE brand and seems to be more expensive</li>
            <li>I noticed as I get older my hair is definitely changing &amp; not for the better.</li>
            <li>But, you can score it on Amazon for nearly half that, which to me is amazing.</li>
            <li>This works great with wet &amp; dry hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the real stuff at a barber shop</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products from La Bella, L&#x27;Oreal, Axe, and even different types of gel from American Crew, and none have performed better than the grooming cream.</li>
            <li>However, since having longer hair, the differences in hold and strength have really been noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just kind of a bland medicinal smell, but if you have shorter hair that doesn&#x27;t reach your nose or mouth - like me - I highly doubt it will be an issue for you.</li>
            <li>Works great is a bit greasey but works well on my hair which I keep short and combed back does not dry up or get hard like gels tried many different products this one has always been my favorite.</li>
            <li>so much for trying something new in bulk.</li>
            <li>It is my main stop for all my daughter&#x27;s Christmas goodies &amp; mine.</li>
            <li>I would say it reminds me of a smell like a very cheap hand wash you would use in a public bathroom or maybe a toilet cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Long on the top and short on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I use a different product when my hair is freshly washed.</li>
            <li>I have used a number of products being told that they are exactly the same as CREW, NOT!</li>
            <li>When I use this product, I usually leave my hair half wet and that works best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with hair that gets fuzzy like a baby chick if it&#x27;s clean and dry without any product in it, so I&#x27;ve tried just about everything there is over the last 30 years.</li>
            <li>and it does smell like floor wax, so don&#x27;t be surprised by that.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair look very greasy and does not hold well enough.  </li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>The only real downside of this product is it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>the definition of &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; is that is was brown (instead of yellow) and it smells like strong, sour, blue-cheese (instead of no-smell that it is supposed to have).  </li>
            <li>have used American Crew Forming Cream and Fiber in the past and both have been much better in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One testament to the strength of the grooming cream is that when I apply it to my hair on the side of my head, I am able to really press it flat and behind my ear.</li>
            <li>The deal is that it&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s thick and easy to work with</li>
            <li>hair is extremely think and slightly wavy, and I think this stuff would not work nearly as well for some with with fine or silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blow drying will apparently fix this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buyer beware &amp; only purchase your products from reliable or professional spas, salons, &amp; Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is just thick enough to allow for a wavy, unkempt look, but not stiff enough to present a rigid, solidified appearance, like many stiffer products, such as the American Crew&#x27;s fiber or hair sprays tend to do.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>That was one frustration I was having with other creams because however much gel I used, it was always puffy on the side and would eventually fall out of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick and heavy texture.</li>
            <li>When I had short hair, any of the above products would have worked fine because realistically, short hair isn&#x27;t that hard to manage.</li>
            <li>Looked it over real close and the trademark is a little off.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a little wavy, and I  blow it out straight</li>

            <li> My hair is a little wavy, and I  blow it out straight</li>
            <li> However, if you have thick and stubborn hair like me, it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> see other reviewers did not like the smell, but I think it smells like lanolin and beeswax and some acceptable slightly masculine cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a CREW product from my local drug store &amp; it is absolutely NOT the same besides costing double!</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair and your hair is very tame, then most likely this isn&#x27;t the cream for you.</li>
            <li> With the other products, including the American Crew forming cream, my hair style often times fell flat and floppy with my bangs eventually getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty expensive, but it is markedly cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hold will only last me about half the day.  </li>
            <li> Way easier to mold dry hair than the clay.  </li>
            <li> Only need a dab, if to much is applied it will not work as well ending up with poor results.</li>
            <li> It stays shiny and in place all day, and if I nap on it, I can just mash it back down into some semblance of behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, because it is like a wax, it is very thick and you will need to rub it in between your hands really well before running your hands through your hair.</li>
            <li> Many others have pointed out that it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> This product does not work well for my thin straight hair.  </li>
            <li> This one in particular is excellent for a guy with short hair, but a nasty ugly cowlick.</li>
            <li> This is not a wet look, slick down cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The other \\&quot;styling\\&quot; creams allow you to play with the hair, but it doesn&#x27;t guarantee the style will stay put.</li>
            <li> In other words, I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long enough where I comb it back and slick it behind my ears.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only bad the first couple of times, then you get used to it.</li>
            <li> So give it a shot if you&#x27;re tired of using other styling gels that just aren&#x27;t cutting it.the cream have allowed me to get the most out of</li>
            <li> Provides a little gloss, so your hair is shiny, but not as limp and wet as pomade type</li>
            <li> Start with just a little and go from there.</li>
            <li> holds well without being stiff....</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair</li>
            <li> Each 3oz case usually lasts me 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s really not a strike against if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product in the past from amazon-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why others are complaining about its smell...</li>
            <li> The cream will also stay in your hair and will be hard to get out until you shower.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy if: You have stubborn, thick, cowlicky hair that you want to STAY PUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this junk is way too thick and lacks any flexibility.</li>
            <li> I have thick unruly hair and this stuff does the job.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 years now and my hair is thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> Probably not a good idea to broadcast that oops.</li>
            <li> So give it a shot if you&#x27;re tired of using other styling gels that just aren&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> So I have very thick, and sometimes unruly hair.</li>
            <li> the product is weirdly oily and doesnt wash off with soap like it should.</li>
            <li> but this order was Bad and not usable.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell bad to me....</li>

            <li> I bought the real stuff at a barber shop and i liked it, so I came online to try and find it at a better price.  Found this stuff and opened it up and it smells like clay.  Looked it over real close and the trademark is a little off.  Basically the real stuff is great this just isn&#x27;t it</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best and strongest hair products that I have used. I have thick black hair and it&#x27;s long enough where I comb it back and slick it behind my ears.

It&#x27;s only bad the first couple of times, then you get used to it. In addition, because it is like a wax, it is very thick and you will need to rub it in between your hands really well before running your hands through your hair. It has a nice thick and heavy texture. The cream will also stay in your hair and will be hard to get out until you shower. If you have thin hair and your hair is very tame, then most likely this isn&#x27;t the cream for you. However, if you have thick and stubborn hair like me, it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot. I have been using the grooming cream for almost 2 years and have not looked back. Each 3oz case usually lasts me 2-3 months. The hold and shine of the cream have allowed me to get the most out of my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the prices on Amazon are a steal. I remember the first time I bought a case, it was close to $20. I still see it \\&quot;on sale\\&quot; at Ralphs for $17.99 and at Target for $16.99. To get 2 cases for $22, that&#x27;s a real nice deal. So give it a shot if you&#x27;re tired of using other styling gels that just aren&#x27;t cutting it.the cream have allowed me to get the most out of my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the prices on Amazon are a steal.

            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the American Crew products at one time, and I find either this product or American Crew Forming Cream ([...]) to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- This product is as simple as it gets. There is no need to comb or style.&lt;br /&gt;- Just apply some and run your hands through your hair, it will fall in a way that looks suave but not overly preppy.&lt;br /&gt;- Provides a little gloss, so your hair is shiny, but not as limp and wet as pomade type products.&lt;br /&gt;- It is just thick enough to allow for a wavy, unkempt look, but not stiff enough to present a rigid, solidified appearance, like many stiffer products, such as the American Crew&#x27;s fiber or hair sprays tend to do.&lt;br /&gt;- This product is pretty expensive, but it is markedly cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Gets greasy very quickly and the overt shine can give the appearance of sweat and grease if too much product is applied.</li>
            <li> This product does not work well for my thin straight hair.  This product makes my hair look very greasy and does not hold well enough.  The hold will only last me about half the day.  Using too much of the stuff makes it look as if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for at more than 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used American Crew Forming Cream and Fiber in the past and both have been much better in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I wanted to add is the smell.  Many others have pointed out that it smells bad.  I would say it reminds me of a smell like a very cheap hand wash you would use in a public bathroom or maybe a toilet cleaner.  Not what I want to be reminded of when I am putting the product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years now and decided to order it online for considerable savings. The product I received is significantly different from the store bought ones I have used before. the product is weirdly oily and doesnt wash off with soap like it should. Even the strength of the hold is not as good. I am going back to the store for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff hold mys hair all day</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> The absolute best hair product made!</li>
            <li> Good hold but it makes your hair smell greasy and it&#x27;s hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with hair that gets fuzzy like a baby chick if it&#x27;s clean and dry without any product in it, so I&#x27;ve tried just about everything there is over the last 30 years. This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 years. The deal is that it&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s thick and easy to work with, it doesn&#x27;t dry/crust up, and it lasts until you wash it out, but it also washes out easily. Some reviewers have said it has a foul odor. It&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s really not a strike against if you ask me. I have a really sensitive nose. It&#x27;s just kind of a bland medicinal smell, but if you have shorter hair that doesn&#x27;t reach your nose or mouth - like me - I highly doubt it will be an issue for you. The only real downside of this product is it&#x27;s price. At runs about $17 on the shelf at most salons. But, you can score it on Amazon for nearly half that, which to me is amazing. And, I have found most alternative products to be as much or more. I have paid up to $18 for this when I had to and probably would again if it came to that. Probably not a good idea to broadcast that oops.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product in the past from amazon- but this order was Bad and not usable.  Then I found out that I cannot return it.  Also- the definition of &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; is that is was brown (instead of yellow) and it smells like strong, sour, blue-cheese (instead of no-smell that it is supposed to have).  In other words, I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 46 year old man with fine hair and this has been the best product to give my hair some texture and body.  The recipe must&#x27;ve been changed at some point because it used to be shiny, which I thought gave it a more formal look, to an almost satin finish.  Bummer..but nothing else works like this.  AXE products doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It has no odor either.</li>
            <li> AMerican Crew creams are absolutely phenomenal. This one in particular is excellent for a guy with short hair, but a nasty ugly cowlick. Holds for hours and hours and hours (and hours).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been happily using the American Crew Pomade for a year or so, but I got a super-short pixie and I needed something that still had a lot of shine, but even more hold. This stuff does the trick. It stays shiny and in place all day, and if I nap on it, I can just mash it back down into some semblance of behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is extremely think and slightly wavy, and I think this stuff would not work nearly as well for some with with fine or silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see other reviewers did not like the smell, but I think it smells like lanolin and beeswax and some acceptable slightly masculine cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy if: You have stubborn, thick, cowlicky hair that you want to STAY PUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip if: You have fine hair or don&#x27;t want to have immovable waxy hair.</li>
            <li> should have gotten forming cream.  this junk is way too thick and lacks any flexibility. so much for trying something new in bulk.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little wavy, and I  blow it out straight.... I was using Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Styling Wax, but I find this just as good. I&#x27;m not sure why others are complaining about its smell... doesn&#x27;t smell bad to me.... holds well without being stiff.... Remember, you can always add more.... Start with just a little and go from there.</li>
            <li> This is grade A hair styling product. Great hold, great shine. Washes out easily enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it held my style a bit better, but I&#x27;m told that that&#x27;s an issue with how my hair grows out and not the product. Blow drying will apparently fix this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a must-have.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of products being told that they are exactly the same as CREW, NOT! I am a woman with short hair &amp; like to change it up. This works great with wet &amp; dry hair. I noticed as I get older my hair is definitely changing &amp; not for the better.YUK;( I could not find CREW anywhere;( Finally I came across it years ago from Amazon sellers. As soon as I apply this product I get curl &amp; can make it look the way I want finishing with hairspray. NO residue! Only need a dab, if to much is applied it will not work as well ending up with poor results. I bought a CREW product from my local drug store &amp; it is absolutely NOT the same besides costing double! Buyer beware &amp; only purchase your products from reliable or professional spas, salons, &amp; Amazon. Thanks to all the honest 5 star sellers &amp; the reliability with sales &amp; delivery. It is my main stop for all my daughter&#x27;s Christmas goodies &amp; mine.</li>
            <li> So I have very thick, and sometimes unruly hair. Long on the top and short on the bottom. This stuff rocks and smells clean. When I use this product, I usually leave my hair half wet and that works best. Gives you a clean polished look. I use a different product when my hair is freshly washed. This works best for me on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair. Washing your hair every other day is better for it, promise! And look, this was a verified purchase so I&#x27;m not pretending!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about the last 5 years since my barber turned me on to it. I love this product.  I have thick unruly hair and this stuff does the job.  I have found that using the smallest amount on a fingertip worked through dry hair gives the best results.  One of these jars will last me about three months.  Remember the smaller the quantity the better.  This will keep your hair from appearing too greasy or oily. I do not use any hairspray with the Crew.</li>
            <li> Works great is a bit greasey but works well on my hair which I keep short and combed back does not dry up or get hard like gels tried many different products this one has always been my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is not a wet look, slick down cream.  I have longer hair and it holds great without leaving you feeling extra greasy.  Kept my hair from turning into a friz ball.</li>
            <li> Not as good as AXE brand and seems to be more expensive</li>
            <li> Way easier to mold dry hair than the clay.  I haven&#x27;t used pomade but I feel this is probably similar</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 years now and my hair is thick and wavy. I don&#x27;t need much for what I want to do everyday to my hair.</li>
