            <li> Love these handy little things!! I carry one in my bag too</li>
            <li> I travel internationally for work and tried a number of travel perfume bottles before getting a Travalo.  They are absolutely fabulous!  Easy to fill, never leak.  The size is easy to carry in your purse or pocket.  You can use the different colors for different fragrances.  I&#x27;ve purchased several more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Love these atomizers.  Purchased for myself and a friend and we can&#x27;t live without these and the price is the best ever.</li>
            <li> Always love these bottles. Great to carry in your purse or for vk. Use them all the time</li>
            <li> I had experienced the Travalo, and loved it, so I bought several to give as gifts.  Easy to fill, easy to use, no clogging, and light weight to carry in your purse.  Great atomizer!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is so easy to use.  Literally take the top off the big perfume put this on top and push down.  So easy.</li>
            <li> Very nice refillable cologne/perfume travel or purse size containers. Very easy to fill and very pretty colors. Different colors for each cologne/perfume.</li>
            <li> At last - a purse size perfume dispenser that really works!  Easy to fill, and does not leak.  Great product - glad I purchased the 4 pack.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great gadget for ladies</li>
            <li> YOU NEED THIS! Never worry about not having your favorite scent again! So easy to use bc literally all you do is remove the spray cap to your perfume, stick this on top and pump it in. Bam. No broken bottles, no carrying huge perfume bottles with you, never not have your perfume again! I keep on in my purse! And they&#x27;re small enough ounce wise to be okay to travel on planes with!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! Will be getting more</li>

            <li> Travalo, Extremely easy to fill.  They all work as advertised.  Only thing is I did want different colors.  They sent me two red ones instead of 1 red and 1 pink.</li>
            <li> great item for everyday use as well as for travel</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these! Don&#x27;t buy the knockoff brand, they leak. Travalo brand is the best!</li>
            <li> Great gifts. A woman always loves carrying this in her purse.</li>
            <li> Got these for traveling, and they are perfect. To use them, you remove the spray nozzle of your perfume bottle, and stick the plastic &amp;#34;straw thing&amp;#34; in the bottom of the travel bottle while pumping up and down. You can see through the window how much you have filled. I like that they are multi-colored so I know which perfume is in which bottle. I don&#x27;t think these will work with a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; bottle, though. I think it needs a spray nozzle. After my trip (2 months ago), I kept these in my purse and the caps stay on and there are no  leaks. Great product!</li>
            <li> i bought them for take it for my purse. you have also no Problems at the Airport&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I love them</li>
            <li> Perfect little refresher during the day!!! Fill with YOUR FAVORITE perfume. Nothing else like this on the market. no mess, no fuss!!! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!  Take them everywhere!</li>
            <li> I lost the first one of these I bought, so when I needed a replacement I bought extras to give as gifts.  These are great for anyone who travels.</li>
            <li> cant get them to fill from my perfume bottle</li>
            <li> Almost immediately after filling them 2 of the 4 began to leak my expensive fragrance everywhere. I won&#x27;t buy anymore Travalo. I&#x27;m going to give Flo a try.</li>
