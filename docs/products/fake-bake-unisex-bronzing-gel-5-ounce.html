            <li>It goes on better, stays better, gives beautiful color and wears out much more evenly than anything I tried before.</li>

            <li>I do love the color you get when you use product.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments when using this product.</li>

            <li>I love It.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light gel that is easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Ideal for daily use both for men and weman.</li>
            <li>no stinky smell and left me with a beautiful golden tan:)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s huge for me.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good self tanner just make sure you don&#x27;t put it on then go somewhere because you can&#x27;t cover up the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, goes on smoothly (use the gloves in the package) and it doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve the desired effect.</li>
            <li>i look very tan and fit</li>
            <li>I thought that Fake Bake Sunless Self-Tanning Lotion Original was the best self-tannig product on the market until I tried this one.</li>
            <li>It works fast!</li>
            <li>And even though it says \\&quot;unisex\\&quot;, I think it&#x27;s definitely geared more towards men, because it SMELLS like mens cologne.  </li>
            <li>I also like the Fake Bake Flawless spray that you apply with the mit.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake makes great products but in my opinion, this is not one of them!</li>
            <li>and I want to order more for the same price...</li>
            <li>I want to buy it for what I paid the first time...</li>
            <li>Not only did I spend $40.00 on the airbrush tan but it only looked good for about 3 days.</li>
            <li>It helps me acheive a better color as being a natural blonde I tend to have a red tint to my skin, It helps even that out and give me a healthy color.</li>
            <li>The color is nice but it was slightly steaky on my hands, knees, and feet.</li>
            <li>Looks real and everyone thought is was real.  </li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and looks so real.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t spend that much...</li>
            <li>This gel just does not give that immediate dark brown affect as \\&quot;Original\\&quot; lotion, but most of that affect washes out after the first shower anyway.</li>
            <li>I have used several other fake bake products, and while this one does a great job as far as color goes, the reason I gave it 3 stars is because it leaves you feeling SO incredibly sticky.</li>
            <li>It is so-o-o-o much better than any other sunless tanning product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Apply this correctly (don&#x27;t overdue it) and it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Goes on evenly and tan is natural appearing.</li>
            <li>When it does come off it is gradual and natural.</li>
            <li>Like the same day, even within hours to give a natural looking tint to my skin without making me look orange like an oompah loompah.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d stick to the classic Fake Bake lotion--it&#x27;s not near as sticky, it doesn&#x27;t smell gross like this stuff, and the bronzer makes it very easy to see where you&#x27;ve already applied the lotion.</li>
            <li>It does give a good tan, but the smell is really bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fake Bake Bronzing Gel  - I bought this product to get some color on my fish belly white body before going on a cruise to the Caribbean. It works fast! Like the same day, even within hours to give a natural looking tint to my skin without making me look orange like an oompah loompah. It&#x27;s easy to use, goes on smoothly (use the gloves in the package) and it doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve the desired effect. Looks great on my legs but I also used it on other swimsuit exposed areas, EVEN MY NECK AND FACE!!! It is so-o-o-o much better than any other sunless tanning product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I do love the color you get when you use product. I received many compliments when using this product. It did not turn me orange. The only drawback on it is that it smells awful, even my husband asked what the smell was. It is also very sticky when applied &amp; even after it has dried. It did not stain my clothes or my sheets, which is a big plus. I think if they could figure out how to change the odor, this would be a perfect self tanner.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Looks real and everyone thought is was real.  The feet area can be tricky but any product will be like that.  Just takes a little practice. Will definately purchase again!</li>
            <li> I thought that Fake Bake Sunless Self-Tanning Lotion Original was the best self-tannig product on the market until I tried this one. I like this Bronzing Gel better. It goes on better, stays better, gives beautiful color and wears out much more evenly than anything I tried before. This gel just does not give that immediate dark brown affect as \\&quot;Original\\&quot; lotion, but most of that affect washes out after the first shower anyway.</li>
            <li> This is so great! Everyone asks me if I have been  tanning.  I love the way it looks so natural.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really awesome too.  Great product!! I love It.</li>
            <li> Apply this correctly (don&#x27;t overdue it) and it looks very natural.  The ONLY negative comment is that it feels sticky for several hours after application.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and tan is natural appearing.</li>
            <li> The color is nice but it was slightly steaky on my hands, knees, and feet. The color is very light so if you want something that is dark I would not recommend this product. I would also not recommend this product for someone who is a beginner. Even though the gel is tinted once rubbed in you can not tell where it has been applied.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanning product I have found. It goes on evenly and looks so real. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of sunless tanning products, including airbrush tanning and spray tanning. I actually just got an airbrush tan about a month ago and then tried this product shortly after. I can not believe the difference between the two. Not only did I spend $40.00 on the airbrush tan but it only looked good for about 3 days. However I have been wearing Fake Bake for the last few weeks (reapplying about once a week) and I love it. NO streaking, orange color, or bad odor.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite from fake bake. It leaves the most natural color compared to any other I have tried on the market including all of fake bake. The smell doesnt brother me. It is stickey for a few minutes after application but the gel LASTS the longest out of all of them. That&#x27;s huge for me. When it does come off it is gradual and natural. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger either.</li>
            <li> It was sticky an took to long to dry- 1 star- was not satisfied  at all . Was not worth what I paid for it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light gel that is easy to blend.Smels great. Gives you nice and even tan. Ideal for daily use both for men and weman.</li>
            <li> It does give a good tan, but the smell is really bad. I know most self tanners stink, but this one is really bad. It kinda makes your legs sticky even my husband noticed that. Overall its a good self tanner just make sure you don&#x27;t put it on then go somewhere because you can&#x27;t cover up the smell.</li>
            <li> I have used several other fake bake products, and while this one does a great job as far as color goes, the reason I gave it 3 stars is because it leaves you feeling SO incredibly sticky. And even though it says \\&quot;unisex\\&quot;, I think it&#x27;s definitely geared more towards men, because it SMELLS like mens cologne.  Also, the gel is tinted, but once you start putting it on, you can&#x27;t tell where you&#x27;ve rubbed it in, which wasn&#x27;t an issue for me, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a beginner. I&#x27;d stick to the classic Fake Bake lotion--it&#x27;s not near as sticky, it doesn&#x27;t smell gross like this stuff, and the bronzer makes it very easy to see where you&#x27;ve already applied the lotion. I also like the Fake Bake Flawless spray that you apply with the mit. Fake Bake makes great products but in my opinion, this is not one of them!</li>
            <li> I was able to stop the terrible habit of tanning!! So happy I found this product. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my glow.</li>
            <li> i look very tan and fit</li>
            <li> It helps me acheive a better color as being a natural blonde I tend to have a red tint to my skin, It helps even that out and give me a healthy color.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product...no stinky smell and left me with a beautiful golden tan:)</li>
            <li> I purchesed fake bakke bronzing gel for 11dollars and I want to order more for the same price...now I saw that it cost 25dollars...I can&#x27;t spend that much...I want to buy it for what I paid the first time...</li>
