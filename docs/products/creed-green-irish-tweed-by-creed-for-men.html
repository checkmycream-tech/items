            <li>The most wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>the  scent was remarkable</li>
            <li>If its was good enuf for him</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good enuf for me.</li>
            <li>We must be wise about this.  </li>
            <li>When the time came to buy another, I researched all over the web for a good deal.</li>
            <li>Smells good.  </li>
            <li>Creed is fantastic and this scent is one of the best.</li>
            <li>No one else at work smells as good as I do.</li>
            <li>The seller did a good job in getting me what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The price was just as good.</li>
            <li>and I agreed it wasn&#x27;t as good as the sample from the store.  </li>
            <li>Good luck with your experiences......</li>
            <li>WITH GOOD QUALITY AND</li>
            <li>Use 2 sprays an you&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li>They are both great in their own way, but both take on their own house&#x27;s signature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find this very appealing.</li>
            <li>carry guaranteed, authentic CREED products and stand by them proudly.  </li>
            <li>I am relieved to say the GIT I bought from Amazon is 100 percent authentic and smells great.</li>
            <li>she wears channel and Jadore...which is very sexy........</li>
            <li>So when I first heard about this legendary stuff I thought</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34; is amazing - every time I have worn this fragrance I have received compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(people catching a whiff, stopping what they are doing, ask what I am wearing and leaning in for another smell or two) and the \\&quot;you must be wearing something</li>
            <li>, take a good look at that list and notice how they themselves say, \\&quot;You can be CONFIDENT when shopping these retailers.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Listen, what kind of people are we dealing with?  </li>
            <li>Listen, what kind of people are we dealing with?  </li>
            <li>] smells nice its</li>
            <li>now not once has someone said they liked it.</li>
            <li>you have nothing nice to say to someone....\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I thought it would make a nice match/blend</li>
            <li>GIT is simply an astounding perfume which opens with a lot of \\&quot;green\\&quot; smell, the smell of ferns and moss, it gives the feeling on being in misty</li>
            <li>I am just saying if you don&#x27;t own a Creed scent and are just getting into the grown man cologne then start here</li>
            <li>I had tested it at Neiman Marcus and liked it</li>
            <li>The GIT from Tuccini is really good and looks genuine.</li>
            <li>The sprayer is strong!</li>
            <li>I thought the price was to good to be true and it was correct.</li>
            <li>Especially, higher end Extraits and EdPs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed several have mentioned something to the effect of \\&quot;I can&#x27;t put my finger on it\\&quot; - that&#x27;s the perfect way to describe any Creed fragrance.</li>
            <li>I think I like this one better than what you had on this morning.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was Cary Grants favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Now I know better, which is why I&#x27;m passing this</li>
            <li>You can be confident when shopping these retailers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re dropping more than a clue.  </li>
            <li>They have a lot more to say about this on the Creed Boutique website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some fakes smell somewhat close to the untrained and, as mine was, ignorant nose, but someone who works with it every day, like a Creed representative, will be able to tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some fakes smell somewhat close to the untrained and, as mine was, ignorant nose, but someone who works with it every day, like a Creed representative, will be able to tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would be able to wear it.</li>
            <li>I was worried about it being a knockoff and was glad to see it was not.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery of a great product.</li>
            <li>Not too sure,</li>
            <li>But, it reminds me of one of the many dime store colognes I would find on my brother&#x27;s dresser about 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>Many months ago I bought a 1 oz.</li>
            <li>And I am so glad that I made the purchase here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have already received many compliments on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Girls love it.</li>
            <li>Was a bit worried, but pulled the trigger and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love how the scent changes as you go about your day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the men&#x27;s scents and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>What matters most is the juice</li>
            <li>It is definitely one of Creed&#x27;s best fragrances.</li>
            <li>We both love it.&lt;br /&gt;expensive</li>
            <li>but I am sure it&#x27;s not made in an Arab country.  </li>
            <li>However we were pleased with all aspects of the purchase otherwise.</li>
            <li>It just takes more time than a whiff of each to compare them.</li>
            <li>Why pay more for something that smells like a cheaper alternative?</li>
            <li>Wear it around lots of people, and see how many compliments you get, and try not to consider the price in your evaluation of its quality.</li>
            <li>I am a confident gentleman -</li>
            <li>I do not think I will ever buy anything from Amazon.com again if this is not rectified as this product has surely been tampered with at some point and time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have had this bottle from Amazon back in 2010 and it is still freaking awesome.</li>
            <li>I received a 100% authentic creed.</li>
            <li>I think this was not an authentic product.  </li>
            <li>It has a very unique smell and it changes as the top notes goes away and what not.</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with this scent and can confirm that the bottle I received from Amazon is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>YOU SOOOO MUCH!!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get it</li>
            <li>Additionally, I would also suggest that GIT is best suited for a more mature audience (35+) - those that will appreciate the true beauty of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>People familiar with Creed know their new sprayers are awesome and spray huge amounts of juice.</li>
            <li>This fragrance makes a person smell very clean, and well groomed.</li>
            <li>Just as good as at Neiman / Bergdorf but way more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a very special person.  </li>
            <li>Very true here.  </li>
            <li>Scent is memorable and has become a \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent that I enjoy wearing.</li>
            <li>Just what I expected and great value!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and when I go out bar hopping one spray on each side of my neck/behind the ear area but even with that amount it&#x27;s always good compliments never &#x27;eeew way too much&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how good the real GIT is, I now have lifetime supply of GIT version for 35$.</li>
            <li>No, you have to buy it first, then find out on your own.  </li>
            <li>No, you have to buy it first, then find out on your own.  </li>
            <li>Cool water is sweeter and more synthetic as compared to GIT.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>The first and only time I have given a perfect score.  </li>
            <li>The first and only time I have given a perfect score.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, well packaged and 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>There are alot of online retailers that sell genuine Creeds.</li>
            <li>What is truly exciting though is the Mysore sandalwood and something distinctly refreshingly woody like rubbing mint leaves on cedar peeking through from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>2nd time use, my niece told what a great cologne I have.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the real thing, smells wonderful on my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li>Immediately after spraying, it is invigorating and very fresh (sort of like grass).</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t know this when I purchased what was advertised as a genuine Creed, I thought I was being a savvy shopper by not paying full price and getting it from an unauthorized source, but in the end all that happened was that I got ripped</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t know or check where the sellers originally got their product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t know or check where the sellers originally got their product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is something magical about holding that bottle in your hand the first time...</li>
            <li>You have to be careful with &amp;#34;Knock-offs&amp;#34; with this type of product, so I was very pleased to see it was the genuine article, so the cost was very good as compared to the big department stores.</li>
            <li>I asked co-workers if they liked my new cologne and the response was, \\&quot;your wearing cologne?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many fragrances, and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>It has a special code written at t bottom of t bottle</li>
            <li>when I apply GIT on for those special occasions, the Superman comes out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never considered buyingan unknown fragrance online even if I think it smells great on someone else.</li>
            <li>Real, genuine Green Irish Tweed from Creed is a wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>, I naively shopped around for the best deal I could AND GOT TAKEN.  </li>
            <li>And, it was more reasonably priced at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I own a green Harris houndstooth, my folks are from Cork, I have a copy of my family sword on my wall, I think that Joyce&#x27;s \\&quot;Portrait\\&quot; is one of the greatest short novels ever, along with Conrad&#x27;s \\&quot;Heart of Darkness,\\&quot; and I like my Tullamore neat, in a snifter.</li>
            <li>As often as I&#x27;ve tested this, I still think it smells like Cool Water, a scent I&#x27;ve never cared for either -- matter of fact</li>
            <li>As someone had pointed out, GIT stands a class apart from cool water.</li>
            <li>true here.  </li>
            <li>DONNOT compare this to cool water cause cool water isn&#x27;t even close to this.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty excited to use this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The last one I really love in Creed Love in White (for women), while Creed Love in Black(for women,also)[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I liked a lot of the back story about the cologne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pricey but 100% worth it, this will forever be a staple for me.</li>
            <li>but worth of money</li>
            <li>If you buy it from a third seller, it is at your own risks.</li>
            <li>fragrance has a lot of apparent similarities to Davidoff coolwater (as most people are quick to point out).</li>
            <li>I own about 30 different colognes and some ladies at work seem to enjoy asking what I am wearing on any particular day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of the bottle, you get a heavy dose (and the Creed nozzles are one of a kind) of the beautiful blend of floral, herbal, and woodsy notes with minimal change during the drydown.  </li>
            <li>Based on some of the reviews it sounds like those that say it has no staying power, it doesn&#x27;t smell right,</li>
            <li>The price was totally right for a Creed product.</li>
            <li>I love sweet stuff just like the next woman but come on, maybe it was my body chmeistry.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s the only way for me to accurately describe how good Irish Tweed is and how well it wears:</li>
            <li>I would also warn that if you do really like the smell at first (Cool Water) try it out for a day or two.</li>
            <li>Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed is the best gentleman&#x27;s  fragrance made.  </li>
            <li>To this day, Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed stands out as one of greatest fragrances of all time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Irish Tweed is VERY unique, complex, fresh, slightly earthy and I agree, the best way to describe it is you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on what you are smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Green Irish Tweed strikes the perfect balance between fresh and masculine, with just the right hint of sweet.  </li>
            <li>SOOOOO with that being said, little boys stay in your lane dont ruin Creeds good name.</li>
            <li>Do not purchase this, I received and it said Toilet Water on the back, lol..  </li>
            <li>but I know my next bottle is not coming from the internet at a discount as I liked getting compliments for this particular scent and</li>
            <li>So they pay the huge markups and by them directly from Creed when if they did their homework and investigated the site they&#x27;d realize they could have saved hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>There is also a reason why you should spray (or dab if not a spray) on the back of your hand once you&#x27;ve narrowed the selection to a couple: you want to make sure it works WITH you.</li>
            <li>/out first trying it</li>
            <li>Most likely you are buying stock that authorized dealers/distributors have rotated out.</li>
            <li>Most likely you are buying stock that authorized dealers/distributors have rotated out.</li>
            <li>The Creed rep told me their colognes actually get BETTER with age, they don&#x27;t have a shelf life, so to speak, so that wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  </li>
            <li>Hey, you win because at least it wasn&#x27;t expensive!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hey, you win because at least it wasn&#x27;t expensive!&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty spot on.</li>
            <li>But a lot of people will not be able to tell if you are wearing the $40 perfume or the $160 perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Also, irrespective of the comparison, and having accepted that the GIT is a class apart, it is still low on value.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more when needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as robust as I remember it, especially on the top notes</li>
            <li>/&gt;While GIT offers fantastic flexibility - can be worn during any season, for any event, and day or night</li>
            <li>bottling and packaging are first class</li>
            <li>There is a reason why when shopping for fragrances a good store has coffee beans and they &#x27;air out&#x27; a test spray before letting you smell (usually a few minutes).</li>
            <li>Even though I love this line Creed is only for certain people.</li>
            <li>If you have worn Cool Water for years, then I can understand how you might compare this to that at first, but for anyone who has tried GIT and then tried Cool Water, there would be a big difference.</li>
            <li>but, it smells a bit common and honestly, a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>Beware, it doesn&#x27;t smell good from this store and the smell (thankfully) only last about an hour ...</li>
            <li>&quot; I was expecting something earthy and dank, peaty and leathery, a bit like Quorum or Devin, only better -- something that would convince me that I really AM a country squire out of a Donleavy novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because it &#x27;wears with time&#x27;, in other words it gently and nicely changes notes the longer you wear it</li>
            <li>then theorized that maybe these other places selling \\&quot;genuine, 100% authentic, satisfaction guaranteed\\&quot; Creed are buying stock that got old from an authorized source.  </li>
            <li>The price/value on the surface is not good - but can you place a value on creating a more confident and a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; you..??  </li>
            <li>The price/value on the surface is not good - but can you place a value on creating a more confident and a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; you..??  </li>
            <li>When you see [...] selling Creed, I&#x27;m fairly certain they aren&#x27;t an authorized seller nor did they receive their stock from Creed.</li>
            <li>When you see [...] selling Creed, I&#x27;m fairly certain they aren&#x27;t an authorized seller nor did they receive their stock from Creed.</li>
            <li>This is purely for the Amazon-sold bottle which comes and goes and dips and rises in price (140-160 USD).</li>
            <li>Certainly the price is a factor, too, and that will affect the reviews here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure quality.  </li>
            <li>This is like many other higher end luxury merchandise.</li>
            <li>This is like many other higher end luxury merchandise.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t speak to the actual scent as anyone interested in this product will be familiar with it.</li>
            <li>This is the one Im ordering next, this one smells kind of sweet while Green Irish Tweed smells more robust, manly and very sensual.</li>
            <li>body &#x27;chemistry&#x27; has as much to do with the fragrance and &#x27;staying power&#x27; as the ingredients of it.</li>
            <li>such cheap prices?</li>
            <li>Why such cheap prices?</li>
            <li>We must remember that we&#x27;re going to be wearing this stuff on our skin for hours and skin is very porous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really claim one way or another on that.</li>
            <li>they is all kinds of information on the internet to see if it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t be real creed imo.</li>
            <li>that whole \\&quot;oceanic\\&quot; thing turns me off.  </li>
            <li>Just a spray or two would stay on you the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I can attest that if you by the Amazon stock, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>It has continuously evolved and it admittedly does not project much anymore.</li>
            <li>If your going to spend this much for a cologne go into a department store and purchase it there.</li>
            <li>Thanks,  RaJuR Music on the Web</li>
            <li>The GIT turned out to be the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know the difference between the real one and the counterfeit.</li>
            <li>I thought the fragrance would be much richer than what I receive.</li>
            <li>Maybe what I received was not the real thing.</li>
            <li>Ordered through amazon after doing some research and reading reviews to see if this was the real thing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to sell a knockoff, don&#x27;t try to deceive people with it; call it something different, put it in a different bottle, and call it your own.  </li>
            <li>While casting no aspersions on Amazon, to that I say:  Please read the above authorized retailer list from Creed&#x27;s own website, check who you&#x27;re buying it from, then ask yourself if they&#x27;re actually on that list.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s pretty stunning but not worth</li>
            <li>It does smell nice but last only a couple of hours ....</li>
            <li>I have no regrets making the purchase at a department store and paying full retail price.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets making the purchase at a department store and paying full retail price.  </li>
            <li>mean it&#x27;s nice to feel a bit cultured when putting on a cologne with such an interesting story.</li>
            <li>Still strong and lasts long.  </li>
            <li>They are that unique and different.</li>
            <li>After receiving and comparing the bottle using photos of other bottles it appears to be authentic.</li>
            <li>bought this after owning the original from norstrom,this item is a Arab store in the middle east ,that had it on there shelf</li>
            <li>Very clean smelling scent that can be worn everywhere, smells simple at first but becomes more complex as you catch whiffs of it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>After all, if you&#x27;re reading this, you are here to pay Amazon half off the list price of the white market good.</li>
            <li>If you end up with an EdT of Irish Tweed, you might just have a bottle of Cool Water since Creed doesn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li>If you end up with an EdT of Irish Tweed, you might just have a bottle of Cool Water since Creed doesn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li>I cannot put my finger on it, but the cologne does not smell quite the same as when purchased full price in the dept store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone who has worn Creed GIT for a lengthy enough period of time would never compare it to Cool Water.</li>
            <li>Please pay a little more and get the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please pay a little more and get the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new signature fragrance!</li>
            <li>The one review I remember reading that was pretty accurate compared it to a ridiculously over priced bottle of Cool Water.</li>
            <li>There would be no need to get rid of older stock and replace it with new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne smells decent.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received was one with the older sprayer.</li>
            <li>As I said, these bottles of GIT are overstock and have the older sprayer which explains the reduced price.</li>
            <li>and it is 100 percent Green Irish Tweed which I have used and loved for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I need to buy another cologne, I will give these guys a try again because they handled the issue very professionally and fast.</li>
            <li>This is what the fragrance really smells like, and is often drastically different from what you get from sniffing the nozzle or putting the liquid right under your nose.</li>
            <li>Although I had to pay a fortune for that little bottle, I fell completely in love with the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too formal for most people.</li>
            <li>There are a few that I really love in particular, they include:</li>
            <li>Sorry for others that may have had a problem, but for me this was a great savings and will continue to buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Better, spray on the areas you will wear it, never rub it in, and walk around 30-mins before dropping a few hundred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Paying anything beyond that for this cologne is honestly just pretentious.</li>
            <li>Most recently a few friend</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth trying once and hating me for it) which makes sense since the supposed middle notes are iris and violet leaf.</li>
            <li>It is a long lasting scent so don&#x27;t go spray crazy,but make sure to spay on your body and not your clothes.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s either a lesser desirable batch or otherwise an older stock where the really strong shimmering fresh top notes (lemon and verbena) (that unfortunately was copied long ago by Cool Water)</li>
            <li>Cool Water costs 100 dollars less, and smells almost exactly like this.  </li>
            <li>(for those who own this fragrance know what I mean..</li>
            <li>I knew I was taking a risk due to the cheap price, but the scent isn&#x27;t even close.  </li>
            <li>It is a new me.  </li>
            <li>I understand why this blend has such a huge following.  </li>
            <li>bottle -- with its classic Creed &#x27;Flask&#x27; Design is a classy touch to anyones</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to be made fun of by your friends for a bottle of toilet</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to see someone in the morning and receive a \\&quot;wow, you smell good - what is that?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Very old stock.</li>
            <li>None of these merchants are being honest and telling you their products are fake right up front, are they?  </li>
            <li>None of these merchants are being honest and telling you their products are fake right up front, are they?  </li>
            <li>This, of course, creates something very much different than what many have grown used to - don&#x27;t ever expect Irish Tweed or any Creed product to be like anything else or &#x27;hit&#x27; you the same way.</li>
            <li>the term they and other higher end fragrances have chosen for the higher concentration EdP (Eau de Parfum).</li>
            <li>After reading reviews on other sites it seems that many others have had the same results from this batch.</li>
            <li>Additionally, smelling a fragrance this way is misleading because that&#x27;s usually not at all how it smells when it mixes with the air.</li>
            <li>It is unbelievable how many comments I have received from this cologne.</li>
            <li>However, when it comes down to it, Green Irish Tweed would fit right into the $39-$59 range just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a decent collection of top shelf cologne and this one has received by the far the least acknowledgment from my peers.</li>
            <li>I have a 4 year old bottle of Creed Silver Mountain Water that smells exactly the same as when I bought it.</li>
            <li>I did a single spray on my right wrist</li>
            <li>Was a little hesitant to buy at this price, but hey, product turned out to be genuine.  </li>
            <li>But bear in mind Terre d&#x27;Hermes, due to its chemical composition (a hefty dose of Iso-E Super molecule and how it works with your nose) is basically olfactory crack.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see Creed being sold by discount fragrance sites.</li>
            <li>that you&#x27;ve never tried on yourself, even if ordered directly from Creed, you are rolling the dice and hoping it works with you.</li>
            <li>If Creed doesn&#x27;t distribute product directly to unauthorized retailers, where are their bottles coming from?  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to Creed when I was a child ( i am 26 years old now) and hadnt seen it since then .</li>
            <li>I actually got a sample and wore almost the whole thing.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is old?</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne early December for a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much remember now, but something about how it was created for a Hollywood starlet in the 50s or 60s and that it was British.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fantastic, no different in smell and stronger than my last bottle with same longevity.</li>
            <li>Thought it may have been an old batch,  which happens at time,  </li>
            <li>- what is the old expression, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for..&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance isn&#x27;t even close to the authentic Green Irish Tweed by Creed.</li>
            <li>It only comes in Millésime: the term they and other higher end fragrances have chosen for the higher concentration EdP (Eau de Parfum).</li>
            <li>The product is genuine but clearly left over grey market goods meant to be sold abroad (it looks like the Middle East).</li>
            <li>If you find it at a department store and like the smell, I would just caution you to try it out for a day and see if it lasts long enough to be worth the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only seen Creed in high end department stores (</li>
            <li>Green Irish Tweed has a reputation that a dignified ,mature, sexy male should wear.</li>
            <li>Not the only red flag, but certainly one of them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yes, you read it correctly, Creed Green Irish Tweed was originally created for actor Cary Grant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought it directly from amazon, not a 3rd party seller on amazon.</li>
            <li>It is in fact real and smells as expected.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe people buy Green Irish Tweed, when everyone will think you&#x27;re wearing Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and never get tired of the smell.</li>
            <li>A little strong when first sprayed , but later after the dry down</li>
            <li>I have always wore \\&quot;top brands\\&quot; i.e. Polo green &amp; black, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, etc</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems noted by other reviewers; I&#x27;ve purchased this product at Nieman and this is exactly the same thing.  </li>
            <li>is the official word directly from Creed&#x27;s website:  \\&quot;In the U.S., Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and their websites, select Saks Fifth Avenue stores, select Nordstrom stores, select Bloomingdale&#x27;s stores, the CREED boutique at 794 Madison Avenue in New York City (1-877-CREED 44), CREED&#x27;s official online store, a handful of independent boutiques across America carefully selected by CREED, including Bluemercury, Joe Brand, Cos Bar and Fred Segal, and, in Canada, Holt Renfrew and Ogilvy</li>
            <li>I see are labeled as EdT (Eau de Toilet) - no way and steer clear of those.</li>

            <li>But the sour powdery basenote of ambergris largely remains.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not satisfied with their product, they simply apologize and offer you a full refund -- simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>, I use it pretty heavily, two sprays to the chest, one to the stomach, one on each wrist (then rub from my inner elbow up the bicep to each arm)</li>
            <li>and I can definitely still smell it distinctly, which means my nose hasn&#x27;t gotten acclimated to the scent at all unlike my usual go-to colognes.</li>
            <li>Green Irish Tweed was the first purchased.  </li>
            <li>Same can be said about a Rolex or any other high end product.</li>
            <li>As mentioned by another reviewer, it does say Toilet Water PGS but thorough research revealed that it is common for fragrances sold in many other countries.</li>
            <li>I guaranteed it&#x27;ll smell different on me unless we are talking about the very common, overpowering $50 bottles that are designed to smell the same on everyone - opposite of what fine, traditional parfums want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It certainly did not smell like my last bottle of Green Irish Tweed.</li>

            <li> We must be wise about this.  </li>
            <li> When the time came to buy another, I researched all over the web for a good deal.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  </li>
            <li> Creed is fantastic and this scent is one of the best.</li>
            <li> No one else at work smells as good as I do.</li>
            <li> The seller did a good job in getting me what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The price was just as good.</li>
            <li> and I agreed it wasn&#x27;t as good as the sample from the store.  </li>
            <li> Good luck with your experiences......</li>
            <li> WITH GOOD QUALITY AND</li>
            <li> Use 2 sprays an you&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li> They are both great in their own way, but both take on their own house&#x27;s signature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find this very appealing.</li>
            <li> carry guaranteed, authentic CREED products and stand by them proudly.  </li>
            <li> I am relieved to say the GIT I bought from Amazon is 100 percent authentic and smells great.</li>
            <li> she wears channel and Jadore...which is very sexy........</li>
            <li> So when I first heard about this legendary stuff I thought</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34; is amazing - every time I have worn this fragrance I have received compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (people catching a whiff, stopping what they are doing, ask what I am wearing and leaning in for another smell or two) and the \\&quot;you must be wearing something</li>
            <li> , take a good look at that list and notice how they themselves say, \\&quot;You can be CONFIDENT when shopping these retailers.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Listen, what kind of people are we dealing with?  </li>
            <li> Listen, what kind of people are we dealing with?  </li>
            <li> ] smells nice its</li>
            <li> now not once has someone said they liked it.</li>
            <li> you have nothing nice to say to someone....\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I thought it would make a nice match/blend</li>
            <li> GIT is simply an astounding perfume which opens with a lot of \\&quot;green\\&quot; smell, the smell of ferns and moss, it gives the feeling on being in misty</li>
            <li> I am just saying if you don&#x27;t own a Creed scent and are just getting into the grown man cologne then start here</li>
            <li> I had tested it at Neiman Marcus and liked it</li>
            <li> The GIT from Tuccini is really good and looks genuine.</li>
            <li> The sprayer is strong!</li>
            <li> I thought the price was to good to be true and it was correct.</li>
            <li> Especially, higher end Extraits and EdPs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed several have mentioned something to the effect of \\&quot;I can&#x27;t put my finger on it\\&quot; - that&#x27;s the perfect way to describe any Creed fragrance.</li>
            <li> I think I like this one better than what you had on this morning.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was Cary Grants favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Now I know better, which is why I&#x27;m passing this</li>
            <li> You can be confident when shopping these retailers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re dropping more than a clue.  </li>
            <li> They have a lot more to say about this on the Creed Boutique website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some fakes smell somewhat close to the untrained and, as mine was, ignorant nose, but someone who works with it every day, like a Creed representative, will be able to tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> would be able to wear it.</li>
            <li> I was worried about it being a knockoff and was glad to see it was not.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of a great product.</li>
            <li> Not too sure,</li>
            <li> But, it reminds me of one of the many dime store colognes I would find on my brother&#x27;s dresser about 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> Many months ago I bought a 1 oz.</li>
            <li> And I am so glad that I made the purchase here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have already received many compliments on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Girls love it.</li>
            <li> Was a bit worried, but pulled the trigger and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Love how the scent changes as you go about your day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the men&#x27;s scents and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> What matters most is the juice</li>
            <li> It is definitely one of Creed&#x27;s best fragrances.</li>
            <li> We both love it.&lt;br /&gt;expensive</li>
            <li> but I am sure it&#x27;s not made in an Arab country.  </li>
            <li> However we were pleased with all aspects of the purchase otherwise.</li>
            <li> It just takes more time than a whiff of each to compare them.</li>
            <li> Why pay more for something that smells like a cheaper alternative?</li>
            <li> Wear it around lots of people, and see how many compliments you get, and try not to consider the price in your evaluation of its quality.</li>
            <li> I am a confident gentleman -</li>
            <li> I do not think I will ever buy anything from Amazon.com again if this is not rectified as this product has surely been tampered with at some point and time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had this bottle from Amazon back in 2010 and it is still freaking awesome.</li>
            <li> I received a 100% authentic creed.</li>
            <li> I think this was not an authentic product.  </li>
            <li> It has a very unique smell and it changes as the top notes goes away and what not.</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with this scent and can confirm that the bottle I received from Amazon is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> YOU SOOOO MUCH!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get it</li>
            <li> Additionally, I would also suggest that GIT is best suited for a more mature audience (35+) - those that will appreciate the true beauty of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> People familiar with Creed know their new sprayers are awesome and spray huge amounts of juice.</li>
            <li> This fragrance makes a person smell very clean, and well groomed.</li>
            <li> Just as good as at Neiman / Bergdorf but way more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a very special person.  </li>
            <li> Very true here.  </li>
            <li> Scent is memorable and has become a \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent that I enjoy wearing.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and great value!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and when I go out bar hopping one spray on each side of my neck/behind the ear area but even with that amount it&#x27;s always good compliments never &#x27;eeew way too much&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how good the real GIT is, I now have lifetime supply of GIT version for 35$.</li>
            <li> No, you have to buy it first, then find out on your own.  </li>
            <li> No, you have to buy it first, then find out on your own.  </li>
            <li> Cool water is sweeter and more synthetic as compared to GIT.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> The first and only time I have given a perfect score.  </li>
            <li> The first and only time I have given a perfect score.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, well packaged and 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> There are alot of online retailers that sell genuine Creeds.</li>
            <li> What is truly exciting though is the Mysore sandalwood and something distinctly refreshingly woody like rubbing mint leaves on cedar peeking through from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2nd time use, my niece told what a great cologne I have.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the real thing, smells wonderful on my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after spraying, it is invigorating and very fresh (sort of like grass).</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t know this when I purchased what was advertised as a genuine Creed, I thought I was being a savvy shopper by not paying full price and getting it from an unauthorized source, but in the end all that happened was that I got ripped</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t know or check where the sellers originally got their product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t know or check where the sellers originally got their product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is something magical about holding that bottle in your hand the first time...</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with &amp;#34;Knock-offs&amp;#34; with this type of product, so I was very pleased to see it was the genuine article, so the cost was very good as compared to the big department stores.</li>
            <li> I asked co-workers if they liked my new cologne and the response was, \\&quot;your wearing cologne?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many fragrances, and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> It has a special code written at t bottom of t bottle</li>
            <li> when I apply GIT on for those special occasions, the Superman comes out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never considered buyingan unknown fragrance online even if I think it smells great on someone else.</li>
            <li> Real, genuine Green Irish Tweed from Creed is a wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li> , I naively shopped around for the best deal I could AND GOT TAKEN.  </li>
            <li> And, it was more reasonably priced at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I own a green Harris houndstooth, my folks are from Cork, I have a copy of my family sword on my wall, I think that Joyce&#x27;s \\&quot;Portrait\\&quot; is one of the greatest short novels ever, along with Conrad&#x27;s \\&quot;Heart of Darkness,\\&quot; and I like my Tullamore neat, in a snifter.</li>
            <li> As often as I&#x27;ve tested this, I still think it smells like Cool Water, a scent I&#x27;ve never cared for either -- matter of fact</li>
            <li> As someone had pointed out, GIT stands a class apart from cool water.</li>
            <li> true here.  </li>
            <li> DONNOT compare this to cool water cause cool water isn&#x27;t even close to this.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty excited to use this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The last one I really love in Creed Love in White (for women), while Creed Love in Black(for women,also)[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I liked a lot of the back story about the cologne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pricey but 100% worth it, this will forever be a staple for me.</li>
            <li> but worth of money</li>
            <li> If you buy it from a third seller, it is at your own risks.</li>
            <li> fragrance has a lot of apparent similarities to Davidoff coolwater (as most people are quick to point out).</li>
            <li> I own about 30 different colognes and some ladies at work seem to enjoy asking what I am wearing on any particular day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of the bottle, you get a heavy dose (and the Creed nozzles are one of a kind) of the beautiful blend of floral, herbal, and woodsy notes with minimal change during the drydown.  </li>
            <li> Based on some of the reviews it sounds like those that say it has no staying power, it doesn&#x27;t smell right,</li>
            <li> The price was totally right for a Creed product.</li>
            <li> I love sweet stuff just like the next woman but come on, maybe it was my body chmeistry.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the only way for me to accurately describe how good Irish Tweed is and how well it wears:</li>
            <li> I would also warn that if you do really like the smell at first (Cool Water) try it out for a day or two.</li>
            <li> Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed is the best gentleman&#x27;s  fragrance made.  </li>
            <li> To this day, Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed stands out as one of greatest fragrances of all time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Irish Tweed is VERY unique, complex, fresh, slightly earthy and I agree, the best way to describe it is you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on what you are smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Green Irish Tweed strikes the perfect balance between fresh and masculine, with just the right hint of sweet.  </li>
            <li> SOOOOO with that being said, little boys stay in your lane dont ruin Creeds good name.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this, I received and it said Toilet Water on the back, lol..  </li>
            <li> but I know my next bottle is not coming from the internet at a discount as I liked getting compliments for this particular scent and</li>
            <li> So they pay the huge markups and by them directly from Creed when if they did their homework and investigated the site they&#x27;d realize they could have saved hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> There is also a reason why you should spray (or dab if not a spray) on the back of your hand once you&#x27;ve narrowed the selection to a couple: you want to make sure it works WITH you.</li>
            <li> /out first trying it</li>
            <li> Most likely you are buying stock that authorized dealers/distributors have rotated out.</li>
            <li> Most likely you are buying stock that authorized dealers/distributors have rotated out.</li>
            <li> The Creed rep told me their colognes actually get BETTER with age, they don&#x27;t have a shelf life, so to speak, so that wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  </li>
            <li> Hey, you win because at least it wasn&#x27;t expensive!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hey, you win because at least it wasn&#x27;t expensive!&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty spot on.</li>
            <li> But a lot of people will not be able to tell if you are wearing the $40 perfume or the $160 perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Also, irrespective of the comparison, and having accepted that the GIT is a class apart, it is still low on value.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more when needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as robust as I remember it, especially on the top notes</li>
            <li> /&gt;While GIT offers fantastic flexibility - can be worn during any season, for any event, and day or night</li>
            <li> bottling and packaging are first class</li>
            <li> There is a reason why when shopping for fragrances a good store has coffee beans and they &#x27;air out&#x27; a test spray before letting you smell (usually a few minutes).</li>
            <li> Even though I love this line Creed is only for certain people.</li>
            <li> If you have worn Cool Water for years, then I can understand how you might compare this to that at first, but for anyone who has tried GIT and then tried Cool Water, there would be a big difference.</li>
            <li> but, it smells a bit common and honestly, a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> Beware, it doesn&#x27;t smell good from this store and the smell (thankfully) only last about an hour ...</li>
            <li> &quot; I was expecting something earthy and dank, peaty and leathery, a bit like Quorum or Devin, only better -- something that would convince me that I really AM a country squire out of a Donleavy novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because it &#x27;wears with time&#x27;, in other words it gently and nicely changes notes the longer you wear it</li>
            <li> then theorized that maybe these other places selling \\&quot;genuine, 100% authentic, satisfaction guaranteed\\&quot; Creed are buying stock that got old from an authorized source.  </li>
            <li> The price/value on the surface is not good - but can you place a value on creating a more confident and a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; you..??  </li>
            <li> The price/value on the surface is not good - but can you place a value on creating a more confident and a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; you..??  </li>
            <li> When you see [...] selling Creed, I&#x27;m fairly certain they aren&#x27;t an authorized seller nor did they receive their stock from Creed.</li>
            <li> When you see [...] selling Creed, I&#x27;m fairly certain they aren&#x27;t an authorized seller nor did they receive their stock from Creed.</li>
            <li> This is purely for the Amazon-sold bottle which comes and goes and dips and rises in price (140-160 USD).</li>
            <li> Certainly the price is a factor, too, and that will affect the reviews here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure quality.  </li>
            <li> This is like many other higher end luxury merchandise.</li>
            <li> This is like many other higher end luxury merchandise.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t speak to the actual scent as anyone interested in this product will be familiar with it.</li>
            <li> This is the one Im ordering next, this one smells kind of sweet while Green Irish Tweed smells more robust, manly and very sensual.</li>
            <li> body &#x27;chemistry&#x27; has as much to do with the fragrance and &#x27;staying power&#x27; as the ingredients of it.</li>
            <li> such cheap prices?</li>
            <li> Why such cheap prices?</li>
            <li> We must remember that we&#x27;re going to be wearing this stuff on our skin for hours and skin is very porous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really claim one way or another on that.</li>
            <li> they is all kinds of information on the internet to see if it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t be real creed imo.</li>
            <li> that whole \\&quot;oceanic\\&quot; thing turns me off.  </li>
            <li> Just a spray or two would stay on you the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I can attest that if you by the Amazon stock, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> It has continuously evolved and it admittedly does not project much anymore.</li>
            <li> If your going to spend this much for a cologne go into a department store and purchase it there.</li>
            <li> Thanks,  RaJuR Music on the Web</li>
            <li> The GIT turned out to be the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know the difference between the real one and the counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I thought the fragrance would be much richer than what I receive.</li>
            <li> Maybe what I received was not the real thing.</li>
            <li> Ordered through amazon after doing some research and reading reviews to see if this was the real thing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to sell a knockoff, don&#x27;t try to deceive people with it; call it something different, put it in a different bottle, and call it your own.  </li>
            <li> While casting no aspersions on Amazon, to that I say:  Please read the above authorized retailer list from Creed&#x27;s own website, check who you&#x27;re buying it from, then ask yourself if they&#x27;re actually on that list.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s pretty stunning but not worth</li>
            <li> It does smell nice but last only a couple of hours ....</li>
            <li> I have no regrets making the purchase at a department store and paying full retail price.  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets making the purchase at a department store and paying full retail price.  </li>
            <li> mean it&#x27;s nice to feel a bit cultured when putting on a cologne with such an interesting story.</li>
            <li> Still strong and lasts long.  </li>
            <li> They are that unique and different.</li>
            <li> After receiving and comparing the bottle using photos of other bottles it appears to be authentic.</li>
            <li> bought this after owning the original from norstrom,this item is a Arab store in the middle east ,that had it on there shelf</li>
            <li> Very clean smelling scent that can be worn everywhere, smells simple at first but becomes more complex as you catch whiffs of it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> After all, if you&#x27;re reading this, you are here to pay Amazon half off the list price of the white market good.</li>
            <li> If you end up with an EdT of Irish Tweed, you might just have a bottle of Cool Water since Creed doesn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li> If you end up with an EdT of Irish Tweed, you might just have a bottle of Cool Water since Creed doesn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li> I cannot put my finger on it, but the cologne does not smell quite the same as when purchased full price in the dept store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who has worn Creed GIT for a lengthy enough period of time would never compare it to Cool Water.</li>
            <li> Please pay a little more and get the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please pay a little more and get the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My new signature fragrance!</li>
            <li> The one review I remember reading that was pretty accurate compared it to a ridiculously over priced bottle of Cool Water.</li>
            <li> There would be no need to get rid of older stock and replace it with new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne smells decent.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was one with the older sprayer.</li>
            <li> As I said, these bottles of GIT are overstock and have the older sprayer which explains the reduced price.</li>
            <li> and it is 100 percent Green Irish Tweed which I have used and loved for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I need to buy another cologne, I will give these guys a try again because they handled the issue very professionally and fast.</li>
            <li> This is what the fragrance really smells like, and is often drastically different from what you get from sniffing the nozzle or putting the liquid right under your nose.</li>
            <li> Although I had to pay a fortune for that little bottle, I fell completely in love with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too formal for most people.</li>
            <li> There are a few that I really love in particular, they include:</li>
            <li> Sorry for others that may have had a problem, but for me this was a great savings and will continue to buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Better, spray on the areas you will wear it, never rub it in, and walk around 30-mins before dropping a few hundred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Paying anything beyond that for this cologne is honestly just pretentious.</li>
            <li> Most recently a few friend</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth trying once and hating me for it) which makes sense since the supposed middle notes are iris and violet leaf.</li>
            <li> It is a long lasting scent so don&#x27;t go spray crazy,but make sure to spay on your body and not your clothes.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s either a lesser desirable batch or otherwise an older stock where the really strong shimmering fresh top notes (lemon and verbena) (that unfortunately was copied long ago by Cool Water)</li>
            <li> Cool Water costs 100 dollars less, and smells almost exactly like this.  </li>
            <li> (for those who own this fragrance know what I mean..</li>
            <li> I knew I was taking a risk due to the cheap price, but the scent isn&#x27;t even close.  </li>
            <li> It is a new me.  </li>
            <li> I understand why this blend has such a huge following.  </li>
            <li> bottle -- with its classic Creed &#x27;Flask&#x27; Design is a classy touch to anyones</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to be made fun of by your friends for a bottle of toilet</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to see someone in the morning and receive a \\&quot;wow, you smell good - what is that?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Very old stock.</li>
            <li> None of these merchants are being honest and telling you their products are fake right up front, are they?  </li>
            <li> None of these merchants are being honest and telling you their products are fake right up front, are they?  </li>
            <li> This, of course, creates something very much different than what many have grown used to - don&#x27;t ever expect Irish Tweed or any Creed product to be like anything else or &#x27;hit&#x27; you the same way.</li>
            <li> the term they and other higher end fragrances have chosen for the higher concentration EdP (Eau de Parfum).</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on other sites it seems that many others have had the same results from this batch.</li>
            <li> Additionally, smelling a fragrance this way is misleading because that&#x27;s usually not at all how it smells when it mixes with the air.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable how many comments I have received from this cologne.</li>
            <li> However, when it comes down to it, Green Irish Tweed would fit right into the $39-$59 range just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a decent collection of top shelf cologne and this one has received by the far the least acknowledgment from my peers.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 year old bottle of Creed Silver Mountain Water that smells exactly the same as when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I did a single spray on my right wrist</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant to buy at this price, but hey, product turned out to be genuine.  </li>
            <li> But bear in mind Terre d&#x27;Hermes, due to its chemical composition (a hefty dose of Iso-E Super molecule and how it works with your nose) is basically olfactory crack.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see Creed being sold by discount fragrance sites.</li>
            <li> that you&#x27;ve never tried on yourself, even if ordered directly from Creed, you are rolling the dice and hoping it works with you.</li>
            <li> If Creed doesn&#x27;t distribute product directly to unauthorized retailers, where are their bottles coming from?  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to Creed when I was a child ( i am 26 years old now) and hadnt seen it since then .</li>
            <li> I actually got a sample and wore almost the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is old?</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne early December for a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much remember now, but something about how it was created for a Hollywood starlet in the 50s or 60s and that it was British.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fantastic, no different in smell and stronger than my last bottle with same longevity.</li>
            <li> Thought it may have been an old batch,  which happens at time,  </li>
            <li> - what is the old expression, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for..&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> the fragrance isn&#x27;t even close to the authentic Green Irish Tweed by Creed.</li>
            <li> It only comes in Millésime: the term they and other higher end fragrances have chosen for the higher concentration EdP (Eau de Parfum).</li>
            <li> The product is genuine but clearly left over grey market goods meant to be sold abroad (it looks like the Middle East).</li>
            <li> If you find it at a department store and like the smell, I would just caution you to try it out for a day and see if it lasts long enough to be worth the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only seen Creed in high end department stores (</li>
            <li> Green Irish Tweed has a reputation that a dignified ,mature, sexy male should wear.</li>
            <li> Not the only red flag, but certainly one of them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes, you read it correctly, Creed Green Irish Tweed was originally created for actor Cary Grant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought it directly from amazon, not a 3rd party seller on amazon.</li>
            <li> It is in fact real and smells as expected.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people buy Green Irish Tweed, when everyone will think you&#x27;re wearing Cool Water.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and never get tired of the smell.</li>
            <li> A little strong when first sprayed , but later after the dry down</li>
            <li> I have always wore \\&quot;top brands\\&quot; i.e. Polo green &amp; black, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, etc</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems noted by other reviewers; I&#x27;ve purchased this product at Nieman and this is exactly the same thing.  </li>
            <li> is the official word directly from Creed&#x27;s website:  \\&quot;In the U.S., Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and their websites, select Saks Fifth Avenue stores, select Nordstrom stores, select Bloomingdale&#x27;s stores, the CREED boutique at 794 Madison Avenue in New York City (1-877-CREED 44), CREED&#x27;s official online store, a handful of independent boutiques across America carefully selected by CREED, including Bluemercury, Joe Brand, Cos Bar and Fred Segal, and, in Canada, Holt Renfrew and Ogilvy</li>
            <li> I see are labeled as EdT (Eau de Toilet) - no way and steer clear of those.</li>

            <li> But the sour powdery basenote of ambergris largely remains.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not satisfied with their product, they simply apologize and offer you a full refund -- simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> , I use it pretty heavily, two sprays to the chest, one to the stomach, one on each wrist (then rub from my inner elbow up the bicep to each arm)</li>
            <li> and I can definitely still smell it distinctly, which means my nose hasn&#x27;t gotten acclimated to the scent at all unlike my usual go-to colognes.</li>
            <li> Green Irish Tweed was the first purchased.  </li>
            <li> Same can be said about a Rolex or any other high end product.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by another reviewer, it does say Toilet Water PGS but thorough research revealed that it is common for fragrances sold in many other countries.</li>
            <li> I guaranteed it&#x27;ll smell different on me unless we are talking about the very common, overpowering $50 bottles that are designed to smell the same on everyone - opposite of what fine, traditional parfums want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It certainly did not smell like my last bottle of Green Irish Tweed.</li>
            <li> Out one evening at the Elephant Bar in San Bernardino, casually having a cocktail at the bar, a very sexy lady sat down next to me and began chatting with me.</li>
            <li> Creed is a French company and never made Toilet Water nor would they spell it in english.  </li>
            <li> things considered, I highly recommend adding Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed to any collection.  </li>

            <li> A truly one-of-a-kind fragrance that cannot be compared to any other fragrance - yes, there are similarities to other fragrances, but really, there is no substitute nor comparison to GIT.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grey market from the Middle East, but the same quality as the stuff from authorized retailers.</li>
            <li> , personally I have a real issue with being sold a fake and told it&#x27;s the real thing.  </li>

            <li> etc. have picked up some &#x27;old&#x27; bottles or just not familiar with Creed.</li>
            <li> My advice would be to not waste $140 on the fake cologne and just drop the extra money if you want to experience real GIT.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll find that pretty much every fragrance sold on Amazon has a few people leaving reviews claiming it&#x27;s fake, that&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t understand how olfactory fatigue works.</li>

            <li> However, keeping my faith in Amazon I finally bought a 4 oz from Amazon for less than what I paid at NM for 1/4 the size.</li>
            <li> It is really unique and trying to describe it in words, especially in writing, is very difficult.</li>
            <li> I hope I have money to buy the real one, but since there is a lot of fake on the internet, I rather buy a generic version of it, and it smells great!I wonders</li>
            <li> the U.S., Creed only has a few authorized distributors.  </li>

            <li> &quot; I&#x27;d think differently, but if you want something really green and tweedy, take my advice -- go for Quorum if you like a tobacco note, or Devin if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Creed Green Irish Tweed Cologne&#x27;... which I must wear around her, since she bought another bottle a month ago...</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.  </li>
            <li> You have got to be careful who you buy this from.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t some propaganda - you can visit the house of Creed, which is one of the few commissioned houses left.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting the top notes, but not the middle and base notes.</li>
            <li> Up to that point, I had already amassed  a vast collection of designer fragrances and a few &amp;#34;hybrids&amp;#34; or borderline niche, i.e. Tom Ford&#x27;s Noir and Grey Vetiver, but no true niche fragrances.  </li>

            <li> This product is a fake and doesn&#x27;t smell like a real Creed.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure where Green Irish Tweed is made</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, some people are fine with buying cologne they know is not real when the price is right, but what would happen if you got sick or had a bad reaction to what you put on?  </li>
            <li> quite a few others sell discounted bottles of Creed due to the fact of shelf life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle and lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li> so was I and the price was half than at the store</li>
            <li> I found, on line, that you were selling it for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re not, chances are EXTREMELY high that you got a fake.  </li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re not, chances are EXTREMELY high that you got a fake.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but it is my new fragrance .</li>
            <li> Upon dry down there is a difference although still subtle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how Amazon got to sell this product, but agree with other comments that Amazon wouldn&#x27;t be dealing in \\&quot;knock-offs\\&quot; otherwise it would harm their reputation and business.  </li>
            <li> Irish Tweed is very complex and you will never smell anything like it elsewhere.</li>

            <li> , so I got on the phone, called the Creed Boutique, and asked the Creed representative a few questions since the Creed that I purchased WASN&#x27;T from an authorized retailer:  </li>
            <li> Few days of use</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this cologne for a discounted price because you will receive a bottle of discounted waste.  </li>
            <li> - I would pitch that it is not an everyday scent.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> dry down it translates to an expensive smelling, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot; inducing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard-earned money by just giving it to dishonest merchants.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now something for everyone selling all those fake Creeds on eBay and even here on Amazon:  ENOUGH WITH</li>

            <li> Would it replace my usual of Terre d&#x27;Hermes?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was introduced to Creed several years ago by my personal shopper at Neiman Marcus. I have only seen Creed in high end department stores (e.g. Neiman Marcus, Harrods and now some Nordstroms) and boutiques. Last I checked Harrods and Neiman won&#x27;t sell online (but Creed online boutique will). I was surprised to see Creed being sold by discount fragrance sites. But, there is a reason you &#x27;think&#x27; you are saving $100-$150.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any fragrance, Creed will &#x27;wilt&#x27; with age. Don&#x27;t buy a bottle and expect it to smell the same in a year or two as the day you picked it up. Especially, higher end Extraits and EdPs. Based on some of the reviews it sounds like those that say it has no staying power, it doesn&#x27;t smell right, etc. have picked up some &#x27;old&#x27; bottles or just not familiar with Creed. There is also the body chemistry variable that goes for any fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, the way some are comparing it to low end colognes du jour that I haven&#x27;t looked at in over 10-years rather than a line in a similar price range like Chanel Exclusifs tells me that some are looking for and expecting something very different. Creed is the only one I know of that uses a very traditional process hand picking ingredients and making by hand. This, of course, creates something very much different than what many have grown used to - don&#x27;t ever expect Irish Tweed or any Creed product to be like anything else or &#x27;hit&#x27; you the same way. I find this very appealing. This isn&#x27;t some propaganda - you can visit the house of Creed, which is one of the few commissioned houses left. They will make you a custom fragrance - just bring the Centurion with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t compare Creed to anything but themselves. They are that unique and different. I am a fan of Chanel Exclusifs as well, but there is NO WAY to compare them. They are both great in their own way, but both take on their own house&#x27;s signature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed several have mentioned something to the effect of \\&quot;I can&#x27;t put my finger on it\\&quot; - that&#x27;s the perfect way to describe any Creed fragrance. Irish Tweed is very complex and you will never smell anything like it elsewhere. It is really unique and trying to describe it in words, especially in writing, is very difficult. I can tell you that I receive a lot of compliments on it and because it &#x27;wears with time&#x27;, in other words it gently and nicely changes notes the longer you wear it and it works with your body chemistry it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to see someone in the morning and receive a \\&quot;wow, you smell good - what is that?\\&quot; then later in the day see the same person \\&quot;Did you change colognes? I think I like this one better than what you had on this morning.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irish Tweed is VERY unique, complex, fresh, slightly earthy and I agree, the best way to describe it is you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on what you are smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compliments, the &#x27;repeat smells&#x27; (people catching a whiff, stopping what they are doing, ask what I am wearing and leaning in for another smell or two) and the \\&quot;you must be wearing something different\\&quot; is so common, that&#x27;s the only way for me to accurately describe how good Irish Tweed is and how well it wears: ON ME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your body &#x27;chemistry&#x27; has as much to do with the fragrance and &#x27;staying power&#x27; as the ingredients of it. There is a reason why when shopping for fragrances a good store has coffee beans and they &#x27;air out&#x27; a test spray before letting you smell (usually a few minutes). There is also a reason why you should spray (or dab if not a spray) on the back of your hand once you&#x27;ve narrowed the selection to a couple: you want to make sure it works WITH you. Better, spray on the areas you will wear it, never rub it in, and walk around 30-mins before dropping a few hundred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this or any other fragrance online that you&#x27;ve never tried on yourself, even if ordered directly from Creed, you are rolling the dice and hoping it works with you. I&#x27;ve never considered buyingan unknown fragrance online even if I think it smells great on someone else. I guaranteed it&#x27;ll smell different on me unless we are talking about the very common, overpowering $50 bottles that are designed to smell the same on everyone - opposite of what fine, traditional parfums want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I describe the complexity, freshness and uniqueness of Irish Tweed goes for all Creeds I have tried. Not all of them work with me nor will all of them work for you. So unless you are a past Irish Tweed user and know it works with you, you may not want to role the dice w/out first trying it somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Online, some of the Irish Tweeds (and other Creed products) I see are labeled as EdT (Eau de Toilet) - no way and steer clear of those. It only comes in Mill&amp;eacute;sime: the term they and other higher end fragrances have chosen for the higher concentration EdP (Eau de Parfum). If you end up with an EdT of Irish Tweed, you might just have a bottle of Cool Water since Creed doesn&#x27;t make it. Creed only offers a few EdTs. Irish Tweed is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: don&#x27;t let the concentration ranking name of Eau de Parfum throw you off - has nothing to do with whether it was made for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why such cheap prices? Could be counterfeits, which are common, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll see this tolerated by Amazon. This is like many other higher end luxury merchandise. Most likely you are buying stock that authorized dealers/distributors have rotated out. It is particularly problematic for something like Creed that is delicate and deteriorates with age. So, like buying a discounted Panerai or Cartier watch with no warranty, the trade-off here is age. When you see [...] selling Creed, I&#x27;m fairly certain they aren&#x27;t an authorized seller nor did they receive their stock from Creed. For all you know, it is 5-years old and has been kept in a 110F warehouse in Arizona (randomly chosen state - no reflection on any seller should any be located there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to buy a fragrance you haven&#x27;t tried before from a non-authorized dealer, I&#x27;m not sure I would use this as a forum to give it a bad review.someone else.

            <li> The most wonderful scent. This was Cary Grants favorite scent. If its was good enuf for him it&#x27;s good enuf for me. This is the best scent. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Cool Water costs 100 dollars less, and smells almost exactly like this.  Women can&#x27;t tell the difference.  I can&#x27;t believe people buy Green Irish Tweed, when everyone will think you&#x27;re wearing Cool Water.  That&#x27;s like paying 80 dollars for a Chanel that smells like a 5 dollar can of Axe Body Spray...stupid.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Just as good as at Neiman / Bergdorf but way more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> After receiving and comparing the bottle using photos of other bottles it appears to be authentic. Unfortunately it does not have the longevity that many claim. Last 5 of the batch number were 14A01. After reading reviews on other sites it seems that many others have had the same results from this batch.</li>
            <li> Real, genuine Green Irish Tweed from Creed is a wonderful fragrance.  This one-star rating is NOT for the fragrance.  THAT deserves a five-star rating.  The one-star rating is denoted as a warning:  B-U-Y-E-R  B-E-W-A-R-E!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the U.S., Creed only has a few authorized distributors.  I learned this THE HARD WAY by not buying from one of them.  And can you guess what I got?  According to two independent Creed salespeople who have worked with Creed for a number of years, A COUNTERFEIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being inexperienced with the world of fragrance, which I have since learned is rife with bootleggers, I naively shopped around for the best deal I could AND GOT TAKEN.  Now I know better, which is why I&#x27;m passing this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the official word directly from Creed&#x27;s website:  \\&quot;In the U.S., Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and their websites, select Saks Fifth Avenue stores, select Nordstrom stores, select Bloomingdale&#x27;s stores, the CREED boutique at 794 Madison Avenue in New York City (1-877-CREED 44), CREED&#x27;s official online store, a handful of independent boutiques across America carefully selected by CREED, including Bluemercury, Joe Brand, Cos Bar and Fred Segal, and, in Canada, Holt Renfrew and Ogilvy carry guaranteed, authentic CREED products and stand by them proudly.  You can be confident when shopping these retailers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, take a good look at that list and notice how they themselves say, \\&quot;You can be CONFIDENT when shopping these retailers.\\&quot;  By saying that, do you think they&#x27;re making reference to all the \\&quot;other\\&quot; people who sell Creed who aren&#x27;t on that list?  They&#x27;re dropping more than a clue.  They have a lot more to say about this on the Creed Boutique website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I got on the phone, called the Creed Boutique, and asked the Creed representative a few questions since the Creed that I purchased WASN&#x27;T from an authorized retailer:  If Creed doesn&#x27;t distribute product directly to unauthorized retailers, where are their bottles coming from?  Their answer:  THEY DON&#x27;T KNOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t know?  Hold it.  NOT the answer you want to hear after you&#x27;ve just purchased an expensive but curiously discounted bottle from one of the unauthorized sources.  (They also told me that Creed doesn&#x27;t go on sale, hence the need, I think, to be suspicious when you spot those discounted prices.  Not the only red flag, but certainly one of them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then theorized that maybe these other places selling \\&quot;genuine, 100% authentic, satisfaction guaranteed\\&quot; Creed are buying stock that got old from an authorized source.  Ah, nope.  The Creed rep told me their colognes actually get BETTER with age, they don&#x27;t have a shelf life, so to speak, so that wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  There would be no need to get rid of older stock and replace it with new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is this:  Although I didn&#x27;t know this when I purchased what was advertised as a genuine Creed, I thought I was being a savvy shopper by not paying full price and getting it from an unauthorized source, but in the end all that happened was that I got ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, some people are fine with buying cologne they know is not real when the price is right, but what would happen if you got sick or had a bad reaction to what you put on?  Counterfeiters don&#x27;t abide by any governmental agencies which regulate what they are allowed to put into their products.  Who would you hold accountable?  I read an article that said the ingredients that have been found in counterfeits are downright dangerous and at the very least disgusting, for instance, car antifreeze, cat urine.  (I&#x27;ve also read that some of the money from these false goods goes to fund terrorist organizations and other organized crime.)  We must be wise about this.  We must remember that we&#x27;re going to be wearing this stuff on our skin for hours and skin is very porous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although one reviewer is actually recommending that you purchase a counterfeitbecause it&#x27;s inexpensive (????), personally I have a real issue with being sold a fake and told it&#x27;s the real thing.  Listen, what kind of people are we dealing with?  None of these merchants are being honest and telling you their products are fake right up front, are they?  No, you have to buy it first, then find out on your own.  Meanwhile, they take your money and feign ignorance.  Or, worse yet, when confronted, swear up and down that what they sold you is real, then get furiously angry at you to the point of treats that you even suggested they sold you a fake.  Their contrived, flick-of-the-switch anger gives them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest merchants don&#x27;t need to resort to crazy, burst-of-emotion diversionary tactics.  If you&#x27;re not satisfied with their product, they simply apologize and offer you a full refund -- simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me crazy, but I think there are some people out there who may feel as I do.  I personally don&#x27;t care to give my valuable money in exchange for something worthless.  That&#x27;s deceptive, it&#x27;s dishonest, and it&#x27;s stealing.  If you&#x27;re going to sell a knockoff, don&#x27;t try to deceive people with it; call it something different, put it in a different bottle, and call it your own.  Oh, then tell them what you put in it and that, since you&#x27;re a dishonest merchant, you don&#x27;t have to obey anyone&#x27;s laws.  Go ahead, put THAT on your skin!  Hey, you win because at least it wasn&#x27;t expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer doubted whether Amazon would tolerate someone affiliated with their site selling fakes.  While casting no aspersions on Amazon, to that I say:  Please read the above authorized retailer list from Creed&#x27;s own website, check who you&#x27;re buying it from, then ask yourself if they&#x27;re actually on that list.  If they&#x27;re not, chances are EXTREMELY high that you got a fake.  Yes, more likely than not what you got is a fake.  Amazon uses other sellers to fill these orders.  They don&#x27;t know or check where the sellers originally got their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know whether what you purchased is real or fake, take it to an authorized Creed retailer and compare it to the real one like I did.  Some fakes smell somewhat close to the untrained and, as mine was, ignorant nose, but someone who works with it every day, like a Creed representative, will be able to tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not telling anyone what to do, but I learned the hard way.  Don&#x27;t waste your hard-earned money by just giving it to dishonest merchants.  Please pay a little more and get the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now something for everyone selling all those fake Creeds on eBay and even here on Amazon:  ENOUGH WITH ALL THE CHEATING!!!because it&#x27;s inexpensive (????), personally I have a real issue with being sold a fake and told it&#x27;s the real thing.

            <li> I went into the store and smelled this cologne. I was introduced to Creed when I was a child ( i am 26 years old now) and hadnt seen it since then . Even though I love this line Creed is only for certain people. There are a few that I really love in particular, they include: Creed Green Irish Tweed(duh) and Creed Silver Mountain Water, this one smells like a man and woman would be able to wear it. I actually got a sample and wore almost the whole thing. This is the one Im ordering next, this one smells kind of sweet while Green Irish Tweed smells more robust, manly and very sensual. The last one I really love in Creed Love in White (for women), while Creed Love in Black(for women,also)[[ASIN:B000KMDQX6 Creed Green Irish Tweed By Creed Eau-de-toilette Spray for Men, 4-Fluid Ounce]] smells nice its almost too Sweet!!!! I love sweet stuff just like the next woman but come on, maybe it was my body chmeistry. People must remember while buying cologne that body chemistry plays a part and while it may smell one way on one person. It will smell different on you and the way your made up. Green Irish Tweed has a reputation that a dignified ,mature, sexy male should wear. SOOOOO with that being said, little boys stay in your lane dont ruin Creeds good name.</li>
            <li> Green Irish Tweed there is no substitute. Arrived quickly, well packaged and 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems noted by other reviewers; I&#x27;ve purchased this product at Nieman and this is exactly the same thing.  I&#x27;m not sure how Amazon got to sell this product, but agree with other comments that Amazon wouldn&#x27;t be dealing in \\&quot;knock-offs\\&quot; otherwise it would harm their reputation and business.  Sorry for others that may have had a problem, but for me this was a great savings and will continue to buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the real thing, smells wonderful on my boyfriend.  He gets compliments on it everytime he puts it on. I was worried about it being a knockoff and was glad to see it was not.</li>
            <li> Been using it for the past 5 years.  Great scent.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of a great product. Scent is memorable and has become a \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent that I enjoy wearing.</li>
            <li> I cannot put my finger on it, but the cologne does not smell quite the same as when purchased full price in the dept store. Maybe it is old? Not too sure, but I know my next bottle is not coming from the internet at a discount as I liked getting compliments for this particular scent and now not once has someone said they liked it. If anything I am wondering if once you are wearing it, it stinks and people follow mom&#x27;s advice: \\&quot;if you have nothing nice to say to someone....\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, and met all expectations.</li>
            <li> My son-in-law loved it!  And, it was more reasonably priced at Amazon.  Smells great!  Would buy it again.  This was a gift.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is amazing! It&#x27;s subtle and lasts the entire day. Compliments every time I wear it.  It&#x27;s the fragrance I choose to wear 98% of the time.</li>
            <li> Awesome  he was very happy with it so was I and the price was half than at the store thanks</li>
            <li> The GIT from Tuccini is really good and looks genuine. It has a special code written at t bottom of t bottle</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne early December for a Christmas gift.  By Dec. 24th, the 7-day return policy has expired.  However, there was a problem with the item so I contacted Customer Service and they refunded me my money with no problem at all.  When I need to buy another cologne, I will give these guys a try again because they handled the issue very professionally and fast.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews online calling this \\&quot;One of the Best Colognes under the radar\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;The cologne that George Clooney Wears\\&quot;. I liked a lot of the back story about the cologne. I don&#x27;t much remember now, but something about how it was created for a Hollywood starlet in the 50s or 60s and that it was British. I mean slap a $150 price tag on those two facts and I was pretty excited to use this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the hype was not even close to met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne smells decent. But, it reminds me of one of the many dime store colognes I would find on my brother&#x27;s dresser about 15 years ago. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but, it smells a bit common and honestly, a bit cheap. The one review I remember reading that was pretty accurate compared it to a ridiculously over priced bottle of Cool Water. That&#x27;s pretty spot on. I&#x27;ve got a decent collection of top shelf cologne and this one has received by the far the least acknowledgment from my peers. I would also warn that if you do really like the smell at first (Cool Water) try it out for a day or two. I&#x27;m happy if I can smell it after an hour or two, let alone 4-5 hours into the evening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did order this cologne offline and I&#x27;ve read some reviews that point out contrasting results with department stores products. I can&#x27;t really claim one way or another on that. If you find it at a department store and like the smell, I would just caution you to try it out for a day and see if it lasts long enough to be worth the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean it&#x27;s nice to feel a bit cultured when putting on a cologne with such an interesting story. However, when it comes down to it, Green Irish Tweed would fit right into the $39-$59 range just fine. Paying anything beyond that for this cologne is honestly just pretentious.</li>
            <li> Many months ago I bought a 1 oz. bottle of GIT from Neiman Marcus. Although I had to pay a fortune for that little bottle, I fell completely in love with the fragrance. When the time came to buy another, I researched all over the web for a good deal. The stories of fake perfume sold by many online retailers worried me. However, keeping my faith in Amazon I finally bought a 4 oz from Amazon for less than what I paid at NM for 1/4 the size. And I am so glad that I made the purchase here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon delivered ahead of schedule. The fragrance is fantastic, no different in smell and stronger than my last bottle with same longevity. As mentioned by another reviewer, it does say Toilet Water PGS but thorough research revealed that it is common for fragrances sold in many other countries. The lot number indicates that this is from 2011. Few days of use and I have already received many compliments on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase reinforced my belief that there is nothing to worry about if the product is sold and shipped by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Greatest smell, nicer than D&amp;G i had.&lt;br /&gt;Smell dissapear in around 4 or 5 hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;Girls love it. Not me! the fragance.&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Women like it.  A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Yes, you read it correctly, Creed Green Irish Tweed was originally created for actor Cary Grant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally picked up based off cologne forum reviews as I went looking for a spring/summer scent (Polo Double Black for winter/classy events and Jack Black&#x27;s Black Label for Fall).  I favor French Milled Verbena Soap(s) so once I read that Green Irish Tweed had verbena I thought it would make a nice match/blend well; I was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has base notes of citrus and sandalwood, a mixture of verbena, violet leaves and Florentine iris with sandalwood and ambergris gives a casual/gentlemanly yet classy smell that can be worn 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had more comments from women (and some guys) about what I was wearing, bars, in the gym, random encounters.  It&#x27;s always \\&quot;what is that smell?\\&quot; or \\&quot;You smell great!\\&quot;  Most recently a few friend and I went out and someone outside our group asked me if they could smell me, she said I smelled wonderful, then all my friends wanted to smell me, everyone thought I smelled great (girls and guys).  I&#x27;ll say that it DOES smell great but don&#x27;t forget not all colognes work for everyone but I think this one works for me.  One thing to note, I use it pretty heavily, two sprays to the chest, one to the stomach, one on each wrist (then rub from my inner elbow up the bicep to each arm) and when I go out bar hopping one spray on each side of my neck/behind the ear area but even with that amount it&#x27;s always good compliments never &#x27;eeew way too much&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle -- with its classic Creed &#x27;Flask&#x27; Design is a classy touch to anyones Bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricey but 100% worth it, this will forever be a staple for me.</li>
            <li> Green Irish Tweed is simply the best.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance has stood the test of time and makes you smell like royalty</li>
            <li> Was a bit worried, but pulled the trigger and glad I did.  The one I received is from a 2011 batch.  Still strong and lasts long.  Love how the scent changes as you go about your day.</li>
            <li> Creed is fantastic and this scent is one of the best. I&#x27;ve tried most of the men&#x27;s scents and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> For the person saying that unless you buy from an authorized Creed retailer then it&#x27;s fake doesn&#x27;t have a clue. There are alot of online retailers that sell genuine Creeds. Creed doesn&#x27;t want to get rid of these fakes, because it benefits them by making people become paranoid and making statement like the below poster. So they pay the huge markups and by them directly from Creed when if they did their homework and investigated the site they&#x27;d realize they could have saved hundreds of dollars. Fragrancenet.com, Scentedmonkey.com, Fragrancex.com and quite a few others sell discounted bottles of Creed due to the fact of shelf life. I have a 4 year old bottle of Creed Silver Mountain Water that smells exactly the same as when I bought it. Creeds don&#x27;t age faster and have the same shelf life as any other fragrance. They need to make money in the secondary market and this is where Creeds that are sometimes only a year old go to. Of course Creeds not going to endorse them because they&#x27;re not authorized Creed dealers which probably costs a fortune. Same can be said about a Rolex or any other high end product. Bottom line is that your not going to get any Creed fragrance for $10 an oz (Ebay). If you would happen to get a fake they is all kinds of information on the internet to see if it&#x27;s real. Just don&#x27;t be paranoid and think you have to pay retail prices for something that&#x27;s sold to the mass market. Common sense people.</li>
            <li> Green Irish Tweed By Creed For Men. Millesime Spray 4.0 Oz Great buy money worsted .Use this since 1980 start in Italy.</li>
            <li> Otcdrugsonline is where I purchased it from. Beware, it doesn&#x27;t smell good from this store and the smell (thankfully) only last about an hour ... can&#x27;t be real creed imo.</li>
            <li> I own a green Harris houndstooth, my folks are from Cork, I have a copy of my family sword on my wall, I think that Joyce&#x27;s \\&quot;Portrait\\&quot; is one of the greatest short novels ever, along with Conrad&#x27;s \\&quot;Heart of Darkness,\\&quot; and I like my Tullamore neat, in a snifter. So when I first heard about this legendary stuff I thought \\&quot;Great!\\&quot; I was expecting something earthy and dank, peaty and leathery, a bit like Quorum or Devin, only better -- something that would convince me that I really AM a country squire out of a Donleavy novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No such luck. As often as I&#x27;ve tested this, I still think it smells like Cool Water, a scent I&#x27;ve never cared for either -- matter of fact that whole \\&quot;oceanic\\&quot; thing turns me off.  And the price! Sheesh! Why pay this for a fancy version of something that teenagers buy at Kohl&#x27;s?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if they&#x27;d called this \\&quot;Man of Aran\\&quot; or \\&quot;Rider to the Sea\\&quot; I&#x27;d think differently, but if you want something really green and tweedy, take my advice -- go for Quorum if you like a tobacco note, or Devin if you don&#x27;t. They&#x27;re cheaper, too.</li>
            <li> There was no cap to the bottle. I like the product but it seems unprofessional to not have a cap to go along with the product.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this, I received and it said Toilet Water on the back, lol..  Creed is a French company and never made Toilet Water nor would they spell it in english.  Real Creed will not be sold for under $200, if so, beware, its fake.</li>
            <li> GIT is simply an astounding perfume which opens with a lot of \\&quot;green\\&quot; smell, the smell of ferns and moss, it gives the feeling on being in misty woods.&lt;br /&gt;Upon dry down it translates to an expensive smelling, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot; inducing fragrance. It has very good projection, silage and longevity. Just a spray or two would stay on you the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance has a lot of apparent similarities to Davidoff coolwater (as most people are quick to point out). It is indeed quite similar on the opening. Upon dry down there is a difference although still subtle. As someone had pointed out, GIT stands a class apart from cool water. Cool water is sweeter and more synthetic as compared to GIT. But a lot of people will not be able to tell if you are wearing the $40 perfume or the $160 perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Also, irrespective of the comparison, and having accepted that the GIT is a class apart, it is still low on value.</li>
            <li> bought this after owning the original from norstrom,this item is a Arab store in the middle east ,that had it on there shelf well past it prime,syria,iraq,ua who knows but they should say it came from one of these countries and it is out of date</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a very special person.  He loved it! Will be back for more when needed. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is a fake and doesn&#x27;t smell like a real Creed.  This has been my worst Amazon purchase to date.  Buyer beware!  I knew I was taking a risk due to the cheap price, but the scent isn&#x27;t even close.  It smells like the cologne from Anchor Man \\&quot; Like Bigfoot&#x27;s dick.\\&quot;  Not sure what that smells like, but not pleasant. I can&#x27;t stand it and Amazon wont let me return it.  If you want to waste over $100 than buy this awful knock off.</li>
            <li> This is the only Cologne I wear. Great stuff, I just wish it was cheaper. I have been using this product for many years and never get tired of the smell.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with &amp;#34;Knock-offs&amp;#34; with this type of product, so I was very pleased to see it was the genuine article, so the cost was very good as compared to the big department stores.</li>
            <li> A little strong when first sprayed , but later after the dry down the  scent was remarkable</li>
            <li> I am relieved to say the GIT I bought from Amazon is 100 percent authentic and smells great. The bottle I received was one with the older sprayer. People familiar with Creed know their new sprayers are awesome and spray huge amounts of juice. As I said, these bottles of GIT are overstock and have the older sprayer which explains the reduced price. What matters most is the juice and it is 100 percent Green Irish Tweed which I have used and loved for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This fragrance makes a person smell very clean, and well groomed. It is definitely one of Creed&#x27;s best fragrances. The price on Amazon is great!</li>
            <li> This is purely for the Amazon-sold bottle which comes and goes and dips and rises in price (140-160 USD). The product is genuine but clearly left over grey market goods meant to be sold abroad (it looks like the Middle East). It&#x27;s not as robust as I remember it, especially on the top notes so it&#x27;s either a lesser desirable batch or otherwise an older stock where the really strong shimmering fresh top notes (lemon and verbena) (that unfortunately was copied long ago by Cool Water) is a lot weaker... but still there. So I can attest that if you by the Amazon stock, it&#x27;s the real deal. You&#x27;re not going to be made fun of by your friends for a bottle of toilet water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the scent itself it&#x27;s pretty stunning but not worth the outrageous 300 USD+ price that Creed asks for from traditional consumer avenues in high-end malls and boutique shops. It is a fairly simple scent that is reminiscent of greenery and chewed violet candy (never had violet candy? it&#x27;s worth trying once and hating me for it) which makes sense since the supposed middle notes are iris and violet leaf. I get a ton of longevity from it. I did a single spray on my right wrist and I can definitely still smell it distinctly, which means my nose hasn&#x27;t gotten acclimated to the scent at all unlike my usual go-to colognes. It has continuously evolved and it admittedly does not project much anymore. It clings to the skin. But the sour powdery basenote of ambergris largely remains. What is truly exciting though is the Mysore sandalwood and something distinctly refreshingly woody like rubbing mint leaves on cedar peeking through from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very good. Would it replace my usual of Terre d&#x27;Hermes? Probably not. It&#x27;s a little too formal for most people. But bear in mind Terre d&#x27;Hermes, due to its chemical composition (a hefty dose of Iso-E Super molecule and how it works with your nose) is basically olfactory crack. GIT, in contrast, is a polite date, a client business lunch (in small doses please), or a summer romp in shorts and a linen shirt... in someone else&#x27;s yacht. After all, if you&#x27;re reading this, you are here to pay Amazon half off the list price of the white market good.n small doses please), or a summer romp in shorts and a linen shirt... in someone else&#x27;s yacht. After all, if you&#x27;re reading this, you are here to pay Amazon half off the list price of the white market good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed, this is my absolute worst Amazon purchase to date...in fact it&#x27;s my only bad Amazon purchase ever and it&#x27;s very bad...the fragrance isn&#x27;t even close to the authentic Green Irish Tweed by Creed.</li>
            <li> excellent product. I bought it as a gift for some one close to me. We both love it.&lt;br /&gt;expensive but worth of money</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this cologne for a discounted price because you will receive a bottle of discounted waste.  I am not sure where Green Irish Tweed is made but I am sure it&#x27;s not made in an Arab country.  My bottle has a sticker on the bottom written in Arabic.  My bottle also leaks from the spray stem.  The cologne smells great for about a minute and then looses all scent.  I sprayed about 10 pumps on myself and came into work.  I asked co-workers if they liked my new cologne and the response was, \\&quot;your wearing cologne?\\&quot;.  I own about 30 different colognes and some ladies at work seem to enjoy asking what I am wearing on any particular day.  Since I have been wearing this knock-off of GIT I havent heard one peep from the ladies in the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE beware of the knock-offs!!!!!!!  If your going to spend this much for a cologne go into a department store and purchase it there.</li>
            <li> Fragrance quality was poor. Very old stock.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is so personal so I won&#x27;t speak to the actual scent as anyone interested in this product will be familiar with it. However we were pleased with all aspects of the purchase otherwise.</li>
            <li> Thought it may have been an old batch,  which happens at time,  but it&#x27;s fine.  Last a long time.  Thanks,  RaJuR Music on the Web</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many fragrances, and this is my favorite by far. Immediately after spraying, it is invigorating and very fresh (sort of like grass). As time passes, it smells deeper and warmer -- an \\&quot;mmm.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has worn Creed GIT for a lengthy enough period of time would never compare it to Cool Water. If you have worn Cool Water for years, then I can understand how you might compare this to that at first, but for anyone who has tried GIT and then tried Cool Water, there would be a big difference. It just takes more time than a whiff of each to compare them. Certainly the price is a factor, too, and that will affect the reviews here. Why pay more for something that smells like a cheaper alternative?, is the idea and is understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend a sample vial. Wear it around lots of people, and see how many compliments you get, and try not to consider the price in your evaluation of its quality.</li>
            <li> Never order from this seller. The colonge I ordered was a complete fake! The colonge was suppose to be an engagement gift and I was mailed a fake colonge in the same bottle and packaging as the original. I have even taken the colonge to a specialist, which told me I was given a fake colonge!</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last !!!! All that money for nothing !!! It does smell nice but last only a couple of hours .... I was very excited to get it and so disappointed after using</li>
            <li> Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed is the best gentleman&#x27;s  fragrance made.  It represents class, confidence, and simply put - a gentleman..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About six (6) months ago I made a decision to venture into niche fragrances.  Up to that point, I had already amassed  a vast collection of designer fragrances and a few &amp;#34;hybrids&amp;#34; or borderline niche, i.e. Tom Ford&#x27;s Noir and Grey Vetiver, but no true niche fragrances.  I purchased two (2) Creed fragrances and three (3) Bond No 9 fragrances at the Nordstom&#x27;s in Nashville. Green Irish Tweed was the first purchased.  There is something magical about holding that bottle in your hand the first time... (for those who own this fragrance know what I mean..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the bottle, you get a heavy dose (and the Creed nozzles are one of a kind) of the beautiful blend of floral, herbal, and woodsy notes with minimal change during the drydown.  A truly one-of-a-kind fragrance that cannot be compared to any other fragrance - yes, there are similarities to other fragrances, but really, there is no substitute nor comparison to GIT.  I find that I get 8+ hours longevity from GIT, but close projection/sillage, just beyond arms length for about 4-6 hours.  The &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34; is amazing - every time I have worn this fragrance I have received compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While GIT offers fantastic flexibility - can be worn during any season, for any event, and day or night - I would pitch that it is not an everyday scent.  I am a confident gentleman - when I apply GIT on for those special occasions, the Superman comes out.  It is a new me.  Additionally, I would also suggest that GIT is best suited for a more mature audience (35+) - those that will appreciate the true beauty of this fragrance.  The younger crowd may disagree, but when you get to be my age (and established), you will understand and agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottling and packaging are first class - what is the old expression, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for..&amp;#34;.  Very true here.  The price/value on the surface is not good - but can you place a value on creating a more confident and a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; you..??  I have no regrets making the purchase at a department store and paying full retail price.  I have since discovered several options (and reliable/trustworthy) on eBay that have cut the cost of subsequent Creed purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I highly recommend adding Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed to any collection.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed and I think you will like the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; you once you wear it.  Unleash the &amp;#34;Superman&amp;#34; in you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Green Irish Tweed is 5 stars out of 5 stars.  The first and only time I have given a perfect score.  GIT is perfection..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count... Invest your time rather than wasting your time...true here.

            <li> The best scent ever!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grey market from the Middle East, but the same quality as the stuff from authorized retailers. 100% legitimate. You&#x27;ll find that pretty much every fragrance sold on Amazon has a few people leaving reviews claiming it&#x27;s fake, that&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t understand how olfactory fatigue works. They keep sniffing it in its concentrated form without letting it dissipate, soon enough their nose can&#x27;t detect it anymore so they think it&#x27;s fake. Additionally, smelling a fragrance this way is misleading because that&#x27;s usually not at all how it smells when it mixes with the air. You&#x27;re getting the top notes, but not the middle and base notes. To smell a fragrance, spray some on the wrist or piece of paper. Hold it in front of a fan or AC vent, and smell the air that comes off. This is what the fragrance really smells like, and is often drastically different from what you get from sniffing the nozzle or putting the liquid right under your nose.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable how many comments I have received from this cologne. I have women just walk up to me in public and ask what is that cologne you are wearing. I have always wore \\&quot;top brands\\&quot; i.e. Polo green &amp; black, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, etc but NOTHING has came close to this cologne. It is expensive but it is my new fragrance .</li>
            <li> The GIT turned out to be the real thing. It wears well. In fact, I&#x27;m wearing it today. No one else at work smells as good as I do. The seller did a good job in getting me what I wanted. I would do business with this seller again. The price was totally right for a Creed product.</li>
            <li> The GIT has arrived almost overnight. There are lots of feed back saying that this product is counterfeit. Well, the description inside the box does shows Arabic letters but the smell is perfect. I really don&#x27;t know the difference between the real one and the counterfeit. 2nd time use, my niece told what a great cologne I have. She never said that with my under $110 colognes. There&#x27;s no doubt I will buy this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant to buy at this price, but hey, product turned out to be genuine.  I took a risk and it paid off.</li>
            <li> The smell is great! It is a long lasting scent so don&#x27;t go spray crazy,but make sure to spay on your body and not your clothes. I am just saying if you don&#x27;t own a Creed scent and are just getting into the grown man cologne then start here you can have it on at work or for the office party you won&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> The cologne smells incredible! The price was just as good. Very happy with my purchase. Would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Either this is a fake or Green Irish Tweed is meant to only last 5 minutes. I noticed when I opened the box that the sprayer had been tampered with and that there was greasy residue on the outside of the bottle. This is a fake. My advice would be to not waste $140 on the fake cologne and just drop the extra money if you want to experience real GIT. I&#x27;m giving this fake GIT a one star rating</li>
            <li> I had tested it at Neiman Marcus and liked it but, it was too expensive.  They gave me a test sample to take with me.  I found, on line, that you were selling it for a lot less.  When your bottle arrived, I had three ladies smell both and they, and I agreed it wasn&#x27;t as good as the sample from the store.  There was quite a difference.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was to good to be true and it was correct. I have been purchasing this product for years and have never had a situation like I m in now. The product I was sent smells nothing like what it is supposed to. I do not think I will ever buy anything from Amazon.com again if this is not rectified as this product has surely been tampered with at some point and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt; Ed Moran</li>
            <li> Totally fake. Don&#x27;t waste your time. Smells like horse feces.</li>
            <li> Second order for the same product</li>
            <li> I understand why this blend has such a huge following.  It&#x27;s pure quality.  My new signature fragrance! Can&#x27;t wait to try the rest of the Creed collection.</li>
            <li> My Son is the manager at Women&#x27;s fragrance at South Coast Plaza Ca. / Nordstrom&#x27;s....He bought this fragrance for me at fathers day 5 years ago...3 bottles later it is MY fragrance.&lt;br /&gt; I must have had at least 60-80 compliments on this Cologne throughout the years from women as well as men...Out one evening at the Elephant Bar in San Bernardino, casually having a cocktail at the bar, a very sexy lady sat down next to me and began chatting with me. She said I walked by her in the reception area and my musk was so inviting she just needed to know the man behind the aroma....We talked and drank for about 1 1/2 hours...had dinner together .&lt;br /&gt; The evening was very nice...numbers were exchanged and things have progressed into a friends with benefits relationship.&lt;br /&gt;This allover  &#x27;Creed Green Irish Tweed Cologne&#x27;... which I must wear around her, since she bought another bottle a month ago...&lt;br /&gt;I would say the aroma attracted her but my personality exasperated the things that followed.....she wears channel and Jadore...which is very sexy........Good luck with your experiences......</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT  IS VERY NICE  WITH GOOD QUALITY AND THE PRICE IS THE BEST!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND IT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!!!!</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.  I thought the fragrance would be much richer than what I receive. Maybe what I received was not the real thing.</li>
            <li> I love it. It smells great. It&#x27;s lasted all day. All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> its a great product and i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I do like this cologne quite bit. I wear it on a daily basis. It has a very unique smell and it changes as the top notes goes away and what not. DONNOT compare this to cool water cause cool water isn&#x27;t even close to this. You have got to be careful who you buy this from. I bought it from Amazon itself, not a third seller. If you buy it from a third seller, it is at your own risks. I have had this bottle from Amazon back in 2010 and it is still freaking awesome.</li>
            <li> Now i know what all the hype was about after finally getting to smell GIT. It is truly a beautiful scent and theres nothing like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I bought it directly from amazon, not a 3rd party seller on amazon. I received a 100% authentic creed. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne 9 months on a tip from a lady friend. Since I started wearing this cologne, I&#x27;ve had compliments from women in their sixties to women in their twenties. Even several men have stopped me to ask what I&#x27;m wearing. Unlike others, I find the cologne long lasting even after working out at the gym after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> I think this was not an authentic product.  It certainly did not smell like my last bottle of Green Irish Tweed.</li>
            <li> To this day, Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed stands out as one of greatest fragrances of all time.  It has inspired a slew of imitators and changed the way the industry looks at and produces scents.  Green Irish Tweed strikes the perfect balance between fresh and masculine, with just the right hint of sweet.  I am very familiar with this scent and can confirm that the bottle I received from Amazon is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> Your price is awesome&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and great value!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered through amazon after doing some research and reading reviews to see if this was the real thing. It is in fact real and smells as expected. Very clean smelling scent that can be worn everywhere, smells simple at first but becomes more complex as you catch whiffs of it throughout the day. The sprayer is strong! Use 2 sprays an you&#x27;ll be good. Definitely a scent every guy should have in his rotation of colognes.</li>
            <li> I hope I have money to buy the real one, but since there is a lot of fake on the internet, I rather buy a generic version of it, and it smells great!I wonders how good the real GIT is, I now have lifetime supply of GIT version for 35$.</li>
