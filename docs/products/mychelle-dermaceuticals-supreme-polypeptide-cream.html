            <li>This is an extremely effective skin cream.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really liked it.</li>
            <li>This product feels nice on my skin, does seem to reduce the appearance of fine lines and feels luxurious, good choice, though pricey.</li>
            <li>The Super Polypeptide had an incredible healing effect and caused the scabs and discoloration to go away in about 4 days (and my skin is easily discolored).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cleanliness\\&quot; and has been replaced by three peptides that are supposed to be even more effective:</li>
            <li>but my ex Nadine sure liked it..  </li>
            <li>I attribute this to good genes and clean diet and habits.</li>
            <li>I worked in the health care industry and love this product-</li>
            <li>In a time when the cosmetic industry is flooding us with so called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products, this one stands out and is truly safe.  </li>
            <li>For more information regarding ingredients in cosmetic/skin care, check out the Environmental Working Group website and click on skin care.  </li>
            <li>It gives my skin such a wonderful glow.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The cream is perfect for me for day, night, and overall improving the texture and lessening the lines in my face.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found this product line.</li>
            <li>But I still use many of their products because it seems to not cause problem on my skin</li>
            <li>and I feel okay with them on.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I can see  some difference in my lines,and what really makes me happy is I have had no alergic reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li>so I seem to go through it more often, than I was my cream</li>
            <li>that was more dense.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was more even in tone and diminished spots.</li>
            <li>VERY rich, but never greasy.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon, for providing excellent products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>I was using the Deep Repair cream, which was great, but I wanted something a bit more.  </li>
            <li>cream itself absorbs easily into the skin</li>
            <li>Have found MyChelle polypeptide cream so easy and creamy to apply.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and no bad skin reactions with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>MyChelle has these terms about their products that sound pseudo-sciency, so I recommend people take a grain of salt about their claims.</li>
            <li>like that the scent is light and the product is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish all companies were as consumer friendly as this one is.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this one after trying a sample.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!  </li>
            <li>this cream does a great job of balancing both the dry and oily parts of my face.  </li>
            <li>This works and is a true value.  </li>
            <li>I really like this face cream, I was on the hunt for more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This product is beating back father time in surprising and pleasing ways.  </li>
            <li>This product is one of the most beloved items in my cabinet for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems a tad pricey but is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a terrific product, great natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and have tried many of the products out there I recommend you try the MyChelle line of products.  </li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love their other products, this one is ok.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great for day and evening even in the dry climate of Colorado where I live.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of hydration, and didn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea at all (which is dying a lot).</li>
            <li>but it does make my face feel comfy smooth, and not tight!  </li>
            <li>It is a nice rich cream for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Like all mychelle products safety and quality come first.  </li>
            <li>If you like to use multiple products at one time, then feel safe in doing so with this line of skin care.  </li>
            <li>the scented if you are interested........</li>
            <li>But thanks for the compliment mom!).</li>
            <li>I have tried many different moisturizers but none has been as effective with absolutely no problems for my very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; it loves my face, no weird stuff, only natural stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this stuff feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates gently and does not contain any of the 3 ingredients which I cannot tolerate.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs readily.  </li>
            <li>but I really like the texture of it.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; on my skin.</li>
            <li>My doctor wants to know what I do.  </li>
            <li>and I think it really does reduce the appearance of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>My skin has really been changing, tightening and looks well moisturized.</li>
            <li>So far this has changed the appearance of my skin, the texture and overall healthy feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right for me now (as a 32 year old).  </li>
            <li>unscented one has its own smell, but not strong.</li>
            <li>The old jar weighs 2 oz exactly today.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way - very light texture and is absorbed right away.  </li>
            <li>and I love the results well enough to have signed up for the regular shipments of this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to use a few \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; products,  </li>
            <li>Cream level was normal elsewhere in the jar, so it hadn&#x27;t slide over to one side.  </li>
            <li>The new jar?  </li>
            <li>Oh I like this, not heavy or greasy and VEGAN, hooray!  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that this product is only 1.2 fl oz.</li>
            <li>I could pass for early 20&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li>Even though this says it is unscented, its fragrance is my favorite of every other facial moisturizer EVER.</li>
            <li>This cream made a positive difference; my skin glowed and looked younger.  </li>
            <li>It hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I try to keep them all natural.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was just my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is still listed as an ingredient on Amazon and the old package is still displayed.     </li>
            <li>look younger than I am already and have not been having much sign of aging.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin ultra soft</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it leaves your skin very shiny and oily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a silky feel that leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Only because the unscented still has a scent, albeit mild, but I expected it to have none.  </li>
            <li>I started using this at the same time that I tried another new product.  </li>
            <li>No one wants to have flaky dry skin around their lips and nose!</li>
            <li>When you try out cosmetics, particularly those that claim to &#x27;reverse&#x27; the tale-tell signs of aging, you have to give it a few months to determine if it really performs the way they advertise it to perform.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkle-reduction (I&#x27;m 27 and fairly wrinkle-free still), but it has definitely had a positive clearing effect on my blackheads and other small skin eruptions.</li>
            <li>It leaves facial  skin feeling velvet soft.  </li>
            <li>This cream is much different from the one I bought MyChelle directly.</li>
            <li>Overnight use (especially over one of the Mychelle serums) keeps my skin soft and hydrated, and reduces lines.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive and dry skin...</li>
            <li>I have tried several others for aging skin that have \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients which is important to me but left my skin feeling dry or tight.</li>
            <li>It does not go as far in coverage as a very pricey cream I have used in the past so</li>
            <li>This cream makes a visible difference in moistness and fine lines if you truly have aging skin, not just a few little hints of what may be to come.</li>
            <li>I started using it in the fall of 2011 and by the next spring, really noticed that the lines on my forehead and around my mouth, began to diminish and became less &#x27;deep&#x27;.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;It has a silky feel that leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Only because the unscented still has a scent, albeit mild, but I expected it to have none.  </li>
            <li> I started using this at the same time that I tried another new product.  </li>
            <li> No one wants to have flaky dry skin around their lips and nose!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkle-reduction (I&#x27;m 27 and fairly wrinkle-free still), but it has definitely had a positive clearing effect on my blackheads and other small skin eruptions.</li>
            <li> It leaves facial  skin feeling velvet soft.  </li>
            <li> This cream is much different from the one I bought MyChelle directly.</li>
            <li> Overnight use (especially over one of the Mychelle serums) keeps my skin soft and hydrated, and reduces lines.</li>

            <li> I have tried several others for aging skin that have \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients which is important to me but left my skin feeling dry or tight.</li>
            <li> It does not go as far in coverage as a very pricey cream I have used in the past so</li>
            <li> This cream makes a visible difference in moistness and fine lines if you truly have aging skin, not just a few little hints of what may be to come.</li>
            <li> I started using it in the fall of 2011 and by the next spring, really noticed that the lines on my forehead and around my mouth, began to diminish and became less &#x27;deep&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it is changing my skin</li>
            <li> (I mark these to see how long they&#x27;ll last me), so I weighed both.  </li>
            <li> my skin still feels dry afterward, especially around the corners of my mouth and under my nose.</li>
            <li> I am desperate to find a moisturizer that is natural (no aging chemicals), does not lead to breakouts for my large pore, oily but dehydrated skin and still works towards anti-aging.  </li>
            <li> Many of these types of face creams, at least for me and my skin type, fail.  </li>

            <li> They&#x27;ll refund my $, but this is not legal.</li>
            <li> It plumps just enough and moisturizes and smooths everything out - not too heavy nor does it disappear -</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Only negative is it does not have SPF in it.</li>
            <li> But maybe, or maybe not, it is slowing down the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can be purchased at some high end retail stores but is much less expensive when ordered online.  </li>
            <li> but I do not enjoy placing it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> It used to be too greasy a few years ago, but my skin changed.  </li>
            <li> First of all, this product is very expensive.</li>
            <li> But it does feel to be on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> I turned 39 a few weeks ago...</li>
            <li> Helps to firm the skin.</li>
            <li> Some moisturizers just plain don&#x27;t work for me --</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well this product will work over time as I have just started using it.&lt;br /&gt;However I will not order the unscented product again!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> (not sure about the &amp;#34;early&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So I am not sure if this is working, because at least it is not reversing any signs of aging on me.</li>
            <li> But upon recently receiving a new jar, I was very disappointed to discover that Mychelle has changed the formula and Matrixyl 3000 is no longer part of this cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side for a product not sold in a high-end salon or spa, but I&#x27;d have a hard time switching to anything else at this point.</li>
            <li> I used another MyChelle product, the Fruit Fiesta Peel, but accidentally left it on my face too long, which allowed that product&#x27;s glycolic acid to burn my skin, leaving really ugly, scabby blotches!</li>
            <li> my 52 years always shocks people--but I had begun to notice subtle changes in the supple-ness of my face.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse, I missed the MyChelle March sale because of buying the cream here.  </li>
            <li> I was sad, but I had to return this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> Hmm this seems a rather questionable \\&quot;upgrade.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> For me, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, or feeling oily or anything unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It smells like flowers -- even the &#x27;unscented&#x27; one has a very, very faint floral aroma, though I think that&#x27;s just the ingredients.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful results! A little goes a long way - very light texture and is absorbed right away.  My 58 year-old skin is moisturized and looks great!</li>
            <li> j&#x27; adore Mychelle, always!!  I&#x27;ve been using their stuff since 2003/2004, only stuff I put on my face.  I love it &amp; it loves my face, no weird stuff, only natural stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other gals are always asking me about my skin since MyChelle makes it look so good - YAY</li>
            <li> Like all mychelle products safety and quality come first.  This works and is a true value.  I just wish all companies were as consumer friendly as this one is.</li>
            <li> I was sad, but I had to return this product. It hurt my sensitive skin. I have been able to use a few \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; products,  I try to keep them all natural. I was excited about this one after trying a sample. But after a few applications, each one ending in red cheeks- it felt like a chemical burn-  I returned the product. Sorry it didn&#x27;t work out. It seems like a good company. Maybe it was just my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Oh I like this, not heavy or greasy and VEGAN, hooray!  I don&#x27;t use it for wrinkles, cuz they are on my face for a good reason...but it does make my face feel comfy smooth, and not tight!  Nice moisturizer!</li>
            <li> When this finally arrived I opened it to find the interior cap missing, cream smeared inside the outer cap, and 25% plus of the cream scooped out from one side - it was immediately obvious.  Cream level was normal elsewhere in the jar, so it hadn&#x27;t slide over to one side.  I had another 1.2 oz Mychelle night cream jar, used daily since 3/7 (I mark these to see how long they&#x27;ll last me), so I weighed both.  The old jar weighs 2 oz exactly today.  The new jar?  Just under 2 oz.  What&#x27;s worse, I missed the MyChelle March sale because of buying the cream here.  AND the vendor is Amazon itself.  They&#x27;ll refund my $, but this is not legal.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the most beloved items in my cabinet for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleared up problem skin. I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkle-reduction (I&#x27;m 27 and fairly wrinkle-free still), but it has definitely had a positive clearing effect on my blackheads and other small skin eruptions. It soothes them into submission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Healed &#x27;peel&#x27;-burned skin. I used another MyChelle product, the Fruit Fiesta Peel, but accidentally left it on my face too long, which allowed that product&#x27;s glycolic acid to burn my skin, leaving really ugly, scabby blotches! The Super Polypeptide had an incredible healing effect and caused the scabs and discoloration to go away in about 4 days (and my skin is easily discolored).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. VERY rich, but never greasy. Some moisturizers just plain don&#x27;t work for me -- my skin still feels dry afterward, especially around the corners of my mouth and under my nose. No one wants to have flaky dry skin around their lips and nose! This product moisturizes, and then the moisture actually seems to stay IN. However, I don&#x27;t look greasy afterward (which I can tend toward).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I really like the smell. It smells like flowers -- even the &#x27;unscented&#x27; one has a very, very faint floral aroma, though I think that&#x27;s just the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side for a product not sold in a high-end salon or spa, but I&#x27;d have a hard time switching to anything else at this point.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this stuff feels on my skin.  It seems a tad pricey but is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive and dry skin... this feels like it not only moisturizes my skin but also &amp;#34;feeds&amp;#34; it... I use it daily</li>
            <li> According to the people at Mychelle, the matrixyl no longer met \\&quot;strict guildelines of cleanliness\\&quot; and has been replaced by three peptides that are supposed to be even more effective: marine oligopeptides; pisum sativum (pea peptide); and rice peptides. Hmm this seems a rather questionable \\&quot;upgrade.\\&quot;  Read our review here:    [...]</li>
            <li> This is an extremely effective skin cream.  It leaves facial  skin feeling velvet soft.  It exfoliates gently and does not contain any of the 3 ingredients which I cannot tolerate.  Does not clog pores.  Can be purchased at some high end retail stores but is much less expensive when ordered online.  Thanks, Amazon, for providing excellent products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I worked in the health care industry and love this product- no toxins.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and no bad skin reactions with my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s worth the price!  I wish they had a larger size. Yay!</li>
            <li> Love this face lotion/cream!  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This cream is much different from the one I bought MyChelle directly. Quality and feel is not the same as the one I bought from MyChelle.</li>
            <li> This product feels nice on my skin, does seem to reduce the appearance of fine lines and feels luxurious, good choice, though pricey.</li>
            <li> In a time when the cosmetic industry is flooding us with so called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products, this one stands out and is truly safe.  It feels great going on and I love the results well enough to have signed up for the regular shipments of this product.  I alternate the Supreme Polypeptide cream with the Pumpkin Renew cream.  If you like to use multiple products at one time, then feel safe in doing so with this line of skin care.  For more information regarding ingredients in cosmetic/skin care, check out the Environmental Working Group website and click on skin care.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at what we&#x27;ve been exposing ourselves to.  Then come back and give MyChelle a try.  There&#x27;s something for everyone, every skin type and condition.  Happy hunting!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mychelle Supreme Polypeptide Cream for about 8 months now and I&#x27;ve really liked it. But the reason I purchased it was because it contained Matrixyl 3000 and I&#x27;d heard excellent things about the anti-aging benefits of this ingredient. But upon recently receiving a new jar, I was very disappointed to discover that Mychelle has changed the formula and Matrixyl 3000 is no longer part of this cream. It is still listed as an ingredient on Amazon and the old package is still displayed.     I now feel misled and will no longer be purchasing this product. The search for the perfect moisturizer continues.</li>
            <li> I was using the Deep Repair cream, which was great, but I wanted something a bit more.  This cream is amazing.  It gives my skin such a wonderful glow.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps skin moist and wrinkles at bay. Only negative is it does not have SPF in it.</li>
            <li> I give this 4.75 stars.  Only because the unscented still has a scent, albeit mild, but I expected it to have none.  The cream is perfect for me for day, night, and overall improving the texture and lessening the lines in my face.  It plumps just enough and moisturizes and smooths everything out - not too heavy nor does it disappear - just right.</li>
            <li> Overnight use (especially over one of the Mychelle serums) keeps my skin soft and hydrated, and reduces lines. It absorbs readily.  It&#x27;s a terrific product, great natural ingredients.  So glad I found this product line.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well this product will work over time as I have just started using it.&lt;br /&gt;However I will not order the unscented product again!!!&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;unscented&#x27; cream smells awful.&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself absorbs easily into the skin but I do not enjoy placing it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Try the scented if you are interested........</li>
            <li> It is a nice rich cream for my dry sensitive skin. It does not go as far in coverage as a very pricey cream I have used in the past so in comparison one needs to keep that in mind when evaluating cost over the life of a jar.</li>
            <li> This is very good.  My pores got smaller, and lines got finer.  It used to be too greasy a few years ago, but my skin changed.  It&#x27;s just right for me now (as a 32 year old).  I got the unscented, but it still smells flowery.  Doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it could bother some.</li>
            <li> I started using this at the same time that I tried another new product.  I&#x27;m not sure how much it is changing my skin but I really like the texture of it.  It is gentle and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; on my skin.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product is very expensive. MyChelle has these terms about their products that sound pseudo-sciency, so I recommend people take a grain of salt about their claims. But I still use many of their products because it seems to not cause problem on my skin and I feel okay with them on. Just be aware that this product is only 1.2 fl oz. This actually makes it more expensive than a lot of &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look younger than I am already and have not been having much sign of aging. So I am not sure if this is working, because at least it is not reversing any signs of aging on me. But maybe, or maybe not, it is slowing down the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unscented one has its own smell, but not strong. I have not experience any problem with this cream which I generally only use as night cream. For me, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, or feeling oily or anything unpleasant. But it does feel to be on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> This cream makes a visible difference in moistness and fine lines if you truly have aging skin, not just a few little hints of what may be to come.</li>
            <li> Love it...only one I will use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently had a cosmetic surgeon think I was his age [23 years younger] and he said this as he was checking my face with no makeup on.  Even my eye doctor couldn&#x27;t believe my age!  I attribute this to good genes and clean diet and habits. My doctor wants to know what I do.  I &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; MyChelle!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it!!!!</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, good price!</li>
            <li> I found it to be just as I thought, lovely for my aging skin!  Will keep purchasing this item.  Packaging was was good to prevent&lt;br /&gt;breakage.  Thank You</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer-- just the right amount of hydration, and didn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea at all (which is dying a lot). The jar packaging has got to go, though. It&#x27;s just not sanitary to keep sticking your fingers in a product, day after day. If they ever change the packaging to a pump, I&#x27;ll buy it again. For now, though, I&#x27;ll stick to Keys Luminos.</li>
            <li> Have found MyChelle polypeptide cream so easy and creamy to apply. I can see  some difference in my lines,and what really makes me happy is I have had no alergic reaction whatsoever. I will definitely continue to use the cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 years.  It leaves your skin ultra soft and I think it really does reduce the appearance of wrinkles.  I turned 39 a few weeks ago... And sent my mom a picture of our newborn and I... And on the phone, she told me that my skin looked so great in that photo... I could pass for early 20&#x27;s!  (not sure about the &amp;#34;early&amp;#34; 20&#x27;s... But thanks for the compliment mom!).</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I have tried several others for aging skin that have \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients which is important to me but left my skin feeling dry or tight. This moisturizer is great for day and evening even in the dry climate of Colorado where I live.</li>
            <li> So far this has changed the appearance of my skin, the texture and overall healthy feel. I also use Acure argon oil.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  Helps to firm the skin.</li>
            <li> i have been using that cream for 6 months now and i absolutly love it!</li>
            <li> I am desperate to find a moisturizer that is natural (no aging chemicals), does not lead to breakouts for my large pore, oily but dehydrated skin and still works towards anti-aging.  I thought I had found the answer in this product, but it keeps clogging my pores and making me breakout.  It also leaves skin looking shiny, oily - even under a matte spf.  I use it on the d&amp;eacute;colletage  area, but can not use on my face.  Still searching...</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream, I was on the hunt for more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; creams since it is a product that I use multiple times a day on my skin.  I have combination skin and this cream does a great job of balancing both the dry and oily parts of my face.  My only challenge is that it is a lighter cream so I seem to go through it more often, than I was my cream that was more dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the scent is light and the product is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great deal if you do the subscribe and save.  I order one every three months.</li>
            <li> Even though this says it is unscented, its fragrance is my favorite of every other facial moisturizer EVER.</li>
            <li> Just meh. Love their other products, this one is ok.</li>
            <li> Excellent! My skin has really been changing, tightening and looks well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how great the product is but my ex Nadine sure liked it..  She likes it and I dislike her</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 18 months now and I must say I love it!  When you try out cosmetics, particularly those that claim to &#x27;reverse&#x27; the tale-tell signs of aging, you have to give it a few months to determine if it really performs the way they advertise it to perform.  Many of these types of face creams, at least for me and my skin type, fail.  Big time.  MyChelle Supreme Polypeptide Cream truly works.  I started using it in the fall of 2011 and by the next spring, really noticed that the lines on my forehead and around my mouth, began to diminish and became less &#x27;deep&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve always been proud of my youthful appearance--my 52 years always shocks people--but I had begun to notice subtle changes in the supple-ness of my face.  This product is beating back father time in surprising and pleasing ways.  If you have sensitive skin and have tried many of the products out there I recommend you try the MyChelle line of products.  I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; believer!  (see what I did there?)</li>
            <li> This cream made a positive difference; my skin glowed and looked younger.  It was more even in tone and diminished spots.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream. The only problem is that it leaves your skin very shiny and oily.  If you already have oily skin this is not the cream for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different moisturizers but none has been as effective with absolutely no problems for my very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It has a silky feel that leaves my skin soft and supple.  A little goes a long way so you get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
