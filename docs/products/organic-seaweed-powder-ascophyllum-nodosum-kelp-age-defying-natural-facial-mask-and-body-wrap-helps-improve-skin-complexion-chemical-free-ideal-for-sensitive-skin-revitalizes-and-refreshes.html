            <li>It feels absolutely amazing when you put it on your face as a mask</li>
            <li>I personally liked the smell of the seaweed (it reminded me of the ocean)</li>
            <li>and I really really liked that!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I leave on for 30 mins then washing off with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Nice in bath</li>
            <li>This is really nice.</li>
            <li>This is powder that you can just add water to or add to your own recipes of scrubs.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>

            <li>After about 10-15 minutes, wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li>rec&#x27;d product via Tomoson for my 100% honest opinion</li>
            <li>I combined 1 teaspoon of seaweed powder and 2 teaspoons of warm water.</li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes in it started hardening and gave a nice cooling sensation to the skin.</li>
            <li>I liked how my skin looked after.  </li>
            <li>They also sent an email to make sure I was happy and enjoying the powder.</li>
            <li>and it felt so nice applying it to my skin.</li>
            <li>I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>1 tsp powder to 2 tsp warm water.</li>
            <li>Worked great and help clean my skin, I added coconut oil and lavender.</li>
            <li>I got this product free to review in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion!</li>
            <li>You need to use a warm cloth and you need to scrub, this does not want to come off easily!</li>
            <li>Whilst there are clear benefits to using the product as a mask or wrap, a scoopful in a warm bath has excellent results too.</li>
            <li>but the scent is very strong.</li>
            <li>very strong smell</li>
            <li>It was very easy.</li>
            <li>It came in on time, the owner is polite &amp; truly cares about her customers &amp; would take time out of her schedule to make sure your satisfied!</li>
            <li>It came in a powdered form so it was nice to just be able to mix it with water.  </li>
            <li>This seaweed face mask is the best one I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>The aroma is lovely and light (NO seaweed stink), and when you use it on your skin as a mask, etc., it leaves a wonderfully pleasant cooling sensation that literally feels like an ocean breeze as it cleanses your pores.</li>
            <li>It comes as a very fine silky powder in a generous sized jar for the price.  </li>
            <li>Very finely milled.  </li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;it has a strong smell of seaweed, which I absolutely love!</li>
            <li>Even without the use of oil, it makes your face very smooth.</li>
            <li>The packaging is really good and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Many from surgeries and people.</li>
            <li>I really am in love with this.  </li>
            <li>I would buy more.  </li>

            <li>I have used this more than once with good success on senstive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having used a seaweed mask before, I was intrigued by my sample for review.</li>
            <li>I wish I had more time and energy to devote to my skin</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering us this wonderful facial mask.</li>
            <li>love  it.</li>
            <li>I think i will buy more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you do not use oil, you will need to add more water which isn&#x27;t included in the instructions.</li>
            <li>All of us women in our home love this product and will continue to use</li>
            <li>Very happy with it, make facial mask with it</li>
            <li>One of my favorite parts of skincare is doing a mask.  </li>
            <li>Organic Seaweed Powder that Azara Organics sent me to review is perfect for customizing a mask that is specific for your skin by adding additional ingredients.  </li>
            <li>i will try more.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love that this item is organic.</li>
            <li>If I took the time to buy the body wrap materials, I would carve out time to do a fully body wrap, but based  on my facial, this would be an awesome product for that purpose.</li>
            <li>If I took the time to buy the body wrap materials, I would carve out time to do a fully body wrap, but based  on my facial, this would be an awesome product for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I am a &amp;#34;girly girl&amp;#34; and I love doing facials.</li>
            <li>Face feels fantastic after using this !</li>
            <li>but it was incredibly smooth!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know what I am putting on my face is not only feeling good, but is good for it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to make and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but I am excited about the organic ingredients and amazing qualities that will purify my skin.</li>
            <li>applied it felt pretty good on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to reach my goal!  </li>
            <li>It’s not a bad smell, just VERY strong.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it made my face feel amazing; smooth and perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty amazing, most state that the smell is fishy, well what would you expect from seaweed that is treated with a bunch of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>The Organic Seaweed Powder by Azara Organics is also a chemical free solution to healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is defiantly a good skin buff and shine and like I said it is a very generous amount in the jar (see that pic?</li>
            <li>I used warm water and it came right off.</li>
            <li>And to prepare it I used a disposable cup and fork and it was easy.</li>
            <li>I use it according to the direction, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>Really strong smell but goes on easily</li>
            <li>but this made it fairly easy to do while soaking in the bath.</li>
            <li>I am so happy, finally found my favorite.</li>
            <li>but it can be strong for some.</li>
            <li>It does have kinda a strong oder of seaweed ,  but I didn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>It does has a strong seaweed smell but it does not bother me.</li>
            <li>Yes, the smell is strong, but putting honey in it helps.</li>
            <li>The fishy odor is strong but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Product smells strongly on seaweed.</li>
            <li>I like this powder for a face mask because I feel like this is a very gentle but effective ingredient for a face mask.</li>
            <li>First just the powder and some warm water...</li>
            <li>Came quickly when I ordered it too!</li>
            <li>but this is great for tightening and making the facial skin smooth and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t so had to start the mixture over to get it to smooth out.</li>
            <li>, it leaves my face smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>Here is the important part.  </li>
            <li>it arrived in a nice container ready to go.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, mixes instantly.</li>
            <li>Lightly smells of seaweed, no perfumes.</li>
            <li>The scrubbing however leaves your skin exfoliated and smooth and moisturized (you can add moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li>so I started looking at how much it would cost to do my own.</li>
            <li>and then I gently removed it with a washcloth and warm water.</li>
            <li>so I was really intrigued to try this out and see how I liked it.</li>
            <li>Powder makes into a great rub, I&#x27;m currently using on my legs.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic straight from the Atlantic, thank you for making such a great product!</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>It feels good on my face and leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li>So far so good with the facials</li>
            <li>I love how fresh and cool my skin felt after using it, and I also believe it’s good for my skin since it’s all natural.</li>
            <li>The Seaweed Powder is nutrient loaded so it satisfies and cleanses your malnourished skin and the unique mineral properties flush out the toxins leaving your skin smooth and youthful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great for a mask, but be aware that since this is a natural product, it does smell like seaweed.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a small company with an awesome product and what looks to be a genuine interest in their customers concerns and opinions.  </li>
            <li>I am picky and it is my new love!</li>
            <li>I work night shifts, and always struggle to keep my skin looking fresh!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited to see results.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth it in my opinion!</li>
            <li>you will notice a difference my face looks clean and</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super smooth and brighter.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I love that all the products are organic and pure.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and cool when you are applying it, and when you wash it off it leaves your skin feeling so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I know that it will take a bit, but after the next day of me using this, I feel so good.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>It also felt so cool from adding the Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I think it was nice, and again - my skin did feel soft and supple as it was supposed to afterward.</li>
            <li>There is just something about doing a mask that makes you feel like your doing your skin a favor by sucking out all the gunk and leaving it super clean and soft!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed any results as far as detoxing go</li>
            <li>As the direction, I made the liquid and it seemed not enough for my face, but it was just good.</li>
            <li>With some masks, they can pull and tug on the skin as it dries but this just dries and skill remains soft so it does not put any kind of pressure on the skin.</li>
            <li>As a facial cleanser/mask this was easy to mix up with warm water and apply with a silicone bristle (unused but intended for hair dye application) brush.  </li>
            <li>It doesn’t smell as strong when it’s still in powder form but as soon as you mix it with a liquid, boy the smell really hits ya!</li>
            <li>Seaweed itself has a lot of other health benefits, so I think it’s a great product to add to your beauty regime.</li>
            <li>the aroma is mild, not over powering at all (having said that, I grew up close to the beach</li>
            <li>stuff is great but for a sensitive sniffer like mine, I strongly recommend to use with essential oils.</li>
            <li>All though...make sure you wipe good cause it&#x27;ll leave a green yellowish residue.</li>
            <li>I received the package fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Just a gently wipe with a warm rag and my face was much smoother and softer than it has been in awhile.</li>
            <li>I was charged the price more high.</li>
            <li>I give the entire experience the full 5 stars and more!  </li>
            <li>I’ll definitely keep using it twice a week because I love how fresh and cool my skin felt after using it, and I also believe it’s good for my skin since it’s all natural.</li>
            <li>my skin was a little pink which is good, it means the blood is to the surface &amp; it will leave you with bright glowing skin!</li>
            <li>The mixing is quick (and actually pretty fun!)</li>
            <li>I loved this it doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and smells like the real deal.</li>

            <li>i tried it with yogurt and honey, and magically my skin felt soo soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>It allows for thick application and feels incredibly indulgent when going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My skin was very soft after washing off the seaweed mixture and remained that way for several days which I loved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many different ingredients you can add to make it your own, they even suggest essential oils.</li>
            <li>The powder is very fine and soft, it dissolves well in water (but make sure you use more than recommended since it tends to clump up and its a bit hard to spread)</li>
            <li>Pure and organic!</li>
            <li>and I liked that my skin didn&#x27;t feel over dry and</li>

            <li>I used only twice so far it looks good</li>
            <li>It is very natural and organic, and leaves your skin completely clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a chance to use it again to see better results but my boyfriend says he noticed results right after the first and only application.</li>
            <li>, it was so soft and it just had that fresh clean feeling to</li>
            <li>Great stuff, hard to take off</li>
            <li>The smell is little too much even for asian girl like me, but you feel great difference after using about  month.&lt;br /&gt;great product!</li>
            <li>, I am really interested to see how it will do all over my body since it worked quite well on my face.</li>
            <li>I added my favorite scent lemongrass to cover the odor only to find myself sickened by the smell of lemongrass now.</li>
            <li>the price and the quality amount of Seaweed Powder it contains, this product is way more affordable compared to similar brands!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have only twenty more pounds to go.  </li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>Fast shipper!</li>
            <li>The next day I think I looked even better.</li>
            <li>First, the smell of seaweed reminds me of when I went to the Rockaway Beach in my youth.</li>
            <li>A lovely seaweed powder that can be used to make facial masks and body wraps...</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Seaweed powder.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with the results, but the mask was incredibly difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>This made my skin so smooth, and I also have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>- I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
            <li>Noticed improvement after my first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can add a drop or two of essential oils to mask the scent.</li>
            <li>That was more than I wanted to spend for a one time facial</li>
            <li>I clearly see results and they are fantastic, I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the feeling at first</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m always like that with every face mask at first.</li>
            <li>For someone who has oily skin, this has helped me SO much!</li>
            <li>It has works better than anything we have tried to decrease his back acne.</li>
            <li>I have never done a seaweed mask so this was my first experience.</li>
            <li>So you decide if you want the best pore-opening and cleaning mask or nice-smelling mediocre mask.</li>
            <li>I will choose the first one.</li>
            <li>This mask was my first seaweek mask.</li>
            <li>One thing that bothered me at first was the smell.</li>
            <li>Some tips, if you are using this only as a face mask, be sure to get ALL of your hair out of the way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll use it more and get back to you</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>in all, I love this seaweed powder, especially because it’s pure kelp powder and has nothing else added to it.</li>
            <li>The mask does not pull on hairs, even when coming off, and can make for a very sensual experience if you plan on giving your significant other a body mask (or making them give you one!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can check their website for more of their products.</li>
            <li>The result on my face is clean and clear.</li>
            <li>This facial mask is really nice on my sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin at all.</li>
            <li>In fact, I recently purchased a bentonite clay powder mask, a popular mask amongst natural product seekers.</li>
            <li>but you can thin to your liking by adding more water a little at a time until you have your perfect</li>
            <li>Great product the smell is intense and I did have a very small break.</li>
            <li>My face is left clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Easy to mix and not too messy - cleans up easily out of mixing container and sink.  </li>
            <li>your looking for a facial mask with amazing benefits, unlike no other than this is the mask to go with.</li>
            <li>Since the first time I used the powder for a facial my skin felt fantastic and looked youthful.</li>
            <li>, just don’t let it dry and stay on for more than a shower.  </li>
            <li>, just don’t let it dry and stay on for more than a shower.  </li>
            <li>It has really easy directions on mixing it and how to get the consistency you need for both the facial wrap and the body wrap.</li>
            <li>Does everything it says it will do only con is the strong seaweed smell.</li>
            <li>They also state that if you find the smell to be too strong, you can add a couple drops of essential oil to help.</li>
            <li>This is a large jar and will last a good long time.</li>
            <li>Besides the silky powder consistency, it&#x27;s pure and organic</li>
            <li>Its ingredients are pure organic kelp powder harvested from the Atlantic Ocean.</li>
            <li>It’s certified USDA pure organic kelp powder harvested from the Atlantic Ocean.</li>

            <li>the mask dries, it starts to feel slightly tight on the skin, but it feels nice and cooling.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, just have to add a little more moisture to make it work correctly.</li>
            <li>I have received this in a fast time.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that there is no GMO&#x27;s or Paraben&#x27;s in this product, which is a must for me.</li>
            <li>it leaves it really smooth especially for those people who have acne like me it helped with my acne</li>
            <li>smoothing it out as you go left me with a smooth, creamy mixture.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It does has a very fishy smell to it.</li>
            <li>and i had some questions which were very promptly answered.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>have very noticeable pimples on my jaw line</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but you know it is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Just a heads up, this becomes gloppy mud, not like the smooth store bought facial masks.</li>
            <li>bought a clay mask almost a year ago now and only used it maybe 5 times, its just too harsh for my skin, but i really wanted one I could use and I am so happy I gave this one</li>
            <li>Thanks to</li>
            <li>Very cleansing.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This seaweed mask by Azara Organics is, absolutely, the exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can also mix different products into your mask, as you see fit.</li>
            <li>I found this combination was very soothing and, I believe, helped my skin to heal.</li>
            <li>My whole bathroom smelled like fish and seaweed.</li>
            <li>This really does smell like seaweed, very beachy and organic smelling.</li>
            <li>so I really had to scrub to get it off.</li>
            <li>It was very relaxing and gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>it made my face feel soft fresh and smooth especially in combination with a lotion.</li>

            <li>It come straight from the Atlantic Ocean.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This product worked for me really well.</li>
            <li>So wash face very well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this from Azara Organics, which is one of the most personal and professional companies I have worked with on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice green color to the soaps, plus it gives the minerals and trace elements to the soap properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It’s not a bad smell but for some it could be a little strong.</li>
            <li>I use it for face masks and it blends really well with other ingredients for a very smooth paste.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly, it is goopy and slimy and easy to spread as long as you put enough water in it and mix well, there are however some clumps that will just not come out</li>
            <li>What’s awesome about is that you only need one teaspoon of the powder to make the paste for the entire face, so it will definitely last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>and I am excited to start using this one regularly!</li>
            <li>It does smell like seaweed as I expected! :)</li>
            <li>scent is a little strong when you mix it with just water, however now I have been mixing it with Greek Yogurt and honey which helps with the smell a lot, it doesn&#x27;t feel quite as refreshing going on, but the results are still great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think for some of you, this will be the answer you&#x27;re looking for - especially if you are looking for a full body mask, but it just wasn&#x27;t something my skin really needs in it&#x27;s regimen.</li>
            <li>through a little trial and error I&#x27;ve found that a bowl with a wide bottom surface and a simple pastry brush works wonderfully...</li>
            <li>I also found that starting with a small amount of very warm liquid, add the powder as you would flour to a cake recipe...</li>
            <li>The next thing I&#x27;m trying is a full body wrap</li>
            <li>I only tried it once with just plain filtered water and skin seems to feel more smooth after using this mask.</li>
            <li>The seaweed powder comes straight from the Atlantic Ocean and to keep it 100% pure, no attempt has been made to mask the natural aroma of seaweed.</li>
            <li>More water or less powder will make a runnier consistency that will take longer to harden and vice versa.</li>
            <li>If you wish to go to their main site it is located here: http://azaraorganics.com/. You can also go here to get idea&#x27;s on how to do their body</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see any difference from this particular seaweed mask compared to others I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but I plan on soaking in the bath with it next to see if it is better than using it as a face mask.  </li>
            <li>Need to use more only have done one facial anf</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at it being here that fast.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend scenting this stuff with something when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seaweed powder made my face extremely soft after using it one time (I have oily skin) and it did not make me break out afterwards like many other products have.</li>
            <li>The key is to add it to warm not hot water.</li>
            <li>so I may be used to it a little more then some</li>
            <li>As I worked the recipe to the creamy consistency I was looking for, I ended up with a little more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used this as a facial mask and my skin felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Spas use this all the time, but you will pay through the nose for one treatment - with this jar you can make a lot of masks easily and not have to spend the money or wear the mask in front of other people.  </li>
            <li>and application is just as easy as any other mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer to use natural products as much as I can.</li>
            <li>So many uses, but this one really helps skin dexterity in the face, abdomen, arms, legs, any of your trouble areas!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for something completely natural that works!</li>
            <li>normally then I mixed a teaspoon of the seaweed powder with a little honey and some warm water, and applied it to my face, neck, and decollete with a fan brush.</li>
            <li>it is very simple just take a little powder and add warm water and then apply.</li>
            <li>so I new that would happen.</li>
            <li>This is just the case with this Azara Organics Organic Seaweed Powder, something totally new in my beauty world.</li>
            <li>Its almost completely gone and nothing new has popped up!</li>
            <li>great, little clumpy but made my face feel tight and soft.</li>
            <li>and I had to make sure my washcloth was really wet several times</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;ve lived by the ocean my entire life, it really doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li>also it made my face very soft .</li>
            <li>Because of that, it had a nice exfoliating quality (although I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really supposed to) and it left my skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li>makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li>It mixes pretty easily and I like that it wasn&#x27;t confusing.</li>
            <li>I have used it first on my upper thighs.</li>
            <li>felt really soft!</li>
            <li>my skin came out so smooth and soft that it&#x27;s a regular part of the facial routine now.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you will notice is the smell I actually like the smell of seaweed</li>
            <li>NATURAL!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who likes to do things naturally!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>When I first opened it you could definitely smell the seaweed.</li>
            <li>is that it’s completely natural!</li>
            <li>I am anxious to use again, but next time I am going to look into some other&#x27;s comments on how they were able to make it spread more smoothly/evenly.  </li>
            <li>mask works better than any mask I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my skin so soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>but it has helped his back so much!</li>
            <li>It smells a little strong, (like the ocean)</li>
            <li>By the time I wet my hair and massaged my scalp then rinsed out the seaweed, it did leave both my scalp and hair extremely clean and soft, but the ocean smell remained.  </li>
            <li>By the time I wet my hair and massaged my scalp then rinsed out the seaweed, it did leave both my scalp and hair extremely clean and soft, but the ocean smell remained.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always down to try something new, even if it seems wacky or different.</li>
            <li>but I used the Seaweed powder (has a light smell not very strong to me) with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve found myself looking for natural alternatives to my more conventional, and often harmful, products.</li>
            <li>but i will try put a little bit more water next time</li>
            <li>It helped to clear up my pimps and break outs.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really clear up my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt it either.  </li>
            <li>It helps clear out</li>
            <li>Makes skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-achieve soft, supple skin</li>
            <li>Not perfumey and all natural</li>
            <li>My wife says this is like something you would get at a professional spa.</li>
            <li>I tried out the face mask recipe they provided &amp; it made my face clear, soft &amp; it literally gave me a glowing feeling.</li>
            <li>Use this with the Natural Escentials Bentonite Clay Mask.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this facial mask product.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I mixed the powder with Apple cider vinegar and the smell was a bit much</li>
            <li>mixed the mixture in the lid because you don’t need much of it.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I also suffer from eczema and have found this product gentle enough to use over my problem areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised I found this.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and it does work</li>
            <li>I am highly sensitive to perfume</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try and product that was 100% natural</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about ten minutes you can really feel it hardening and tightening your skin, you may also get itchy.</li>
            <li>It is a natural product and has the natural scent.</li>
            <li>but it did make my face really soft even after just one application.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me, but if you are really sensitive to smells, this may turn you off.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And tried 2 times in a week so far.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>and it is fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it enough to rate it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several high-quality organic seaweeds and this is a firm favorite.</li>
            <li>You can always add a few drops of essential oils (like lavender) to make it smell better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK if you can get it to stick to your face long enough to dry.  </li>
            <li>I found a few other facial powders that seemed good</li>
            <li>The smell is odd but not bad.</li>
            <li>I decided to go with the facial mask idea they provided on their main site.</li>
            <li>This comes in a large 8oz jar which is PLENTY of powder to do your face once a week or a full body wrap since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>If you find this aroma too strong, you may choose to add a few drops of an essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now that I know that this is a small up and coming company, I’ll be reordering once I deplete this (huge) supply of powder.</li>
            <li>Seaweed is a great skincare ingredient, and a lot of body wraps and masks are made of seaweed but are very expensive.  </li>
            <li>i liked it for my face, although when it came to the body wrap portion (which is the reason i really bought it in the beginning) it didn&#x27;t stick to my skin, i added water like the website told me too and bought all of the ingredients, disappointed with the body wrap part but other than that, it left my face extremely soft and smooth and i have very sensitive skin !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost ten pounds in two weeks on my new regimen, including the wrap.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, trying to remove it was a real challenge, and I ended cleaning up the entire bathroom when I was done.</li>
            <li>It did and left it soft not dried out.  </li>
            <li>From what I have read here, it treats a whole array of problems and the results are different for different people.</li>
            <li>I just use any kind of floral water instead of plain water and that helps a little.</li>
            <li>Like but not love due to the very strong seaweed odor.  </li>
            <li>I love that there are not many ingredients and with minimal ingredients to make your skin soft.</li>
            <li>but, as with anything new; be sure to test on a small area under the soft part of your arm for a few hours before using the web recipes...</li>
            <li>You do not need a lot at one time and the jar is large, so it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>So, I decided to use it the body wrap way for my husband on his back for his back acne and WOW!!</li>
            <li>If the exuberant amount may be returned, I stay with the product; otherwise, I&#x27;ll return it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have seen a reduction in pore size, oiliness and just generally I wake up in the morning and my skin looks refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it 3 different ways so far.</li>
            <li>I feel years younger and have a natural glow.</li>
            <li>I was not really expecting much from this product, but after just one use I can already see some results.</li>
            <li>So far I am noticing my skin is not as only</li>
            <li>Have only used 1 time so far.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel fresh and firm after I used it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell since it smell weird with seaweed.</li>
            <li>If you accidentally drop some powder, cleanup is nearly effortless - just run the vacuum.</li>
            <li>The only complaint someone might have is the strong smell of seaweed.</li>
            <li>and I noticed right away that my skin was not as dried out as it was.</li>
            <li>and it did arrive prior to the projected delivery date; no extraneous packaging and no hidden damages in-transit.</li>
            <li>and it did arrive prior to the projected delivery date; no extraneous packaging and no hidden damages in-transit.</li>
            <li>it feels minty on the face other than that i Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference after a week</li>
            <li>Having your mask in powder form allows for easy storage, WAY more applications out of one tub (money saver!), and a very long lifespan of the product - I have found with other powders that these products almost never go bad and have to be thrown out.</li>
            <li>Seaweed leave the skin firm and toned soft to the touch for a whole week after using, once a week wrapped in Saran wrap and then suit up with one of those plastic gym suites for about an hour or two and then into the shower</li>
            <li>Next time I use this powder, I’ll extend the “facial” to my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;; it soothes and smoothes my (mature) skin.  </li>
            <li>Next time I use this powder, I’ll extend the “facial” to my neck and décolleté; it soothes and smoothes my (mature) skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It may look a little funny, but after it hardened</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first but that quickly changed after the first application.</li>
            <li>I bought it a week ago, I have been using it for six straight days because it removes all the redness that I got from using other products especially acne products.</li>
            <li>People complained about the smell but its really not bad at all</li>
            <li>have never used or even had a mask done before this, but anyone with dry skin, rosacea, and early signs of aging can use this mask and it will help.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty messy, that&#x27;s why only four stars.</li>

            <li> It feels absolutely amazing when you put it on your face as a mask</li>
            <li> I personally liked the smell of the seaweed (it reminded me of the ocean)</li>
            <li> and I really really liked that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I leave on for 30 mins then washing off with warm water.  </li>
            <li> Nice in bath</li>
            <li> This is really nice.</li>
            <li> This is powder that you can just add water to or add to your own recipes of scrubs.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Combine 1 teaspoon of the seaweed powder with 2 teaspoons of warm water.  </li>
            <li> After about 10-15 minutes, wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li> rec&#x27;d product via Tomoson for my 100% honest opinion</li>
            <li> I combined 1 teaspoon of seaweed powder and 2 teaspoons of warm water.</li>
            <li> After about 5 minutes in it started hardening and gave a nice cooling sensation to the skin.</li>
            <li> I liked how my skin looked after.  </li>
            <li> They also sent an email to make sure I was happy and enjoying the powder.</li>
            <li> and it felt so nice applying it to my skin.</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> 1 tsp powder to 2 tsp warm water.</li>
            <li> Worked great and help clean my skin, I added coconut oil and lavender.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to review in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion!</li>
            <li> You need to use a warm cloth and you need to scrub, this does not want to come off easily!</li>
            <li> Whilst there are clear benefits to using the product as a mask or wrap, a scoopful in a warm bath has excellent results too.</li>
            <li> but the scent is very strong.</li>
            <li> very strong smell</li>
            <li> It was very easy.</li>
            <li> It came in on time, the owner is polite &amp; truly cares about her customers &amp; would take time out of her schedule to make sure your satisfied!</li>
            <li> It came in a powdered form so it was nice to just be able to mix it with water.  </li>
            <li> This seaweed face mask is the best one I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> The aroma is lovely and light (NO seaweed stink), and when you use it on your skin as a mask, etc., it leaves a wonderfully pleasant cooling sensation that literally feels like an ocean breeze as it cleanses your pores.</li>
            <li> It comes as a very fine silky powder in a generous sized jar for the price.  </li>
            <li> Very finely milled.  </li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;it has a strong smell of seaweed, which I absolutely love!</li>
            <li> Even without the use of oil, it makes your face very smooth.</li>
            <li> The packaging is really good and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Many from surgeries and people.</li>
            <li> I really am in love with this.  </li>
            <li> I would buy more.  </li>
            <li> Add more water, if needed, to achieve the desired texture.</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels after this face mask.</li>
            <li> love love loveeee it.</li>

            <li> If I took the time to buy the body wrap materials, I would carve out time to do a fully body wrap, but based  on my facial, this would be an awesome product for that purpose.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know what I am putting on my face is not only feeling good, but is good for it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very easy to make and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but I am excited about the organic ingredients and amazing qualities that will purify my skin.</li>
            <li> applied it felt pretty good on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to reach my goal!  </li>
            <li> It’s not a bad smell, just VERY strong.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it made my face feel amazing; smooth and perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty amazing, most state that the smell is fishy, well what would you expect from seaweed that is treated with a bunch of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> The Organic Seaweed Powder by Azara Organics is also a chemical free solution to healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is defiantly a good skin buff and shine and like I said it is a very generous amount in the jar (see that pic?</li>
            <li> I used warm water and it came right off.</li>
            <li> And to prepare it I used a disposable cup and fork and it was easy.</li>
            <li> I use it according to the direction, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Really strong smell but goes on easily</li>
            <li> but this made it fairly easy to do while soaking in the bath.</li>
            <li> I am so happy, finally found my favorite.</li>
            <li> but it can be strong for some.</li>
            <li> It does have kinda a strong oder of seaweed ,  but I didn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> It does has a strong seaweed smell but it does not bother me.</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell is strong, but putting honey in it helps.</li>
            <li> The fishy odor is strong but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Product smells strongly on seaweed.</li>
            <li> I like this powder for a face mask because I feel like this is a very gentle but effective ingredient for a face mask.</li>
            <li> First just the powder and some warm water...</li>
            <li> Came quickly when I ordered it too!</li>
            <li> but this is great for tightening and making the facial skin smooth and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t so had to start the mixture over to get it to smooth out.</li>
            <li> , it leaves my face smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> Here is the important part.  </li>
            <li> it arrived in a nice container ready to go.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, mixes instantly.</li>
            <li> Lightly smells of seaweed, no perfumes.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing however leaves your skin exfoliated and smooth and moisturized (you can add moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li> so I started looking at how much it would cost to do my own.</li>
            <li> and then I gently removed it with a washcloth and warm water.</li>
            <li> so I was really intrigued to try this out and see how I liked it.</li>
            <li> Powder makes into a great rub, I&#x27;m currently using on my legs.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic straight from the Atlantic, thank you for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> It feels good on my face and leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good with the facials</li>
            <li> I love how fresh and cool my skin felt after using it, and I also believe it’s good for my skin since it’s all natural.</li>
            <li> The Seaweed Powder is nutrient loaded so it satisfies and cleanses your malnourished skin and the unique mineral properties flush out the toxins leaving your skin smooth and youthful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great for a mask, but be aware that since this is a natural product, it does smell like seaweed.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a small company with an awesome product and what looks to be a genuine interest in their customers concerns and opinions.  </li>
            <li> I am picky and it is my new love!</li>
            <li> I work night shifts, and always struggle to keep my skin looking fresh!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m excited to see results.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth it in my opinion!</li>
            <li> you will notice a difference my face looks clean and</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super smooth and brighter.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I love that all the products are organic and pure.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and cool when you are applying it, and when you wash it off it leaves your skin feeling so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I know that it will take a bit, but after the next day of me using this, I feel so good.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> It also felt so cool from adding the Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I think it was nice, and again - my skin did feel soft and supple as it was supposed to afterward.</li>
            <li> There is just something about doing a mask that makes you feel like your doing your skin a favor by sucking out all the gunk and leaving it super clean and soft!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed any results as far as detoxing go</li>
            <li> As the direction, I made the liquid and it seemed not enough for my face, but it was just good.</li>
            <li> With some masks, they can pull and tug on the skin as it dries but this just dries and skill remains soft so it does not put any kind of pressure on the skin.</li>
            <li> As a facial cleanser/mask this was easy to mix up with warm water and apply with a silicone bristle (unused but intended for hair dye application) brush.  </li>
            <li> It doesn’t smell as strong when it’s still in powder form but as soon as you mix it with a liquid, boy the smell really hits ya!</li>
            <li> Seaweed itself has a lot of other health benefits, so I think it’s a great product to add to your beauty regime.</li>
            <li> the aroma is mild, not over powering at all (having said that, I grew up close to the beach</li>
            <li> stuff is great but for a sensitive sniffer like mine, I strongly recommend to use with essential oils.</li>
            <li> All though...make sure you wipe good cause it&#x27;ll leave a green yellowish residue.</li>
            <li> I received the package fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Just a gently wipe with a warm rag and my face was much smoother and softer than it has been in awhile.</li>
            <li> I was charged the price more high.</li>
            <li> I give the entire experience the full 5 stars and more!  </li>
            <li> I’ll definitely keep using it twice a week because I love how fresh and cool my skin felt after using it, and I also believe it’s good for my skin since it’s all natural.</li>
            <li> my skin was a little pink which is good, it means the blood is to the surface &amp; it will leave you with bright glowing skin!</li>
            <li> The mixing is quick (and actually pretty fun!)</li>
            <li> I loved this it doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and smells like the real deal.</li>
            <li> Seller even included ebooks with different uses/recipes free!!</li>

            <li> I really like how fine the seaweed powder feels.  </li>
            <li> The Organic Seaweed Powder is good for all types of skin issues from rashes to acne and can even help dry skin!</li>
            <li> hoping that it would calm my skin.</li>
            <li> I will say its not an over night magic, but I can tell how soft my skin feels.</li>

            <li> I received a complimentary product to test.</li>

            <li> If you are sensitive to scent, make sure you add the oil</li>
            <li> i tried it with yogurt and honey, and magically my skin felt soo soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> It allows for thick application and feels incredibly indulgent when going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I left it on for the recommended 15 minutes and then washed off with warm water.</li>
            <li> So far I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really love the fact that Azara Organics make it crystal clear what is in their product and where it is from.  </li>
            <li> I could NOT believe how soft and smooth my skin was!</li>

            <li> Fantastic product; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> SOFT skin and so clean!  </li>
            <li> My skin was very soft after washing off the seaweed mixture and remained that way for several days which I loved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are so many different ingredients you can add to make it your own, they even suggest essential oils.</li>
            <li> The powder is very fine and soft, it dissolves well in water (but make sure you use more than recommended since it tends to clump up and its a bit hard to spread)</li>
            <li> Pure and organic!</li>
            <li> and I liked that my skin didn&#x27;t feel over dry and</li>
            <li> Smell is strong, but its a natural product.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I used only twice so far it looks good</li>
            <li> It is very natural and organic, and leaves your skin completely clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a chance to use it again to see better results but my boyfriend says he noticed results right after the first and only application.</li>
            <li> , it was so soft and it just had that fresh clean feeling to</li>
            <li> Great stuff, hard to take off</li>
            <li> The smell is little too much even for asian girl like me, but you feel great difference after using about  month.&lt;br /&gt;great product!</li>
            <li> , I am really interested to see how it will do all over my body since it worked quite well on my face.</li>
            <li> I added my favorite scent lemongrass to cover the odor only to find myself sickened by the smell of lemongrass now.</li>
            <li> the price and the quality amount of Seaweed Powder it contains, this product is way more affordable compared to similar brands!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have only twenty more pounds to go.  </li>
            <li> First time using it</li>
            <li> Fast shipper!</li>
            <li> The next day I think I looked even better.</li>
            <li> First, the smell of seaweed reminds me of when I went to the Rockaway Beach in my youth.</li>
            <li> A lovely seaweed powder that can be used to make facial masks and body wraps...</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Seaweed powder.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed with the results, but the mask was incredibly difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> This made my skin so smooth, and I also have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
            <li> Noticed improvement after my first application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can add a drop or two of essential oils to mask the scent.</li>
            <li> That was more than I wanted to spend for a one time facial</li>
            <li> I clearly see results and they are fantastic, I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feeling at first</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m always like that with every face mask at first.</li>
            <li> For someone who has oily skin, this has helped me SO much!</li>
            <li> It has works better than anything we have tried to decrease his back acne.</li>
            <li> I have never done a seaweed mask so this was my first experience.</li>
            <li> So you decide if you want the best pore-opening and cleaning mask or nice-smelling mediocre mask.</li>
            <li> I will choose the first one.</li>
            <li> This mask was my first seaweek mask.</li>
            <li> One thing that bothered me at first was the smell.</li>
            <li> Some tips, if you are using this only as a face mask, be sure to get ALL of your hair out of the way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it more and get back to you</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> in all, I love this seaweed powder, especially because it’s pure kelp powder and has nothing else added to it.</li>
            <li> The mask does not pull on hairs, even when coming off, and can make for a very sensual experience if you plan on giving your significant other a body mask (or making them give you one!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can check their website for more of their products.</li>
            <li> The result on my face is clean and clear.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is really nice on my sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin at all.</li>
            <li> In fact, I recently purchased a bentonite clay powder mask, a popular mask amongst natural product seekers.</li>
            <li> but you can thin to your liking by adding more water a little at a time until you have your perfect</li>
            <li> Great product the smell is intense and I did have a very small break.</li>

            <li> , just don’t let it dry and stay on for more than a shower.  </li>
            <li> It has really easy directions on mixing it and how to get the consistency you need for both the facial wrap and the body wrap.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it will do only con is the strong seaweed smell.</li>

            <li> This is a large jar and will last a good long time.</li>

            <li> smoothing it out as you go left me with a smooth, creamy mixture.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It does has a very fishy smell to it.</li>
            <li> and i had some questions which were very promptly answered.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> have very noticeable pimples on my jaw line</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but you know it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up, this becomes gloppy mud, not like the smooth store bought facial masks.</li>
            <li> bought a clay mask almost a year ago now and only used it maybe 5 times, its just too harsh for my skin, but i really wanted one I could use and I am so happy I gave this one</li>
            <li> Thanks to</li>
            <li> Very cleansing.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This seaweed mask by Azara Organics is, absolutely, the exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also mix different products into your mask, as you see fit.</li>
            <li> I found this combination was very soothing and, I believe, helped my skin to heal.</li>
            <li> My whole bathroom smelled like fish and seaweed.</li>
            <li> This really does smell like seaweed, very beachy and organic smelling.</li>
            <li> so I really had to scrub to get it off.</li>
            <li> It was very relaxing and gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> it made my face feel soft fresh and smooth especially in combination with a lotion.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It come straight from the Atlantic Ocean.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This product worked for me really well.</li>
            <li> So wash face very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Azara Organics, which is one of the most personal and professional companies I have worked with on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice green color to the soaps, plus it gives the minerals and trace elements to the soap properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It’s not a bad smell but for some it could be a little strong.</li>
            <li> I use it for face masks and it blends really well with other ingredients for a very smooth paste.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly, it is goopy and slimy and easy to spread as long as you put enough water in it and mix well, there are however some clumps that will just not come out</li>
            <li> What’s awesome about is that you only need one teaspoon of the powder to make the paste for the entire face, so it will definitely last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> and I am excited to start using this one regularly!</li>
            <li> It does smell like seaweed as I expected! :)</li>
            <li> scent is a little strong when you mix it with just water, however now I have been mixing it with Greek Yogurt and honey which helps with the smell a lot, it doesn&#x27;t feel quite as refreshing going on, but the results are still great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think for some of you, this will be the answer you&#x27;re looking for - especially if you are looking for a full body mask, but it just wasn&#x27;t something my skin really needs in it&#x27;s regimen.</li>
            <li> through a little trial and error I&#x27;ve found that a bowl with a wide bottom surface and a simple pastry brush works wonderfully...</li>
            <li> I also found that starting with a small amount of very warm liquid, add the powder as you would flour to a cake recipe...</li>
            <li> The next thing I&#x27;m trying is a full body wrap</li>
            <li> I only tried it once with just plain filtered water and skin seems to feel more smooth after using this mask.</li>
            <li> The seaweed powder comes straight from the Atlantic Ocean and to keep it 100% pure, no attempt has been made to mask the natural aroma of seaweed.</li>
            <li> More water or less powder will make a runnier consistency that will take longer to harden and vice versa.</li>
            <li> If you wish to go to their main site it is located here: http://azaraorganics.com/. You can also go here to get idea&#x27;s on how to do their body</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference from this particular seaweed mask compared to others I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but I plan on soaking in the bath with it next to see if it is better than using it as a face mask.  </li>
            <li> Need to use more only have done one facial anf</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at it being here that fast.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend scenting this stuff with something when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seaweed powder made my face extremely soft after using it one time (I have oily skin) and it did not make me break out afterwards like many other products have.</li>
            <li> The key is to add it to warm not hot water.</li>
            <li> so I may be used to it a little more then some</li>
            <li> As I worked the recipe to the creamy consistency I was looking for, I ended up with a little more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used this as a facial mask and my skin felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Spas use this all the time, but you will pay through the nose for one treatment - with this jar you can make a lot of masks easily and not have to spend the money or wear the mask in front of other people.  </li>
            <li> and application is just as easy as any other mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer to use natural products as much as I can.</li>
            <li> So many uses, but this one really helps skin dexterity in the face, abdomen, arms, legs, any of your trouble areas!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for something completely natural that works!</li>
            <li> normally then I mixed a teaspoon of the seaweed powder with a little honey and some warm water, and applied it to my face, neck, and decollete with a fan brush.</li>
            <li> it is very simple just take a little powder and add warm water and then apply.</li>
            <li> so I new that would happen.</li>
            <li> This is just the case with this Azara Organics Organic Seaweed Powder, something totally new in my beauty world.</li>
            <li> Its almost completely gone and nothing new has popped up!</li>
            <li> great, little clumpy but made my face feel tight and soft.</li>
            <li> and I had to make sure my washcloth was really wet several times</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;ve lived by the ocean my entire life, it really doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li> also it made my face very soft .</li>
            <li> Because of that, it had a nice exfoliating quality (although I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really supposed to) and it left my skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li> makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li> It mixes pretty easily and I like that it wasn&#x27;t confusing.</li>
            <li> I have used it first on my upper thighs.</li>
            <li> felt really soft!</li>
            <li> my skin came out so smooth and soft that it&#x27;s a regular part of the facial routine now.  </li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice is the smell I actually like the smell of seaweed</li>
            <li> NATURAL!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who likes to do things naturally!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> When I first opened it you could definitely smell the seaweed.</li>
            <li> is that it’s completely natural!</li>
            <li> I am anxious to use again, but next time I am going to look into some other&#x27;s comments on how they were able to make it spread more smoothly/evenly.  </li>
            <li> mask works better than any mask I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my skin so soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> but it has helped his back so much!</li>
            <li> It smells a little strong, (like the ocean)</li>
            <li> By the time I wet my hair and massaged my scalp then rinsed out the seaweed, it did leave both my scalp and hair extremely clean and soft, but the ocean smell remained.  </li>
            <li> By the time I wet my hair and massaged my scalp then rinsed out the seaweed, it did leave both my scalp and hair extremely clean and soft, but the ocean smell remained.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always down to try something new, even if it seems wacky or different.</li>
            <li> but I used the Seaweed powder (has a light smell not very strong to me) with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve found myself looking for natural alternatives to my more conventional, and often harmful, products.</li>
            <li> but i will try put a little bit more water next time</li>
            <li> It helped to clear up my pimps and break outs.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really clear up my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt it either.  </li>
            <li> It helps clear out</li>
            <li> Makes skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-achieve soft, supple skin</li>
            <li> Not perfumey and all natural</li>
            <li> My wife says this is like something you would get at a professional spa.</li>
            <li> I tried out the face mask recipe they provided &amp; it made my face clear, soft &amp; it literally gave me a glowing feeling.</li>
            <li> Use this with the Natural Escentials Bentonite Clay Mask.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this facial mask product.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I mixed the powder with Apple cider vinegar and the smell was a bit much</li>
            <li> mixed the mixture in the lid because you don’t need much of it.</li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I also suffer from eczema and have found this product gentle enough to use over my problem areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised I found this.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and it does work</li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive to perfume</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try and product that was 100% natural</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about ten minutes you can really feel it hardening and tightening your skin, you may also get itchy.</li>
            <li> It is a natural product and has the natural scent.</li>
            <li> but it did make my face really soft even after just one application.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me, but if you are really sensitive to smells, this may turn you off.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And tried 2 times in a week so far.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> and it is fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it enough to rate it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several high-quality organic seaweeds and this is a firm favorite.</li>
            <li> You can always add a few drops of essential oils (like lavender) to make it smell better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK if you can get it to stick to your face long enough to dry.  </li>
            <li> I found a few other facial powders that seemed good</li>
            <li> The smell is odd but not bad.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with the facial mask idea they provided on their main site.</li>
            <li> This comes in a large 8oz jar which is PLENTY of powder to do your face once a week or a full body wrap since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you find this aroma too strong, you may choose to add a few drops of an essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now that I know that this is a small up and coming company, I’ll be reordering once I deplete this (huge) supply of powder.</li>
            <li> Seaweed is a great skincare ingredient, and a lot of body wraps and masks are made of seaweed but are very expensive.  </li>
            <li> i liked it for my face, although when it came to the body wrap portion (which is the reason i really bought it in the beginning) it didn&#x27;t stick to my skin, i added water like the website told me too and bought all of the ingredients, disappointed with the body wrap part but other than that, it left my face extremely soft and smooth and i have very sensitive skin !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost ten pounds in two weeks on my new regimen, including the wrap.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, trying to remove it was a real challenge, and I ended cleaning up the entire bathroom when I was done.</li>
            <li> It did and left it soft not dried out.  </li>
            <li> From what I have read here, it treats a whole array of problems and the results are different for different people.</li>
            <li> I just use any kind of floral water instead of plain water and that helps a little.</li>
            <li> Like but not love due to the very strong seaweed odor.  </li>
            <li> I love that there are not many ingredients and with minimal ingredients to make your skin soft.</li>
            <li> but, as with anything new; be sure to test on a small area under the soft part of your arm for a few hours before using the web recipes...</li>
            <li> You do not need a lot at one time and the jar is large, so it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> So, I decided to use it the body wrap way for my husband on his back for his back acne and WOW!!</li>
            <li> If the exuberant amount may be returned, I stay with the product; otherwise, I&#x27;ll return it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen a reduction in pore size, oiliness and just generally I wake up in the morning and my skin looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it 3 different ways so far.</li>
            <li> I feel years younger and have a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I was not really expecting much from this product, but after just one use I can already see some results.</li>
            <li> So far I am noticing my skin is not as only</li>
            <li> Have only used 1 time so far.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel fresh and firm after I used it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell since it smell weird with seaweed.</li>
            <li> If you accidentally drop some powder, cleanup is nearly effortless - just run the vacuum.</li>
            <li> The only complaint someone might have is the strong smell of seaweed.</li>
            <li> and I noticed right away that my skin was not as dried out as it was.</li>
            <li> and it did arrive prior to the projected delivery date; no extraneous packaging and no hidden damages in-transit.</li>
            <li> and it did arrive prior to the projected delivery date; no extraneous packaging and no hidden damages in-transit.</li>
            <li> it feels minty on the face other than that i Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference after a week</li>
            <li> Having your mask in powder form allows for easy storage, WAY more applications out of one tub (money saver!), and a very long lifespan of the product - I have found with other powders that these products almost never go bad and have to be thrown out.</li>
            <li> Seaweed leave the skin firm and toned soft to the touch for a whole week after using, once a week wrapped in Saran wrap and then suit up with one of those plastic gym suites for about an hour or two and then into the shower</li>
            <li> Next time I use this powder, I’ll extend the “facial” to my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;; it soothes and smoothes my (mature) skin.  </li>
            <li> Next time I use this powder, I’ll extend the “facial” to my neck and décolleté; it soothes and smoothes my (mature) skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may look a little funny, but after it hardened</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first but that quickly changed after the first application.</li>
            <li> I bought it a week ago, I have been using it for six straight days because it removes all the redness that I got from using other products especially acne products.</li>
            <li> People complained about the smell but its really not bad at all</li>
            <li> have never used or even had a mask done before this, but anyone with dry skin, rosacea, and early signs of aging can use this mask and it will help.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty messy, that&#x27;s why only four stars.</li>
            <li> Luckily I started with a small amount of powder so the little bit of waste was worth the lesson.  </li>
            <li> I added a few drops of tea tree oil which made the smell more subtle.</li>
            <li> You should be able to get at least 16 masks from this one jar, and at the price of $17.95, that is a little over $1.00 per mask!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the mask my skin turned a little pink</li>
            <li> Using it as just a facial mask, it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t leave the mask on as long the next time.  </li>
            <li> The paste itself is pretty thick</li>
            <li> The smell is not great but not bad.  </li>
            <li> Besides it&#x27;s only on until it dry&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> that your skin won’t have any irritations and it actually helps to reduce the redness as well as other skin irritations especially if you add some aloe to it.</li>
            <li> more benefits (especially the smell - this mask and the powder have a bit of an earthy smell, but definitely not a sea-like or fishy smell) than the bentonite clay mask (which has no smell), and is easily removed from your face or body (the bentonite clay mask can be exceptionally painful and difficult to remove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an aloe vera plant and decided to put some aloe vera into the mask after having suffered a minor sunburn.</li>
            <li> And try to stay in the bathroom with the door closed when you have the mask and open the window or turn on the exhaust fan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not difficult to try five different products and find that none of them will hold up to the standard left behind by my previous products.</li>
            <li> If I stay on this path, it shouldn&#x27;t take long at all!</li>
            <li> so removal is a little difficult, but just take your time and be sure not to scrub your skin too vigorously.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to mixing the seaweed powder with other essential oils and some aloe</li>
            <li> Pat your skin dry.</li>
            <li> and I have found that the mask adds hydration to my dry spots and helps to control oil elsewhere.</li>
            <li> so it did dry a bit</li>
            <li> I applied it to my face and let it dry and then washed it off.</li>
            <li> These bitter winters can be rough on a lady&#x27;s skin but a seaweed facial mask can help repair the damage.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the seaweed smell.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Once my skin dried it was the softest I have ever felt it in a LONG time, the only feeling I can attribute it to is like after getting a Microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been looking for healthy organic ways to treat the slow painful process of looking older.  </li>
            <li> Found it really hard to mix and get it to blend completely.</li>
            <li> As an initial tryout, I only used cold tap water and mixed it in a plastic (used to be for hair dye but only used it once) mixing bowl with a silicone bristled (hair dye brush only used once) brush.  </li>
            <li> but I expected that since I know what seaweed smells like.  </li>
            <li> You could additionally add a few drops of an essential oil or even honey to it which has a moisturizing effect on the skin.</li>
            <li> and I went about my day remotely working from home.  </li>
            <li> and I went about my day remotely working from home.  </li>
            <li> so that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> It says on the container that they do not mask the scent of seaweed and if it&#x27;s too overpowering you can add a few drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li> but when I removed the mask, it had gently exfoliated my skin (including my lips where I sloppily overapplied).</li>
            <li> A little bit of this, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> opposing my part, not the product due to leaving it on about 10 minutes longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> will try the body wrap as other reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical when I applied this to my face.</li>
            <li> I used this for a facial mask and did not experience any negative reactions.</li>
            <li> I actually added 3 teaspoons of water to it so it wouldn&#x27;t be too thick</li>
            <li> so I put it all over my neck, collar bone and down to the breast line...</li>
            <li> put it on my skin and laying down to relax while it did what it was suppose to.</li>
            <li> After about 10 - 15 minutes its time to take it off (I go for 20 because I am lazy and want it to be totally dry)</li>
            <li> Next I tried as a morning recipe; Organic Orange Juice and a couple of very small drops of Tea Tree Oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll bet you can&#x27;t pronounce half the words on the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant to try powder masks, thinking that they would be difficult and time consuming to mix up and apply, but I could not have been more wrong.</li>
            <li> You feel pampered in less than a half hour.</li>
            <li> the smell is expected and it got a little dry and hard to put after a few minutes</li>
            <li> The only other wisdom I can impart is that even if you&#x27;re making a very small batch, resist the urge to default to a small bowl for mixing...</li>
            <li> The powder itself is a dark green color in a plastic jar.</li>
            <li> I felt my skin tight</li>
            <li> Not sure how other manufactures compare,</li>
            <li> Mine came out a little clumpy but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Like the product but the smell is a little offsetting when putting on your face</li>
            <li> I decided to mix the powder with a little bit of honey and some peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> There are seaweed powders that are far less expensive.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so firm and tight after each use.</li>
            <li> It does smell nasty- just like seaweed, but I added a couple drops of essential oils and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I imagine you could make a mask everyday of the month if you wanted too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and stinky but</li>
            <li> but I have tried a few.  </li>
            <li> : I smell like a dead fish...</li>
            <li> I really disliked the smell.</li>
            <li> I chilled out with a glass of wine while the mask dried</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for a few months.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this on my scalp and hair as a cleansing/conditioner a few times a week to address my seborrheic dermatitis symptoms.  </li>
            <li> It is a dark green color and almost looks like baby food!</li>
            <li> the smell is not strong at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong smell anyway.</li>
            <li> but it really does not smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Dump the seaweed powder into a small bowl, and add 1 tablespoon lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> I usually use Bentonite, Rhassoul Clay, Amla Clay on my face</li>
            <li> instructions for mixing and using this mask are just to mix the seaweed powder with lukewarm water with a fork in a small bowl until desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I used it I didn&#x27;t have any essential oils on hand</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but I didn&#x27;t smell anything?</li>
            <li> My face also felt very firm</li>
            <li> With the weather being so extremely cold and windy lately the skin on my face has gotten very dry and rough.</li>
            <li> It was a little tough to wash off</li>
            <li> Stays lumpy and then of course is hard to place on face.</li>
            <li> how hard is that.</li>
            <li> but once I looked at the ingredients list they had all kinds of stuff in them that I could hardly pronounce</li>
            <li> It was a little clumpy and some parts felt really thin since I am used to thicker mud masks.  </li>
            <li> Wear an old t-shirt you don’t mind smelling so bad.</li>
            <li> It really stinks, and not all of the essential oils in the world could change it.</li>
            <li> I make facial masks, cold process soap, and melt &amp; pour soap, and this works well in all three.</li>
            <li> Mix with a fork, adding up to another tablespoon of lukewarm water, as needed, to achieve a thick, paste-like consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Add 1 teaspoon Aloe Vera gel, 1 teaspoon honey — or both — to the paste.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the jar calls for 1 tsp seaweed to 2 tsp water but the result is too thick.  </li>
            <li> The smell is awful but definately worth it!</li>
            <li> Very thick and hard to mix well.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that smells like fish...</li>
            <li> duh!</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty pungent, but it is seaweed and isn&#x27;t horrible once it&#x27;s on your face.</li>
            <li> In the past some mask have proven difficult to remove but not this one, there was no scrubbing needed.</li>
            <li> i mean it smells like you just rubbed a fish on your face!..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product just a few times, but can see results already!!!</li>
            <li> They will also not get crusty or leave behind residue.</li>

            <li> Makes skin so soft.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic straight from the Atlantic, thank you for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> I have received this in a fast time. I was very surprised at it being here that fast. I am using it as a body wrap. I have a lot of scars. Many from surgeries and people. I have used it first on my upper thighs. I will say its not an over night magic, but I can tell how soft my skin feels. After 3 days I decided to use it on my thighs,hips, and stomach. I really am in love with this.  I know that it will take a bit, but after the next day of me using this, I feel so good.  I would buy more.  A little bit of this, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft after washing off the seaweed mixture and remained that way for several days which I loved. I personally liked the smell of the seaweed (it reminded me of the ocean) and I liked that my skin didn&#x27;t feel over dry and like it was cracking like it does with clay based masks. It was a little tough to wash off and I had to make sure my washcloth was really wet several times but it wasn&#x27;t overly grainy like it would be if I was using a walnut based mask and I really really liked that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with the facial mask idea they provided on their main site. If you wish to go to their main site it is located here: http://azaraorganics.com/. You can also go here to get idea&#x27;s on how to do their body mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what the directions said for the mask I chose to make:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Dump the seaweed powder into a small bowl, and add 1 tablespoon lukewarm water. Mix with a fork, adding up to another tablespoon of lukewarm water, as needed, to achieve a thick, paste-like consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Add 1 teaspoon Aloe Vera gel, 1 teaspoon honey — or both — to the paste. Stir until well mixed. Add more water, if needed, to achieve the desired texture. You can also skip these ingredients entirely if you so desire, although the aloe helps heal any skin irritation you may have and the honey adds to the moisturizing effect of the mask and acts as a preservative.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Apply the seaweed mask to your face, leave in place for up to 20 minutes and rinse off with lukewarm water. Pat your skin dry. Use this mask up to twice a week as part of your regular beauty routine.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many different ingredients you can add to make it your own, they even suggest essential oils. The sky is truly the limit. I decided to put in Aloe Vera gel &amp; honey. I will admit, I despised the smell. However, once I added the honey and Aloe Vera gel it smelled amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may look a little funny, but after it hardened and I took it off my face felt really soft! It also felt so cool from adding the Aloe Vera. I really like the fact that there is no GMO&#x27;s or Paraben&#x27;s in this product, which is a must for me. It&#x27;s nice to know what I am putting on my face is not only feeling good, but is good for it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a facial mask with amazing benefits, unlike no other than this is the mask to go with. Next on my list is to try the body mask, I am really interested to see how it will do all over my body since it worked quite well on my face. It say&#x27;s it is great for cellulite, and is often used as a cellulite treatment. Also, you get a ton of product! I imagine you could make a mask everyday of the month if you wanted too. I&#x27;ve been told it makes 48 masks, give or take.</li>
            <li> Seaweed is a great skincare ingredient, and a lot of body wraps and masks are made of seaweed but are very expensive.  Azara has brought out a powder that you can use to make your own wraps and masks!  And the best part is that you save money and know what you are getting.  Spas use this all the time, but you will pay through the nose for one treatment - with this jar you can make a lot of masks easily and not have to spend the money or wear the mask in front of other people.  It only takes 1 Tbsp of the powder mixed with 2 Tbsp warm water and apply the mixture to your face, wait about 15 minutes and then wash off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used or even had a mask done before this, but anyone with dry skin, rosacea, and early signs of aging can use this mask and it will help.  It feels nice and cool when you are applying it, and when you wash it off it leaves your skin feeling so soft and silky.  You should be able to get at least 16 masks from this one jar, and at the price of $17.95, that is a little over $1.00 per mask!  Tell me you can go to a spa and get one of these masks for even the $17.95 - it just won&#x27;t happen.  So stay in the comfort in your own home and make your skin feel SO good.  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels after this face mask.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. I bought it for face masks and body wraps. I think it works but it stinks. I added my favorite scent lemongrass to cover the odor only to find myself sickened by the smell of lemongrass now. It&#x27;s messy and stinky but dangit it works. I suggest if you don&#x27;t mind odors of seaweed then this is for you...</li>
            <li> I loved this it doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin it leaves it really smooth especially for those people who have acne like me it helped with my acne and it just makes your skin look refreshed also the smell is not strong at all i use it twice  a week works great i actually told my sister about it now she has it and she also loves it i would highly recommend this product..love love loveeee it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve tried every Kelp powder on the market but I have tried a few.  This is by far my favorite! It comes as a very fine silky powder in a generous sized jar for the price.  Besides the silky powder consistency, it&#x27;s pure and organic so what ever recipe you decide to try, and there are tons out on the web...there are no nasty chemicals to interfere or react to your ingredients.  I&#x27;ve tried it 3 different ways so far. First just the powder and some warm water...the aroma is mild, not over powering at all (having said that, I grew up close to the beach so I may be used to it a little more then some so you&#x27;ll have to judge that one for yourself).  Next I tried as a morning recipe; Organic Orange Juice and a couple of very small drops of Tea Tree Oil.  The combination of the citrus, Tea Tree and the aroma of the Sea was exhilarating...the only thing I&#x27;d recommend when using another type of liquid is to warm it up (just like the instruction said...duh! :)). I didn&#x27;t so had to start the mixture over to get it to smooth out. Luckily I started with a small amount of powder so the little bit of waste was worth the lesson.  As I worked the recipe to the creamy consistency I was looking for, I ended up with a little more then I needed for my face so I put it all over my neck, collar bone and down to the breast line...what an awesome mistake that turned out to be... my skin came out so smooth and soft that it&#x27;s a regular part of the facial routine now.  The last recipe I tried was adding a drop of Lavender and Chamomile Oil to the warm water mixture for an evening routine... just awesome...so relaxing, I felt like I was at a spa (...but, as with anything new; be sure to test on a small area under the soft part of your arm for a few hours before using the web recipes...everyone&#x27;s skin is different).  The only other wisdom I can impart is that even if you&#x27;re making a very small batch, resist the urge to default to a small bowl for mixing...through a little trial and error I&#x27;ve found that a bowl with a wide bottom surface and a simple pastry brush works wonderfully...I also found that starting with a small amount of very warm liquid, add the powder as you would flour to a cake recipe...smoothing it out as you go left me with a smooth, creamy mixture.  I like mine on the thicker side but you can thin to your liking by adding more water a little at a time until you have your perfect mixture.&lt;br /&gt;Last, I haven&#x27;t had a need to test their customer service skills for a concern or return but if their follow-up on the initial sale is any indicator then I would have to say an all-star service in my opinion.  They&#x27;re a small company with an awesome product and what looks to be a genuine interest in their customers concerns and opinions.  I give the entire experience the full 5 stars and more!  The next thing I&#x27;m trying is a full body wrap so I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I purchased this product! I use it mostly as face masks. It is very easy to make and easy to apply. My skin is glowing. I work night shifts, and always struggle to keep my skin looking fresh! Finally I found how!</li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice is the smell I actually like the smell of seaweed but it can be strong for some. I love that all the products are organic and pure. I usually use Bentonite, Rhassoul Clay, Amla Clay on my face but I thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the benefits of seaweed?&lt;br /&gt;-Revitalizes age defying mask&lt;br /&gt;-achieve soft, supple skin&lt;br /&gt;-detox the body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: 1 tablespoon seaweed, 2 tablespoons of water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you leave the product on for 15 minutes you will notice a difference my face looks clean and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution: Do not keep this product on your face longer than 15 minutes. I kept it on my face for about 30 minutes and my face was very red and sore so please only leave it on for the suggested amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the product and I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> It works great and leaves my face feel really smooth and clean!&lt;br /&gt;For the price and the quality amount of Seaweed Powder it contains, this product is way more affordable compared to similar brands!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product!!!    So far so good... I bought it a week ago, I have been using it for six straight days because it removes all the redness that I got from using other products especially acne products. I also minimize my acne in my cheek and chin area... I hope to see more improvements so that I could update you    update!!!   I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months now and my skin looks really good. After using it my skin looks hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li> I use my seaweed powder in my homemade body wrap recipe.  The wraps are working!  I&#x27;ve lost ten pounds in two weeks on my new regimen, including the wrap.  I&#x27;m excited to reach my goal!  I have only twenty more pounds to go.  If I stay on this path, it shouldn&#x27;t take long at all!</li>
            <li> Great product the smell is intense and I did have a very small break. I&#x27;m a esthetician so I new that would happen. I did not cut it with a oil</li>
            <li> My face is glowing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Seaweed facial mask &amp; body wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simply amazing. It is so simple to use and the results are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it is ORGANIC! NATURAL! This is a winner! My face is glowing.. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to do things naturally! Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. My face is left clean and fresh. I feel years younger and have a natural glow. Not perfumey and all natural</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product &amp; service</li>
            <li> Love all natural products.def a must.</li>
            <li> I had a wonderful experience with Azara Organics. My product showed up on time and was not damaged. This seaweed powder made my face extremely soft after using it one time (I have oily skin) and it did not make me break out afterwards like many other products have. The smell is great; just like at the beach! This was a great buy and I would definitely order from Azara Organics again!!</li>
            <li> Be sure to not go over time or you may have some burning, redness and swelling...opposing my part, not the product due to leaving it on about 10 minutes longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife says this is like something you would get at a professional spa. She likes how it makes her face feel. She has used the lemongrass essential oil, which she says helps by adding a couple drops in the mix prior to the facial.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty amazing, most state that the smell is fishy, well what would you expect from seaweed that is treated with a bunch of harmful chemicals. I was not really expecting much from this product, but after just one use I can already see some results. Not sure how other manufactures compare, but I know for sure I will keep buying this. I have recommended this product to all of my friends and co-workers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CWDaly</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it will do only con is the strong seaweed smell.</li>
            <li> Very thick and hard to mix well.</li>
            <li> Loved the product! I use this in my body wraps and it works great! Will definitely be buying from here again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> First time using it so we&#x27;ll see how it goes but I used the Seaweed powder (has a light smell not very strong to me) with apple cider vinegar and I can feel it cleansing. Mine came out a little clumpy but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. And to prepare it I used a disposable cup and fork and it was easy.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars! It came in on time, the owner is polite &amp; truly cares about her customers &amp; would take time out of her schedule to make sure your satisfied! I tried out the face mask recipe they provided &amp; it made my face clear, soft &amp; it literally gave me a glowing feeling.</li>
            <li> It smell like the ocean you can tell it is seaweed</li>
            <li> Use this with the Natural Escentials Bentonite Clay Mask. It does has a very fishy smell to it. I think the benefits outweigh the smell. Besides it&#x27;s only on until it dry&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts!  But I love this stuff. . The odor is maskable. I just use essential oils.  I use in as masks and wraps mostly.  Have even just used to detox in the bath.  Simple&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it lasts!</li>
            <li> I love it! It makes my skin feel so good! People complained about the smell but its really not bad at all</li>
            <li> Pros: It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I smell like a dead fish...&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great but for a sensitive sniffer like mine, I strongly recommend to use with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once but it made my skin feel great. The smell is pretty pungent, but it is seaweed and isn&#x27;t horrible once it&#x27;s on your face.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Also my daughter used it before me and she told me how impress she was, after feeling her skin.</li>
            <li> Lovely product and delivered promptly</li>
            <li> Is a good product. The only bad thing is that smells like fish... i mean it smells like you just rubbed a fish on your face!..lol... but the product works great, it leaves my face smooth and glowing. What i started doing is adding a drop of lemon essential oil so it wont smell like Shamu just died on my face! But i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, hard to take off but my skin feels amazing!!</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d done my research sooner.There are seaweed powders that are far less expensive. I wish I&#x27;d waited and not bought this one.</li>
            <li> This is so great. I really disliked the smell. However, I started using it with my lavender oil and it smells wonderful. You can use it as a face mask or make a wrap out of it to help tighten and gone your skin. You can even take a bath in it. Just please note that if you can&#x27;t handle the scent, please add a essential body oil to your bath tub as well.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.loved the way my skin felt after application.great customer service too.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this facial mask product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I love it.  Here are the formula that I use for facial mask.  I leave on for 30 mins then washing off with warm water.  The only down side is the seaweed smell.&lt;br /&gt;1 tea spoon seaweed powder&lt;br /&gt;3 tea spoon milk&lt;br /&gt;1 egg yoke&lt;br /&gt;1 tea spoon Goya extra virgin Oliver Oil</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference from this particular seaweed mask compared to others I have used.</li>
            <li> what more is there to say about organic seaweed with its benefits!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to make my body wraps and its amazing you should try it somtime.</li>
            <li> Found it really hard to mix and get it to blend completely. Stays lumpy and then of course is hard to place on face.</li>
            <li> it feels minty on the face other than that i Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference after a week</li>
            <li> Great product and even greater customer service!! I received a personalized email from the company as soon as the product was delivered and i had some questions which were very promptly answered.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, on the very first use as face pack, could feel the difference making my face extremely soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff .I have very noticeable pimples on my jaw line I used this,by the next day the majority of them were gone also it made my face very soft . It does have kinda a strong oder of seaweed ,  but I didn&#x27;t mind it. Just make sure you follow the directions and don&#x27;t go over the time limit :)</li>
            <li> Worked great and help clean my skin, I added coconut oil and lavender. Worked great on my skin and I have eczema. It helped to clear up my pimps and break outs.</li>
            <li> Bought this powder for my mom...she uses it with Spirulina powder and says it gives her a lot of energy!</li>
            <li> Didnt love the smell. Nice in bath though</li>
            <li> Wow! This facial mask works great! I have used it several times and my skin is glowing. It definitely smells of seaweed, which is comforting since the product is organic. I can&#x27;t wait to try it as a body wrap.</li>
            <li> I have already ordered 3 and my patients love the results.</li>
            <li> This is really nice. It makes your skin so soft. The smell is strong but that is to be expected. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is really nice on my sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin at all. Also I love how it is made with one ingredient and organic. It feels good on my face and leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product would reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Fast shipper! So many uses, but this one really helps skin dexterity in the face, abdomen, arms, legs, any of your trouble areas! Love it!</li>
            <li> I received the organic seaweed powder&lt;br /&gt;I want send me moor skincare organic carem thank you</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a good skin toner, but this product was not the best for me. It really stinks, and not all of the essential oils in the world could change it. Secondly, trying to remove it was a real challenge, and I ended cleaning up the entire bathroom when I was done. There has to be a better way.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic mask! Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it according to the direction, it&#x27;s easy. It does has a strong seaweed smell but it does not bother me. The result on my face is clean and clear. will try the body wrap as other reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I was a little skeptical at first but that quickly changed after the first application. Literally! My skin looked and felt great after the very first time using it! Definitely recommend it and plan on buying more!&lt;br /&gt;Mona B</li>
            <li> This seaweed powder makes my skin feel wonderful. It tingles when it is on and I look like I just left the spa for a facial after I wash it off. Came quickly when I ordered it too! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this seaweed powder and this seller!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Really strong smell but goes on easily and you can feel it working. Just wish I can get over the smell. Even after a shower I kept smelling that sea smell.</li>
            <li> Have only tried once since I recieved it a week ago. I mixed the powder with Apple cider vinegar and the smell was a bit much but I&#x27;m excited to see results.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  My skin is glowing and looks healthier!</li>
            <li> It works well but the scent is very strong.</li>
            <li> Seaweed leave the skin firm and toned soft to the touch for a whole week after using, once a week wrapped in Saran wrap and then suit up with one of those plastic gym suites for about an hour or two and then into the shower Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Will buy again</li>
            <li> i liked it for my face, although when it came to the body wrap portion (which is the reason i really bought it in the beginning) it didn&#x27;t stick to my skin, i added water like the website told me too and bought all of the ingredients, disappointed with the body wrap part but other than that, it left my face extremely soft and smooth and i have very sensitive skin !</li>
            <li> very strong smell but you know it is the real thing. Just add oil if the smell gets to you.&lt;br /&gt;I would order again</li>
            <li> Smell is strong, but its a natural product.  Love the results!</li>
            <li> I have used it twice in a week with the recipes that were provided online. So far I am noticing my skin is not as only and it does feel fresh when I remove the mask.  So far so good with the facials now I will try the body wrap!</li>
            <li> Excellent seaweed powder! This is powder that you can just add water to or add to your own recipes of scrubs. Its ingredients are pure organic kelp powder harvested from the Atlantic Ocean. It does smell nasty- just like seaweed, but I added a couple drops of essential oils and it was fine. The company is also very nice and emails you about your order shipment and they also send you recipes of how to use. Just a heads up, this becomes gloppy mud, not like the smooth store bought facial masks. It just takes a couple minutes to get used to how to put it on efficiently. I have only tried facial masks but  I plan on putting it in my body scrubs I make and also plan on using it in a body wrap. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product just a few times, but can see results already!!! The seaweed smell isn&#x27;t a problem for me, as it reminds me of the ocean that I love. It&#x27;s not a strong smell anyway. I prefer to use natural products as much as I can. I&#x27;ve also used this as a facial mask and my skin felt so clean and soft. This is a multi tasking product that works!</li>
            <li> Love love love it! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Great product</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Shipping was prompt and product was as detailed!! Seller even included ebooks with different uses/recipes free!!</li>
            <li> Like the product but the smell is a little offsetting when putting on your face but then again it is seaweed.</li>
            <li> I only used this one time but there are 2 uses in each container. It smells weird, well like seaweed. I didn&#x27;t have a chance to use it again to see better results but my boyfriend says he noticed results right after the first and only application. The next day I think I looked even better.</li>
            <li> Really nice! I really like it!! The smell is little too much even for asian girl like me, but you feel great difference after using about  month.&lt;br /&gt;great product!</li>
            <li> Smells horrible but it left my skin looking and feeling BEAUTIFUL! It really stinks though and it&#x27;s pretty messy, that&#x27;s why only four stars.</li>
            <li> It does have a really bad smell but I expected that since I know what seaweed smells like.  It doesn&#x27;t really clear up my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt it either.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but I plan on soaking in the bath with it next to see if it is better than using it as a face mask.  Good price though.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a paste</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved using this mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a clay mask almost a year ago now and only used it maybe 5 times, its just too harsh for my skin, but i really wanted one I could use and I am so happy I gave this one a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has a strong smell of seaweed, which I absolutely love! it felt so nice, and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier! my skin feels great and I am excited to start using this one regularly!</li>
            <li> Skin feels great afterwards</li>
            <li> This seaweed powder is EXCELLENT! The aroma is lovely and light (NO seaweed stink), and when you use it on your skin as a mask, etc., it leaves a wonderfully pleasant cooling sensation that literally feels like an ocean breeze as it cleanses your pores. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been looking for healthy organic ways to treat the slow painful process of looking older.  Azara Organics is now going to be one of them.  Azara Organics has put their heart in soul into making this product.  It is 100% organic derived from quality seaweed from the Northern Atlantic Ocean.  It is tested on a constant basis for quality and Azara will even show you the reports if requested.  Think about all the things we use on our faces to stay younger.  Look in your medicine cabinet right now, check the ingredient&#x27;s on your beauty products.  I&#x27;ll bet you can&#x27;t pronounce half the words on the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was simple enough to use.  Combine 1 teaspoon of the seaweed powder with 2 teaspoons of warm water.  You have the option to add a couple drops of essential oil.  Here is the important part.  Remember this product is made out of seaweed.  Well unless you don&#x27;t have a nose, your gonna notice a smell.  If you are sensitive to scent, make sure you add the oil or you won&#x27;t like the aroma.  After you have created the mixture, apply it to your face.  After about 10-15 minutes, wash off with warm water. I followed the above directions with the exception of adding the essential oils.  Despite the scent, the mask was cooling and soothing.  After removing the mask my skin felt rejuvenated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also make a facial or body scrub with this seaweed powder.&lt;br /&gt;•1/4 cup Olive Oil&lt;br /&gt;•3 tbsp ground Azara Organics Seaweed Powder&lt;br /&gt;•1/4 cup Sea Salt&lt;br /&gt;•1 drop Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;Mix together preferably in a mason jar to save leftovers for later use.﻿&lt;br /&gt;(would have gotten five stars except for the smell.  I should have purchased essential oils to put in it)&lt;br /&gt;*I rec&#x27;d product via Tomoson for my 100% honest opinion*</li>
            <li> I love this product. First, the smell of seaweed reminds me of when I went to the Rockaway Beach in my youth. The immediate smell of the Atlatantic is a great mreminder of my youth.  My skin feels so firm and tight after each use. To enhance the qaulity is to add some essential oils to change the scent. I love that there are not many ingredients and with minimal ingredients to make your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Very finely milled.  Dissolves well in lotions and oils.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it you could definitely smell the seaweed. It’s not a bad smell but for some it could be a little strong. For me it reminded the smell of an ocean that had seaweed washed ashore, so I kinda like the earthy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about it is that it’s completely natural! It’s certified USDA pure organic kelp powder harvested from the Atlantic Ocean. The seaweed powder comes straight from the Atlantic Ocean and to keep it 100% pure, no attempt has been made to mask the natural aroma of seaweed. If you find this aroma too strong, you may choose to add a few drops of an essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the mixture in the lid because you don’t need much of it. I combined 1 teaspoon of seaweed powder and 2 teaspoons of warm water. I actually added 3 teaspoons of water to it so it wouldn&#x27;t be too thick and it would be easier to apply to the face. You could additionally add a few drops of an essential oil or even honey to it which has a moisturizing effect on the skin. What’s awesome about is that you only need one teaspoon of the powder to make the paste for the entire face, so it will definitely last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once applied it felt pretty good on my face. The paste itself is pretty thick but it’s really simple to apply. After about 5 minutes in it started hardening and gave a nice cooling sensation to the skin. I left it on for abut 15 minutes and then washed it off. My face felt awesome after that, it was so soft and it just had that fresh clean feeling to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this seaweed powder, especially because it’s pure kelp powder and has nothing else added to it. Thanks to that your skin won’t have any irritations and it actually helps to reduce the redness as well as other skin irritations especially if you add some aloe to it. Seaweed itself has a lot of other health benefits, so I think it’s a great product to add to your beauty regime. I’ll definitely keep using it twice a week because I love how fresh and cool my skin felt after using it, and I also believe it’s good for my skin since it’s all natural. Definitely recommend it!ause I love how fresh and cool my skin felt after using it, and I also believe it’s good for my skin since it’s all natural. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It&#x27;s easy to use and smells like the real deal. All though...make sure you wipe good cause it&#x27;ll leave a green yellowish residue. I do love that it comes from the Atlantic. And that it is organic. Also, the one thing I noticed is it doesn&#x27;t tell you how often to apply on the jar. Can&#x27;t complain though. As I got this as a product for review deal.</li>
            <li> A lovely seaweed powder that can be used to make facial masks and body wraps...it arrived in a nice container ready to go. I have yet to use it (saving it for a rainy/snowy day) but I am excited about the organic ingredients and amazing qualities that will purify my skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful face mask. Very cleansing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Got rid of the wrinkles under my eyes in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Like but not love due to the very strong seaweed odor.  I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll get used&lt;br /&gt;to it.</li>
            <li> I have used this more than once with good success on senstive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having used a seaweed mask before, I was intrigued by my sample for review. I wish I had more time and energy to devote to my skin but this made it fairly easy to do while soaking in the bath. For me, showering with a washcloth and buffing the mask away seems to work well and keeps it out of my eyes after I&#x27;m done soaking in the tub. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakouts or rashes and I use an aloe, hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil leave on treatment afterward and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried various mask in market, But seaweed is something different. once you open the jar you can smell the seaweed. i tried it with yogurt and honey, and magically my skin felt soo soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> I liked how my skin looked after.  Have only used 1 time so far.  I am anxious to use again, but next time I am going to look into some other&#x27;s comments on how they were able to make it spread more smoothly/evenly.  It does smell like seaweed as I expected! :)</li>
            <li> Good quality. Fast delivery. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I like it .but my friend allergic for it .</li>
            <li> Since the first time I used the powder for a facial my skin felt fantastic and looked youthful. As others have said the smell reminds them they are at the beach. Which I don&#x27;t mind. I love the beach! I was very impressed with the customer service. I received the package fairly quickly. They also sent an email to make sure I was happy and enjoying the powder. Also if I should have any questions to contact them.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product; highly recommended. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, mixes instantly. Pure and organic!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Seaweed powder.  It feels absolutely amazing when you put it on your face as a mask, it is so refreshing!  I noticed a difference after just one use, my skin was softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little strong when you mix it with just water, however now I have been mixing it with Greek Yogurt and honey which helps with the smell a lot, it doesn&#x27;t feel quite as refreshing going on, but the results are still great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I also follow with a toner as they recommend on the container.  I will definitely buy this product again as well as recommending to others.</li>
            <li> great, little clumpy but made my face feel tight and soft.Came on time and will buy again</li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve found myself looking for natural alternatives to my more conventional, and often harmful, products. It&#x27;s not difficult to try five different products and find that none of them will hold up to the standard left behind by my previous products. This seaweed mask by Azara Organics is, absolutely, the exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask works better than any mask I have tried in the past. In fact, I recently purchased a bentonite clay powder mask, a popular mask amongst natural product seekers. I was impressed with the results, but the mask was incredibly difficult to remove. I find the seaweed mask provides the same, if not more benefits (especially the smell - this mask and the powder have a bit of an earthy smell, but definitely not a sea-like or fishy smell) than the bentonite clay mask (which has no smell), and is easily removed from your face or body (the bentonite clay mask can be exceptionally painful and difficult to remove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to try powder masks, thinking that they would be difficult and time consuming to mix up and apply, but I could not have been more wrong. Having your mask in powder form allows for easy storage, WAY more applications out of one tub (money saver!), and a very long lifespan of the product - I have found with other powders that these products almost never go bad and have to be thrown out. They will also not get crusty or leave behind residue. If you accidentally drop some powder, cleanup is nearly effortless - just run the vacuum. The mixing is quick (and actually pretty fun!) and application is just as easy as any other mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for mixing and using this mask are just to mix the seaweed powder with lukewarm water with a fork in a small bowl until desired consistency is reached. More water or less powder will make a runnier consistency that will take longer to harden and vice versa. The mask can then be rinsed of with water. I choose to apply my mask with a foundation brush I pickedup from the drug store. It allows for thick application and feels incredibly indulgent when going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also mix different products into your mask, as you see fit. I have an aloe vera plant and decided to put some aloe vera into the mask after having suffered a minor sunburn. I found this combination was very soothing and, I believe, helped my skin to heal. I&#x27;ve also heard of people trying goat milk or honey in their mask, both of which I have not tried as I am a vegan and allergic to dairy products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend and I both use this product. We have independently found some relief to our acne and I have found that the mask adds hydration to my dry spots and helps to control oil elsewhere. I also suffer from eczema and have found this product gentle enough to use over my problem areas. The mask does not pull on hairs, even when coming off, and can make for a very sensual experience if you plan on giving your significant other a body mask (or making them give you one!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can check their website for more of their products. They have a generous supply of organic, non GMO, paraben-free products:&lt;br /&gt;azaraorganics.com</li>
            <li> This made my skin so smooth, and I also have sensitive skin.  I used this for a facial mask and did not experience any negative reactions. Yes, the smell is strong, but putting honey in it helps. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised I found this.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and it does work but the smell is very strong! ! My whole bathroom smelled like fish and seaweed.</li>
            <li> I have used Azara Organics Seaweed Powder as a facial mask and I saw wonderful results immediately. I cleansed my skin normally then I mixed a teaspoon of the seaweed powder with a little honey and some warm water, and applied it to my face, neck, and decollete with a fan brush. I left the seaweed powder mixture on my skin for about 30 minutes. It dries on your skin so removal is a little difficult, but just take your time and be sure not to scrub your skin too vigorously. As soon as i removed the mask my skin was a little pink which is good, it means the blood is to the surface &amp; it will leave you with bright glowing skin! Once my skin dried it was the softest I have ever felt it in a LONG time, the only feeling I can attribute it to is like after getting a Microdermabrasion. My face also felt very firm I joked with my friend that it felt like I got a face lift.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Lightly smells of seaweed, no perfumes. I am highly sensitive to perfume so I wanted to try and product that was 100% natural and I found it! You can mix it with water for consistency. I will definitely buy this again. Thank you for offering us this wonderful facial mask. I am so happy, finally found my favorite.</li>
            <li> i tried this and was blown away with the result. it is very simple just take a little powder and add warm water and then apply. leave for 10 mins and rinse. how hard is that. you will be doing your skin a favor. love  it. I recommend this!! try it ! you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> This comes in a large 8oz jar which is PLENTY of powder to do your face once a week or a full body wrap since a little goes a long way. The powder is very fine and soft, it dissolves well in water (but make sure you use more than recommended since it tends to clump up and its a bit hard to spread) I have only used this as a facial mask so I can not say anything about how it is on the body but this is great for tightening and making the facial skin smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this one right now as I type because I wanted to tell you my experience as I went along. It went on smoothly, it is goopy and slimy and easy to spread as long as you put enough water in it and mix well, there are however some clumps that will just not come out so you have to smoosh them well with your fingers before you put it on, or leave them that&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about ten minutes you can really feel it hardening and tightening your skin, you may also get itchy. You may also scare you mother when you walk out to get tea, a bonus! This really does smell like seaweed, very beachy and organic smelling. After about 10 - 15 minutes its time to take it off (I go for 20 because I am lazy and want it to be totally dry) You need to use a warm cloth and you need to scrub, this does not want to come off easily! The scrubbing however leaves your skin exfoliated and smooth and moisturized (you can add moisturizer afterwards but I do not since I do this at night)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is defiantly a good skin buff and shine and like I said it is a very generous amount in the jar (see that pic? it is as big as my dogs head!) I will continue to use this weekly or biweekly and when it runs out I think i will buy more. Give it a shot, you will not be dissapointed, just be prepared to scrub!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
            <li> Totally organic kelp. How can you go wrong? This is a large jar and will last a good long time. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always down to try something new, even if it seems wacky or different. This is just the case with this Azara Organics Organic Seaweed Powder, something totally new in my beauty world. But when offered to chance to give it a whirl, I couldn&#x27;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When testing this product, I used it solely for my face. Use is simple, just add in a teaspoon of water to 2 teaspoons of seaweed. To combat the, well, seaweed smell, drop in some essential oils if you have them on hand, and then smear the product on your face. Unfortunately, when I used it I didn&#x27;t have any essential oils on hand and I had to get a whiff of seaweed for the 15 minutes it sat on my face. Highly recommend scenting this stuff with something when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the mask dries, it starts to feel slightly tight on the skin, but it feels nice and cooling. I left it on for the recommended 15 minutes and then washed off with warm water. This does get gritty and sort of sticks to the skin so I really had to scrub to get it off. Because of that, it had a nice exfoliating quality (although I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really supposed to) and it left my skin feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This certainly isn&#x27;t the best mask I&#x27;ve ever tried. I think it was nice, and again - my skin did feel soft and supple as it was supposed to afterward. However, I didn&#x27;t like how sticky it was on my skin. I think for some of you, this will be the answer you&#x27;re looking for - especially if you are looking for a full body mask, but it just wasn&#x27;t something my skin really needs in it&#x27;s regimen.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely loved by the women in our household. It is a natural product and has the natural scent. It is recommended to add essential oil to it. We did not have the oil to add to it, however, I would recommend adding it. The scent isn&#x27;t too offensive, but I would recommend the oil addition. If you do not use oil, you will need to add more water which isn&#x27;t included in the instructions. This mask does wonders. It definitely does a deep cleaning. Even without the use of oil, it makes your face very smooth. We have not tried it as a body wrap yet, however, that is next on the list to try. You feel pampered in less than a half hour. All of us women in our home love this product and will continue to use</li>
            <li> I tried this product immediately!  It came in a powdered form so it was nice to just be able to mix it with water.  I went on nice and my skin feels amazing after letting the mask sit on my face and neck for 15 minutes!</li>
            <li> Very happy with it, make facial mask with it n love it!</li>
            <li> Noticed improvement after my first application. So far I am extremely satisfied. The only complaint someone might have is the strong smell of seaweed. But since I&#x27;ve lived by the ocean my entire life, it really doesn&#x27;t bother me that much. I&#x27;m sure you can add a drop or two of essential oils to mask the scent.</li>
            <li> Remarkable! Silky and wonderful - I mix it with water and a bit of Almond oil and it makes my skin feel like silk!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It makes my face feel fresh and firm after I used it.  Easy to mix and not too messy - cleans up easily out of mixing container and sink.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Need to use more only have done one facial anf I loved it.</li>
            <li> I really like how fine the seaweed powder feels.  The jar is perfect size to carry and the product good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at $17.95 and immediately to 12.95, after processing the payment. I was charged the price more high. If the exuberant amount may be returned, I stay with the product; otherwise, I&#x27;ll return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> With the weather being so extremely cold and windy lately the skin on my face has gotten very dry and rough. I looked into the cost of having a seaweed facial at a local salon and it was going to be about $45. That was more than I wanted to spend for a one time facial so I started looking at how much it would cost to do my own. I found a few other facial powders that seemed good but once I looked at the ingredients list they had all kinds of stuff in them that I could hardly pronounce and then I came across this one by Azara Organics. It has ONE ingredient, just one! And its certified USDA organic. This seaweed facial mask only has organic kelp powder in it that is harvested from the Atlantic Ocean. I really love the fact that Azara Organics make it crystal clear what is in their product and where it is from.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this so the day it came in the mail instantly became my spa day. I decided to mix the powder with a little bit of honey and some peppermint oil. It smelled so yummy and it felt so nice applying it to my skin. I chilled out with a glass of wine while the mask dried, I think I left it on for 20 minutes and then I gently removed it with a washcloth and warm water. In the past some mask have proven difficult to remove but not this one, there was no scrubbing needed. Just a gently wipe with a warm rag and my face was much smoother and softer than it has been in awhile. It was very relaxing and gentle on my skin and I noticed right away that my skin was not as dried out as it was. These bitter winters can be rough on a lady&#x27;s skin but a seaweed facial mask can help repair the damage. I am looking forward to mixing the seaweed powder with other essential oils and some aloe but I did not have any oil this time. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> strong seaweed smell and truoblesome mixing with water over all a great product</li>
            <li> Works great!! Use it for body wraps and face masks! The only thing is that it does not contain a lot but it still works great!</li>
            <li> Smells like the ocean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK if you can get it to stick to your face long enough to dry.  The instructions on the jar calls for 1 tsp seaweed to 2 tsp water but the result is too thick.  I had to add another tsp of water and tsp of essential oil to make it work.  You do not need a lot at one time and the jar is large, so it will last a long time.  It&#x27;s a great deal for the size and price.  The fishy odor is strong but not overpowering.  I&#x27;ve only used it once but it did make my face really soft even after just one application.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, just have to add a little more moisture to make it work correctly.</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for a few months.I clearly see results and they are fantastic, I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I only tried it once with just plain filtered water and skin seems to feel more smooth after using this mask. the smell is expected and it got a little dry and hard to put after a few minutes but i will try put a little bit more water next time</li>
            <li> One of my favorite parts of skincare is doing a mask.  There is just something about doing a mask that makes you feel like your doing your skin a favor by sucking out all the gunk and leaving it super clean and soft!&lt;br /&gt;This Organic Seaweed Powder that Azara Organics sent me to review is perfect for customizing a mask that is specific for your skin by adding additional ingredients.  The Seaweed Powder is nutrient loaded so it satisfies and cleanses your malnourished skin and the unique mineral properties flush out the toxins leaving your skin smooth and youthful.  The Organic Seaweed Powder by Azara Organics is also a chemical free solution to healthy skin.  The Organic Seaweed Powder is good for all types of skin issues from rashes to acne and can even help dry skin!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feeling at first but I&#x27;m always like that with every face mask at first. But after it hardened and I cleaned it off it made my face feel soft fresh and smooth especially in combination with a lotion.</li>
            <li> I used only twice so far it looks good the smell is bothering me i will try more. The shipping was on time and my item was in good condition.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Have read some reviews about the smell but it really does not smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> I recommend  this product  100%.My stretch mark are gone and my stomach is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Being a Brit, I like to take baths!  I have tried several high-quality organic seaweeds and this is a firm favorite. Whilst there are clear benefits to using the product as a mask or wrap, a scoopful in a warm bath has excellent results too. The key is to add it to warm not hot water.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it as a face and body mask! I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed any results as far as detoxing go but it leaves my skin so soft and refreshed! The smell is odd but not bad. Will purchase it again when I run out!</li>
            <li> makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li> I love that this item is organic. I’m used to the smell of seaweed so it was no surprise when I rehydrated the powder into a gooey paste for my facial. As an initial tryout, I only used cold tap water and mixed it in a plastic (used to be for hair dye but only used it once) mixing bowl with a silicone bristled (hair dye brush only used once) brush.  Used the same brush to apply it like frosting on a cake to my face, deep into my hairline and on my neck.  I left it on longer than intended so it did dry a bit but when I removed the mask, it had gently exfoliated my skin (including my lips where I sloppily overapplied). SOFT skin and so clean!  For those not liking the seaweed smell, you can use a drop of essential oil to offset the sea smell.  I plan on using this on my scalp and hair as a cleansing/conditioner a few times a week to address my seborrheic dermatitis symptoms.  I no longer dye my blue/black hair but already know from an imported seaweed scalp/hair cleansing conditioner that this product will not discolor my gray (white) hair.  Great value and now that I know that this is a small up and coming company, I’ll be reordering once I deplete this (huge) supply of powder. Great customer care (they reached out to me and gave me a recipe to try out on my face that I will also use on my scalp/hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  9-19-15:  First use and I’m impressed.  As a facial cleanser/mask this was easy to mix up with warm water and apply with a silicone bristle (unused but intended for hair dye application) brush.  I applied it after masking my face with a fruit acid-based cleanser/mask that revved up my blood circulation (translation:  my face was very red) hoping that it would calm my skin. It did and left it soft not dried out.  No ocean smell left on my skin.  I was called away by the time I had finished applying the seaweed mix to my scalp and hair (pixie length hair) to address seborrheic dermatitis symptoms and to cleanse/condition my hair.  That said, it ended up drying on my head like cement and I went about my day remotely working from home.  By the time I wet my hair and massaged my scalp then rinsed out the seaweed, it did leave both my scalp and hair extremely clean and soft, but the ocean smell remained.  I will have to use commercial shampoo to remove the ocean smell, but I’ve learned that I can use this seaweed on my hair and scalp, just don’t let it dry and stay on for more than a shower.  Great customer care (thanks for reaching out) with “recipe” ideas for usage.  Next time I use this powder, I’ll extend the “facial” to my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;; it soothes and smoothes my (mature) skin.  The best thing about this product is that it arrives in just the powder form and I control what goes into the mix and what consistency (viscosity) I want.  There is a lot of product and since seaweed hair cleansing is only needed 2 – 3 times per week, I’ll be ordering this item maybe semi-annually.  If I took the time to buy the body wrap materials, I would carve out time to do a fully body wrap, but based  on my facial, this would be an awesome product for that purpose. Fast shipping and it did arrive prior to the projected delivery date; no extraneous packaging and no hidden damages in-transit.

Fast shipping and it did arrive prior to the projected delivery date; no extraneous packaging and no hidden damages in-transit. Great vendor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Azara Organics, which is one of the most personal and professional companies I have worked with on Amazon. Excellent customer service! Product smells strongly on seaweed. I like it. If you want the benefits of seaweed, then this seaweed smell is a sign that it is pure. I purposely put this on one side of my body to compare, and my skin was noticeable smoother - even the next day! I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I make facial masks, cold process soap, and melt &amp; pour soap, and this works well in all three. It gives a nice green color to the soaps, plus it gives the minerals and trace elements to the soap properties.&lt;br /&gt;It works great for a mask, but be aware that since this is a natural product, it does smell like seaweed. I added a few drops of tea tree oil which made the smell more subtle. It didn&#x27;t bother me, but if you are really sensitive to smells, this may turn you off.</li>
            <li> I mix this with honey for a face mask.  It smells a little strong, (like the ocean) but I don&#x27;t mind.  My skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this. I find the smell is fishy, but it does say to use it with a scented oil. I have sensitive skin so that is not an option.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my skin and laying down to relax while it did what it was suppose to. I felt my skin tight and I felt discomfort on one of my checks and when I rinsed it off I has 3 &#x27;It seems like&#x27;  burn spots and swollen :-( I put Vit E and aloe from one of plants and again at bed time. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Recently I have no time to visit facial care shop.&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this. And tried 2 times in a week so far. As the direction, I made the liquid and it seemed not enough for my face, but it was just good. After while, rinsed it out, and found so bright and silky face! I Love it! I Don&#x27;t need to visit spa again!!!</li>
            <li> Can u tell me how to make the body wrap with the seaweed.and how it works..</li>
            <li> Great product!  Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I had never used a powder formula for a face mask before. I also had never tried anything for a body wrap so I was really intrigued to try this out and see how I liked it. It has really easy directions on mixing it and how to get the consistency you need for both the facial wrap and the body wrap. It mixes pretty easily and I like that it wasn&#x27;t confusing. The smell is not the best but it is an all organic seaweed mixture so that is to be expected. They say on the jar that they do not mask the scent to keep it 100% pure and I can respect that. They also state that if you find the smell to be too strong, you can add a couple drops of essential oil to help. It is a dark green color and almost looks like baby food! It come straight from the Atlantic Ocean. I find this all to be really awesome. Once I applied the mask and it was time to take it off (10-15 min) I used warm water and it came right off. The smell of the product does NOT linger on your skin. I could NOT believe how soft and smooth my skin was! For someone who has oily skin, this has helped me SO much! So, I decided to use it the body wrap way for my husband on his back for his back acne and WOW!! It has works better than anything we have tried to decrease his back acne. Its almost completely gone and nothing new has popped up! It doesn&#x27;t say that it is used for acne or anything but it has helped his back so much! I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for something completely natural that works! Its definitely worth it in my opinion! I got this product free to review in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion!</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;girly girl&amp;#34; and I love doing facials. I have never done a seaweed mask so this was my first experience. It was very easy. 1 tsp powder to 2 tsp warm water. I applied it to my face and let it dry and then washed it off. It says on the container that they do not mask the scent of seaweed and if it&#x27;s too overpowering you can add a few drops of essential oil. Not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but I didn&#x27;t smell anything? Anyway, it made my face feel amazing; smooth and perfectly clean. I also had no sensitivity issues from using it. This is a large container. Using it as just a facial mask, it will last a very long time. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my body yet, but I&#x27;m going to look into it.</li>
            <li> This seaweed face mask is the best one I have tried so far. It is very natural and organic, and leaves your skin completely clean and fresh. I would definitely recommend this product to those who put function over fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell since it smell weird with seaweed. So you decide if you want the best pore-opening and cleaning mask or nice-smelling mediocre mask. I will choose the first one.</li>
            <li> Face feels fantastic after using this ! Love it !</li>
            <li> Works very well. I used it in a facial mask as per email. Worked well. My face feels softer. Can not wait to use it in a body wrap! Amazing!</li>
            <li> This mask was my first seaweek mask. At first I was a little skeptical when I applied this to my face. It was a little clumpy and some parts felt really thin since I am used to thicker mud masks.  I have combination skin and it is fairly sensitive. The first time I used the mask my skin turned a little pink but it was incredibly smooth! It helps clear out my pores and the skin on my face felt overall tighter. I won&#x27;t leave the mask on as long the next time.  The smell is not great but not bad.  You can always add a few drops of essential oils (like lavender) to make it smell better.</li>
            <li> Love it. Yes it stinks but I got used to it after two uses. Seaweed baths are great too. Great for acne too.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so good!! The smell is awful but definately worth it! I would recommend buying this !</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super smooth and brighter. I am picky and it is my new love!</li>
            <li> Powder makes into a great rub, I&#x27;m currently using on my legs. Odor is not offensive to me, reminds me of the beach!</li>
            <li> This product worked for me really well. The packaging is really good and it arrived quickly. The powder itself is a dark green color in a plastic jar. I use it for face masks and it blends really well with other ingredients for a very smooth paste. One thing that bothered me at first was the smell. It doesn’t smell as strong when it’s still in powder form but as soon as you mix it with a liquid, boy the smell really hits ya! It’s not a bad smell, just VERY strong. It actually smells of the ocean and the beach. I grew up on an island so I should be the last one complaining about the smell but if you’ve never used this powder, you will be bothered by the smell. I just use any kind of floral water instead of plain water and that helps a little. Some tips, if you are using this only as a face mask, be sure to get ALL of your hair out of the way. Wear an old t-shirt you don’t mind smelling so bad. And try to stay in the bathroom with the door closed when you have the mask and open the window or turn on the exhaust fan. The smell lingers, on your skin, hair and pillowcase even. So wash face very well. After over a week of use, the smell does not bother me now.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product for anyone with problem skin. From what I have read here, it treats a whole array of problems and the results are different for different people. I like this powder for a face mask because I feel like this is a very gentle but effective ingredient for a face mask. With some masks, they can pull and tug on the skin as it dries but this just dries and skill remains soft so it does not put any kind of pressure on the skin. I apply this mask 4-5 times a week. I have seen a reduction in pore size, oiliness and just generally I wake up in the morning and my skin looks refreshed. It does not look as tired as it used to.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it enough to rate it.  I like it.  I tried it as a face mask and body wrap.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it more and get back to you</li>
