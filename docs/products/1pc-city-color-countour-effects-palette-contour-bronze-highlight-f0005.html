            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and i look fabulous and feel very confident!</li>
            <li>This product helps give my face a nice bronze tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s usable and alright for the price, but I&#x27;m still going to be looking for another contouring palette that compliments fair skin better.</li>
            <li>Shipped FAST , great product!!!</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy something better</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>to I ordered it and it came 2 days later excellent price will be buying again.</li>
            <li>Love the guide it gives you.  </li>
            <li>The powder set my makeup and I was able to highlight and contour in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I wish the highlighting shade was a bit more noticeable on my skin</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin too</li>
            <li>Easy to do and exactly what I needed to start contouring.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you need a quick day look or if you have not contoured before this product is easy to apply and blend for a natural look.</li>
            <li>Cream based contouring usually takes me 20+ minutes to blend, so this time saving product is great for people who want the contoured look while pressed for time.</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented, which is exactly what i wanted, this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I brushed over it and tried to blend it in, it stayed put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a powder set to contour</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really sparkly didn&#x27;t like it .</li>
            <li>A lot of dust, but very pigmented, the care is made out of cardboard and cheep</li>
            <li>I really like it basically what you pay</li>
            <li>have normal fair skin so using their contour shade on my face makes me look ridiculous.</li>
            <li>The highlight powder is very off white</li>
            <li>and it came early</li>
            <li>Contour shade is super dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay item, the contour color is a little too dark, and the bronzer is too orange</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the bronzer as it is a little darker</li>

            <li> I used the bronzer to contour and it took a long time and a lot of translucent powder to blend it in.</li>
            <li> I broke the white though, so be careful!!</li>
            <li> It was placed at the bottom of the box underneath my other items, with no bubble protection around it.</li>

            <li> So i hardly got any of the highlighter to use.</li>
            <li> Unhappy that the item wasn&#x27;t protected properly.</li>
            <li> I received my kit and the highlighter was broken and falling all over the place.</li>
            <li> So one of the powder cakes arrived broken and all over the palette.</li>
            <li> Just expect that it will probably arrive broken.</li>
            <li> I applied the powder after using my regular BB cream as a base.</li>
            <li> Difficult to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it was way too expensive!</li>
            <li> but i am sorely disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sparkly didn&#x27;t like it .</li>
            <li> This product helps give my face a nice bronze tone. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for contouring love it!</li>
            <li> When we received it the middle one was already broke into pieces.</li>
            <li> Great product and color! You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I broke the white though, so be careful!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never contoured my face before, so this is a good starter kit.  The highlight it lighter than I would like for my skin tone, but has helped me learn how to contour.</li>
            <li> Got it today, and i love it! It came in perfect condition looks exactly as shown in the picture. It is very pigmented, which is exactly what i wanted, this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I received my kit and the highlighter was broken and falling all over the place. So i hardly got any of the highlighter to use. It may have been the fault of the shipping agency but i am sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;- Stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Contour shade is super dark. I have to use the bronzer for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;-The highlight is too shimmery for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;- Difficult to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal fair skin so using their contour shade on my face makes me look ridiculous. I used the bronzer to contour and it took a long time and a lot of translucent powder to blend it in. The highlighter is a bit shimmery, which I personally don&#x27;t like. The highlighter also doesn&#x27;t blend at all! No matter how many times I brushed over it and tried to blend it in, it stayed put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s usable and alright for the price, but I&#x27;m still going to be looking for another contouring palette that compliments fair skin better.</li>
            <li> Shipped FAST , great product!!! Great for sensitive skin too</li>
            <li> The bronzer is the only one I don&#x27;t use regularly.</li>
            <li> A lot of dust, but very pigmented, the care is made out of cardboard and cheep</li>
            <li> Love this product! been looking for something like this all in one product for a while now!</li>
            <li> The highlight powder is very off white and I&#x27;d mixed with a lot of glitters. The dark hues are not easy to apply it blend into the skin. Save your money and buy something better it&#x27;s worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I really like it basically what you pay is what you get and it came early</li>
            <li> works great. Good price.</li>
            <li> Love love love this makeup does exaclty what it supposed to I ordered it and it came 2 days later excellent price will be buying again.</li>
            <li> great value ! wonderful set for begining makeup artist!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Love the guide it gives you.  Easy to do and exactly what I needed to start contouring.</li>
            <li> Unhappy that the item wasn&#x27;t protected properly. It&#x27;s a thin, flat palette with powder in it. It was placed at the bottom of the box underneath my other items, with no bubble protection around it. So one of the powder cakes arrived broken and all over the palette. Sigh. Other than that, I like the product itself. Just expect that it will probably arrive broken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay item, the contour color is a little too dark, and the bronzer is too orange</li>
            <li> Love this, great for beginners!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I thought it was cream based, but it is actually a pressed powder. This was my first time using a powder set to contour and I was surprising impressed with the results. I applied the powder after using my regular BB cream as a base. The powder set my makeup and I was able to highlight and contour in under 5 minutes. Cream based contouring usually takes me 20+ minutes to blend, so this time saving product is great for people who want the contoured look while pressed for time. I would recommend this product if you need a quick day look or if you have not contoured before this product is easy to apply and blend for a natural look.</li>
            <li> Perfection that&#x27;s all I can say!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this! I don&#x27;t really use the bronzer as it is a little darker then I would like but the powder highlight is amazing!</li>
            <li> Been wanting a contour kit forever! Looked at smashbox but it was way too expensive! This kit comes with three colors and a how to apply guide. The guide is perfect for beginners ( even though I&#x27;m not). I used it under my cc cream and i look fabulous and feel very confident!</li>
            <li> I love it! It cane quick and blends perfectly. I wish the highlighting shade was a bit more noticeable on my skin but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
