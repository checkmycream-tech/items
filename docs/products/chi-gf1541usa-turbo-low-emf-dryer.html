    <ol>
            <li>So it is not the best hairdryer to use on children or allow them to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>LOVED IT!!!!  </li>
            <li>CHI is a great product!!!!  </li>
            <li>Recommend this product to anyone looking for the perfect hairdryer!</li>
            <li>Except for the price it is the best dryer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is a great hairdryer</li>
            <li>So I took the advice of one of my great hair stylist and bought one.  </li>
            <li>when it works it&#x27;s great, but it broke after a year.  </li>
            <li>Over all, great product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise works great.  </li>
            <li>Bought a Chi about 7 years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product - very well designed.  </li>
            <li>PLEASE think twice before spending that kind of money.</li>
            <li>the cord is very long which makes it great for traveling - you can plug it in across the room, but it has a great strap to bundle up the cord.</li>
            <li>Love my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, and with the concentrator attachment on it has perfect directional heat</li>
            <li>Use a cheaper one for them that blows more air than heat.</li>
            <li>Wish it had more heat temperature options.</li>
            <li>Okay product.</li>
            <li>Why pay more</li>
            <li>would love to return it..</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t burn your brush :)  </li>
            <li>the nozzel gets very hot, I noticed this AM that the nozzel tip is melting!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t cheap -about</li>
            <li>It has great power, yet it&#x27;s not very loud.</li>
            <li>and I felt it was well worth the money!  </li>
            <li>Its well worth the price, as we say you do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is so good I bought a second one.  </li>
            <li>It does get very hot</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>Had the first one for over 10 years before I needed to replace it!  </li>
            <li>AND THEY WON&#x27;T HONOR A RETURN WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH OF USE!</li>
            <li>Other than that good unit.</li>
            <li>so I assumed it would be as good as my other drier in terms of power and strength</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair is significantly more soft, shiny, and healthy looking since starting to use it.</li>
            <li>Love the quiet, but it is VERY hot.</li>
            <li>It was passed the 30 day return period for Amazon, and Farouk (the manufacturer) states that purchasing a Chi online voids the warranty, as it most likely is counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>The air runs too hot</li>
            <li>This purchase was to replace a similar CHI brand dryer that was an all time favorite.</li>
            <li>Diffuser and front of dryer started smoking and melted on first use.</li>
            <li>The same product you pay double for in local store, great product wife loves it!!</li>
            <li>The first one was a gift so without a receipt they would do nothing.</li>
            <li>Chi hair dryer is great, this is my second one, dropped the other.  </li>
            <li>I have small hands and consider myself to have good coordinations, but after 6 months I can not seem to avoid inadvertantly shutting the power off.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone who is willing to invest in their hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much heavier and louder.</li>
            <li>So much to the point that when you switch hands while styling the power is often shut off by accident.</li>
            <li>The heat was to intense and burned off a chunk of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll put that $35 towards a cheap dryer that will last 10 years.</li>
            <li>The nozzle and attachment melted within 9 months but dries hair fast..</li>
            <li>I could have very well gotten a lemon.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, I exchanged the dryer for the black Chi Pro, which is much closer to the original Turbo (and cheaper, too!).</li>
            <li>Nice and hot, light weight and cold spot,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weak and does not get hot but just warm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little better than those hotel driers you see mounted to the wall.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be able to dry hair quite the way this Chi Turbo Low EMF Dryer does it for me.</li>
            <li>Well, I did not read the fine print close enough that said \\&quot;only for 1 year\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have been using for (years), but this new one the electrical cord on this is like my fathers construction cord he uses on a construction site</li>
            <li>The only caution I have is that this dryer has a high heat concentration and since it heats hair quickly you can burn your scalp if not careful.</li>
            <li>Off toggle style switch that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Professional quality...</li>
            <li>The dryer is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>If spend this much money on a product I would like if to last longer</li>
            <li>Every time I use this just want to throw it in the trash, I still have my old CHI just like this one that&#x27;s about to die that I state</li>
            <li>Very disappointing that 2 hair dryers worth $100 each are only good for a year, literally!</li>
            <li>I got this product at tj maxx after losing my other awesome blow drier (different brand that I unfortunately don&#x27;t remember).</li>
            <li>This new Turbo is vastly inferior.</li>
            <li>Then the new one does the same thing that is why you see them at marshalls and TJ maxx!</li>
            <li>I have no regrets!</li>
            <li>There is a low and high but that only seems to change the strength of the air being blown.</li>
            <li>It will burn your hair if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I expected a much longer life from this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Loved this dryer for three years until it went cold after shooting sparks out of the nozzle.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, and now it stays straight trough out the day, and also looks much less frizzy!</li>
            <li>Not a long life span for the price.</li>
            <li>My hair is FINE and THIN.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I loved the way it dried, but I will never pay for this over-priced, poor customer serviced company again!</li>
            <li> The handle is uncomfortably flat on one side.</li>
            <li> After drying my hair with the Chi, I do not even have to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer takes about half the time to dry my hair compared to my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I had long hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pause on one spot to long or bye bye hair.</li>
            <li> the cord is so stiff, my old one was NOT like this, why O why would they use a cord like this on a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 CHI hair dryers over the last 3 years and both have now stopped heating in less than 18 months.</li>
            <li> Slightly heavier than last one.  </li>
            <li> No real adjustment for heat.</li>
            <li> Not really what you look for in a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and process alot due to greying :(.  </li>
            <li> Be vary careful!</li>
            <li> My only critic is that the cord is very heavy.</li>
            <li> The cold button makes the air only slightly less hot, not cool at all.</li>
            <li> The dryer is heavier than previous models.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this brand.</li>
            <li> On top of all this, I&#x27;m very disappointed that Chi has stopped offering a lifetime warranty on its dryers.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to remedy the problem.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL BUYING SOMETHING SO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> This product went cold after about a year, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Very shady business practice and will make me think about buying expensive items like this again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Although the dryer itself still works, it&#x27;s useless to me with the attachement.</li>
            <li> They make it difficult to return.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer on a whim when I was bored at work.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It is a useless, expensive piece of junk now sitting in the cabinet.  </li>
            <li> I got this dryer from a salon as a replacement for my Turbo that went cold after three years.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product and this company.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this hair dryer as I always use the attachment.  </li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m stuck with a worthless hair dryer and I&#x27;m out $130</li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible company.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible company and they need to protect consumers against Chi!</li>

            <li> the nozzel gets very hot, I noticed this AM that the nozzel tip is melting! I will return this product.</li>
            <li> Love my hair dryer. Itis quiet and efficient.</li>
            <li> The dryer is heavier than previous models.  Mine began making a grinding noise after two months.  It was passed the 30 day return period for Amazon, and Farouk (the manufacturer) states that purchasing a Chi online voids the warranty, as it most likely is counterfeit.  Make this purchase from a salon!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - very well designed.  Professional quality...the cord is very long which makes it great for traveling - you can plug it in across the room, but it has a great strap to bundle up the cord.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is so good I bought a second one.  I never need styling products or additional tools when I use it.  Very quiet, and with the concentrator attachment on it has perfect directional heat so I can even style my hair to look as if I used a flatiron without using one! I&#x27;ve also used the diffuser to make it look like I have big curls in my hair.  The only caution I have is that this dryer has a high heat concentration and since it heats hair quickly you can burn your scalp if not careful. So it is not the best hairdryer to use on children or allow them to use. Use a cheaper one for them that blows more air than heat.</li>
            <li> I got this dryer from a salon as a replacement for my Turbo that went cold after three years. This new Turbo is vastly inferior. It&#x27;s much heavier and louder. The handle is uncomfortably flat on one side. The air runs too hot - my hair looked fried. The cold button makes the air only slightly less hot, not cool at all. After two weeks, I exchanged the dryer for the black Chi Pro, which is much closer to the original Turbo (and cheaper, too!). On top of all this, I&#x27;m very disappointed that Chi has stopped offering a lifetime warranty on its dryers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! It has great power, yet it&#x27;s not very loud. The dryer is not heavy at all. My only critic is that the cord is very heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer and I felt it was well worth the money!  Makes my hair look like I just came from the salon!  I keep it on the low setting because that&#x27;s all it needs to be on.</li>
            <li> This purchase was to replace a similar CHI brand dryer that was an all time favorite. This model has a different ON/Off toggle style switch that is very sensitive. So much to the point that when you switch hands while styling the power is often shut off by accident. I have small hands and consider myself to have good coordinations, but after 6 months I can not seem to avoid inadvertantly shutting the power off.</li>
            <li> Love the quiet, but it is VERY hot. No real adjustment for heat. There is a low and high but that only seems to change the strength of the air being blown.</li>
            <li> After drying my hair with the Chi, I do not even have to use a flat iron.  Does not frizz up my hair.</li>
            <li> Wish it had more heat temperature options. Okay product. It will burn your hair if you&#x27;re not careful. I had long hair. Now it&#x27;s short. The heat was to intense and burned off a chunk of my hair.  My hair is FINE and THIN. Would recommend others using this product to use the low blow option. Keep space between it and your hair.  keep it moving.  Don&#x27;t pause on one spot to long or bye bye hair.</li>
            <li> Diffuser and front of dryer started smoking and melted on first use. Not really what you look for in a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The same product you pay double for in local store, great product wife loves it!! Save money buy here!! Why pay more</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be able to dry hair quite the way this Chi Turbo Low EMF Dryer does it for me.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT!!!!  Exactly what I was looking for!  CHI is a great product!!!!  Recommend this product to anyone looking for the perfect hairdryer!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product and this company. I have had 2 CHI hair dryers over the last 3 years and both have now stopped heating in less than 18 months. The first one was a gift so without a receipt they would do nothing. The second I bought and saved the receipt and box \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;. Well, I did not read the fine print close enough that said \\&quot;only for 1 year\\&quot;. Very disappointing that 2 hair dryers worth $100 each are only good for a year, literally! I called and they offered to fix it for an additional $35. I think I&#x27;ll put that $35 towards a cheap dryer that will last 10 years. PLEASE think twice before spending that kind of money. I loved the way it dried, but I will never pay for this over-priced, poor customer serviced company again!</li>
            <li> The attachment to the dryer and the end of the dryer melted within 4 months.  Although the dryer itself still works, it&#x27;s useless to me with the attachement.</li>
            <li> The nozzle and attachment melted within 9 months but dries hair fast.. If spend this much money on a product I would like if to last longer</li>
            <li> Except for the price it is the best dryer I have ever used.  I have very fine hair and process alot due to greying :(.  So I took the advice of one of my great hair stylist and bought one.  I now keep an extra on the shelf, just in case it goes out!  Had the first one for over 10 years before I needed to replace it!  Its well worth the price, as we say you do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible company. They are producing dryers they know spark and catch on FIRE! Their dryers are a fire hazard &amp; they know it! They make it difficult to return. Charge for shipping and replacements and you pay to ship FIRE HAZARD back! Then the new one does the same thing that is why you see them at marshalls and TJ maxx! Be vary careful! This is a horrible company and they need to protect consumers against Chi!</li>
            <li> when it works it&#x27;s great, but it broke after a year.  Not a long life span for the price.</li>
            <li> Loved this dryer for three years until it went cold after shooting sparks out of the nozzle.  I expected a much longer life from this hair dryer.  I definitely would not recommend this nor would I purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer on a whim when I was bored at work. I have no regrets! This hair dryer takes about half the time to dry my hair compared to my old hair dryer. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair is significantly more soft, shiny, and healthy looking since starting to use it. My hair is naturally wavy, and now it stays straight trough out the day, and also looks much less frizzy! Over all, great product. I highly recommend to anyone who is willing to invest in their hair.</li>
            <li> This product went cold after about a year, don&#x27;t waste your money.  Worked well when it did work but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Had one before. Works the same as the last one. No problems. Slightly heavier than last one.  Other than that good unit.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this just want to throw it in the trash, I still have my old CHI just like this one that&#x27;s about to die that I state I have been using for (years), but this new one the electrical cord on this is like my fathers construction cord he uses on a construction site, you can not move the blow dryer around while using it the cord is so stiff, my old one was NOT like this, why O why would they use a cord like this on a blow dryer. I would not recommend this blow dryer to anyone...Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to return it..</li>
            <li> Otherwise works great.  Not sure how to remedy the problem.  Diffuser won&#x27;t attach properly anymore and can&#x27;t find replacement tool.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.  I purchased this for my mom for her birthday.  It does get very hot so you might want to take off your jewelery before blowdrying.  Keep the dryer moving so you don&#x27;t burn your brush :)  I use this in the salon as well (Im a stylist)</li>
            <li> I got this product at tj maxx after losing my other awesome blow drier (different brand that I unfortunately don&#x27;t remember). It wasn&#x27;t cheap -about $90 so I assumed it would be as good as my other drier in terms of power and strength but I was wrong. It&#x27;s a little better than those hotel driers you see mounted to the wall. It&#x27;s weak and does not get hot but just warm. Don&#x27;t waste your money with this brand.</li>
            <li> I had to send this back because it was smelly like something was burning and it wasn&#x27;t going away.  I could have very well gotten a lemon.I tried returning it, but Amazon is saying I cannot. I WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL BUYING SOMETHING SO EXPENSIVE AND THEY WON&#x27;T HONOR A RETURN WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH OF USE! Very shady business practice and will make me think about buying expensive items like this again on Amazon. So now I&#x27;m stuck with a worthless hair dryer and I&#x27;m out $130+ !</li>
            <li> Bought a Chi about 7 years ago and loved it.  I decided to replace it and bought another Chi.  The diffuser attachment melted within a month of buying and won&#x27;t stay on.  I am so disappointed with this hair dryer as I always use the attachment.  It is a useless, expensive piece of junk now sitting in the cabinet.  Don&#x27;t buy if you want to use any of the attachments that come with it.</li>
            <li> Chi hair dryer is great, this is my second one, dropped the other.  Nice and hot, light weight and cold spot, everything I want in a Hairdryer.</li>
