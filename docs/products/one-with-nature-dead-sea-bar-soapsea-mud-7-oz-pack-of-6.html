            <li>Love, Jonathan</li>
            <li>Yes, it can be abrasive, but if you don&#x27;t scrub your skin like you&#x27;re sanding wood, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this soap, you will love it too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>it makes your skin squicky clean.  </li>
            <li>Rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>So far i have been using it for 4 days and my face feels so smooth and no clogged pores!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d leave for bit, but sure enough my forehead would be filled with more pimples.</li>
            <li>Well the very first day i used</li>
            <li>The best part is that it stayed clear, because I was so ready for my acne to come back.</li>
            <li>soap is cheap, the salt grains exfoliate my face very well, it leaves my skin clean and balanced, I don&#x27;t even need moisturizer after using this soap.</li>
            <li>Plus, the bars are nicely substantial and last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within two weeks or so, my face completely cleared up, more so than i&#x27;d seen it in MONTHS.</li>
            <li>you may be affended about the smell at first</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s so worth it after wasting my money on stuff that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>it is a double whammy of natural ingredients and a second to none exfoliation that keeps my skin looking, smelling, and  feeling great.</li>
            <li>No nasty smelling perfumes or other odors.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such quick service.</li>
            <li>but as I got older i noticed i started getting an oily skin and clogged pores.(gross</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s one of the more affordable (at least right now)</li>
            <li>I recommend this soap highly.</li>
            <li>Rinses off easily in the shower unlike some of that goopy stuff like Dove and other lotions that claim to be soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that I can use multiple times per day without any fear of it drying out my skin and still gets me clean.</li>
            <li>It was shipped very quickly thank god because it is very hard to find in stores, and the price was right too.</li>
            <li>I have perpetually dry, bumpy skin and this smoothes it right out.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea mud-based soaps available.</li>
            <li>So far, it hasn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now.</li>
            <li>I like to use natural products, and use this soap guilt-free.</li>
            <li>It leaves such a clean and refreshing feeling, that it is hard to use any other soap after using this soap.  </li>
            <li>The simplicity and purity of ingredients, combined with the mild and pleasing feeling they leave your skin with (not harsh or drying), makes these soaps - specifically this one and the Dead Sea Salt version -</li>
            <li>I tried the soap, not really expecting much, and wow, was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>To buy the single bar, has gotten very costly, but when I ran across the multi-bar offer, I did not hesitate, I jumped at the offer.  </li>
            <li>This soap is very mild and non irritating if you have skin problems.</li>

            <li> Do you have dry skin, rashes, other skin problems?  I recommend this soap highly.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m a soap fanatic. I have tried multiple brands and types of soaps but always come back to this one(One With Nature, Dead Sea Mud Soap). Yes, it can be abrasive, but if you don&#x27;t scrub your skin like you&#x27;re sanding wood, you should be fine. It contains minerals and Dead Sea mud -- it&#x27;s exfoliating by nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price, it&#x27;s one of the more affordable (at least right now) Dead Sea mud-based soaps available. Bonus? It&#x27;s great for your skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome ! Great man soap . It has little pebbles in it ... And helps my eczema.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff- great price compared to most organic grocers, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i use this product all the time when i can find it. it makes your skin squicky clean.  you may be affended about the smell at first but as you use it you don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> Love the efficacy of this soap.</li>
            <li> I never had issues with my skin but as I got older i noticed i started getting an oily skin and clogged pores.(gross) anywho... I bought this soap at my local supermarket for 5 bucks. Well the very first day i used i felt the difference in my skin! I love it! So far i have been using it for 4 days and my face feels so smooth and no clogged pores!! Will be definitely keep on using this soap.</li>
            <li> Having acne from childhood well into adulthood I have tried just about every product on the market, with very few positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is cheap, the salt grains exfoliate my face very well, it leaves my skin clean and balanced, I don&#x27;t even need moisturizer after using this soap. I only use this on my face, so a bar lasts me about two months, and the product is always consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> My very favorite soap of all time. I have perpetually dry, bumpy skin and this smoothes it right out.</li>
            <li> I will not buy another soap.</li>
            <li> The simplicity and purity of ingredients, combined with the mild and pleasing feeling they leave your skin with (not harsh or drying), makes these soaps - specifically this one and the Dead Sea Salt version - my favorites ever.

I still use at on my face at least once a day and I also use it as a body soap, and it makes my skin feel great. Follow it up with a moisturizer and you&#x27;re set for your acne treatment. I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s so worth it after wasting my money on stuff that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I love mud soaps. I use them for my face and body. Good price and good quality for me</li>
