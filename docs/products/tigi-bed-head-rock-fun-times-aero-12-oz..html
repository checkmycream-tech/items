            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hairspray because of the name of it, honestly.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>As with any hairspray, the nozzle can get clogged--just get in the habit of rinsing with warm water.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Smells kind of fruity</li>
            <li>IT IS ABSOLUTELY AWSOME, SUPERB,</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I ordered this hairspray after a girl on one of my favorite beauty blogs recommended it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend you don&#x27;t buy this hairspray, even if it smells okay, because this bottle is going to take a lot of maintenance.</li>
            <li>always been pleased with buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>Still a lot to pay for hair spray but a much better bargain that $20.  </li>
            <li>While I enjoyed the scent of this hairspray, I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with the hold.</li>
            <li>Knew I had to get more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray . . .</li>
            <li>Having tried MANY hairsprays this is always my go to spray.</li>
            <li>Im glad I was able to get this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the hold that this give</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and i hope they never stop making it because i love it.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>this product is awesome, being spending a lot of money on the past trying to find a good hair spray and with no luck until I read review this product online.</li>
            <li>GREAT hair spray to add volume and hair style stays put but is completely touchable after use.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with it and will continue to use until it is gone :)    </li>
            <li>It comes out easily</li>
            <li>Love this product that i use everyday at an awesome price!</li>
            <li>It smells really good too and sprays more direct then all over the place.</li>
            <li>The product was in good condition; brand new.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and this helps create volume.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li>It holds it, but also is moves freely.  </li>
            <li>and I prefer more of a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Nice and stiff, GREAT smell (</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell (in my opinion), and holds great without being *too* stiff.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s perfect and certainly worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Great hold for my long curled hair.</li>
            <li>using this hair spray is fun and places hair where you want it and holds it all day!</li>
            <li>The hairspray was nice when the pump was working, however the spray sticks to the nozzle and it barely comes out of the nozzle so its not spraying easily now and evenly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it hold your style and smell good</li>
            <li>This is a good product, the only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the price.</li>
            <li>I quickly bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell fruity good (like I expected based on other reviews) and it doesn&#x27;t hold that great.</li>
            <li>I believe I have found my new favorite hair spray.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good and positive things about this hairspray.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and stick straight...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, straight and a lot of it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just flexible enough with a light spray--if you want a stronger hold, spray more.  </li>
            <li>perfume made from sunshine, fresh flowers and baby powder).  </li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s worth the money, if you want firm(er)</li>
            <li>Much better then the old hair spray I used.</li>
            <li>The hold is great but doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff.  </li>
            <li>I love other Bed Head products, but this is just ok.</li>
            <li>I usally use Big and Sexy hairspray (which I love) but thought I try something new.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery and</li>
            <li>Also this product made my hair very very crunchy and greasy.</li>
            <li>It holds my hair great, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling hard or sticky.</li>
            <li>So now I have to try running it under hot water and use a needle to poke the holes out</li>
            <li>Can usually last me a month or more.</li>
            <li>That was my first thought after smelling this product.</li>
            <li>Just what a recovering alcholoic needs to smell first thing in the morning and to be surrounded by all day.</li>
            <li>I love that it holds without my hair feeling sticky and gross!</li>
            <li>Nothing hot water cant fix.</li>
            <li>I often have to use quite a bit to get a more firm hold on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>But after having it for 3 weeks, it fizzles out of the bottle and drips over my hand and only sprays straight upwards because most of the holes in the hairspray nozzle are blocked.  </li>
            <li>I have short straight hair and love the all day hold it gives.</li>
            <li>I am of Asian descent and have pretty easy hair to work with.</li>
            <li>And if you have fine hair, straight hair, stubborn hair, or humid conditions, it&#x27;s just enough support to get through the day</li>
            <li>I got this with high hopes that it would do a great job, but when I got it, I was actually kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li>My friends and I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>Cons - can give a crunchy feel/texture if sprayed too much</li>
            <li>even if you do use too much, it STILL doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like the way it holds, but my hair is touchable.</li>
            <li>it is really truly FLEXIBLE.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making this</li>
            <li>Even if I put too much on my hair doesn&#x27;t feel brittle.</li>
            <li>This product was much cheaper even after the S&amp;H was factored in.</li>
            <li>I actually love the old hairspray I was using before, but wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li>In my approximately 36 years of hairspray use I finally came across this spray and let me just say it is the best I have ever used</li>
            <li>I will being going back to Big and Sexy for my hairspray.</li>
            <li>I would and have highly reccommended this product.</li>
            <li>The spray came out a little thicker than I had hoped (I guess I was hoping for more of an aerosol).</li>
            <li>No complaint for the spray, but the bottle has a leak where the plastic sprayer meets the metal can.</li>
            <li>The scent is not very pleasing, it has a strong old fashioned hair spray smell to me.</li>
            <li>I want to note too I live in AZ</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to ever live with out it.  </li>
            <li>This has good flexible hold but left my hair dull looking,</li>
            <li>The problem I do have is getting some volume at the roots at the top of my head, which is what I usually use hair spray for.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new hair spray since my old one was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I am a busy mom</li>
            <li>product has real holding power, so spray your fingers and run them through your hair starting at the roots.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more in case some crazy person decides to not make it any more.  </li>
            <li>It makes my straight short hair stay in place, but it also allows me to style it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with short straight unruly hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is a bit on the wild side and often on the frizzy side.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy nd sticky nor is it watery and non-holding.</li>
            <li>I needed a spray that offers a lot of support.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a final spray for when styling is complete, this one might work for you.</li>
            <li>Difficult to find on the shelves at Ulta as so popular.  </li>
            <li>This spray keeps my hir tame and frizz free all day long.</li>
            <li>It holds hard, but brushes out clean.</li>
            <li>will say that it&#x27;s not as strong a hold as Bedhead&#x27;s Hard Head or Masterpiece Massive Shine, but comes in a close third.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the few extra dollars verse</li>
            <li>I like this hairspray because, even though it&#x27;s pricey as far as hairsprays go, it holds really well without being stiff, and it also smells like candy.</li>
            <li>This hairspray works well on my thin, fine hair.  </li>

            <li> Nothing hot water cant fix.</li>
            <li> I often have to use quite a bit to get a more firm hold on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> But after having it for 3 weeks, it fizzles out of the bottle and drips over my hand and only sprays straight upwards because most of the holes in the hairspray nozzle are blocked.  </li>
            <li> I have short straight hair and love the all day hold it gives.</li>
            <li> I am of Asian descent and have pretty easy hair to work with.</li>
            <li> And if you have fine hair, straight hair, stubborn hair, or humid conditions, it&#x27;s just enough support to get through the day</li>
            <li> I got this with high hopes that it would do a great job, but when I got it, I was actually kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> My friends and I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> Cons - can give a crunchy feel/texture if sprayed too much</li>
            <li> even if you do use too much, it STILL doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like the way it holds, but my hair is touchable.</li>
            <li> it is really truly FLEXIBLE.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making this</li>
            <li> Even if I put too much on my hair doesn&#x27;t feel brittle.</li>
            <li> This product was much cheaper even after the S&amp;H was factored in.</li>
            <li> I actually love the old hairspray I was using before, but wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> In my approximately 36 years of hairspray use I finally came across this spray and let me just say it is the best I have ever used</li>
            <li> I will being going back to Big and Sexy for my hairspray.</li>
            <li> I would and have highly reccommended this product.</li>
            <li> The spray came out a little thicker than I had hoped (I guess I was hoping for more of an aerosol).</li>
            <li> No complaint for the spray, but the bottle has a leak where the plastic sprayer meets the metal can.</li>
            <li> The scent is not very pleasing, it has a strong old fashioned hair spray smell to me.</li>
            <li> I want to note too I live in AZ</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to ever live with out it.  </li>
            <li> This has good flexible hold but left my hair dull looking,</li>
            <li> The problem I do have is getting some volume at the roots at the top of my head, which is what I usually use hair spray for.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new hair spray since my old one was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I am a busy mom</li>
            <li> product has real holding power, so spray your fingers and run them through your hair starting at the roots.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more in case some crazy person decides to not make it any more.  </li>
            <li> It makes my straight short hair stay in place, but it also allows me to style it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with short straight unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is a bit on the wild side and often on the frizzy side.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy nd sticky nor is it watery and non-holding.</li>
            <li> I needed a spray that offers a lot of support.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a final spray for when styling is complete, this one might work for you.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find on the shelves at Ulta as so popular.  </li>
            <li> This spray keeps my hir tame and frizz free all day long.</li>
            <li> It holds hard, but brushes out clean.</li>
            <li> will say that it&#x27;s not as strong a hold as Bedhead&#x27;s Hard Head or Masterpiece Massive Shine, but comes in a close third.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the few extra dollars verse</li>
            <li> I like this hairspray because, even though it&#x27;s pricey as far as hairsprays go, it holds really well without being stiff, and it also smells like candy.</li>
            <li> This hairspray works well on my thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> and yet my hair is very touchable without being stiff.  </li>
            <li> It was a little more stiff and heavy</li>
            <li> My hair still looks natural when I use it, unlike other hairspray I have tried that hold well, but give my hair a sticky wet look.</li>
            <li> It really holds your style well without the crunchy hard look.  </li>
            <li> Overdo and you end up with difficult to brush hair, so go lightly.  </li>
            <li> It offers flexible hold when needed but also firm hold for &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; styles.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this spray because it&#x27;s flexible and doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair.  </li>
            <li> hold with some movement left in your hair without having it look greasy or caked down with product.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this is that the nozzle gets a little plugged up.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money trying to find a. Hairspray that holds but is not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Only a few hours after using this hair spray all my curls fell out.</li>
            <li> Truly, I have thick, coarse hair, and can&#x27;t stand my hair falling in my eyes especially at work, but also don&#x27;t want to look like I plastered my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> This is so average.</li>
            <li> ( I personally can&#x27;t vouch for its effects on thick or curly hair).</li>
            <li> and it does not weight it down like some do.  </li>
            <li> but it weighs my hair down</li>
            <li> Way less than I was paying at discount salon place.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that I often curl.</li>
            <li> It felt a little heavier than I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not excited about the fragrance, but I would recommend this to anyone with hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> The hold was a little stiffer than what I would call &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the hair look all hard and wet.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair everyday, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to my hairspray being lightweight, but having a firm, but flexible, hold.</li>
            <li> This just felt heavy.</li>
            <li> than I like and only got worse as I tried to build my style.</li>
            <li> and I prey everyday that they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time using any other aerosol spray.</li>
            <li> Holds without being too stiff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too stiff.</li>
            <li> Not the worst hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a hairspray that held my hair but that didn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or feel hard.</li>
            <li> Hold my hair all day without leaving it too hard.</li>
            <li> I think the hairspray is too thick to get through the holes to spray on to my hair without clogging up.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t your mother&#x27;s hairspray -- the hold is subtle and combable, no helmet head at all.</li>
            <li> (I have thin hair, no body)  </li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I am SO not impressed</li>
            <li> The nozzle does tend to get clogged often and needs periodic cleaning, or else the spray shoots in random directions.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> GREAT hair spray to add volume and hair style stays put but is completely touchable after use. This holds great and isn&#x27;t gummy.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I ever used.  The hold is great but doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff.  My friends and I highly recommend this product!  Fantastic hairspray!!!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray!! I have been using it for over 2yrs now and I have a hard time using any other aerosol spray. It holds my hair great, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling hard or sticky. I am a busy mom and I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair everyday, so this aids me in that! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this hairspray after a girl on one of my favorite beauty blogs recommended it.  Overall, I am happy with it and will continue to use until it is gone :)    Pros - great hold and scent  Cons - can give a crunchy feel/texture if sprayed too much</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my fine limp hair.  It holds it, but also is moves freely.  Smells great too!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hairspray because of the name of it, honestly.  But after having it for 3 weeks, it fizzles out of the bottle and drips over my hand and only sprays straight upwards because most of the holes in the hairspray nozzle are blocked.  So now I have to try running it under hot water and use a needle to poke the holes out becuase I think the hairspray is too thick to get through the holes to spray on to my hair without clogging up.  I recommend you don&#x27;t buy this hairspray, even if it smells okay, because this bottle is going to take a lot of maintenance.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best hair sprays I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;A great value for your money.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it hold your style and smell good but you also don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it for an all day hold.&lt;br /&gt;And even if you do use too much, it STILL doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great hairspray, this is it :)</li>
            <li> I am of Asian descent and have pretty easy hair to work with. The problem I do have is getting some volume at the roots at the top of my head, which is what I usually use hair spray for. And sometimes to hold curls in when necessary. I got this with high hopes that it would do a great job, but when I got it, I was actually kind of disappointed. The spray came out a little thicker than I had hoped (I guess I was hoping for more of an aerosol). I actually love the old hairspray I was using before, but wanted to try something different. For me, this product did not work well. It felt a little heavier than I wanted. I&#x27;m use to my hairspray being lightweight, but having a firm, but flexible, hold. This just felt heavy. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the seller. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This has good flexible hold but left my hair dull looking,</li>
            <li> Have use this product for a couple years, very pleased with how it finishes my style&lt;br /&gt;without using a lot of product.  A little pricey, but worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Have always been pleased with buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. Great hold for my long curled hair. Nice scent. Can usually last me a month or more.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this spray because it&#x27;s flexible and doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair.  I wasn&#x27;t too keen on spending $20 for hairspray but Amazon had it for $12.  Still a lot to pay for hair spray but a much better bargain that $20.  This is a good product, the only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the price.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is amazing. I have spent a lot of money trying to find a. Hairspray that holds but is not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;This is it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Have used this spray for years.  Difficult to find on the shelves at Ulta as so popular.  Amazon is always good bet for items.&lt;br /&gt;This product has real holding power, so spray your fingers and run them through your hair starting at the roots.  No need to spray again all day. (I have thin hair, no body)  Lasting hold even in humidity.  Overdo and you end up with difficult to brush hair, so go lightly.  That&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li> Bought this product based on the great reviews. But it did not work for me. I usally use Big and Sexy hairspray (which I love) but thought I try something new. I have long thick hair that I often curl. Only a few hours after using this hair spray all my curls fell out. I want to note too I live in AZ so humdity isn&#x27;t a factor at all haha. Also this product made my hair very very crunchy and greasy. It was also so sticky it clumped up all my hair into one big chunk. I even tried spraying each curl individually but it still all ended up stuck together . I was very disappointed. I will being going back to Big and Sexy for my hairspray. It is well worth the few extra dollars verse this product that I will now be throwing away.</li>
            <li> While I enjoyed the scent of this hairspray, I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with the hold. It was a little more stiff and heavy than I like and only got worse as I tried to build my style. Not the worst hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used, but not my favorite. If you&#x27;re looking for a final spray for when styling is complete, this one might work for you. If you like to spray as you style, you might want to try something different with a finer mist.</li>
            <li> Great price and amazing product!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this over and over again, my best hair spray, goes on light and holds great. highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great hold. Borrowed my roommate&#x27;s hairspray once when I ran out to hold my sock bun in place and it didn&#x27;t work what so ever. Knew I had to get more of this stuff. It is also truly flexible! It doesn&#x27;t make the hair look all hard and wet.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray . . . it has the perfect amount of hold yet leaves my hair so that it moves.</li>
            <li> This hairspray works well on my thin, fine hair.  Holds without being too stiff.  It&#x27;s just flexible enough with a light spray--if you want a stronger hold, spray more.  As with any hairspray, the nozzle can get clogged--just get in the habit of rinsing with warm water.  I&#x27;m not excited about the fragrance, but I would recommend this to anyone with hair like mine.  I could buy this again.</li>
            <li> Having tried MANY hairsprays this is always my go to spray. I have short straight hair and love the all day hold it gives. And price from this seller is awesome! Way less than I was paying at discount salon place.</li>
            <li> Im glad I was able to get this product through Amazon. I really like the way it holds, but my hair is touchable.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Only hairspray I use - but beware.  Make sure your hair is IN PLACE before you use this spray because afterwards it&#x27;s not going anywhere!  Nice and stiff, GREAT smell (a gal just complimented me on it at the gym, thought it was &amp;#34;a perfume made from sunshine, fresh flowers and baby powder).  I love it.</li>
            <li> It holds. It&#x27;s not too stiff. It smells nice.  It comes out easily enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it&#x27;s not as strong a hold as Bedhead&#x27;s Hard Head or Masterpiece Massive Shine, but comes in a close third.  I often have to use quite a bit to get a more firm hold on my fine hair.  But, that&#x27;s the point of a flexible spray--and flexible it is.  I would say it&#x27;s worth the money, if you want firm(er) hold with some movement left in your hair without having it look greasy or caked down with product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this product that i use everyday at an awesome price!</li>
            <li> My favourite hairspray!</li>
            <li> This is so average. Go buy some Suave and save yourself the money. It doesn&#x27;t smell fruity good (like I expected based on other reviews) and it doesn&#x27;t hold that great. I am SO not impressed, I won&#x27;t buy it again. It didn&#x27;t burn my hair off my head or attract bees or anything, so I am generously giving it two stars but I would rather use $3 grocery store hairspray than this. Also, the sprayer gets clogged almost daily.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new hair spray since my old one was discontinued.  I love the hold that this give and yet my hair is very touchable without being stiff.  I have very fine hair and it does not weight it down like some do.  I believe I have found my new favorite hair spray.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray! My hair is fine and stick straight... this is the only hairspray that will keep my hair curled! I have tried just about everything and will probably lose my mind if they stop making this stuff!</li>
            <li> That was my first thought after smelling this product. It smells just like Southern Comfort whiskey. Just what a recovering alcholoic needs to smell first thing in the morning and to be surrounded by all day. The Rockaholic name should have clued me in.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t want to ever live with out it.  It holds hard, but brushes out clean.</li>
            <li> I literally can say this is the hairspray I&#x27;ve been looking for all my life! Well, maybe not when I was a baby, but... Truly, I have thick, coarse hair, and can&#x27;t stand my hair falling in my eyes especially at work, but also don&#x27;t want to look like I plastered my hair in place.  This HOLDS but it is really truly FLEXIBLE.  My hair stays put but doesn&#x27;t look like it can&#x27;t move.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I will definitely buy more in case some crazy person decides to not make it any more.  TRY IT!</li>
            <li> using this hair spray is fun and places hair where you want it and holds it all day! Thanks for making this</li>
            <li> this is my second time buying this hairspray and i hope they never stop making it because i love it. It offers flexible hold when needed but also firm hold for &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; styles.</li>
            <li> I love that it holds without my hair feeling sticky and gross! My hair still looks natural when I use it, unlike other hairspray I have tried that hold well, but give my hair a sticky wet look. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, straight and a lot of it and this is great hair spray for me! Even if I put too much on my hair doesn&#x27;t feel brittle. It holds all day and stand up to sweat and a lot of movement. I would and have highly reccommended this product. Plus I love the orange can!</li>
            <li> No complaint for the spray, but the bottle has a leak where the plastic sprayer meets the metal can. Therefore it is constantly leaking sticky globs.</li>
            <li> I love other Bed Head products, but this is just ok. The scent is not very pleasing, it has a strong old fashioned hair spray smell to me. The hold was a little stiffer than what I would call &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; hair spray. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> A dry-type hairspray, great to use for rolling hair. My hair is fine and this helps create volume. Great product.</li>
            <li> The hairspray was nice when the pump was working, however the spray sticks to the nozzle and it barely comes out of the nozzle so its not spraying easily now and evenly.</li>
            <li> I happened upon this in a sample size at my local grocery store, bought it on a lark, and have been hooked ever since. This isn&#x27;t your mother&#x27;s hairspray -- the hold is subtle and combable, no helmet head at all. And if you have fine hair, straight hair, stubborn hair, or humid conditions, it&#x27;s just enough support to get through the day ( I personally can&#x27;t vouch for its effects on thick or curly hair). The nozzle does tend to get clogged often and needs periodic cleaning, or else the spray shoots in random directions. But other than that, it&#x27;s perfect and certainly worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray! It has a nice smell (in my opinion), and holds great without being *too* stiff.</li>
            <li> Good hold but it weighs my hair down and it&#x27;s a bit sticky. Smells kind of fruity and I prefer more of a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Holds hair great, but gives flexibility. Great for curling hairstyles or for keeping in the volume you create. Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Much better then the old hair spray I used. The only problem with this is that the nozzle gets a little plugged up. Nothing hot water cant fix.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  It makes my straight short hair stay in place, but it also allows me to style it.  I would recommend this to anyone with short straight unruly hair.</li>
            <li> The product was in good condition; brand new. Toni &amp; Guy has stopped selling this product altogether, and even at Nordstrom Rack the price is still about $17-$19. This product was much cheaper even after the S&amp;H was factored in. I like this hairspray because, even though it&#x27;s pricey as far as hairsprays go, it holds really well without being stiff, and it also smells like candy. It doesn&#x27;t have the gross alcohol-y or get-high-off-of-fumes-in-the-salon type of smell.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It really holds your style well without the crunchy hard look.  It smells really good too and sprays more direct then all over the place.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good and positive things about this hairspray. In my approximately 36 years of hairspray use I finally came across this spray and let me just say it is the best I have ever used and I prey everyday that they never stop making it. I have naturally curly hair that is a bit on the wild side and often on the frizzy side. This spray keeps my hir tame and frizz free all day long. It is not heavy nd sticky nor is it watery and non-holding. It is the perfect in between. It holds your hair all dy with just one application but you can actually run your fingers through it at the same time. When someone hugs you your hair doesn&#x27;t slam them in the face and knock them over. IT IS ABSOLUTELY AWSOME, SUPERB, THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED!! You have to try this hairspray you will not regret it guaranteed. Oh, and by the way it is cheapest on Amazon, cannot find it in any stores. ULTA Stores used to carry it in there stores but now I can only find it on there onine site.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a hairspray that held my hair but that didn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or feel hard. I have found what I was looking for. I needed a spray that offers a lot of support. I intend to reorder when I run out. Great seller!!</li>
            <li> title of the review says it all.. the hairspray literally freezes your hair where it is and creates VOLUME on my totally volumeless hair.. i&#x27;ve never had volume. i&#x27;m speechless!!</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I heard that this product was discontinued so when I found it online I quickly bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Great Price.&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and this product is awesome, being spending a lot of money on the past trying to find a good hair spray and with no luck until I read review this product online. Hold my hair all day without leaving it too hard. Ps price here is $8 different from salon.</li>
