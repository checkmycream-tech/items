            <li>Well satisfied.</li>
            <li>They are SIGNIFICANTLY better than when I wrote that.</li>
            <li>They are SIGNIFICANTLY better than when I wrote that.</li>
            <li>So much better than squeezing out blemishes with fingernails.</li>
            <li>and I moved on the Queen Helene mint julep, which worked out better for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Severe being more than one (try about 20 over my face).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now along with Paula&#x27;s Skin Balancing cleanser and toner with a bit of the Resist Anti-Aging Hydrator (love that stuff).</li>
            <li>I did not see any improvement at all after more than 3 days of application.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a trial size on paula&#x27;s choice website and was extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love this for blackheads on my nose,</li>
            <li>It seems to keep my pores cleaner, allowing them to shrink more.</li>
            <li>Seems to work as a spot treatment most of the time but don&#x27;t expect miraculous results.</li>
            <li>love Paula&#x27;s Choice</li>
            <li>Also, we consumers need to keep in mind that more isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li>Enjoy :)</li>
            <li>There’s no research directly linking salicylic acid in skincare products to treating sebaceous hyperplasia but in theory and, as we’ve seen, in practice, it can help a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s often wise to embrace both paucity and patience in life, particularly when it comes to what we put on and in our body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I guess my redness was deeper because even after a couple of weeks of using this, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Choice products have made a huge difference in the health and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>This product worked better than my $2000.00 worth of laser treatments.  </li>
            <li>This serum takes times to work and doesn&#x27;t erase them all the way, all the time, but has greatly reduced them (I use it daily under makeup, because I use the RetinA at night).</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it because it was advertised as diminishing redness.</li>
            <li>Below is my original review</li>
            <li>But you will notice a difference the first time you use it and even more improvement over time.  </li>
            <li>And that is where this product really was outstanding, for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong on blackheads but gentle on my skin!  </li>
            <li>I use one quick pump of the product on to my palm, them with my index finger</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a devoted user for several years because the scope of products is broad, they&#x27;re of excellent quality, samples are available, the products work very well for me--and  </li>
            <li>I use BHA 9 in conjunction with other RESIST exfoliants, which are very effective in \\&quot;resurfacing\\&quot; my skin, but progress in overcoming my sebaceous hyperplasia came speedily once I added BHA 9 to my facecare routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is a great little serum treatment for a BHA product.</li>
            <li>This clear, liquid-like solution contains a potent concentration of salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>Although my skin is not yet perfectly clear of clogged pores, I am seeing improvement, so I will continue to use this product and will watch for more results.</li>
            <li>It is fully absorbed within a minute or so and leaves no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the many compliments I constantly get on my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Paula&#x27;s Choice RESIST BHA 9 very successfully on my combination skin (oily T-zone) to markedly diminish the patches of bumpy sebaceous hyperplasia (clogged sweat glands) on my forehead and the small patch of them on my nose.</li>
            <li>I received the product as advertised and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>The formula is very smooth, a bit heavy, but goes on easily under moisturizer at night.  </li>
            <li>So much so that they are almost gone (Yay!)</li>
            <li>I have not finished the first vial</li>
            <li>Really !  </li>
            <li>but I had to keep going back for more treatments to treat remaining spots.  </li>
            <li>Thanks PC!</li>
            <li>, is that much higher.</li>
            <li>THEN it costs WAY too much!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on sale pretty often, 15% or 20% off.</li>
            <li>Before this serum, I used Stridex in the Red Box nightly and it worked better for my skin than this BHA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>The thick, cheap 2% gels are way better!  </li>
            <li>And it makes the pores and sebaceous filaments on my nose pretty much disappear.</li>
            <li>and I used it on my nose for large pores.</li>
            <li>It seems to really help keep my stubborn blackhead/clogged pore area at bay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and contains no artificial fragrances or colors.  </li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>but it really seems to help my pores and my hyperplasia .</li>
            <li>With what is left over I smooth it over my nose.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Paula</li>
            <li>I see results in the pores, but am not yet seeing much of a result</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the price, considering the fast shipment</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not finding much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t seen any signs of improvement.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast and well this worked for me.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really remove the sebaceous spots.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for sebaceous hyperplasia.  </li>
            <li>I have a code here for any new paulas choice customers that will give you $10 off your first order from the site.</li>
            <li>It has now been about two weeks, and I&#x27;m definitely seeing significant improvement in my clogged pores.</li>
            <li>: It has been four weeks since I wrote the original review above.</li>
            <li>On my forehead I am only using the product at night to treat my sebaceous hyperplasia, and as in my original review, there is still no visible improvement there.</li>
            <li>On my forehead I am only using the product at night to treat my sebaceous hyperplasia, and as in my original review, there is still no visible improvement there.</li>
            <li>I have these painless but unattractive bumps, and my dermatologist zapped them with an electric needle--which left my face all spotty for days and barely reduced many of them.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to see this product, especially because of the high percentage of BHA.  </li>
            <li>this is the first one that really surprised me.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I did not buy this product from Amazon, but directly from Paula&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>For years now, the only products I&#x27;ve been able to use are salicylic acid, and glycolic acid in low concentrations.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to help control oil production overall a little bit, which is a nice side effect.</li>
            <li>As a new mom I had lots of new spots on my skin.</li>
            <li>Despite the peeling I mentioned earlier, this is not drying -- probably because the first four ingredients are thickeners and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product would probably be best as the final part of your skincare routine, as it might slow things down considerably if you use it early on.</li>
            <li>We tend to want instant results in our society, but our bodies operate at their own (usually slower) pace.</li>
            <li>And for the pump, I finally figured out that if I push the pump sideways into the palm of my hand while simultaneously pressing down on the pump, I can control the amount better.</li>
            <li>I reluctantly decided to keep using it on my problem areas, and now, after two weeks, I am definitely noticing positive changes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this contains a large amount of salicylic acid, I next tried it on a breakout.</li>
            <li>My clogged pores have continued to clear.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t see any point in wasting this much money for this tiny bottle and you shouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li>Can complete dissolution be around the corner?</li>
            <li>I am 68 yr old and still have blemishes and sebaceous hyperplasia.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, why was I checking out Amazon, when I can buy from Paula directly?  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast the red marks from my zits are fading.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product directly from Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li>It definitely works on breakouts and should do well on any issues with the top few layers of your skin, as well.</li>
            <li>White bumps are gone, fine lines are visibly reduced, overall plumpness and collagen in skin is improved, redness of old acne scars is faded almost completely, no new breakouts, existing blemishes disappear overnight...</li>
            <li>It is also promoted as being good for problem-areas where nothing else has done the trick, but I&#x27;ve found it to be a little too harsh for continued use in a specific area on my sensitive skin (i.e. using it on the same patch of skin for more than a few days)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had just the slightest amount of peeling, but oddly no dryness at all.</li>
            <li>This is an instant classic for me, just like the 2% BHA from this line.</li>
            <li>As I continue to use BHA 9, the hyperplasia on my forehead steadily gets smaller and fainter.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I&#x27;m not going outside without a high SPF sunscreen.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fair-skinned with mild to moderate closed comedones.  </li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t dry and stick to the skin because you can only use it at night and it wipes right off on the pillow as soon as you roll onto your side.  </li>
            <li>I used the product for a little over a week and my huge white spot is now GONE.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t control how much is dispensed and the little pump pumps out way too much product for just one zit.  </li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin, so benzoyl peroxide is totally out of the question for me to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed in recent months.</li>
            <li>I take a tiny bit and put it directly on the Sebacous Hyperplaisia spots.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I developed cystic acne that only went away after stopping use of this</li>
            <li>Despite its strength, it&#x27;s still extremely gentle due to its time-release formula.</li>
            <li>The only thing is if you&#x27;re skin is sensitive, start by using it only at night and maybe a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>user (\\&quot;super reader\\&quot;) who complained that BHA 9 exacerbated her/his already oily skin appears not to have used the product according to directions.</li>
            <li>I expected it to work really well, and much faster than the usual 2% BHA products you see everywhere.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews about overnight success, I was discouraged when after the first few nights I saw no improvement in my seriously clogged pores.</li>
            <li>It helps calm down active acne spots too.</li>

            <li> for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> The thick, cheap 2% gels are way better!  </li>
            <li> And it makes the pores and sebaceous filaments on my nose pretty much disappear.</li>
            <li> and I used it on my nose for large pores.</li>
            <li> It seems to really help keep my stubborn blackhead/clogged pore area at bay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and contains no artificial fragrances or colors.  </li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> but it really seems to help my pores and my hyperplasia .</li>
            <li> With what is left over I smooth it over my nose.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Paula</li>
            <li> I see results in the pores, but am not yet seeing much of a result</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the price, considering the fast shipment</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not finding much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> and I really haven&#x27;t seen any signs of improvement.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast and well this worked for me.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really remove the sebaceous spots.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for sebaceous hyperplasia.  </li>
            <li> I have a code here for any new paulas choice customers that will give you $10 off your first order from the site.</li>
            <li> It has now been about two weeks, and I&#x27;m definitely seeing significant improvement in my clogged pores.</li>
            <li> : It has been four weeks since I wrote the original review above.</li>
            <li> On my forehead I am only using the product at night to treat my sebaceous hyperplasia, and as in my original review, there is still no visible improvement there.</li>
            <li> On my forehead I am only using the product at night to treat my sebaceous hyperplasia, and as in my original review, there is still no visible improvement there.</li>
            <li> I have these painless but unattractive bumps, and my dermatologist zapped them with an electric needle--which left my face all spotty for days and barely reduced many of them.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to see this product, especially because of the high percentage of BHA.  </li>
            <li> this is the first one that really surprised me.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I did not buy this product from Amazon, but directly from Paula&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> For years now, the only products I&#x27;ve been able to use are salicylic acid, and glycolic acid in low concentrations.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to help control oil production overall a little bit, which is a nice side effect.</li>
            <li> As a new mom I had lots of new spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> Despite the peeling I mentioned earlier, this is not drying -- probably because the first four ingredients are thickeners and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product would probably be best as the final part of your skincare routine, as it might slow things down considerably if you use it early on.</li>
            <li> We tend to want instant results in our society, but our bodies operate at their own (usually slower) pace.</li>
            <li> And for the pump, I finally figured out that if I push the pump sideways into the palm of my hand while simultaneously pressing down on the pump, I can control the amount better.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly decided to keep using it on my problem areas, and now, after two weeks, I am definitely noticing positive changes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this contains a large amount of salicylic acid, I next tried it on a breakout.</li>
            <li> My clogged pores have continued to clear.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t see any point in wasting this much money for this tiny bottle and you shouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li> Can complete dissolution be around the corner?</li>
            <li> I am 68 yr old and still have blemishes and sebaceous hyperplasia.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, why was I checking out Amazon, when I can buy from Paula directly?  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast the red marks from my zits are fading.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product directly from Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li> It definitely works on breakouts and should do well on any issues with the top few layers of your skin, as well.</li>
            <li> White bumps are gone, fine lines are visibly reduced, overall plumpness and collagen in skin is improved, redness of old acne scars is faded almost completely, no new breakouts, existing blemishes disappear overnight...</li>
            <li> It is also promoted as being good for problem-areas where nothing else has done the trick, but I&#x27;ve found it to be a little too harsh for continued use in a specific area on my sensitive skin (i.e. using it on the same patch of skin for more than a few days)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had just the slightest amount of peeling, but oddly no dryness at all.</li>
            <li> This is an instant classic for me, just like the 2% BHA from this line.</li>
            <li> As I continue to use BHA 9, the hyperplasia on my forehead steadily gets smaller and fainter.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I&#x27;m not going outside without a high SPF sunscreen.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fair-skinned with mild to moderate closed comedones.  </li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t dry and stick to the skin because you can only use it at night and it wipes right off on the pillow as soon as you roll onto your side.  </li>
            <li> I used the product for a little over a week and my huge white spot is now GONE.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t control how much is dispensed and the little pump pumps out way too much product for just one zit.  </li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin, so benzoyl peroxide is totally out of the question for me to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed in recent months.</li>
            <li> I take a tiny bit and put it directly on the Sebacous Hyperplaisia spots.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I developed cystic acne that only went away after stopping use of this</li>
            <li> Despite its strength, it&#x27;s still extremely gentle due to its time-release formula.</li>
            <li> The only thing is if you&#x27;re skin is sensitive, start by using it only at night and maybe a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> user (\\&quot;super reader\\&quot;) who complained that BHA 9 exacerbated her/his already oily skin appears not to have used the product according to directions.</li>
            <li> I expected it to work really well, and much faster than the usual 2% BHA products you see everywhere.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews about overnight success, I was discouraged when after the first few nights I saw no improvement in my seriously clogged pores.</li>
            <li> It helps calm down active acne spots too.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience with a supplement that caused me to break out when normally I have great skin.</li>
            <li> The packaging needs to be changed because you need only a small amount and it tends to send out too much.  </li>
            <li> Another update 9-11-14, the chunkier ones(ugh!) have turned flat.</li>
            <li> the dissatisfied user pointed out, yes, the product is expensive; however, you need to use only a very small amount to get good results.</li>
            <li> In a matter of only a few days, the hyperplasia on my nose completely vanished and those on my forehead shrank noticeably.</li>
            <li> Either way, start slow and use only a tiny bit on the main problem areas.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product for as long as it&#x27;s manufactured</li>
            <li> I will update this review once I know how long this products lasts with nightly use.</li>
            <li> Finally producing less oil and acne to only be hit with severe hyperplasia.</li>
            <li> They leave my skin red, inflamed, and permanently hyper-pigmented due to long-term inflammation.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was really nervous about trying this product due to its high concentration of salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> Well, since not gonna put it on the entire face but spot treatment as a last step of night skin care, I have not yet seen any result for just a few tried.</li>
            <li> Tiny little motions can get a tiny bit of serum out, bigger ones can do half a pump or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve also developed in the past year on my forehead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I was only using small amounts of this at a time as a spot treatment, I can&#x27;t say how it made my skin feel overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not particularly viscous.</li>
            <li> I had previously received a sample in a tiny vial.  </li>
            <li> After looking through a few different websites, I found Paula&#x27;s Choice Resist BHA 9 Spot Treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the product for a few days.  </li>
            <li> It cleared up the breakout in only a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a dermatologist’s care is required, there are a few key products to consider.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out of desperation because other products would work temporarily</li>
            <li> Our skin is a living organ that, like any other of our body parts, can be overwhelmed by an onslaught of chemicals.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I do note that it took a little while to dry.</li>
            <li> skin tends to be dry these days; this might feel a bit heavy for oilier skin.</li>
            <li> I had a few small areas of redness after a recent breakout</li>
            <li> Not worth $40.</li>
            <li> Then it runs everywhere and half the product is wasted.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I have a few flesh colored bumps on my cheeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this in a few months with an update.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> What a waste of 40 dollars.  </li>
            <li> The Sebacous Hyperplaisia shrinks down to almost invisible, no more bumpy skin.  </li>
            <li> So are all of the other commonly prescribed medications.</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken a before picture of my skin to show the dramatic results of using this produce only 3 times!</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad Milia on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I only use a tiny bit each time so the cost is not so bad.  </li>
            <li> This heavy liquid isn&#x27;t intended for application all over the face; BHA 9 is designed to \\&quot;spot treat\\&quot; troubled areas only:</li>
            <li> so you use very little of it at a time.</li>
            <li> Pricey with very little product</li>
            <li> This seems a bit expensive given that you only get one ounce although I &#x27;s just a spot treatment</li>
            <li> but I am not sure on the chunkier (ugh) ones.</li>
            <li> Even the wartier looking ones are gone or reduced to small bumps.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a bit pricey given the really small size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never know; I returned this product because it was like waking up to an oil slick on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy oily substance which made my oily skin 10X oilier.</li>
            <li> I had a white spot under my eye that had been getting worse and worse no matter what I tried.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find one that isn&#x27;t - al least for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find one that isn&#x27;t - al least for my skin.  </li>
            <li> At least it hasn&#x27;t worked yet.  </li>
            <li> And its only been a few days!!!!!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously life changing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously blown away.</li>
            <li> Although treating sebaceous hyperplasia yourself can be frustrating and in almost all cases</li>
            <li> I have not experienced ANY redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I seem to be the one person that this miracle worker just doesn&#x27;t work for.  </li>
            <li> It merely flattens it.</li>
            <li> Also extremely expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> If you have had a bad reaction to salicylic acid or are allergic to aspirin, you should not use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so bad</li>
            <li> Feeling disappointed and frustrated.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Very Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Oh, so cruel Mother Nature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum nightly for four weeks now on my worst acne and there has not been any improvement with this product.  </li>

            <li> For all of those who want to start an affordable and very effective face routine here is a link for $10 OFF your first Paula&#x27;s Choice online order: http://goo.gl/J5uNbc﻿ Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> Good product with fat delivery</li>
            <li> I received the product as advertised and shipping was very fast. Well satisfied. Thank you.</li>
            <li> After seeing my dermatologist and being told that there was nothing that could be done about my clogged oil glands on my forehead and nose, I decided to do some research.  After looking through a few different websites, I found Paula&#x27;s Choice Resist BHA 9 Spot Treatment.  I ordered a sample of the product to see it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, like with all skin care, it takes time and patience to see results.  I have combo/dry skin and as mentioned the clogged oil glands are on my forehead and nose.  After 3 weeks of daily application, I am seeing a reduction in the appearance of the clogged glands on both my forehead and nose with the bonus of the elimination of a stubborn whitehead on the side of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  Changes don&#x27;t happen overnight, however with patience and continued use, you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> This seems a bit expensive given that you only get one ounce although I &#x27;s just a spot treatment so you use very little of it at a time. It seems to really help keep my stubborn blackhead/clogged pore area at bay.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for a few days.  I have a few flesh colored bumps on my cheeks and I have tried everything to diminish them. This product has seemed to make them disappear. And its only been a few days!!!!!  I am so happy I found this product.  Thank you Paula&#x27;s Choice!!!</li>
            <li> This BHA treatment is great. When I spot some redness or blemish just emerging, I put it on after my moisturizer in the evening and there is almost no sign of it the next morning. It is also promoted as being good for problem-areas where nothing else has done the trick, but I&#x27;ve found it to be a little too harsh for continued use in a specific area on my sensitive skin (i.e. using it on the same patch of skin for more than a few days)</li>
            <li> Helps with imperfections like hyperplasia.</li>
            <li> Whether or not you like this product will probably depend on what condition(s) you&#x27;re looking to treat. I was excited to try it because it was advertised as diminishing redness. I had a few small areas of redness after a recent breakout and I thought they&#x27;d be a great way to test this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a bit of peeling where I used this. So if your issue relates to the top layer(s) of skin, this could really be a good product for you. However, I guess my redness was deeper because even after a couple of weeks of using this, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this contains a large amount of salicylic acid, I next tried it on a breakout. And that is where this product really was outstanding, for me. It cleared up the breakout in only a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I was only using small amounts of this at a time as a spot treatment, I can&#x27;t say how it made my skin feel overall. I do note that it took a little while to dry. This product would probably be best as the final part of your skincare routine, as it might slow things down considerably if you use it early on. Despite the peeling I mentioned earlier, this is not drying -- probably because the first four ingredients are thickeners and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not particularly viscous. However, once you apply it, it&#x27;s not runny. It&#x27;s clear and contains no artificial fragrances or colors.  This was non-irritating for me. If you have had a bad reaction to salicylic acid or are allergic to aspirin, you should not use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a quality product. It definitely works on breakouts and should do well on any issues with the top few layers of your skin, as well.</li>
            <li> What about options outside the dermatologist&#x27;s office? Although treating sebaceous hyperplasia yourself can be frustrating and in almost all cases a dermatologist’s care is required, there are a few key products to consider. Chief among them is a product we&#x27;re very proud of, and that&#x27;s our Resist BHA 9 for Stubborn Imperfections. This clear, liquid-like solution contains a potent concentration of salicylic acid. Despite its strength, it&#x27;s still extremely gentle due to its time-release formula. Salicylic acid penetrates the oil buildup, increases cell turnover by exfoliating the surface of the skin as well as inside the pore to unclog these bumps, and reduces inflammation, all of which diminish these bumps. There’s no research directly linking salicylic acid in skincare products to treating sebaceous hyperplasia but in theory and, as we’ve seen, in practice, it can help a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^This what is there website says about this product! Wanted to try this for my  sebaceous hyperplasia  but uhm I can plenty of products with salicylic acid...so I don&#x27;t see any point in wasting this much money for this tiny bottle and you shouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about overnight success, I was discouraged when after the first few nights I saw no improvement in my seriously clogged pores. I reluctantly decided to keep using it on my problem areas, and now, after two weeks, I am definitely noticing positive changes. I have severely clogged pores/bumpy black-heads all around my mouth, and this clogged area has been spreading in recent months. I also have extremely sensitive skin, so benzoyl peroxide is totally out of the question for me to use. So are all of the other commonly prescribed medications. They leave my skin red, inflamed, and permanently hyper-pigmented due to long-term inflammation. For years now, the only products I&#x27;ve been able to use are salicylic acid, and glycolic acid in low concentrations. But even those have been no match for the worsening clogged pores and cystic acne I&#x27;ve developed in recent months. Needless to say, I was really nervous about trying this product due to its high concentration of salicylic acid. It has now been about two weeks, and I&#x27;m definitely seeing significant improvement in my clogged pores. I&#x27;ve also had no additional cystic acne, or any acne, for that matter. I have not experienced ANY redness or irritation. I&#x27;m seeing a lot of skin-smoothing at this time, so I know it&#x27;s giving me added exfoliation in comparison to what I was using. Because of this, I&#x27;m not going outside without a high SPF sunscreen. I don&#x27;t want to add additional sun damage. Although my skin is not yet perfectly clear of clogged pores, I am seeing improvement, so I will continue to use this product and will watch for more results. I will update again in a couple of weeks. One thing the product is NOT helping with is the sebaceous hyperplasia I that I&#x27;ve also developed in the past year on my forehead. (However I HAVE noticed definite smoothing of my forehead creases!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 7/31/15: It has been four weeks since I wrote the original review above. My clogged pores have continued to clear. They are SIGNIFICANTLY better than when I wrote that. In fact, I&#x27;m pretty happy with how my skin is looking. I would say that overall there is a 70 to 80% reduction in clogged pores, and I&#x27;ve had no cystic acne since using this. I have actually been using the product twice each day all around my mouth and nose (no problems with irritation). I did stop using sunscreen because it seemed to be comedogenic. I have yet to find one that isn&#x27;t - al least for my skin.  On my forehead I am only using the product at night to treat my sebaceous hyperplasia, and as in my original review, there is still no visible improvement there. At this point though, the acne and clogged pore improvements are benefit enough for me.ar. They are SIGNIFICANTLY better than when I wrote that.

            <li> Did absolutely nothing. No change to my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying I almost NEVER write reviews for things I buy but oh, my, goodness... This stuff is seriously life changing. I wish I had taken a before picture of my skin to show the dramatic results of using this produce only 3 times! White bumps are gone, fine lines are visibly reduced, overall plumpness and collagen in skin is improved, redness of old acne scars is faded almost completely, no new breakouts, existing blemishes disappear overnight... I&#x27;m seriously blown away. The only thing is if you&#x27;re skin is sensitive, start by using it only at night and maybe a couple times a week. My skin is really sensitive and I&#x27;ve had just the slightest amount of peeling, but oddly no dryness at all. Maybe the peeling is a good thing like I&#x27;m shedding the damaged skin. Either way, start slow and use only a tiny bit on the main problem areas. Use this with Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Perfecting solution and prepare to be stunned. I will continue using this product for as long as it&#x27;s manufactured which I hope is forever. Also, use the Equinox blackhead extractor tools they sell on here. So much better than squeezing out blemishes with fingernails. Huge improvement!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of all the raving reviews, but it just does not work for me. I have combination - acne-prone skin and I used this religiously for a week, before giving up on it and I moved on the Queen Helene mint julep, which worked out better for my skin type.</li>
            <li> ** 09/04/14 IT WORKS** Another update 9-11-14, the chunkier ones(ugh!) have turned flat. Can complete dissolution be around the corner? -- Oh, so cruel Mother Nature. Finally producing less oil and acne to only be hit with severe hyperplasia. Severe being more than one (try about 20 over my face). I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now along with Paula&#x27;s Skin Balancing cleanser and toner with a bit of the Resist Anti-Aging Hydrator (love that stuff). I can say that the BHA 9 is definitely working on my flatter spots. So much so that they are almost gone (Yay!) but I am not sure on the chunkier (ugh) ones. I think they&#x27;re getting smaller but admittedly, there is a LOT of wishful thinking and hoping going on there. I&#x27;ll update this in a few months with an update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 4 days &amp; already I can see a difference! The bumps on my face are already getting smaller, &amp; my pores have shrunk! My face is looking amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to see my results after another 4 days! Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Does not work - I did not see any improvement at all after more than 3 days of application.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a trial size on paula&#x27;s choice website and was extremely pleased with the results. I have been having recurring breakouts on my cheeks where I just could not seem to break the cycle of them. I had a horrible experience with a supplement that caused me to break out when normally I have great skin. I decided to try this out of desperation because other products would work temporarily but then the breakouts would start up again. I used this in conjunction with the paulas choice BHA 2% exfoliant and now my cheeks have finally stopped the recurring breakout and the red spots are finally starting to fade. I am still getting 1-2 breakouts here and there but its reducing gradually and its not the, stays under the skin for weeks or months kind, and they seem to go away faster. I have a code here for any new paulas choice customers that will give you $10 off your first order from the site. Enjoy! https://goo.gl/xqVefS</li>
            <li> I have not finished the first vial but it really seems to help my pores and my hyperplasia . I have been using it in the evening as directed.</li>
            <li> Amazing product !! This product worked better than my $2000.00 worth of laser treatments.  Really !  I bought this product to treat Sebaceous Hyperplaisia.  The laser treatment worked but I had to keep going back for more treatments to treat remaining spots.  I saw the great reviews for this product and decided to give it a try.  The results are truly amazing.  It shrunk the spots to almost nothing and I used it on my nose for large pores. The pores are very tiny now and I could not br happier.  I use one quick pump of the product on to my palm, them with my index finger I take a tiny bit and put it directly on the Sebacous Hyperplaisia spots.  With what is left over I smooth it over my nose.  The Sebacous Hyperplaisia shrinks down to almost invisible, no more bumpy skin.  This condition, SH can not be cured, it is a pore that has been damaged and will never recover. It is very likely that the treatment will need to be used in a continous routine.  But, with the results having it as part of my regular skin care is a no brainer.  The consistancey is unlike anything else I have ever used.  It feels oily.  I only use a tiny bit each time so the cost is not so bad.  P.S. I am rarely impressed with cosmetic treatments this is the first one that really surprised me.  Thanks Paula</li>
            <li> Pricey with very little product</li>
            <li> I love this for blackheads on my nose, well I guess I should say for the blackheads I USED to have on my nose.  It&#x27;s strong on blackheads but gentle on my skin!  Thanks PC!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great little serum treatment for a BHA product. It seems to keep my pores cleaner, allowing them to shrink more. It also seems to help control oil production overall a little bit, which is a nice side effect. I use it on my large-pored nose, the cheek area adjacent to my nose, my chin, and my 3 spots of sebaceous hyperplasia. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now. I see results in the pores, but am not yet seeing much of a result w/ the hyperplasia spots. I&#x27;m knocking a star off for price, which to me is overpriced for this item. I will update this review once I know how long this products lasts with nightly use.</li>
            <li> First of all, I did not buy this product from Amazon, but directly from Paula&#x27;s website.  I am just about to reorder - it&#x27;s on sale!  About this product - IT WORKS!!!  I am 68 yr old and still have blemishes and sebaceous hyperplasia.  I use it in conjunction with Paula&#x27;s Resist C15 Super Booster (or an excellent vitamin C serum on here on Amazon by Azure Naturals, which I recommend, that has a higher potency).  I mix the two fluids and apply all over my face.  It initially does have an oily feel, yet, there is no oil in this product.  It is fully absorbed within a minute or so and leaves no greasy feel.  Yes, I use it all over and my entire complexion is improved, without any dryness or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;So, why was I checking out Amazon, when I can buy from Paula directly?  Well, at times I run out of product and need a replacement immediately - and I am so happy to find this product listed as Amazon Prime - so I can get it the next day!  I don&#x27;t think the price, considering the fast shipment, is that much higher.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do a darn thing...so don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> Seems to work as a spot treatment most of the time but don&#x27;t expect miraculous results.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a little over a month now and I&#x27;m not finding much of a difference.  Not worth $40.</li>
            <li> Below is my original review but I upgraded to 3 stars after using it a week.  I had previously received a sample in a tiny vial.  I found I can pump some product into the vial and then pick up a tiny bit with a Q-tip and then apply it so I&#x27;m not wasting a bunch every time I use it.  I still don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t dry and stick to the skin because you can only use it at night and it wipes right off on the pillow as soon as you roll onto your side.  I&#x27;ll use it til it&#x27;s gone but still won&#x27;t repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Paula&#x27;s Choice and I was so excited to see this product, especially because of the high percentage of BHA.  I expected it to work really well, and much faster than the usual 2% BHA products you see everywhere.  SO disappointed!  You can&#x27;t control how much is dispensed and the little pump pumps out way too much product for just one zit.  Then it runs everywhere and half the product is wasted.  Then it doesn&#x27;t stay on where you put it.  It runs off.  Then the zit is still there after you wake up.  THEN it costs WAY too much!  The thick, cheap 2% gels are way better!  I can&#x27;t even believe it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.  At least it hasn&#x27;t worked yet.  It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference.  I will keep using and see if the bumps go away.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad Milia on my forehead and cheeks. I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for about 3 weeks and I really haven&#x27;t seen any signs of improvement.</li>
            <li> This is an instant classic for me, just like the 2% BHA from this line. I can&#x27;t believe how fast the red marks from my zits are fading. It helps calm down active acne spots too. And it makes the pores and sebaceous filaments on my nose pretty much disappear. The downsides are the price and the container. It&#x27;s on sale pretty often, 15% or 20% off. Or you can get a trial size vial on the company website. And for the pump, I finally figured out that if I push the pump sideways into the palm of my hand while simultaneously pressing down on the pump, I can control the amount better. Tiny little motions can get a tiny bit of serum out, bigger ones can do half a pump or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to be dry these days; this might feel a bit heavy for oilier skin.</li>
            <li> Got those dreaded milia?  This is the cure.  I was amazed at how fast and well this worked for me.  The packaging needs to be changed because you need only a small amount and it tends to send out too much.  But you will notice a difference the first time you use it and even more improvement over time.  This is a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I seem to be the one person that this miracle worker just doesn&#x27;t work for.  I&#x27;ve been using the serum nightly for four weeks now on my worst acne and there has not been any improvement with this product.  In fact, I developed cystic acne that only went away after stopping use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fair-skinned with mild to moderate closed comedones.  Before this serum, I used Stridex in the Red Box nightly and it worked better for my skin than this BHA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no reason not to try this serum if you&#x27;ve been looking at it and are unsure about it.  The formula is very smooth, a bit heavy, but goes on easily under moisturizer at night.  I did not experience any burning or itching.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I had a white spot under my eye that had been getting worse and worse no matter what I tried.  This spot had been under my eye for years.  It was so bad, I was going to see a dermatologist to get it taken care of.  I couldn&#x27;t be seen for three months so I decided while I was waiting, to try this product based on its reviews.  I used the product for a little over a week and my huge white spot is now GONE.  And now I don&#x27;t have to see a doctor!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!! As a new mom I had lots of new spots on my skin. After a month of using this serum the have vanished!</li>
            <li> The only thing that fixes my sebaceous hyperplasia! I have these painless but unattractive bumps, and my dermatologist zapped them with an electric needle--which left my face all spotty for days and barely reduced many of them. Others became pits. I have been using Retin-A for decades with no help. This serum takes times to work and doesn&#x27;t erase them all the way, all the time, but has greatly reduced them (I use it daily under makeup, because I use the RetinA at night). Even the wartier looking ones are gone or reduced to small bumps. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Amazing for sebaceous hyperplasia</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really remove the sebaceous spots. It merely flattens it.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed. It did nothing to help my sebaceous hyperplasia. I was hoping but should have known. Feeling disappointed and frustrated.</li>
            <li> for a reasonable price! but it&#x27;s still a bit pricey given the really small size. Well, since not gonna put it on the entire face but spot treatment as a last step of night skin care, I have not yet seen any result for just a few tried. Maybe review this again in next month!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Paula&#x27;s Choice RESIST BHA 9 very successfully on my combination skin (oily T-zone) to markedly diminish the patches of bumpy sebaceous hyperplasia (clogged sweat glands) on my forehead and the small patch of them on my nose. In a matter of only a few days, the hyperplasia on my nose completely vanished and those on my forehead shrank noticeably. As I continue to use BHA 9, the hyperplasia on my forehead steadily gets smaller and fainter. I use BHA 9 in conjunction with other RESIST exfoliants, which are very effective in \\&quot;resurfacing\\&quot; my skin, but progress in overcoming my sebaceous hyperplasia came speedily once I added BHA 9 to my facecare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The user (\\&quot;super reader\\&quot;) who complained that BHA 9 exacerbated her/his already oily skin appears not to have used the product according to directions. This heavy liquid isn&#x27;t intended for application all over the face; BHA 9 is designed to \\&quot;spot treat\\&quot; troubled areas only: it&#x27;s to be used sparingly on affected areas as the very last step in a nighttime skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the dissatisfied user pointed out, yes, the product is expensive; however, you need to use only a very small amount to get good results. A little goes a very long way. Also, we consumers need to keep in mind that more isn&#x27;t always better. Our skin is a living organ that, like any other of our body parts, can be overwhelmed by an onslaught of chemicals. We tend to want instant results in our society, but our bodies operate at their own (usually slower) pace. It&#x27;s often wise to embrace both paucity and patience in life, particularly when it comes to what we put on and in our body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula&#x27;s Choice products have made a huge difference in the health and appearance of my skin. I&#x27;ve been a devoted user for several years because the scope of products is broad, they&#x27;re of excellent quality, samples are available, the products work very well for me--and  I enjoy the many compliments I constantly get on my skin!</li>
            <li> What a waste of 40 dollars.  Did absolutely nothing for sebaceous hyperplasia.  I would give it no stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Since they refuse to post my review of this product on Paulaschoice.com I&#x27;ll do it here. I purchased this product directly from Paula&#x27;s Choice. This is a very heavy oily substance which made my oily skin 10X oilier. How such a greasy product can possibly remove blackheads I&#x27;ll never know; I returned this product because it was like waking up to an oil slick on my face. Also extremely expensive for the amount you get.</li>
