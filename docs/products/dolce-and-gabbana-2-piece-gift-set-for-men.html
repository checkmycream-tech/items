    <ol>
            <li>But the 3.4oz shipped from amazon is definately the best deal if you know you like it already.</li>
            <li>perfect for the fall and winter months</li>
            <li>but I paid $35 which make me very happy.  </li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift for the hubs and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>I feel like the best </li>
            <li>Great on time and perfect choice</li>
            <li>Ideal para salidas nocturnas.</li>
            <li>It also has excellent projection and good longevity.</li>
            <li>This cologne itself is great.</li>
            <li>Great smell &amp; price.</li>
            <li>It just--flat out--smell great.  </li>
            <li>Still the smell is great.</li>
            <li>A great gift idea for guys.</li>
            <li>great cologne</li>
            <li>Great scent-</li>
            <li>But for the durations it stays it is very nice.</li>
            <li>Also, the packaging is very nice for a gift.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product is probably very nice, but the return service policy sucks!&lt;br /&gt;Not very happy!</li>
            <li>The design and colour of the bottle is great and looks very good on the top of the dresser...</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an addition to your collection, I think this one is definitely good.</li>
            <li>Perfect for that special date night or a night out drinking scotch and smoking cigars with the guys.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and what you smell at the top is basically what you get all the way through.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne for my husband and we both love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend a warm fragrance like this for the Summer, because it&#x27;s a warm scent</li>
            <li>I liked this woodsy scent at the store and was going for a deeper winter </li>
            <li>This is clearly one of the best smelling designer colognes on the market.  </li>
            <li>and i can honestly say this one is fitting.</li>
            <li>Apparently this does not describe me lol as my girlfriend did not like this on me but said it was a good scent (just not for me).  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s perfect for Fall, Spring, and especially Winter.&lt;br /&gt;Dolce &amp;</li>
            <li>Definately a scent you&#x27;d find on a distinguished and again sophisticated man.</li>
            <li>and I love it....</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>But me personally, I love this scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok so this one always seems to go head to head with la nuit del homme in the fragrance community.</li>
            <li>The smell is definitely sexy and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>the fragrance better.</li>
            <li>i love the bottle and</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>it would be an easy choice to go for La Nuit Del Homme.</li>
            <li>not a fan of the strong scents but</li>
            <li>The super saver shipment was great and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is sophisticated and rather sweet.</li>
            <li>So if your the type of person who doesn&#x27;t like to feel like your gagging everyone about you with cologne and would like a nice sexy mature fragrance, this is for you.</li>
            <li>excellent masculine adult scent.</li>
            <li>this one won me over quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>I was given a full refund after the support agent had to talk to his manager.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s definately not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it has a great subtle scent and is just right.  </li>
            <li>not overpowering, just clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I will still keep the Hugo as my dedicated scent when seeing old friends, but this is nice to mix it up a bit when the times are right.</li>
            <li>Gabbana is quite a pricey brand, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>yet, somehow, the singular scent makes it worth a purchase anyway.</li>
            <li>D and G got it right on this one.</li>
            <li>Longevity is really pretty good (4-6 hours) but the sillage is pretty weak as it is mostly a skin scent after about an hour or two (reason for 1 star deduction).  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly as it did at Sephora when I tested it---aka not a knock off.  </li>
            <li>I got this, without sampling first, based on the demands on a girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like an overpowering scent and The One has an light but masculine scent that catches people attention.</li>
            <li>Also, after an hour or so it is pretty much a close skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just a little stonger than I remembered and more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; like my Dad might have worn.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfect date night cologne for a first date, or for meeting someone new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 1.6oz, because I only smelled this quickly in a store and wanted to try it in a more personal setting..</li>
            <li>It has a very manly and gentlemen like smell.</li>
            <li>The real is also all brown inside.</li>
            <li>The longevity and silage problem I found with this fragrance is based off a real bottle.</li>
            <li>Had been splashing it at duty free every month on my trips at the airport, finally ought it since wife loves it.</li>
            <li>The cologne is definitely called \\&quot;The One\\&quot; for a reason as it is really good date night/romantic scent for the mature and distinguished male.  </li>
            <li>The real one&#x27;s entire box is made better and this box is already starting to come apart after having it for a day.</li>
            <li>And the 1.6oz is a decent size bottle.</li>
            <li>The main problem is longevity and silage.</li>
            <li>so i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The sheer impossibility of comparing it to anything else makes it intriguing to just return to from time to time, to sniff and let your mind wander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only a guy for what it&#x27;s worth, but I can&#x27;t imagine any woman not liking this scent on a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whether you put on a few sparys or a tad more it has no effect.</li>
            <li>I love it too, just that it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Mine was sold and shipped by amazon.com as a new product</li>
            <li>This fragrance is a little bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>The fake also has a lot more alcohol in it and only slightly has the rich sweet smell the real has.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is something I wear for certain occasions, especially on a date</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a masculine scent and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The sprayer has a different color ring around it and the tube inside has 3 notches made in it on the real one.</li>
            <li>It is a bit sweet but also has some florals to mellow that down.</li>
            <li>For social occasions, \\&quot;day wear\\&quot; and the like, it will be largely useless and will be picked up by only the most finely attuned noses.</li>
            <li>Also, this all cannot be explained by possibly having an older bottle.</li>
            <li>Although the 1.6 ozs bottle is small, you only need to use a small amount as this product has a very good scent and it lingers on you for a long time.  </li>
            <li>A nice subtle, deep, woody, serious scent with a light after glow of airy, manly sporty freshness.  </li>
            <li>to put it simply, it&#x27;s sort of a fragrance for private indulgences or for those situations in which you know others are going to be intimately close to you</li>
            <li>It is very masculine, but sort of flat </li>
            <li>Spraying any scent directly onto clothing can not only spoil your clothing but can overpower the nostrils.</li>
            <li>The interior of the box on the one bought here is of cheap white paper, half as thick as the real.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The interior of the box on the one bought here is of cheap white paper, half as thick as the real.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I&#x27;ve found that I like as much, if not more than that.</li>
            <li> new scents have a little citrus or floral underneath </li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> the name dg just oozes elegance and classy</li>
            <li> The cologne has absolutely no smell.</li>
            <li> but it came with about a 3rd of the juice missing and the sprayer was already primed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very in your face</li>
            <li> And a little lasts so long, unlike women&#x27;s perfume-</li>
            <li> Only disappointment for myself was the size of the bottle clearly thinking it was bigger.</li>
            <li> It is very close to the skin and this is a common complaint with this cologne.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re game, and have around $50 that you don&#x27;t need, this will provide you at least a few intoxicating private moments over the course of your day.</li>
            <li> The product code on the bottom of the fake bottle put its in late September 2012 while the department store one was from early October 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li> When I tried to return this to Amazon, I was told that this was not able to be done because of government regulations regarding liquids, etc.  </li>
            <li> After going and getting one from the local department store, I believe the one I purchased here is fake.</li>
            <li> so I will usually buy him a bottle for our anniversary, or Christmas if he still has some.</li>
            <li> It is hard to review a fragrance as it changes once on a person&#x27;s skin as it did for my husband.  </li>
            <li> even though it is hard to write a review about cologne since it is so subjective</li>
            <li> you know what I mean....</li>
            <li> It is apparent either this is a totally bad brand or</li>
            <li> As other reviewers around the world have cautioned, the projection and duration of this fragrance is catastrophically bad...</li>
            <li> It is for the type of people who buy candles merely to watch them burn, rather than to set a dramatic mood.</li>
            <li> I am out $50.00 now and have a bottle of cologne which, in my opinion, is too expensive just to \\&quot;give away\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t you feel bad for his roommate Adam?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This fragrance is a little bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> Since discovering this scent in a magazine insert---- and having Matthew McConaughey endorsing it --- my DH wears it and LOVES it!</li>
            <li> I get compliments from this fragrance. I don&#x27;t recommend a warm fragrance like this for the Summer, because it&#x27;s a warm scent that&#x27;s perfect for Fall, Spring, and especially Winter.&lt;br /&gt;Dolce &amp; Gabbana is quite a pricey brand, but it&#x27;s worth it. This fragrance is something I wear for certain occasions, especially on a date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Hugo by Hugo Boss as my dedicated cologne for well over a decade. This is the only cologne I&#x27;ve found that I like as much, if not more than that. I will still keep the Hugo as my dedicated scent when seeing old friends, but this is nice to mix it up a bit when the times are right. The smell is sophisticated and rather sweet. Definately a scent you&#x27;d find on a distinguished and again sophisticated man. And it&#x27;s definately not a bad smell. I&#x27;m only a guy for what it&#x27;s worth, but I can&#x27;t imagine any woman not liking this scent on a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect date night cologne for a first date, or for meeting someone new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 1.6oz, because I only smelled this quickly in a store and wanted to try it in a more personal setting.. And the 1.6oz is a decent size bottle. But the 3.4oz shipped from amazon is definately the best deal if you know you like it already.</li>
            <li> D and G got it right on this one. This is my second bottle and I love it.... Thank you for the price also, makes me rethink buying anything else in store...</li>
            <li> As other reviewers around the world have cautioned, the projection and duration of this fragrance is catastrophically bad...yet, somehow, the singular scent makes it worth a purchase anyway. There&#x27;s a pervasive smoothness / creaminess to it during and after drydown, which is miles away from the overly eager fruity scents and dime-a-dozen musks that we are all probably used to. The sheer impossibility of comparing it to anything else makes it intriguing to just return to from time to time, to sniff and let your mind wander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So- to put it simply, it&#x27;s sort of a fragrance for private indulgences or for those situations in which you know others are going to be intimately close to you (and you want them to do so, of course.) For social occasions, \\&quot;day wear\\&quot; and the like, it will be largely useless and will be picked up by only the most finely attuned noses. It is for the type of people who buy candles merely to watch them burn, rather than to set a dramatic mood. So if you&#x27;re game, and have around $50 that you don&#x27;t need, this will provide you at least a few intoxicating private moments over the course of your day.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne. It has a very manly and gentlemen like smell. It lasts for a long time. Shipment came without a problem.</li>
            <li> not a fan of the strong scents but this one won me over quickly and easily.  perfect for the fall and winter months</li>
            <li> This cologne itself is great. Great smell &amp; price. Only disappointment for myself was the size of the bottle clearly thinking it was bigger. Still wouldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I purchased in the local store for $62 but I paid $35 which make me very happy.  I like the scent and it lasts, and lasts and lasts.  My last 1.6 oz bottle lasted over a year.</li>
            <li> This is clearly one of the best smelling designer colognes on the market.  It is a tad bit spicy and, yet, without any harshness.  It just--flat out--smell great.  It also has excellent projection and good longevity.</li>
            <li> The cologne is definitely called \\&quot;The One\\&quot; for a reason as it is really good date night/romantic scent for the mature and distinguished male.  Apparently this does not describe me lol as my girlfriend did not like this on me but said it was a good scent (just not for me).  But me personally, I love this scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its definitely got a woodsy tobacco vibe going for it that appears to be well-blended.  Longevity is really pretty good (4-6 hours) but the sillage is pretty weak as it is mostly a skin scent after about an hour or two (reason for 1 star deduction).  So if your the type of person who doesn&#x27;t like to feel like your gagging everyone about you with cologne and would like a nice sexy mature fragrance, this is for you.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> A nice subtle, deep, woody, serious scent with a light after glow of airy, manly sporty freshness.  What a Bently Continental GT Speed would wear, if it wore cologne.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a family member who already received the same product.  When I tried to return this to Amazon, I was told that this was not able to be done because of government regulations regarding liquids, etc.  I can understand this, but I should have been told in advance.  I am out $50.00 now and have a bottle of cologne which, in my opinion, is too expensive just to \\&quot;give away\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m sure the product is probably very nice, but the return service policy sucks!&lt;br /&gt;Not very happy!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for the hubs and it smells great!  Smells exactly as it did at Sephora when I tested it---aka not a knock off.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband and we both love it! It&#x27;s a masculine scent and not overpowering. Pro-Tip: Spray the cologne in front of you and walk through it. Spraying any scent directly onto clothing can not only spoil your clothing but can overpower the nostrils. You don&#x27;t want to be that guy on your freshman dorm hallway who smelled like patchouli 24/7. Didn&#x27;t you feel bad for his roommate Adam?</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my son because his local store ran out and did not know when they will be ordering again.  Although the 1.6 ozs bottle is small, you only need to use a small amount as this product has a very good scent and it lingers on you for a long time.  The design and colour of the bottle is great and looks very good on the top of the dresser...a plus for style and looks.  The super saver shipment was great and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is apparent either this is a totally bad brand or what I got was an immitation product. The cologne has absolutely no smell. Whether you put on a few sparys or a tad more it has no effect.</li>
            <li> excellent masculine adult scent. Perfect for that special date night or a night out drinking scotch and smoking cigars with the guys.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and what you smell at the top is basically what you get all the way through. It is a bit sweet but also has some florals to mellow that down. The main problem is longevity and silage. I can put this on and go to school and come back on my bike and even with an increased body temperature, I cannot smell this after 2-3 hours. Also, after an hour or so it is pretty much a close skin scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, watch out when you get your bottle. Mine was sold and shipped by amazon.com as a new product but it came with about a 3rd of the juice missing and the sprayer was already primed. I was given a full refund after the support agent had to talk to his manager. I now have doubts about buying colognes on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. After going and getting one from the local department store, I believe the one I purchased here is fake. The interior of the box on the one bought here is of cheap white paper, half as thick as the real. The real is also all brown inside. The real one&#x27;s entire box is made better and this box is already starting to come apart after having it for a day. The sprayer has a different color ring around it and the tube inside has 3 notches made in it on the real one. The fake also has a lot more alcohol in it and only slightly has the rich sweet smell the real has. Also, this all cannot be explained by possibly having an older bottle. The product code on the bottom of the fake bottle put its in late September 2012 while the department store one was from early October 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. The longevity and silage problem I found with this fragrance is based off a real bottle.</li>
            <li> Great on time and perfect choice</li>
            <li> Ok so this one always seems to go head to head with la nuit del homme in the fragrance community. I finally got this so I had both colognes. The smell is definitely sexy and sophisticated. It&#x27;s not very in your face but girls will definitely notice it if you get close. I don&#x27;t like the longevity or the projection. It is very close to the skin and this is a common complaint with this cologne. Still the smell is great. IF i had to choose between this and La Nuit Del Homme it would be an easy choice to go for La Nuit Del Homme. Comparable scents in terms of sexiness and sophistication but the latter destroys this one in terms of longevity and projection. If you are looking for an addition to your collection, I think this one is definitely good. If you are one of those guys who only has a bottle or two at a time, I&#x27;d suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I liked this woodsy scent at the store and was going for a deeper winter scent for my husband.  It is hard to review a fragrance as it changes once on a person&#x27;s skin as it did for my husband.  It&#x27;s not bad, just a little stonger than I remembered and more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; like my Dad might have worn.  It is very masculine, but sort of flat once it reacted with his skin.  I feel like the best new scents have a little citrus or floral underneath all that woodsy, muskiness or ingredients that linger longer and balance the fragrance better.</li>
            <li> Had been splashing it at duty free every month on my trips at the airport, finally ought it since wife loves it. I love it too, just that it doesn&#x27;t last long. But for the durations it stays it is very nice.</li>
            <li> I got this, without sampling first, based on the demands on a girlfriend.  Bingo, she went bonkers for it.  Honestly, it has a great subtle scent and is just right.  Also, the packaging is very nice for a gift.</li>
            <li> Excelente aroma... Ideal para salidas nocturnas. Quien lleva este perfume lleva la caballerosidad a donde quiera.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky when it comes to cologne and i can honestly say this one is fitting. I don&#x27;t like an overpowering scent and The One has an light but masculine scent that catches people attention. I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments so i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A great gift idea for guys.</li>
            <li> great cologne even though it is hard to write a review about cologne since it is so subjective i love the bottle and the name dg just oozes elegance and classy</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. This was what my husband was wearing the night we met so I will usually buy him a bottle for our anniversary, or Christmas if he still has some. Great scent- not overpowering, just clean and fresh smell. And a little lasts so long, unlike women&#x27;s perfume- and I know ladies you know what I mean....&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
