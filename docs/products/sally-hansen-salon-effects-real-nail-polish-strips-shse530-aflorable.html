            <li>Great product, super easy to use, lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li>now...let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments and love looking at my toes.</li>
            <li>I love about Sally Hansen</li>
            <li>top coat.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I love these strips.  </li>
            <li>the product arrived quickly, package perfectly however the product seem to be old, they did not want to stick to my fingernails..</li>
            <li>Easy to apply love it.</li>
            <li>Since my work doesn&#x27;t allow nail polish, I&#x27;m always making sure my toes look fabulous.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give four stars instead of five is that removing the strips does seem to take a bit more effort than removing normal nail polish, but nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li>Then smooth out again before using another nail to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Not one that requires the UV light.</li>
            <li>ive had a few nail strips that go on perfectly</li>
            <li>nail polish remover lightly rubbed on the inside of the strip...works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>I always add a very strong clear top coat as well.  </li>
            <li>Clean nails</li>
            <li>With a good topcoat, your pedi can last up to a month.</li>
            <li>Hansen makes good nail polish strips that last when combined with my nail strengthening regimen.</li>
            <li>ive read some negatives, but most of the problems that people are having can be fixed and easily.  </li>
            <li>Go on easy, just put a coat of clear nail polish on top.  </li>
            <li>I really like these and find them to be easy to apply, although I don&#x27;t follow the directions.</li>
            <li>Be sure your nails are clear of any oils, debris, spit, etc.  </li>
            <li>Obviously you must have clean nails, but I have also put them on top of a coordinating color polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing these ones (aflorable) right now.</li>
            <li>If you get really good, you can even get three manicures out of it, but nail strips needs to be kept in an air tight container.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply and last quite a while.</li>
            <li>My first Sally Hansen Nail Polish Strips and</li>
            <li>The colors and patterns are pretty, but the process is onerous.</li>
            <li>Leaving the protective coating on lets the strip be a little less floppy and that might help first time users position more successfully.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>When you figure how long they last and the cost, the Jamberrys are a much better bargain and product!</li>
            <li>With this pattern the minimal chipping blends right in &amp; they are still quite clean looking.</li>
            <li>None of the nail strips fit my slender fingers, and by the time I cut them down to the right size they had shredded and torn.  </li>
            <li>The box arrived completely smashed and the strips themselves don&#x27;t stay adhered to the nail, despite following the directions precisely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of salon effects and this design is very pretty</li>
            <li>Since toes are significantly smaller than hand nails, I am able to cut the bigger one into 2 and use those for my smaller toes (pinkies and &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; toe).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them on for 6 days &amp; they look like they&#x27;re just a day old!</li>
            <li>So far, I have gotten 10 days wear each time I have used them.</li>
            <li>ive had NO issues thus far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to simply paint my nails!  </li>
            <li>(they are starting to look pretty ragged at the end of the 10 day period) but on my toes they last about a month.  </li>
            <li>Pattern is hard to read and these tore easy when applying</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different nail wraps and these were my least favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in the camp with customers who think these nail strips are worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li>I tore the first one in half just peeling the cover off.  </li>
            <li>There is no way these will last near as long as Jamberrys.  </li>
            <li>I could not see the green leaves in the picture, I thought it was just a pretty red and whitish pattern.  </li>
            <li>No dry time last for days !!</li>
            <li>Usually, with nail strips, once the special package is unsealed, you have a limited lifespan (only a day MAX) before you have to chuck them out.</li>

            <li> If you have had trouble with these before, maybe this way might work for you.</li>
            <li> The only damage I have seen is when I have broken a nail or done something to damage the nail itself, otherwise no damage at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally addicted.</li>

            <li> My first Sally Hansen Nail Polish Strips and now...let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Lighter colors than expected</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price and look lovely!</li>
            <li> they chip and come of within a day or two!!! Jamberry or bust!</li>
            <li> Great product, super easy to use, lives up to its claims. I&#x27;m totally addicted.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jamberry nail wraps for several months now. They are great! So, I decided to try these.  There is no comparison!  I tore the first one in half just peeling the cover off.  The second one ripped when I was pressing it down on my nail.  I threw them in the trash!! There is no way these will last near as long as Jamberrys.  When you figure how long they last and the cost, the Jamberrys are a much better bargain and product!</li>
            <li> Love love love! Got lots of compliments also!</li>
            <li> Love these! Super easy to apply and last quite a while. Plus it&#x27;s so convenient to not have to wait for your nails to dry after applying.</li>
            <li> I really like these and find them to be easy to apply, although I don&#x27;t follow the directions. So here are my directions. If you have had trouble with these before, maybe this way might work for you. Obviously you must have clean nails, but I have also put them on top of a coordinating color polish. I peel the strip AND the protective coating from the backing paper. Leaving the protective coating on lets the strip be a little less floppy and that might help first time users position more successfully. Once in place, I press down and push the edges of the strip into place all over my nail before peeling off the protective layer. Then smooth out again before using another nail to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; the end. I don&#x27;t usually file the edge either unless there is some obvious excess. So far, I have gotten 10 days wear each time I have used them. The only damage I have seen is when I have broken a nail or done something to damage the nail itself, otherwise no damage at all. The only reason I give four stars instead of five is that removing the strips does seem to take a bit more effort than removing normal nail polish, but nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li> Since my work doesn&#x27;t allow nail polish, I&#x27;m always making sure my toes look fabulous. I get lots of compliments and love looking at my toes. Perfect for sandal weather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about Sally Hansen is that you get 16 individual strips. Usually, with nail strips, once the special package is unsealed, you have a limited lifespan (only a day MAX) before you have to chuck them out. What they do with this brand is split the 16 into 2 packs of eight. Since toes are significantly smaller than hand nails, I am able to cut the bigger one into 2 and use those for my smaller toes (pinkies and &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; toe). After that each strip is given to a toe nail. With a good topcoat, your pedi can last up to a month. Trust me. I&#x27;ve done it. Granted I have a few chips on my big toe nail due to my work shoes, but they&#x27;re very minimal. One thing I advise, is getting a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; top coat. Not one that requires the UV light. I bought mine at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Salon. Use that as a both a base coat and a top coat.</li>
            <li> this was a great gift for my friend at a great price. she seems happy with them and says they applied great!</li>
            <li> I love these nail strips and this design looks so good and so attractive.  Be sure your nails are clear of any oils, debris, spit, etc.  Clean nails well with alcohol or acetone and then apply.  If you get really good, you can even get three manicures out of it, but nail strips needs to be kept in an air tight container.</li>
            <li> They come in the cutest designs and I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments while wearing them, however they don&#x27;t last very long and can be quite a pain to apply. They start chipping about two days after application and you can&#x27;t reuse your leftovers.</li>
            <li> I love these.  ive read some negatives, but most of the problems that people are having can be fixed and easily.  ive had a few nail strips that go on perfectly and then ive had a set that had lost its sticky.  well, its a nail polish strip...whats the obvious solution to fixing that? nail polish remover lightly rubbed on the inside of the strip...works like a charm.  rub enough on so you notice its sticky (once again) then apply to your nail like you would have from the start. I always add a very strong clear top coat as well.  ive had NO issues thus far and I wear them for weeks at a time.  lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I could not see the green leaves in the picture, I thought it was just a pretty red and whitish pattern.  Still, it&#x27;ll look cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen makes good nail polish strips that last when combined with my nail strengthening regimen.</li>
            <li> the product arrived quickly, package perfectly however the product seem to be old, they did not want to stick to my fingernails.. they peeled up within an hour of putting them on I had to remove them... the product claims to stay on for 7 to 10 days that was not the case with this product.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work well at all. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different nail wraps and these were my least favorite.</li>
            <li> Pattern is hard to read and these tore easy when applying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of salon effects and this design is very pretty</li>
            <li> The box arrived completely smashed and the strips themselves don&#x27;t stay adhered to the nail, despite following the directions precisely.</li>
            <li> I love these!!! So easy to use. No dry time last for days !! No chipping. Easy to apply love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing these ones (aflorable) right now. I&#x27;ve had them on for 6 days &amp; they look like they&#x27;re just a day old! With this pattern the minimal chipping blends right in &amp; they are still quite clean looking. Great product &amp; you can&#x27;t beat amazons prices!</li>
            <li> Go on easy, just put a coat of clear nail polish on top.  They last 2 weeks +</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in the camp with customers who think these nail strips are worth the trouble.  The application process took about an hour from start to finish, and while the strips do last longer than a regular manicure, they&#x27;re not worth the trouble.  It&#x27;s so much easier to simply paint my nails!  If you like tedious work, you may find the application process is worth it, but next time I will paint my nails or visit a salon.  None of the nail strips fit my slender fingers, and by the time I cut them down to the right size they had shredded and torn.  The colors and patterns are pretty, but the process is onerous.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in some Easter Baskets that I made for my grown granddaughters.  I made them a nail salon basket, with every thing they need to do there nail, even with lots of decorations.  They loved them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used things like this before, and this wasn&#x27;t great. They didn&#x27;t stay on my nails unlike others I&#x27;ve gotten for 5 dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love these strips.  They last on my fingers about two weeks (they are starting to look pretty ragged at the end of the 10 day period) but on my toes they last about a month.  Yes - I use these on my toes as well.</li>
