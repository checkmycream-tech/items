            <li> The head is about as long as the diameter of a dime.</li>
            <li> If you use a sturdier/thicker style wax I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying these as they would probably snap, they are only 1/16 inch thick.</li>
            <li> , I just wish it was a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> You do get quite a few.</li>
            <li> They arrived in a small ziploc bag with no branding labels.</li>
            <li> Would work well for eyebrows or small areas...</li>
