            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this forever. This is my summer perfume and I absolutely love it. It bit pricey seeing is how they don&#x27;t carry it in stores anymore.</li>

            <li> Man I love this stuff!! Ive been wearing it for almost 15 years and will not wear anything else!!! great price too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased on and off since 2003, I don&#x27;t wear it every day but it&#x27;s the only perfume that&#x27;s I&#x27;ve consistently worn for that long without getting sick of it! It&#x27;s bright and almost peppery, not sweet, hard to describe. I get lots of compliments on it, I feel like it&#x27;s almost a unizex scent. Will continue to buy over and over again!</li>

            <li> This smells amazing and is long lasting.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves the smell of oranges with a hint of vanilla.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and I always get compliments when I wear it.  A+++++++++!!!!</li>
