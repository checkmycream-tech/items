            <li>This is a good product and one that i can rely on doing the job.  </li>
            <li>It feels so good after use.  </li>
            <li>I am Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Glad carried by Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Very nice items, fast shipping, great transaction.</li>
            <li>The floss used to be very strong.</li>
            <li>The floss strands break very easily.</li>
            <li>Got a sample of Thornton Floss from the Dentist and was told that this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>And, it truly is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>My dentist is pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love this floss.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the rubber grips.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t afind it in the stores but it is the only thing that is perfect for in between teeth.</li>
            <li>My gums are in much better shape using these.</li>
            <li>They used to make a much better product.</li>
            <li>This floss is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I put my subject line in caps because I want to shout to the world that this is an excellent product!  </li>
            <li>A fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The stiffened end of the floss is perfect for threading between teeth on a multiple tooth fixed bridge.</li>
            <li>I could clean all of my teeth and the strands would stay together and not break.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the time and money.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to their use as floss; however, they have been just right for placing beads onto my most recent lace shawl kitting project.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for because CVS doesn&#x27;t carry perio floss anymore.  </li>
            <li>would prefer the exact thing my dentist uses</li>
            <li>Much easyer to floss with!</li>
            <li>Bought 3 for my whole family.</li>
            <li>It was also much stiffer than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>Now there are fewer pieces of floss in the box (50 versus 75) and they are  very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Really cleans.</li>
            <li>I like these much more than the thinner ones you find in the stores by other manufacturers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I use this large floss around my bridgework where there are spaces large enough to accommodate it.  </li>
            <li>It really works the gums under the bridge while cleaning like no other flosser I have used.</li>
            <li>CVS discontinued and replaced with their own brand, which is not nearly as good.</li>
            <li>Now you have to spend way too much time trying to get it inserted but it bends because it is not stiff enough.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find in my research that it could be purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li>For people that have heavy tartar build-up this type of floss works much better then regular floss.</li>
            <li>hard to get in between some of my teeth (tight space), but good quality</li>
            <li>It has its own threader, a fuller section for bridge work and a thin section for regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>No matter if we follow the &amp;#34;opening instructions&amp;#34; we generally end up with a tangled box of floss.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they would figure out a better way to package them, as sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get one out without a bunch of other ones starting to come out.  </li>
            <li>I have been using very effective Thornton Periodontal floss of some time now and have been disappointed that local pharmacies no longer carry this product.</li>

            <li> ; (not the stiff threading portion) is much too long</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are great if you need them, but paying $15 is a rip-off, and not very Amazon-like.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be far too thick and less you have severe periodontal disease with very open embrasures.</li>
            <li> I agree it is getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> This question was posed in other reviews, and here is the answer.  </li>
            <li> I then use regular flossy floss in the smaller spaces, and thin floss where required.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well and was recommended by my dental hygienist!  </li>
            <li> is now thinner and less rigid than it used to be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s not available.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is too thick for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I brush twice aday and try to floss at least once a day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive , but it does the bst job of cleaning between teeth and under bridges or implants.  </li>
            <li> Floss works well, somewhat expensive</li>

            <li> Very nice items, fast shipping, great transaction. Thanks!</li>
            <li> hard to get in between some of my teeth (tight space), but good quality</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is getting harder and harder to find.  Glad carried by Amazon!  Ideal for bridgework!  I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of Thornton Floss from the Dentist and was told that this is one of the better ones. And, it truly is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> This floss is so easy to use.  It has its own threader, a fuller section for bridge work and a thin section for regular flossing.  I like to dip this floss in mouthwash for extra cleaning around the gums under the bridge.  My dentist is pleased with the results.  I agree it is getting harder to find.  CVS discontinued and replaced with their own brand, which is not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> Love this floss.  Great product, price and service</li>
            <li> This product is worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to their use as floss; however, they have been just right for placing beads onto my most recent lace shawl kitting project.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great for under bridge work.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who is in a nursing/rehab home and he loves this.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> I would have given this a higher rating for the product serving its intended purpose, IF there had not been excessive materials. The &amp;#34;other end&amp;#34; (not the stiff threading portion) is much too long and I had to cut @ six inches off each piece in order to use it.</li>
            <li> I use this large floss around my bridgework where there are spaces large enough to accommodate it.  I then use regular flossy floss in the smaller spaces, and thin floss where required.</li>
            <li> No matter if we follow the &amp;#34;opening instructions&amp;#34; we generally end up with a tangled box of floss.  BUT they work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now.  It&#x27;s expensive , but it does the bst job of cleaning between teeth and under bridges or implants.  The payoff is when you go for a dental checkup and the dentist reviews your Xrays and says, &amp;#34;se you in six months. Keep up the good work.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a year.  It seems that they&#x27;ve changed to a cheaper version where the plastic lead that you need to push between/under/around the teeth, bridges, caps etc.  is now thinner and less rigid than it used to be.  Now you have to spend way too much time trying to get it inserted but it bends because it is not stiff enough.  It didn&#x27;t used to be like this so some change in quality seems to be instituted.  I&#x27;ll not be buying it anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and one that i can rely on doing the job.  I am Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for because CVS doesn&#x27;t carry perio floss anymore.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Floss works well, somewhat expensive</li>
            <li> The very best tongue cleaner on the market.  Love the rubber grips.  Bought 3 for my whole family.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t afind it in the stores but it is the only thing that is perfect for in between teeth.</li>
            <li> This is too thick for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer the exact thing my dentist uses but I guess that&#x27;s not available.</li>
            <li> I put my subject line in caps because I want to shout to the world that this is an excellent product!  I have several spots between teeth where regular floss did not get it all out.  This stuff does.</li>
            <li> I found this to be far too thick and less you have severe periodontal disease with very open embrasures. It was also much stiffer than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay $15 for a $5 product.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are great if you need them, but paying $15 is a rip-off, and not very Amazon-like.  I thought you get 3 boxes for $15, but nope, you get one, and you get ripped off.  So beware.  This question was posed in other reviews, and here is the answer.  Go to Dental Depot and get these for $5 a box, a very good deal.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product. The stiffened end of the floss is perfect for threading between teeth on a multiple tooth fixed bridge.</li>
            <li> I have been using very effective Thornton Periodontal floss of some time now and have been disappointed that local pharmacies no longer carry this product. I was pleasantly surprised to find in my research that it could be purchased through Amazon. Great news for me!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Hard to find.</li>
            <li> Excellent floss.  It feels so good after use.  Only problem was the tip that you use appears to collapse after 1-2 times used.  Basically it is a really good product!</li>
            <li> I like these much more than the thinner ones you find in the stores by other manufacturers.  I just wish they would figure out a better way to package them, as sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get one out without a bunch of other ones starting to come out.  My gums are in much better shape using these.</li>
            <li> Product works well.  Found out about this type of floss from my dental technician.  For people that have heavy tartar build-up this type of floss works much better then regular floss.</li>
            <li> The floss used to be very strong. I could clean all of my teeth and the strands would stay together and not break. Now there are fewer pieces of floss in the box (50 versus 75) and they are  very flimsy. The floss strands break very easily. They used to make a much better product.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well and was recommended by my dental hygienist!  I can already feel an improvement in my gums &amp; have already orded two additional Thorntons Peril Floss.</li>
            <li> Really cleans. No gum irritation.</li>
            <li> I like it because u can pull it through your teeth! Much easyer to floss with! I brush twice aday and try to floss at least once a day!</li>
            <li> Great for problem places</li>
            <li> This is the one for bridges.  It really works the gums under the bridge while cleaning like no other flosser I have used.</li>
            <li> The best floss for getting under bridges</li>
