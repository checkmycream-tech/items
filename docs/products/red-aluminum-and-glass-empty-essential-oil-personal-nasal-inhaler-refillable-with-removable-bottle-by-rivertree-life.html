            <li> I say seems only because I have not had the inhailer long.</li>
            <li> But just put a little essential oil in there.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these to put essential oil in so that I could carry it around in my purse when I need a little pick me up.</li>
            <li> The seals are tight and the bottles are portable.</li>
            <li> Stick a little peppermint oil in, stick in a wick and inhale for headaches!</li>
            <li> I purchased this inhailer because I hated the tampon look of the plastic inhailers.</li>

            <li> Great product for using my essential oils. I recommend this product and this provider. Wonderful customer service and quality products.</li>
            <li> Love this product. No mess, no leaks!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the product. I had to return it. but the efficiency for the return and credit back to my account was great. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Love it!! So convenient. But just put a little essential oil in there. Just enough for the wick to fill up. Live and learn here! LOL!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and carry with you. I like these.</li>
            <li> Great quality, nice to carry in purse or pocket, will buy again!</li>
            <li> gave the personal inhaler as a gift.</li>
            <li> I purchased this inhailer because I hated the tampon look of the plastic inhailers. It has a glass insert that fits well into the outer piece .&lt;br /&gt;This inhailer is easy to put together and take apart to put your favorite essential oils in the cotton filter that is provided. It seems to be a quality product... I say seems only because I have not had the inhailer long.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> So useful! I purchased one of these to put essential oil in so that I could carry it around in my purse when I need a little pick me up. I poured in my oils and then let the wick soak them up before screwing it all together. So far no leaks and the top stays on securely. I also like that the finish looks metallic so it looks more like a lipstick tube in my purse. I only wish there was a variety pack of colors available for different oils.</li>
            <li> These are a great tool for using essential oils.  The seals are tight and the bottles are portable.</li>

            <li> Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to fill and convenient to carry with me wherever I go! Just soak the cotton and you will have leak free essential oils wherever you go!</li>
            <li> These are great and easy to clean.  Stick a little peppermint oil in, stick in a wick and inhale for headaches!</li>
            <li> It I&#x27;d just perfect. Size and the case is just like a lip stick case. It is amazing. I just ordered two more colors. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this!  Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought so many of the plastic ones! Waiting for a sale to buy a lot more!&lt;br /&gt;Great gift to give to friends!</li>
            <li> good. lid tends to pop off...</li>
            <li> works great. Seems like good quality</li>
            <li> LOVE this inhaler! Looks so stylish, and I like that it&#x27;s glass and not plastic :D</li>
            <li> A really nice-looking inhaler. Super easy to fill and works great.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a glass vile inside that holds the cotton. Semi difficult to remove/replace old oil but overall, sophisticated oil inhaler!</li>
