            <li>The Fantastic Four is a great product it comes with all the essentials for a gel manicure and</li>
            <li>nice price&lt;br</li>
            <li>This set has all the polishes she needs to do her own at home gel manicures and pedicures.</li>
            <li>I started doing my own nails using the Gelish starter kit that comes with these products but in the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; size .</li>
            <li>Nice starter pack.</li>
            <li>Super happy with these.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>Love this kit for doing gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>Was just looking for the Foundation and Top Coat, but couldn&#x27;t beat the price for all four products.  </li>
            <li>What is not included though is the cleaner that is needed once you have finished setting the top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love</li>
            <li>Such a good deal!!!</li>
            <li>i wish they made a pack with 2 foundations, 1 top coat, and 1 pH balancer.</li>
            <li>You could probably get away with just the Foundation and Top it</li>
            <li>I can get the instructions but having them with the product would be more convenient .</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I made this investment and can do this myself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this set, it has everything you need and does the job.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I love it ...</li>
            <li>Love the Gelish polish.  </li>
            <li>$200 up front for a good LCD nail dryer, this Fantastic Four kit, and about six full size colored polishes.  </li>
            <li>Nice full size set.</li>
            <li>These arrived quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Did my nails last week the came out great for me using Gel polish on my own.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice set to go with any gel polish colors, the shipping was also very fast!</li>
            <li>I love the size of this four, they are fantastic, it came way before I expect it, my sister loves shellac</li>
            <li>FULL SIZES!</li>
            <li>Compared to other online sellers they had the best price.</li>
            <li>I originally tried to do a manicure with just gel polish and top coat-bad idea.</li>
            <li>Appreciate that these were all full size bottles!  </li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and haven&#x27;t had any problems with air bubbles or peeling.  </li>
            <li>super cheap, regular size (not mini) and great quality!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product..thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>That was fine with me</li>
            <li>but I just use strong alcohol and lint free wipes (91% rubbing alcohol)</li>
            <li>This product arrived fairly quick!</li>
            <li>I use with UV light - but will buy LED when UV stops working...</li>
            <li>Works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It works great if you use them all properly!</li>
            <li>When I had the SH top coat on my nails, I built two 6 x 4 garden beds and planted plants and all that fun stuff</li>
            <li>The pH bond &amp; cuticle nourishment are great but you can just use alcohol instead of the pH bond and you could probably find some type of cuticle nourishment at your local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was free, took about a week to receive.</li>
            <li>Everything is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great product, I use it will all different brands and so fart</li>
            <li>My mom got me a gel light for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Purchased this and with this kit, the light,  and gel polish my manicure is just as long-lasting as the salon gel manicure.</li>
            <li>BTW - if you decide to do it yourself, there are many videos online about how to do this right.  </li>
            <li>Check when you order any Gelish products to make sure you are comparing the right size before ordering .</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Did not arrive in original packaging.</li>
            <li>Also purchase rubbing alcohol to clean off nail before and after curing and acetone remover to remove.</li>
            <li>I had some issues with gel polish peeling, and I fixed them with this set and capping the edge better!</li>
            <li>Gelish is my exclusive brand of gel that I use and this kit is FULL SIZE, Not mini.</li>
            <li>It comes with full size bottles.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Gelish Fantastic 4 kit well over a year ago</li>
            <li>I will continue to by this product, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>and they are kind enough to always gift me a bottle of gelish polish in return.</li>
            <li>I will get my money back within 2 months of not going to the salon; then my nail jobs are free except for buying more product hear and there.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>is just right</li>
            <li>It peeled right off.</li>
            <li>A great kit, especially for one such as myself who was just starting out doing my own gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>Shipping to europe was very fast, got it in a week.</li>
            <li>I definitely would pay more if she were to purchase separately at a store.</li>
            <li>I first tried it with a manicure before my cruise.</li>
            <li>They were exactly as listed</li>
            <li>When I run out I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Do not come boxed, but fantastic none the less :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty positive that I&#x27;m doing everything correctly</li>
            <li>Just the foundation and top it off cost $30 while they give you the whole set for the same price!</li>
            <li>I used an LED light as opposed to a UV, as I found that UV bothers my hands (made them feel sunburned all of the time) and have found that gelish products work equally well with both.</li>
            <li>Lasts abt 4 days than the whole Polish peels off my nail.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for DIY gel nails!</li>
            <li>and it works really well too.</li>
            <li>So maybe this is the reason why, it just doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>It is very shiny.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m ready to invite my daughters and granddaughters to let me do their nails, too.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It is what I asked for though, so I cant really complain.</li>
            <li>I find I only needed foundation and top coat in future, don&#x27;t need all four in this pack.</li>
            <li>These are so much bigger and such a better value.</li>
            <li>but I feel as if the top coat doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I used my Dremel and a fine grit sanding wheel and sanded my nails down a couple of layers (like my salon does) and reapplied all the steps</li>
            <li>I like that these are full sized bottles, I have bought gelish from beauty stores before but this much cheaper than going to a store that sells professional products and buying them all separate (especially because I can only get the mini sized ones in a store.)</li>
            <li>When used properly, it works very well!  </li>
            <li>My first set last me 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Sally Hansen base &amp; top coat because I was too impatient to wait for this gelish polish to arrive in the mail, &amp; I honestly think the Sally Hansen polish worked better.</li>
            <li>While I am not as familiar with the products as the nail technicians I typically go to</li>
            <li>I am a professional.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve done my moms, friend, and my nails with no chip or peel for over a week.</li>
            <li>I like this brand so far and will continue testing it out.</li>
            <li>(bought this one just for when the first one runs cause price was super not that I&#x27;m anywhere near half empty)</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I didn&#x27;t realize I needed it, and my still-tacky nails didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>Although it is very durable the removal process is not a pain as i have found with many other gel base and top.</li>
            <li>The only thing that surprised us was that the box was not included.</li>
            <li>After twenty years of going to salons to get acrylics, I recently began having them overlay gel polish on my natural nail.  </li>
            <li>SO much cheaper than other sellers</li>
            <li>It is durable and helps your gel manicure to last for a long time, or until you remove it and do a new manicure.</li>
            <li>I have managed to make my manicures last much longer than with regular nail polish or even other &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Arrived just as shown in the picture, brand new, came in the mail sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>so everything was ready to go and it was less of a chore to do at home .</li>

            <li> I bought my first Gelish Fantastic 4 kit well over a year ago</li>
            <li> I will continue to by this product, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> and they are kind enough to always gift me a bottle of gelish polish in return.</li>
            <li> I will get my money back within 2 months of not going to the salon; then my nail jobs are free except for buying more product hear and there.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> is just right</li>
            <li> It peeled right off.</li>
            <li> A great kit, especially for one such as myself who was just starting out doing my own gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Shipping to europe was very fast, got it in a week.</li>
            <li> I definitely would pay more if she were to purchase separately at a store.</li>
            <li> I first tried it with a manicure before my cruise.</li>
            <li> They were exactly as listed</li>
            <li> When I run out I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Do not come boxed, but fantastic none the less :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive that I&#x27;m doing everything correctly</li>
            <li> Just the foundation and top it off cost $30 while they give you the whole set for the same price!</li>
            <li> I used an LED light as opposed to a UV, as I found that UV bothers my hands (made them feel sunburned all of the time) and have found that gelish products work equally well with both.</li>
            <li> Lasts abt 4 days than the whole Polish peels off my nail.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for DIY gel nails!</li>
            <li> and it works really well too.</li>
            <li> So maybe this is the reason why, it just doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> It is very shiny.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m ready to invite my daughters and granddaughters to let me do their nails, too.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It is what I asked for though, so I cant really complain.</li>
            <li> I find I only needed foundation and top coat in future, don&#x27;t need all four in this pack.</li>
            <li> These are so much bigger and such a better value.</li>
            <li> but I feel as if the top coat doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I used my Dremel and a fine grit sanding wheel and sanded my nails down a couple of layers (like my salon does) and reapplied all the steps</li>
            <li> I like that these are full sized bottles, I have bought gelish from beauty stores before but this much cheaper than going to a store that sells professional products and buying them all separate (especially because I can only get the mini sized ones in a store.)</li>
            <li> When used properly, it works very well!  </li>
            <li> My first set last me 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Sally Hansen base &amp; top coat because I was too impatient to wait for this gelish polish to arrive in the mail, &amp; I honestly think the Sally Hansen polish worked better.</li>
            <li> While I am not as familiar with the products as the nail technicians I typically go to</li>
            <li> I am a professional.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve done my moms, friend, and my nails with no chip or peel for over a week.</li>
            <li> I like this brand so far and will continue testing it out.</li>
            <li> (bought this one just for when the first one runs cause price was super not that I&#x27;m anywhere near half empty)</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I didn&#x27;t realize I needed it, and my still-tacky nails didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> Although it is very durable the removal process is not a pain as i have found with many other gel base and top.</li>
            <li> The only thing that surprised us was that the box was not included.</li>
            <li> After twenty years of going to salons to get acrylics, I recently began having them overlay gel polish on my natural nail.  </li>
            <li> SO much cheaper than other sellers</li>
            <li> It is durable and helps your gel manicure to last for a long time, or until you remove it and do a new manicure.</li>
            <li> I have managed to make my manicures last much longer than with regular nail polish or even other &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Arrived just as shown in the picture, brand new, came in the mail sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> so everything was ready to go and it was less of a chore to do at home .</li>
            <li> I thought it was funny how they were using OPI base &amp; top coat because all their polishes were gelish.</li>
            <li> The gel isn&#x27;t lasting as long as others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Applied two layers of the base coat and it wasn&#x27;t quite strong enough for my super thin nails so after the third coat it felt pretty sturdy for my liking.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of product in the bottles so far im not even half way</li>
            <li> /&gt;like to use it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;color</li>
            <li> These were even larger than I had expected!  </li>
            <li> and I did not get one single chip in my nail polish.</li>
            <li> I put everything in a bin including an old placemat to protect my table, an extension cord and small lamp</li>
            <li> I have had only one chip in the past two months from the one to two week manicures i do.</li>
            <li> This too is very time consuming and expensive.  </li>
            <li> and they used OPI base &amp; top coat</li>
            <li> I had the process down to about 45 minutes .</li>
            <li> I redid them this way 4 times over a few months time.</li>
            <li> so ill try that the next time around and update my review.</li>
            <li> I usually let set under UV lamp for 3 minutes instead of two.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to be a bit difficult to soak off compared to using gelaze gel which has the base coat built in, but that could be because i&#x27;ve only been doing gels for a year.</li>
            <li> Realizing how expensive it is to get gels at the salon and the $5 fee they throw on to take it off</li>
            <li> Disappointed and dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> But I was disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this kit. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love these! I use them every week for my manicures. Instead of paying every week thirty dollars to have someone to do it now i can do it myself.</li>
            <li> Great kit!  I bought my first Gelish Fantastic 4 kit well over a year ago (bought this one just for when the first one runs cause price was super not that I&#x27;m anywhere near half empty) I do my nails once or twice a month - Gelish is great - easy to use (if you can polish your nails...) I use with UV light - but will buy LED when UV stops working...</li>
            <li> Love this kit for doing gel nails at home. Good value</li>
            <li> Was just looking for the Foundation and Top Coat, but couldn&#x27;t beat the price for all four products.  Got here quickly.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product..thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set to go with any gel polish colors, the shipping was also very fast! I had some issues with gel polish peeling, and I fixed them with this set and capping the edge better! It does seem to be a bit difficult to soak off compared to using gelaze gel which has the base coat built in, but that could be because i&#x27;ve only been doing gels for a year. It is durable and helps your gel manicure to last for a long time, or until you remove it and do a new manicure.</li>
            <li> A great kit, especially for one such as myself who was just starting out doing my own gel nail polish. There are instructions on the back of the box which help out, and the bottles actually contain quite a bit of product. What is not included though is the cleaner that is needed once you have finished setting the top coat. The first time I used this I didn&#x27;t realize I needed it, and my still-tacky nails didn&#x27;t last long at all. After I purchased the cleaner, the final step (just wipe on after finishing each nail) my nails set beautifully. BTW..I used an LED light as opposed to a UV, as I found that UV bothers my hands (made them feel sunburned all of the time) and have found that gelish products work equally well with both.</li>
            <li> good product,nice price&lt;br /&gt;good product,nice price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like to use it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;color is just right&lt;br /&gt;i love gelish&lt;br /&gt;happy buyer</li>
            <li> FULL SIZES! Such a good deal!!! Arrived just as shown in the picture, brand new, came in the mail sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I like that these are full sized bottles, I have bought gelish from beauty stores before but this much cheaper than going to a store that sells professional products and buying them all separate (especially because I can only get the mini sized ones in a store.) I bought this to replace my used up mini kit. The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t come with that the mini kit had is cleanser but I just use strong alcohol and lint free wipes (91% rubbing alcohol)</li>
            <li> convenient 4 pack, great price.  i wish they made a pack with 2 foundations, 1 top coat, and 1 pH balancer.</li>
            <li> Disappointed and dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> This pack is GREAT! SO much cheaper than other sellers and they work FLAWLESSLY! I love my gel polish! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Applied two layers of the base coat and it wasn&#x27;t quite strong enough for my super thin nails so after the third coat it felt pretty sturdy for my liking. Super happy with these.</li>
            <li> Great price. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Not so impressed. The gel isn&#x27;t lasting as long as others I&#x27;ve tried. I have yet to use pH bond so ill try that the next time around and update my review. Lasts abt 4 days than the whole Polish peels off my nail. Product arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for DIY gel nails! You could probably get away with just the Foundation and Top it Off but I use all of them. I&#x27;d also recommend this tutorial which helped me a lot: http://www.luluandsweetpea.com/2013/01/diy-gel-nails-at-home.html Mine came with the box flattened out and the bottles wrapped separately in bubble wrap. That was fine with me but if you wanted to give it as a gift or something it might look kinda smushed.</li>
            <li> Been using this product since it&#x27;s birth.  Great product.  Just as good as Shellac and A LOT cheaper!!  When used properly, it works very well!  I am a professional.</li>
            <li> Items received not as described as the picture. Received them without the package. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic.  Easy to use and haven&#x27;t had any problems with air bubbles or peeling.  Last about two weeks, sometimes longer.  I usually let set under UV lamp for 3 minutes instead of two.  Last about two weeks, sometimes longer.</li>
            <li> These were even larger than I had expected!  I have been buying these at a beauty supply place but won&#x27;t do that again!</li>
            <li> O&#x27;m so impressed with this package! super cheap, regular size (not mini) and great quality! I&#x27;ll be buying from this seller again, no doubt.</li>
            <li> Nice full size set. It works great if you use them all properly! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a shellac hack from home!</li>
            <li> Just as I was expecting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive that I&#x27;m doing everything correctly but I feel as if the top coat doesn&#x27;t last very long. I bought the Sally Hansen base &amp; top coat because I was too impatient to wait for this gelish polish to arrive in the mail, &amp; I honestly think the Sally Hansen polish worked better. When I had the SH top coat on my nails, I built two 6 x 4 garden beds and planted plants and all that fun stuff and I did not get one single chip in my nail polish. But when I use this gelish polish I could be opening a can and it chips. The pH bond &amp; cuticle nourishment are great but you can just use alcohol instead of the pH bond and you could probably find some type of cuticle nourishment at your local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also just went and had my nails done for a wedding and they used OPI base &amp; top coat and it works really well too. I thought it was funny how they were using OPI base &amp; top coat because all their polishes were gelish. So maybe this is the reason why, it just doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> The Fantastic Four is a great product it comes with all the essentials for a gel manicure and the bottles are regular size and NOT the minis. This product arrived fairly quick!</li>
            <li> When I placed the order, I thought that I would receive it in the package as it was shown on the page. But I was disappointed when I received my order; there was no box, just 4 individually wrapped bottles. So I don&#x27;t have the instructions for application of Nail Harmony Gelish Gel Polish. I can get the instructions but having them with the product would be more convenient .</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend. This set has all the polishes she needs to do her own at home gel manicures and pedicures. This is a great deal! I definitely would pay more if she were to purchase separately at a store. The bottles are full-size, not the mini bottles. Shipping was free, took about a week to receive. The only thing that surprised us was that the box was not included. The polishes came wrapped in tissue paper.</li>
            <li> I love gelish! I first tried it with a manicure before my cruise. Realizing how expensive it is to get gels at the salon and the $5 fee they throw on to take it off I decided to just try doing it at home. I am so glad I did. All my friends ask me to do their nails when they have events to go to and they are kind enough to always gift me a bottle of gelish polish in return.</li>
            <li> Great set! Do not come boxed, but fantastic none the less :)</li>
            <li> I love this package as it does have all of the essentials for a perfect gel manicure. It is very shiny. I have had only one chip in the past two months from the one to two week manicures i do. There is a lot of product in the bottles so far im not even half way although i give my sister weekly manicures, myself and my mom once every week to two. Although it is very durable the removal process is not a pain as i have found with many other gel base and top. LOVE IT AND REORDER for this awesome price</li>
            <li> Perfect size and the best part is the price.</li>
            <li> This was a great bargain for the money, since the mini sizes are around $12-17 in Sally Beauty supply - these are full-size bottles! Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> great price and got here quick! will order again</li>
            <li> I find I only needed foundation and top coat in future, don&#x27;t need all four in this pack. Works great though</li>
            <li> Everything is fantastic. Love it.</li>
            <li> After twenty years of going to salons to get acrylics, I recently began having them overlay gel polish on my natural nail.  This too is very time consuming and expensive.  Then I realized, I can order all the same products my salon uses online.  Now I do my own nails at the most convenient time and in my own home!  I invested approx. $200 up front for a good LCD nail dryer, this Fantastic Four kit, and about six full size colored polishes.  I will get my money back within 2 months of not going to the salon; then my nail jobs are free except for buying more product hear and there.  BTW - if you decide to do it yourself, there are many videos online about how to do this right.  I kept reading how it will take 3 or 4 times of doing it yourself before you get good at it.  I just did my 3rd manicure using this system, and it looks like the pro&#x27;s did it.  I am so glad I made this investment and can do this myself.  Now, I&#x27;m ready to invite my daughters and granddaughters to let me do their nails, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this set, it has everything you need and does the job. So far I&#x27;ve done my moms, friend, and my nails with no chip or peel for over a week. Hopefully it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> the price was just awesome. Compared to other online sellers they had the best price. Just the foundation and top it off cost $30 while they give you the whole set for the same price!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My first set last me 3 years.  I will continue to by this product, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Did not arrive in original packaging.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it will all different brands and so fart this is what works for me.</li>
            <li> After extensive research , I decided that this is the home brand to use.  I started doing my own nails using the Gelish starter kit that comes with these products but in the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; size . These are so much bigger and such a better value. Check when you order any Gelish products to make sure you are comparing the right size before ordering . These work perfectly every time. I didn&#x27;t soak them off - I used my Dremel and a fine grit sanding wheel and sanded my nails down a couple of layers (like my salon does) and reapplied all the steps and it worked great! I redid them this way 4 times over a few months time. Now I am giving my nails a break and will start again next month . If not for the grow out these would last forever . I only had to redo my nails every 3 weeks . I had the process down to about 45 minutes . I put everything in a bin including an old placemat to protect my table, an extension cord and small lamp so everything was ready to go and it was less of a chore to do at home .</li>
            <li> great value and arrived quickly! met my expectations!</li>
            <li> This product is a steal of a price in comparison to purchasing everything separately.  While I am not as familiar with the products as the nail technicians I typically go to I have managed to make my manicures last much longer than with regular nail polish or even other &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; brands.  I like this brand so far and will continue testing it out.</li>
            <li> Love! My mom got me a gel light for Christmas. I originally tried to do a manicure with just gel polish and top coat-bad idea. It peeled right off. Purchased this and with this kit, the light,  and gel polish my manicure is just as long-lasting as the salon gel manicure. Also purchase rubbing alcohol to clean off nail before and after curing and acetone remover to remove.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! Great bargain!  Quality product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Every time... thanks</li>
            <li> The product is good, and the price is also very good. Shipping to europe was very fast, got it in a week.</li>
            <li> Gelish is my exclusive brand of gel that I use and this kit is FULL SIZE, Not mini. Love love love.</li>
            <li> I love the size of this four, they are fantastic, it came way before I expect it, my sister loves shellac and she just was ecstatic!!</li>
            <li> It all works great and is very easy to follow directions to use.  I use it just for home nail work for myself and my family.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for years, and this is the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> Appreciate that these were all full size bottles!  Came as promised and works great!</li>
            <li> This did not come in the box as the picture shows, but four separate products rolled up in some tissue paper. It is what I asked for though, so I cant really complain.</li>
            <li> Nice starter pack. It comes with full size bottles.</li>
            <li> I think the best product</li>
            <li> Very good quality!!!Fast shipping, thank you.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly and nicely packaged. They were exactly as listed and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them! When I run out I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I love it ... This gel do what it&#x27;s supposed to do very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Love the Gelish polish.  Did my nails last week the came out great for me using Gel polish on my own.  I went a step further and did marbleize nails.  Never done this before but it came out really good.</li>
