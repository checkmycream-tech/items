            <li>Fit was good.</li>
            <li>good product, quick ship</li>
            <li>More of  a  goldish,orange, reddish tint.</li>
            <li>There are so many things that can be done with this wig</li>
            <li>but I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>(I love the way Amazon Marketplace operates).</li>
            <li>and I was amazed how many people thought it was my hair..  </li>
            <li>It was better than the picture posted on the website and in Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OKAY for one night out.</li>
            <li>The wig picture is lovely but the wig I received did not match the color or style in the picture.  </li>
            <li>The color,  texture and cut was great and realistic.</li>
            <li>Go action has been great the wig worked out</li>
            <li>Easy to brush out.</li>
            <li>it simply isn&#x27;t the color pictured, but still beautiful.</li>
            <li>Now this is light brown</li>
            <li>This wig is comfortable to wear and looks sexy right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>It has the right texture and thickness, lovely color as pictured.</li>
            <li>A cool setting on the blow dryer and/or cool hair rollers should be fine.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun for the price.</li>
            <li>So far so good ad far as shedding and what not.</li>
            <li>WOULD BUY FROM AGAIN because they did me right.</li>
            <li>It was too long and sexy for me, so I cut off almost 5 inches, and it was still shoulder length, and looks more natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sexy wig that lasted me for a while with proper care.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li>It is RED more than it is brown.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it is synthetic, I will not be using hot irons and hot curling rods to style.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for the cost, but I like it better than some of my most expensive wigs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still good for a few uses though.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, she is very satisfied--good, likes the style and comfort.</li>
            <li>I really do like this wig when I want to dress up in a coustom.</li>
            <li>(Thanks for the tips- PunkRockSoulSister) to mute the shiny tones.</li>
            <li>This looked absolutely nothing like it did in the picture.  </li>
            <li>But I really didn&#x27;t mind, the length and curls are what mattered to me.</li>
            <li>Very fun wig for daily use or Cosplay.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very dark brown color; but a very gorgeous dark brown.</li>
            <li>would definitely buy another one at this price just for the fun of it!</li>
            <li>It is full and did not shed at all when I brushed it,  </li>
            <li>It worked great for Halloween and a few other times</li>
            <li>It is a bit shiny (again- this is normal for a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; wig)</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery time is the only positive thing I can say.</li>
            <li>There is some loss of hair, but that is to be expected with most wigs and is very minor with this one.</li>
            <li>It was very shiny (as almost all synthetic wigs are) - another sign that not only screams &amp;#34;WIG!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am told a brief soak in vinegar will work too, but then who wants to have vinegar smelling hair?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very much more RED than Redish Brown or Brown - and cut looks awkward at forehead and sides with short layers - I would have loved it if cut would have been as shown even though it is so red.  </li>
            <li>It came out of the package matted down (of course), but with styling, it perked right up.</li>
            <li>Even among other synthetic wigs, the price of this one was very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very nice as most synthetic wigs use a black base and up-close screams &amp;#34;WIG!!!&amp;#34; (unless of course you have dark skin tones).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig! So does my husband. The color is perfect, just a shade or so darker than my own color. The length is great. It fits wonderfully. Easy to brush out. There is some loss of hair, but that is to be expected with most wigs and is very minor with this one. I have worn this wig at least 10 times since it arrived, and I cannot think of anything negative to say about it. It looks good. It is a bit shiny (again- this is normal for a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; wig) but it is not super bad. Very fun wig for daily use or Cosplay. I would buy this again if I ever need to, and will definitely look for other wigs from this vendor / manufacturer for my future needs.</li>
            <li> good product, quick ship</li>
            <li> i bought for a friend; she is very pleased with the wig. A good value for the price. Her only complaint is it not really that red-- More of  a  goldish,orange, reddish tint. Otherwise, she is very satisfied--good, likes the style and comfort.</li>
            <li> Very much more RED than Redish Brown or Brown - and cut looks awkward at forehead and sides with short layers - I would have loved it if cut would have been as shown even though it is so red.  Fit was good.</li>
            <li> Got for role playing.  Lots of fun for the price. Looks nice as well.</li>
            <li> I really do like this wig when I want to dress up in a coustom.</li>
            <li> This wig is comfortable to wear and looks sexy right out of the package.  It was too long and sexy for me, so I cut off almost 5 inches, and it was still shoulder length, and looks more natural.  Shipment arrived on time as promised by Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sexy wig that lasted me for a while with proper care. The hair will eventually frizz from just the humidity in the air and brushing will begin to pull hairs out after just a few times. It&#x27;s still good for a few uses though. It worked great for Halloween and a few other times but I eventually threw it out.</li>
            <li> Now this is light brown and it is so beautiful. There are so many things that can be done with this wig and yes it is long but I LOVE IT. i hope this wig holds up for quite a while for me. it does shed a little but it does not get all matted up. Thank you, thankyou, thank you. WOULD BUY FROM AGAIN because they did me right. AWESOME!!!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s absolutely a gorgeous wig. quality is really good. texture of the hair is wonderful. it&#x27;s so pretty. the only thing, it&#x27;s not a red/brown. it&#x27;s a very dark brown color; but a very gorgeous dark brown. I have NO complaints. it simply isn&#x27;t the color pictured, but still beautiful.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this wig from a Chinese company (Gooaction). Problem resolution is complicated when dealing with a company based in another country. But, I did my homework and I am very, very, very pleased. (I love the way Amazon Marketplace operates). I decided even if I was unhappy, I did not spend a whole lot of money to get frustrated over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know items made, sold, and shipped from China take extra time to arrive. It was almost a month before I got my wig. They are usually shipped freight (tramp steamers) and then wait in Customs with the strict regulations of imports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did a lot of research on wigs: real human hair vs. real-like human hair (synthetic), styles, maintenance and care. Real human hair is too expensive (they run up in the thousands of dollars!) and synthetic wigs can look really costume-like and fake. I&#x27;m starting to lose my hair :( and wanted to find something close to my natural red hair that would look and feel natural without putting me into bankruptcy. Even among other synthetic wigs, the price of this one was very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The style is nice and layered. It is RED more than it is brown. It came out of the package matted down (of course), but with styling, it perked right up. The separate skull cap included is black- but the cap (roots) of the wig is nude. This is very nice as most synthetic wigs use a black base and up-close screams &amp;#34;WIG!!!&amp;#34; (unless of course you have dark skin tones). It was very shiny (as almost all synthetic wigs are) - another sign that not only screams &amp;#34;WIG!!&amp;#34; but &amp;#34;FAKE PLASTIC WIG!!&amp;#34;.  I used Suave Professionals Shampoo for Dry hair (Thanks for the tips- PunkRockSoulSister) to mute the shiny tones. I am told a brief soak in vinegar will work too, but then who wants to have vinegar smelling hair?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is synthetic, I will not be using hot irons and hot curling rods to style. Very few synthetic wigs are able to handle ordinary styling tools without melting. A cool setting on the blow dryer and/or cool hair rollers should be fine. I am very happy!</li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars only because of the packaging. It was so poorly packed it was just a bunched up mess. So the waves and curls were all but gone. I didn&#x27;t sweat it because I knew washing and stlying would restore the look as it appears in picture.&lt;br /&gt;With that said it styled easily and beautifully. Just like the picture. It has the right texture and thickness, lovely color as pictured. I will purchase from th again and do recommend them. BUT THEYVE GOT TO PUT MORE EFFORT IN PACKING AND PROTECTING THE PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s prettier than pictured, the color is gorgeous, and I am VERY happy with it. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for the cost, but I like it better than some of my most expensive wigs.</li>
            <li> I just received my wig today and tried it on immediately. It is full and did not shed at all when I brushed it,  looks very sexy on.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy another one at this price just for the fun of it!</li>
            <li> Go action has been great the wig worked out</li>
            <li> this was purchased for a masquerade party.. it was a hit and I was amazed how many people thought it was my hair..  for the price, it was a great wig.. Plan on wearing it on other occasions.</li>
            <li> The color,  texture and cut was great and realistic. It was better than the picture posted on the website and in Amazon</li>
            <li> very nice get a lot of complements on it</li>
            <li> This looked absolutely nothing like it did in the picture.  Couldn&#x27;t send it back soon enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OKAY for one night out.</li>
            <li> The wig picture is lovely but the wig I received did not match the color or style in the picture.  i&#x27;m disappointed in the product. Fast Delivery time is the only positive thing I can say.</li>
            <li> the inside lining stretched and is a little bigger then when i bought it.</li>
            <li> Love it! I really love the length and the curls! The only thing is, it&#x27;s not as dark red as it is in the picture. There is no brown that I saw.  It is red though. But I really didn&#x27;t mind, the length and curls are what mattered to me. So far so good ad far as shedding and what not. But I&#x27;ve only worn it a couple of times. Would like to buy from this company again.</li>
