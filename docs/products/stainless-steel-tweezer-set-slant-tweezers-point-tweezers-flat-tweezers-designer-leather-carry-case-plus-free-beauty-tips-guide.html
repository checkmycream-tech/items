            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think there was much of a difference between tweezers.</li>
            <li>I received these for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>They come with a white case thats cute,it makes for a great gift.</li>
            <li>The tweezers feel comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>The case holds all three of the tweezers securely.</li>

            <li>I love it when you find a good set of tweezers that actually work</li>
            <li>This is a good set because I can do my eyebrows myself and it looks like it&#x27;s done professionally.</li>
            <li>They grab the hair easily and rip it out quickly.</li>
            <li>I got this set as gift for my sister, as she had asked for a nice set of tweezers and I saw that this had high reviews.</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>Looks very stylish and professional.</li>
            <li>When I opened these from the package after they came in that mail, I looked at my husband and told him that I know I shouldn&#x27;t as excited for these as I am, but I can&#x27;t help it..</li>
            <li>Luckily, XISS packaged theirs in a very nice, white leather carrying case.  </li>
            <li>One of them is slanted used to quickly clean your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>They are strong, sturdy, super effective, and come with a nice little holder.</li>
            <li>This 3 pack set of Professional Tweezers is absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>My mom always told me that you get what you pay for and that is certainly true in this case.  </li>
            <li>They fit right in my hand and don&#x27;t slip or slide and get the job done.</li>
            <li>These high quality precise professional tweezers with hand finished tips, which will not break or bend during use making them great to use as ingrown hair tweezers, eyebrow tweezers, hair removal tweezers, splinter tweezers and first aid tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flat tweezer is good for shaping and enhancing your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an exceptional set of tweezers , you receive three different ones for all your tweezing needs .I</li>
            <li>I notice that after following the tips the company gives I was able to get most of the hair with the root on the bottom.</li>
            <li>more than highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>I was able to get rid of more than one hair at a time with the flat tweezers.</li>
            <li>These things rip out all the right hair in all the right places!</li>
            <li>The cute case it comes in also makes it that little bit more special!</li>
            <li>I laughed a little at the thought of them coming in a leather pouch, but it is also working out very well, and I am glad I kept it.</li>
            <li>Very much worth every cent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that I get three of them for different uses</li>
            <li>Stylish leather case, stainless steel, each has a different tip for many uses</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s well worth the price,</li>
            <li>These tweezers are not only attractive, but the understated matte black finish provides a better grip and therefore control.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made of sturdy stainless steel, and are able to easily exert enough pressure to yank out offending hairs or eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a hair these tweezers can&#x27;t get; very fine, stubborn, ingrown hairs, it got a tick off our dog, several splinters out of our feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will certainly shop again for gifts!</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable in the hand, they bulge out in the middle</li>
            <li>I am a 47 year-old woman, so my skin isn&#x27;t exactly as taught as it once was.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review these at such a great price during your recent promotion</li>
            <li>The tips align so perfectly that when the tweezers are squeezed together, it is difficult to see the seam between them--the hallmark of a well machined product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I had one really awesome pair (that unfortunately fell off the balcony of my hotel room while I was on vacation...</li>
            <li>the tweezers their mom had brought did nothing more than push the splinter in further and prolong their agony.  </li>
            <li>The tips are all very sharp and precise and the gripping surface is non-slip and wider and easier to grip than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>They close tightly, the grip is comfortable, and you can pull more than one hair at once.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>love this set because it comes with the three angles you need: a flat tip, slant tip, and point tip.</li>
            <li>I notice how clean they look as if I went to get them professionally done.</li>
            <li>only by providing such a superior product but also with the care and attention to detail in their packaging .This</li>
            <li>I bought three sets after trying the first one and liking them SO much.</li>
            <li>Shop no more as the XISS tweezer set is fantastic, high quality tips that are precise and really comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>And when it comes to ingrown hairs they are also on point, my son seems to always have a few and with these tweezers he was able to grab the hair and pull it out quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a nice little case.  </li>
            <li>This set includes 3 different, professional quality tweezers - slanted, flat and pointed and they come in a nice little designer leather carrying case that keeps each one clean and secure in it&#x27;s own individual pocket.  </li>
            <li>I came to Amazon first and saw these highly rated tweezers for about $15.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also great for splinters and little tiny pieces of glass.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>It should not be so hard to find tweezers that have a good &amp;#34;connect&amp;#34; point,</li>
            <li>product and works very well .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky</li>
            <li>but these really surpass my expectations.</li>
            <li>If this sounds too small for you, you could go for the full length slant tweezers, which, depending on color, are anywhere from 6-10 dollars more.</li>
            <li>Wife loves them professional grade!!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really hard to find some good decent tweezers</li>
            <li>Having been whinged at to buy them by a friend, I didn&#x27;t see anything special about them initially until I saw them.</li>
            <li>many times the tweezers do not grip tight enough to pull that splinter out of your finger, or pluck those stray hairs from your eyebrow or chin.&lt;br /&gt;These are worth every penny!</li>
            <li>included case is just the right size - large enough to hold all the tweezers safely and be easy to find, but also small enough that it does not take up a disproportionate amount of space.  </li>
            <li>The tips of the pointed ones are extremely sharp, great for removing a splinter by only going as deep as you need to.  </li>
            <li>But I have no problems getting a thumb and two fingers on this smaller version, more than enough for any tweezer task.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do sit tight in the holder, but I&#x27;m sure it will loosen up with time and</li>
            <li>I love that they also come with the little storage pouch</li>
            <li>They are made of  great quality of material i can have them for a long time,not like other brands with low quality materials.</li>
            <li>I love the little case that comes with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tweezers and the little travel case they come in are absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>(So many tweezers just don&#x27;t have a firm grasp/grip...</li>
            <li>The sharp pointed ones are great for those tiny little hairs and ingrown ones.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just looking to pull random, fully erupted hairs, they&#x27;d be fine, but I wanted a pair that could grasp really fine hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because I typically can&#x27;t see by the time I am done due to my eyes watering.</li>
            <li>product is a professional premium stainless steel tweezer set, you will receive slant tip tweezers, point tip tweezers, flat tip tweezers, and a designer leather carrying case.</li>
            <li>I thought I had learned this one, but evidently I need to repeat it for myself: &#x27;The cheapest tool ends up being the most expensive one.&#x27;</li>
            <li>The only decent pair of the 3 was the pointy pair.</li>
            <li>After somehow losing my last pair of tweezers on a trip, I was in need of a new pair.</li>
            <li>Sure, the whole thing could get sucked down into an upholstered limbo, but at least it will be easier to find if it does.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit hard to squeeze compared with other tweezers that I own.  </li>
            <li>Not needle sharp, but sharp enough so that only the most deeply buried splinter or hair would require something besides this pair of tweezers to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a good set because I can do my eyebrows myself and it looks like it&#x27;s done professionally.</li>
            <li> They grab the hair easily and rip it out quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this set as gift for my sister, as she had asked for a nice set of tweezers and I saw that this had high reviews.</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> Looks very stylish and professional.</li>
            <li> When I opened these from the package after they came in that mail, I looked at my husband and told him that I know I shouldn&#x27;t as excited for these as I am, but I can&#x27;t help it..</li>
            <li> Luckily, XISS packaged theirs in a very nice, white leather carrying case.  </li>
            <li> One of them is slanted used to quickly clean your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> They are strong, sturdy, super effective, and come with a nice little holder.</li>
            <li> This 3 pack set of Professional Tweezers is absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> My mom always told me that you get what you pay for and that is certainly true in this case.  </li>
            <li> They fit right in my hand and don&#x27;t slip or slide and get the job done.</li>
            <li> These high quality precise professional tweezers with hand finished tips, which will not break or bend during use making them great to use as ingrown hair tweezers, eyebrow tweezers, hair removal tweezers, splinter tweezers and first aid tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flat tweezer is good for shaping and enhancing your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an exceptional set of tweezers , you receive three different ones for all your tweezing needs .I</li>
            <li> I notice that after following the tips the company gives I was able to get most of the hair with the root on the bottom.</li>
            <li> more than highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I was able to get rid of more than one hair at a time with the flat tweezers.</li>
            <li> These things rip out all the right hair in all the right places!</li>
            <li> The cute case it comes in also makes it that little bit more special!</li>
            <li> I laughed a little at the thought of them coming in a leather pouch, but it is also working out very well, and I am glad I kept it.</li>
            <li> Very much worth every cent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that I get three of them for different uses</li>
            <li> Stylish leather case, stainless steel, each has a different tip for many uses</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s well worth the price,</li>
            <li> These tweezers are not only attractive, but the understated matte black finish provides a better grip and therefore control.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made of sturdy stainless steel, and are able to easily exert enough pressure to yank out offending hairs or eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a hair these tweezers can&#x27;t get; very fine, stubborn, ingrown hairs, it got a tick off our dog, several splinters out of our feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will certainly shop again for gifts!</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable in the hand, they bulge out in the middle</li>
            <li> I am a 47 year-old woman, so my skin isn&#x27;t exactly as taught as it once was.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review these at such a great price during your recent promotion</li>
            <li> The tips align so perfectly that when the tweezers are squeezed together, it is difficult to see the seam between them--the hallmark of a well machined product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I had one really awesome pair (that unfortunately fell off the balcony of my hotel room while I was on vacation...</li>
            <li> the tweezers their mom had brought did nothing more than push the splinter in further and prolong their agony.  </li>
            <li> The tips are all very sharp and precise and the gripping surface is non-slip and wider and easier to grip than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> They close tightly, the grip is comfortable, and you can pull more than one hair at once.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> love this set because it comes with the three angles you need: a flat tip, slant tip, and point tip.</li>
            <li> I notice how clean they look as if I went to get them professionally done.</li>
            <li> only by providing such a superior product but also with the care and attention to detail in their packaging .This</li>
            <li> I bought three sets after trying the first one and liking them SO much.</li>
            <li> Shop no more as the XISS tweezer set is fantastic, high quality tips that are precise and really comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> And when it comes to ingrown hairs they are also on point, my son seems to always have a few and with these tweezers he was able to grab the hair and pull it out quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li> Comes in a nice little case.  </li>
            <li> This set includes 3 different, professional quality tweezers - slanted, flat and pointed and they come in a nice little designer leather carrying case that keeps each one clean and secure in it&#x27;s own individual pocket.  </li>
            <li> I came to Amazon first and saw these highly rated tweezers for about $15.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also great for splinters and little tiny pieces of glass.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> It should not be so hard to find tweezers that have a good &amp;#34;connect&amp;#34; point,</li>
            <li> product and works very well .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky</li>
            <li> but these really surpass my expectations.</li>
            <li> If this sounds too small for you, you could go for the full length slant tweezers, which, depending on color, are anywhere from 6-10 dollars more.</li>
            <li> Wife loves them professional grade!!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard to find some good decent tweezers</li>
            <li> Having been whinged at to buy them by a friend, I didn&#x27;t see anything special about them initially until I saw them.</li>
            <li> many times the tweezers do not grip tight enough to pull that splinter out of your finger, or pluck those stray hairs from your eyebrow or chin.&lt;br /&gt;These are worth every penny!</li>
            <li> included case is just the right size - large enough to hold all the tweezers safely and be easy to find, but also small enough that it does not take up a disproportionate amount of space.  </li>
            <li> The tips of the pointed ones are extremely sharp, great for removing a splinter by only going as deep as you need to.  </li>
            <li> But I have no problems getting a thumb and two fingers on this smaller version, more than enough for any tweezer task.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do sit tight in the holder, but I&#x27;m sure it will loosen up with time and</li>
            <li> I love that they also come with the little storage pouch</li>
            <li> They are made of  great quality of material i can have them for a long time,not like other brands with low quality materials.</li>
            <li> I love the little case that comes with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tweezers and the little travel case they come in are absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> (So many tweezers just don&#x27;t have a firm grasp/grip...</li>
            <li> The sharp pointed ones are great for those tiny little hairs and ingrown ones.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just looking to pull random, fully erupted hairs, they&#x27;d be fine, but I wanted a pair that could grasp really fine hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because I typically can&#x27;t see by the time I am done due to my eyes watering.</li>
            <li> product is a professional premium stainless steel tweezer set, you will receive slant tip tweezers, point tip tweezers, flat tip tweezers, and a designer leather carrying case.</li>
            <li> I thought I had learned this one, but evidently I need to repeat it for myself: &#x27;The cheapest tool ends up being the most expensive one.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The only decent pair of the 3 was the pointy pair.</li>
            <li> After somehow losing my last pair of tweezers on a trip, I was in need of a new pair.</li>
            <li> Sure, the whole thing could get sucked down into an upholstered limbo, but at least it will be easier to find if it does.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit hard to squeeze compared with other tweezers that I own.  </li>
            <li> Not needle sharp, but sharp enough so that only the most deeply buried splinter or hair would require something besides this pair of tweezers to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are 3 different tips, pointed, slant and flat tip.</li>
            <li> I use the flat tweezers for betweens my two brows to get rid of those hairs that cause a unibrow.</li>
            <li> First, I am a sucker for packaging!</li>
            <li> She liked her men toothless and her chicken raw.</li>
            <li> ; my set is a black case with white tweezers.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these tweezers because you can tell that they are also very durable and will last a long time just from the look of them!</li>
            <li> I have an obsession with tweezers and constantly tweezing my eyebrows even when there&#x27;s just a little hair or two.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not worried about the tweezer slipping out of my hand when plucking my brows.</li>
            <li> Tips are not fine enough.</li>
            <li> The tip of the pointed tweezer is not that sharp but be careful not to poke your self.</li>
            <li> ends of the slant tips are relatively sharp.</li>
            <li> The other 2 were too clunky.</li>
            <li> found these to pluck the hairs easier then any other tweezers I have ever owned .Not</li>
            <li> The quality of them shines through, certainly not your average tweezers.</li>
            <li> Also, they are less sharp than others that I have.  </li>
            <li> After leaving my old one behind at a security check point.</li>
            <li> She had a peak that went down to her eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I picked the pin bones out of slippery, oily salmon with them the other night!</li>
            <li> I went to WalMart and bought a pair for about half that price and attempted to use them to remove some ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> set was black and the carrying case is white.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One flick of the wrist and these babies removed all my course boar-like black hairs from my misguided hairline.</li>
            <li> I usually have welts and some bleeding after tweezing my eyebrows due to accidentally grabbing skin.  </li>
            <li> if anyone is like me, it seems like when you get in your car you notice lots of little hairs you missed.</li>
            <li> No stubble or skin infections left behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as though the XISS tweezers have little hair magnets in the tips!  </li>
            <li> I seriously cannot think of anything negative to say about this tweezer set other than I wish I had them sooner.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard finding a set of tweezers that just work.</li>
            <li> I mean bc</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how many pairs of tweezers I&#x27;ve gone through over the years that have all ended up in the trash because when the time came for them to &amp;#34;earn their keep&amp;#34; they failed miserably.  </li>
            <li> at least I know they aren&#x27;t going to accidently fall out!</li>
            <li> The slant ones help with thick hairs that usually broke off at the base.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
            <li> measure just shy of 2.75 inches.</li>
            <li> Because when it breaks or fails, you have to add the cost of the one you should have bought to start with.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I didnt want to be like her, so</li>
            <li> I am beyond obsessed with this tweezer set from XISS.</li>
            <li> The tips of the tweezers were very poorly aligned and so did not grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I was wrong!</li>
            <li> These meant I was done before it got that bad though.</li>
            <li> For a pair of tweezers?! Seemed outrageous.</li>

They are very comfortable in the hand, they bulge out in the middle so you can grip them with your fingers and thumb better.

I usually have welts and some bleeding after tweezing my eyebrows due to accidentally grabbing skin.  It&#x27;s as though the XISS tweezers have little hair magnets in the tips!

            <li> These are amazing quality tweezers! They work great! I ordered white and they look great too! I love that they also come with the little storage pouch, that will keep them from getting lost and damaged as easily! *I received a sample to try in order to give my unbiased and honest opinion. The views in this review are completely my own!*</li>
            <li> I am not even sure where to begin.  These tweezers are awesome! I have used them for my eyebrows as well as removing a splinter from my daughter&#x27;s finger!  There are three different tips, so regardless what you need it for, your needs can be met!  I must also mention, that I love the case that it comes in.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think there was much of a difference between tweezers. I guess I was wrong! These things grab the hair with ease. Two of them are wider than your standard cheapy tweezers. Those two facts together meant these made plucking my eyebrows quick and easy! It&#x27;s nice because I typically can&#x27;t see by the time I am done due to my eyes watering. These meant I was done before it got that bad though.They are strong, sturdy, super effective, and come with a nice little holder. They do sit tight in the holder, but I&#x27;m sure it will loosen up with time and at least I know they aren&#x27;t going to accidently fall out! I received these for free for review purposes. My opinions are my own honest ones however!</li>
            <li> They come with a white case thats cute,it makes for a great gift.They are made of  great quality of material i can have them for a long time,not like other brands with low quality materials.I recived this item for review in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Love love love love love these tweezers! They fit right in my hand and don&#x27;t slip or slide and get the job done. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review these at such a great price during your recent promotion</li>
            <li> As soon as I got these they were put to the test and I have to say I think they are just simply AMAZING. Very much worth every cent even the case is good quality and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> After somehow losing my last pair of tweezers on a trip, I was in need of a new pair. I came to Amazon first and saw these highly rated tweezers for about $15. For a pair of tweezers?! Seemed outrageous. I went to WalMart and bought a pair for about half that price and attempted to use them to remove some ingrown hairs. To what should I liken that process? Put one quarter on top of another, and try to use those as tweezers. Yeah, it was about like that. The tips of the tweezers were very poorly aligned and so did not grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back again to Amazon, and I ordered this pair of Mini Slant Tweezers. Success! The tips align so perfectly that when the tweezers are squeezed together, it is difficult to see the seam between them--the hallmark of a well machined product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both ends of the slant tips are relatively sharp. Not needle sharp, but sharp enough so that only the most deeply buried splinter or hair would require something besides this pair of tweezers to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They measure just shy of 2.75 inches. If this sounds too small for you, you could go for the full length slant tweezers, which, depending on color, are anywhere from 6-10 dollars more. But I have no problems getting a thumb and two fingers on this smaller version, more than enough for any tweezer task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson? I thought I had learned this one, but evidently I need to repeat it for myself: &#x27;The cheapest tool ends up being the most expensive one.&#x27; Why? Because when it breaks or fails, you have to add the cost of the one you should have bought to start with. Start here, and this will be the last pair of tweezers you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that I get three of them for different uses but at times I struggle to catch the hair!!! All in all it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  These tweezers are not only attractive, but the understated matte black finish provides a better grip and therefore control.  They have a nice balance and are easy to hold manipulate.  The tips come together perfectly and hold securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included case is just the right size - large enough to hold all the tweezers safely and be easy to find, but also small enough that it does not take up a disproportionate amount of space.  Definitely a part of my travel kit from now on🐸&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this set of tweezers to evaluate in order to review.</li>
            <li> This 3 pack set of Professional Tweezers is absolutely amazing quality!&lt;br /&gt;I love the look and feel of this set. There are 3 different tips, pointed, slant and flat tip. Also comes with a nice leather carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;My set was black and the carrying case is white.&lt;br /&gt;The precision is excellent! I love it when you find a good set of tweezers that actually work well!&lt;br /&gt;So many times the tweezers do not grip tight enough to pull that splinter out of your finger, or pluck those stray hairs from your eyebrow or chin.&lt;br /&gt;These are worth every penny! Don&#x27;t bother trying to get off cheaply, you need a good set of tweezers that will do the job!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this for home use, professional use or even to be given as a gift!</li>
            <li> I bought three sets after trying the first one and liking them SO much. One set is for home; the second is for travel and my purse; and the third is for household use. I picked the pin bones out of slippery, oily salmon with them the other night!</li>
            <li> Amazingly Designed product, exactly as pictured and good quality</li>
            <li> Having been whinged at to buy them by a friend, I didn&#x27;t see anything special about them initially until I saw them. The quality of them shines through, certainly not your average tweezers. The cute case it comes in also makes it that little bit more special! Definitely recommend them to anyone looking for some good tweezers!</li>
            <li> Love this tweezer set!! Great, precise, well made instruments and super nice leather case! All three are cheaper than one tweezerman tweezer and just as well made!!!</li>
            <li> Best set ever! After leaving my old one behind at a security check point. For these I will run back to the car to save them!! LoL.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay. Not what I was hoping for, so I ordered some Tweezerman tweezers instead. Just going to keep these around as backup.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t meet my expectation. They had so many great reviews, I got my hopes up. The only decent pair of the 3 was the pointy pair. The other 2 were too clunky. If you&#x27;re just looking to pull random, fully erupted hairs, they&#x27;d be fine, but I wanted a pair that could grasp really fine hairs. I had one really awesome pair (that unfortunately fell off the balcony of my hotel room while I was on vacation...thank goodness no-one was below!) and that&#x27;s my gold standard, I won&#x27;t be happy (in the tweezer dept, that is!) until I find an equally effective pair (and I don&#x27;t know what brand they were, bummer!), so I&#x27;ll just have to keep looking! (So many tweezers just don&#x27;t have a firm grasp/grip...I&#x27;ll HAVE the hair, and then it just slides through)</li>
            <li> Wife loves them professional grade!!!</li>
            <li> Wayward eyebrows, splinters, and ingrown hairs don&#x27;t stand a chance. This set has a tool for any job.</li>

            <li> These three piece tweezer set works wonders on your brows. After using all three tweezers on my brows I notice how clean they look as if I went to get them professionally done. The tweezers feel comfortable in my hand. Also they give me a good grip so I&#x27;m not worried about the tweezer slipping out of my hand when plucking my brows. I used the point tweezers to help get rid of those stubborn and very fine hairs. The tip of the pointed tweezer is not that sharp but be careful not to poke your self. I use the flat tweezers for betweens my two brows to get rid of those hairs that cause a unibrow. I was able to get rid of more than one hair at a time with the flat tweezers. The slant ones help with thick hairs that usually broke off at the base. The company puts silicone pieces on the tweezers to keep them close and so the point tweezers don&#x27;t poke you.There is a paper inside the package that comes out and it gives you tips after plucking. I notice that after following the tips the company gives I was able to get most of the hair with the root on the bottom. On that same paper is tells you what each tool it used for. You get a carrying case that is about the same size of an iphone 4. The case holds all three of the tweezers securely. These are the best tweezers I have ever used for my brows because my brows are so clean around them. If you need amazing tweezers then these are perfect for you. I was able to get these XISS set of three tweezers for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> They are a bit hard to squeeze compared with other tweezers that I own.  Also, they are less sharp than others that I have.  Comes in a nice little case.  I wanted to like them.</li>
            <li> These things rip out all the right hair in all the right places! I have a widows peaks like that kid in The Munsters. Just like my grandma! She had a peak that went down to her eyebrows. She liked her men toothless and her chicken raw. Needless to say I didnt want to be like her, so i though I&#x27;d start by ripping out the hair triangle on my forhead. One flick of the wrist and these babies removed all my course boar-like black hairs from my misguided hairline. No stubble or skin infections left behind. Praise for these wonderful tweezers!!!</li>
            <li> This is a awesome product every girl should own this set it has all of the tweezers you need to do everything from health aid  to makeup and more.. luv that it comes with a leather case to keep them in one spot so u don&#x27;t lose them. Nice and sleek:)</li>
            <li> The tweezers come in a package of three. Each of them look differently and have different purpose. One of them is slanted used to quickly clean your eyebrows. The pointed tweezer is good for grabbing the stubborn hairs. The flat tweezer is good for shaping and enhancing your eyebrows. This is a good set because I can do my eyebrows myself and it looks like it&#x27;s done professionally. I&#x27;m really picky and it&#x27;s really hard to find some good decent tweezers but these really surpass my expectations. It comes with cute leather pouch that you can keep the tweezers inside. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> PROs:  Stylish leather case, stainless steel, each has a different tip for many uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers are a lot like pens.  Nobody cares about them until they need them, only to find out that they&#x27;re buried in the couch somewhere.  Luckily, XISS packaged theirs in a very nice, white leather carrying case.  Sure, the whole thing could get sucked down into an upholstered limbo, but at least it will be easier to find if it does.  As far as the tweezers themselves, I was very impressed by their quality.  They&#x27;re made of sturdy stainless steel, and are able to easily exert enough pressure to yank out offending hairs or eyebrows.  The tips of the pointed ones are extremely sharp, great for removing a splinter by only going as deep as you need to.  Yes, I&#x27;ve experimented on these things.  I love you people THAT much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of this tweezer set, enabling me to offer you my honest opinion on them.  I hope I&#x27;ve been able to help you make your purchasing decision.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tweezers set. They work awesomely at get those stray brows and other unwanted hair.... Also work wonders at getting splinters  out of feet as I found out when my husband had a tiny one. Would make a great gift for anyone...</li>
            <li> Bought for the missus. She loves it! Great set of quality tweezers. Looks very stylish and professional. She loves the leather case and packaging too. Didn&#x27;t know there were different types for different areas. I even tried them out on myself - works great for tidying my beard &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My mom always told me that you get what you pay for and that is certainly true in this case.  I can&#x27;t even tell you how many pairs of tweezers I&#x27;ve gone through over the years that have all ended up in the trash because when the time came for them to &amp;#34;earn their keep&amp;#34; they failed miserably.  This set includes 3 different, professional quality tweezers - slanted, flat and pointed and they come in a nice little designer leather carrying case that keeps each one clean and secure in it&#x27;s own individual pocket.  The tips are all very sharp and precise and the gripping surface is non-slip and wider and easier to grip than others I&#x27;ve tried.  They&#x27;re top of the line when it comes to eyebrow tweezing but they&#x27;re beyond amazing when it comes to removing splinters and ingrown hairs.  We just returned from vacation and thank God I had the foresight to pack these because the pier out back of the condo we rented wreaked havoc on my God babie&#x27;s feet.  It seemed like every day one of them had a splinter and the tweezers their mom had brought did nothing more than push the splinter in further and prolong their agony.  It took me all of 30 seconds to secure and remove the splinters using the pointed tweezers in this set, they didn&#x27;t even realize that I had done anything, always a huge bonus.  And when it comes to ingrown hairs they are also on point, my son seems to always have a few and with these tweezers he was able to grab the hair and pull it out quickly and painlessly.  Definitely a great set that&#x27;s well worth the price, guaranteed to last and not rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience but all the opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product</li>
            <li> When I opened these from the package after they came in that mail, I looked at my husband and told him that I know I shouldn&#x27;t as excited for these as I am, but I can&#x27;t help it.. I finally have &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; tweezers that I am not letting the hubby and kids steal all the time and lose. They are just what I need for tweezing my eye brows and pulling splinters. I love the little case that comes with them.&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> EXCELENT!  Odered one for the wife and one for my travel kit.  Good quality and a grat price.</li>
            <li> I got this set as gift for my sister, as she had asked for a nice set of tweezers and I saw that this had high reviews. She immediately tested out each of the three tweezers. She said that they were perfect and that the travel case with it would help reduce the chance that they would get lost.</li>
            <li> I am beyond obsessed with this tweezer set from XISS. First, I am a sucker for packaging! The tweezers and the little travel case they come in are absolutely adorable. I love the color, the design, the elegance of it. I have an obsession with tweezers and constantly tweezing my eyebrows even when there&#x27;s just a little hair or two. This set is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;-- The sharp pointed ones are great for those tiny little hairs and ingrown ones. They grab the hair easily and rip it out quickly. They&#x27;re also great for splinters and little tiny pieces of glass.&lt;br /&gt;-- The slant and flat tweezers are both great to keep your eyebrows nice and groomed. They close tightly, the grip is comfortable, and you can pull more than one hair at once.&lt;br /&gt;This set is an all-in-one pack of tweezers you need for anything! It&#x27;s a great travel set for your purse! I seriously cannot think of anything negative to say about this tweezer set other than I wish I had them sooner.  Sample provided for testing and honest review</li>
            <li> i love this tweezers. come witht the nice and secured case. these three types is awesome for different plucking needed.well made and works well.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this tweezer set! It should not be so hard to find tweezers that have a good &amp;#34;connect&amp;#34; point, if you know what I mean?&lt;br /&gt;These all are top quality, and I am very happy. I laughed a little at the thought of them coming in a leather pouch, but it is also working out very well, and I am glad I kept it. FTR; my set is a black case with white tweezers.</li>
            <li> It is so hard finding a set of tweezers that just work. I can&#x27;t tell you how many we have lying in the bathroom cabinet drawer that are completely useless. Shop no more as the XISS tweezer set is fantastic, high quality tips that are precise and really comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Sturdy tweezer set. Not as precise as I would have liked when tweezing. Tips are not fine enough. It is just okay.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, superior to what I have purchased from the drug stores etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Superb quality tweezers which work really well. They have a great design that allows the tweezers to be held very comfortably which makes it easier to use. They come in a very handy leather case which ensures that you don&#x27;t end up misplacing them! You can&#x27;t go wrong with these tweezers because you can tell that they are also very durable and will last a long time just from the look of them! Excellent, Five star product!</li>
            <li> Great set, well made, high quality, Shipping really fast! nice to get case too. THX</li>
