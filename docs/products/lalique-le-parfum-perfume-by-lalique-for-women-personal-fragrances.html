            <li>It&#x27;s a very good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased Lalique before however I can tell you this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>Best perfume ever I gave to my wife....</li>
            <li>Beautiful bottle! ....</li>
            <li>wonderful scent would purchase again!........</li>
            <li>What a beautifully decor piece this will make when it&#x27;s delightful perfume</li>
            <li>I purchased some Lalique cologne for my husband this Christmas, and he loved it!  </li>
            <li>If you like that you&#x27;ll LOVE this!!</li>
            <li>Great perfum, excellent seller practice with outstanding price of $40+ dollars.</li>
            <li>perfect :) good smell.</li>
            <li>It smells good in her</li>
            <li>She loved it and told me to buy some for myself,</li>
            <li>It is a light fragrance, but it is delightful.  </li>
            <li>NOT TOO GOOD</li>
            <li>A worthwhile buy</li>
            <li>And the price is appropriate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more a winter/evening smell, that stays longs on clothes.</li>
            <li>Love the smell....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn many perfumes</li>
            <li>a favorite of mine is Armani Code.</li>
            <li>In addition:  to receiving it in such beautiful packaging (you won&#x27;t even want to discard the box) and in this bottle by Lalique is just incredulous!  </li>
            <li>I believed I checked twice to be sure there wasn&#x27;t an add.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I didn&#x27;t even want to write a review for fear that they would disappear before I could grab another one.  </li>
            <li>I knew that I would never be able to part with it.  </li>
            <li>Although I truly LOVE Lalique fragrances, this scent is not one of my favorites, but I did get a lot of compliments when I wore it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very rich and  lovely.</li>
            <li>You get, in my opinion, one of the highest quality, exquisite fragrance of any I&#x27;ve known beside a few others (won&#x27;t mention now) even on the EDT Lalique by Lalique..</li>
            <li>But for the deep discount that I received ($34) by purchasing an older vintage from Amazon.com, I am very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is unique and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>First I did some background as I love the fragrance of Lalique by Lalique.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think it is a good value.</li>
            <li>From what I understand from reading the reviews, the ones at the department stores were bottled more recently and the scent lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>Neiman Marcus carries the same Le Parfum  - 3.3 oz., but at a much higher price tag, $175.00!!!  </li>
            <li>It was a gift can say much.</li>
            <li>, I don’t have a point of reference on how much longer that one lasts.  </li>
            <li>Nice, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li>this is same fragrance by Lalique but difference is special cube shaped bottle.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the perfume with crescent moon shape top w. embellished florals and embossed floral down side</li>
            <li>I bought this for my moms birthday, we like high end perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Rich and deep fragrance, the fragrance lasts all day, highly recommended to a mature lady of class.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and I will order more.</li>
            <li>WOW and WOW!</li>

            <li> is long gone by</li>
            <li> so do a lot of other people when I wear Lalique.</li>
            <li> Whimsical and classic - like their other products.</li>
            <li> So, I did a little research to find out about their women&#x27;s fragrances and found this one.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Confused as that is made in EDT and EDP.  </li>

            <li> Nice, but it does not last long. I have to reapply after a couple of hours. It does smell good,however.</li>
            <li> Whimsical and classic - like their other products.</li>
            <li> Rich and deep fragrance, the fragrance lasts all day, highly recommended to a mature lady of class. A worthwhile buy</li>
            <li> Great perfum, excellent seller practice with outstanding price of $40+ dollars. It sells at Neiman Marcus for $170.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy this stuff in stores. It is a vintage perfume that cannot be matched by today&#x27;s generic scents. And the price is appropriate.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this fragrance. It&#x27;s more a winter/evening smell, that stays longs on clothes.</li>
            <li> Love the smell....so do a lot of other people when I wear Lalique.</li>
            <li> It was a gift can say much. It smells good in her this is her third bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good! perfect :) good smell.</li>
            <li> So people are questioning the authenticity of this perfume. I&#x27;ve never purchased Lalique before however I can tell you this is wonderful. I think they are selling it at a deep discount because it&#x27;s nearing the end of its shelf life. Don&#x27;t let that stop you it&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;ve worn many perfumes a favorite of mine is Armani Code. If you like that you&#x27;ll LOVE this!!</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever I gave to my wife....she loves it and me too...when she wares it I am all over her...5 star is not enough to rate this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my moms birthday, we like high end perfumes.  She loved it and told me to buy some for myself, it&#x27;s very rich and  lovely. It is unique and lasts all day. I use it everyday and I will order more.</li>
            <li> WOW and WOW! First I did some background as I love the fragrance of Lalique by Lalique.  That&#x27;s the perfume with crescent moon shape top w. embellished florals and embossed floral down side Tall but slim bottle.  Confused as that is made in EDT and EDP.  Come to find out this is same fragrance by Lalique but difference is special cube shaped bottle.  There are no photos that prepares you for actual beauty of this one.  The sheer weight!  What a beautifully decor piece this will make when it&#x27;s delightful perfume is gone.  One can call this an &amp;#34;art-deco&amp;#34; decorative glass as oppose to aforementioned one listed above that fragrance is long gone by still looks beautifully romantic on my vanity tray.  You get, in my opinion, one of the highest quality, exquisite fragrance of any I&#x27;ve known beside a few others (won&#x27;t mention now) even on the EDT Lalique by Lalique.. Talk abt longevity Anyway! ....In addition:  to receiving it in such beautiful packaging (you won&#x27;t even want to discard the box) and in this bottle by Lalique is just incredulous!  I believed I checked twice to be sure there wasn&#x27;t an add. digit I missed before the price.  Truthfully, I didn&#x27;t even want to write a review for fear that they would disappear before I could grab another one.  Thought of as gift.  But knowing myself... I knew that I would never be able to part with it.  Anyway! Gotta share with my gals!  Only gift if it&#x27;s for mom.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed with the scent.  Will give it away.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle! ....a keepsake!..........wonderful scent would purchase again!........Amazon was on time despite it being the height of the Christmas season!</li>
            <li> Although I truly LOVE Lalique fragrances, this scent is not one of my favorites, but I did get a lot of compliments when I wore it.  So I am buying them as gifts for friends and family!</li>
