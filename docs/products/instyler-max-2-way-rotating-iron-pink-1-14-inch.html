            <li>my hair came out great!</li>
            <li>I guess I am just a bit too uncoordinated, but for doing flips on my ends, and giving my hair lift at the roots this is great!</li>

            <li>Good bye curling irons and fried hair!</li>
            <li>Great replacement for Revostyler that we cannot buy anymore.</li>
            <li>There are a ton of great reviews for this, what can I say?</li>

            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>This thing is wonderful, I have never done my hair so fast!</li>
            <li>I love my 2-way InStyler!  </li>
            <li>and it did not give me nice curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice straightener, but it honestly didn&#x27;t work any better than a $20 one in my opinion, plus with the bristles, it pulls a lot of my hair out.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly sturdy for being so light weight.</li>
            <li>This must be amazing for girls with medium to fine hair b</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my Instyler.</li>
            <li>I get better results with a curling iron</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair sooo silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love my InStyler.  </li>
            <li>it works like magic on hair ...</li>
            <li>This makes my hair look better than when I go to a salon.</li>
            <li>Love this iron.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this to straighten it, but I do use it to give some volume and to curl the ends and &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; the top.  </li>
            <li>Once my hair gets more bast my shoulders, I want to use it the curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased with the results that this product provided however after one use I noticed substantial wear on the outer heating element of the iron</li>
            <li>maybe it will work better for others.</li>
            <li>flat iron still work the best and gives you more smoother and shinier hair than this....</li>
            <li>I only bought this because my Rolling Styler broke (I dropped it to be more precise after over 3 years of doing an awesome job).</li>
            <li>but it did not....could not return it as threw the box and wanted to give a fair chance if it is really going to work</li>
            <li>styling flicks was never that easy</li>
            <li>It is really easy to burn yourself with this.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is so easy to burn yourself with this.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of all in one hair styling tool when i first saw its promotional video ...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth, shiny, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I had the original InStyler for a couple of years and then it broke, I was so upset.</li>
            <li>All in all its an extremely helpful device for women who wish to have beautifully styled hair in minutes....</li>
            <li>Received quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li>If I used hot rollers I was able to somewhat control my hair, but hot rollers were a bother sometimes.</li>
            <li>I always have to use hot rollers to get it smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li>I am very glad that i finally decided to buy it!</li>
            <li>It took my spiral curly hair and made it smooth and straight!</li>
            <li>Love the new 2-way rotating.</li>
            <li>but now when i actually used it im simply in love with it!</li>
            <li>When the original InStyler first came out my daughter saw the infomercial and bought two of them for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>I bought the InStyler back when it was new and just shown in infomercials lol.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t count how many people I&#x27;ve recommended this to lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reversible rotation for this one in particular has made the process THAT much easier!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be better off with a rusk flat iron that&#x27;s affordable and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Smooth, straight, shiny, and fewer tangles...</li>
            <li>I wish I was able to get some curl with the InStyler Max 2-way, so far all I have gotten is a bit of curve on the ends.</li>
            <li>Then my old one decided to stay off more than it stayed on</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I exchanged it for an identical iron and found that the new iron held up a bit better than the first</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I first started using the Instyler</li>
            <li>my hair was so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it would do.  </li>
            <li>If you look carefully, you will see that the comb is made out of plastic in the Rolling Styler, and it will actually comb you hair as it straightens it, making it so much more effective.</li>
            <li>Like the original one  this includes a comb to separate and section your hair for styling, but it also includes a heat mat to set the hot Instyler on, a heat guard, and a stay cool end tip for extra control.</li>
            <li>It saves so much time in the morning and makes my hair look like I spent much more time on it than I did!</li>
            <li>Hand hurts from gripping it so much, but it would happen with a regular one anyways.</li>
            <li>I love the pretty pink color too.</li>
            <li>So I finally bought a new one, and so far I am loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very very highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>used to be straight as a stick.</li>
            <li>My hair is just out of arms length now and too much hair for a roller to stay in anytime at all.</li>
            <li>, I expected a lot more out of it from the reviews and things</li>
            <li>but sometimes it falls straight</li>
            <li>but I still didn&#x27;t want to pay almost $100 (plus tax) for a hair straightener, I just don&#x27;t like spending that much on myself</li>
            <li>After using this my hair really does look and feel smoother and the frizz is gone.</li>
            <li>These Instylers work very well.</li>
            <li>After using this my hair really does look and feel smoother and the frizz is gone.</li>
            <li>These Instylers work very well.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>far right*</li>
            <li>The same day I ordered the new InStyler Max and I really like it, it works well for my hair, heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the pink!</li>
            <li>The improvements are the 2-way rotating, it&#x27;s much lighter, prettier colors, and somehow the new lightweight material it is made of does not get gunked up with hair products like gels, serums, and mousses.</li>
            <li>but with instyler its simple and quick .....</li>
            <li>Still takes a long time to curl, but better than the regular straight ones.  </li>
            <li>I believe that the price for this product is way too high for the lack of quality it has.</li>
            <li>Crossing my fingers that this one lives as long as my last one did! :)</li>
            <li>curls them flawlessly with least possible damage as other curling rods do.  </li>
            <li>I started looking at new InStylers and kept putting off buying one because of the price.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very curly hair and this is the only thing that works for me.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I have natural curly hair, but it isn&#x27;t the type of curl I want.  </li>
            <li>my old one</li>
            <li>Even though I was used to my old one, it&#x27;s still easier to style using this direction changing cylinder.</li>
            <li>I retired my old one (still working) after 6 years when I bought this.</li>
            <li>I used to have to windex collected product off my old one about once a month.</li>
            <li>I have quite a lot of hair, but it is sort of fine, yet it blows up and looks like a wild woman if I just allow it to dry naturally or air dry.</li>
            <li>I had to use my regular flat iron to do my hair right after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased and used many in-stylers over the years, I found the InStyler max-2 way iron burned and damaged my hair,I compared it to my others InStylers and noted the quality of this item was not of the others same items Ive purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>I tried regular flatirons and even though they straightened my hair they left the ends looking really</li>
            <li>i have not picked up a flat iron since I&#x27;ve discovered the instyler and the new max has made life in the mirror even easier.</li>

            <li> Returned it and will be going back to my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I still prefer for a flat iron or a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I still had to use my blow dryer and flat irons to get desired outcome.</li>
            <li> Crossing my fingers that this one lives as long as my last one did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used flat irons, blow dry, perm, coloring - nothing</li>
            <li> The only issue is I ordered pink and got a purple one and didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning or exchanging.</li>
            <li> its thick and long and when I want to go from curly to straight</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the wet2dry Instyler because I would rather straighten my hair when it was dry, so that feature wouldn&#x27;t be used, this one has the ability of changing the direction of the cylinder rotation.</li>
            <li> And my hair is not thick or hard to comb by any means.</li>

            <li> I tried this finally yesterday. I was a little worried that my hair was so long I would get it all tangled up in the rolling part. My hair is just at my waist and for some reason it has gotten a bit wavy in the back...used to be straight as a stick. I have quite a lot of hair, but it is sort of fine, yet it blows up and looks like a wild woman if I just allow it to dry naturally or air dry. I always have to use hot rollers to get it smooth and shinny. My hair is just out of arms length now and too much hair for a roller to stay in anytime at all. I wish I was able to get some curl with the InStyler Max 2-way, so far all I have gotten is a bit of curve on the ends. Smooth, straight, shiny, and fewer tangles...yep I like it. I would have given it 5 stars if I could have gotten curl.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice straightener, but it honestly didn&#x27;t work any better than a $20 one in my opinion, plus with the bristles, it pulls a lot of my hair out. I have weak hair though, so if your hair is tough it wont just pull it out.</li>
            <li> I had the original InStyler for a couple of years and then it broke, I was so upset. The same day I ordered the new InStyler Max and I really like it, it works well for my hair, heats up very quickly. It is part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my Instyler. The best curling device out there ladies.</li>
            <li> Not impressed...I get better results with a curling iron</li>
            <li> Got it as a birthdsy gift for my neice. She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase in InStyler for some time now. I am very glad that i finally decided to buy it! I have slightly thick, long hair. It leaves my hair sooo silky smooth! It cuts down on time as well. I can run it through my hair and head off to work quicker. I love it. you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I love my InStyler.  It saves so much time in the morning and makes my hair look like I spent much more time on it than I did!</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of all in one hair styling tool when i first saw its promotional video ... but now when i actually used it im simply in love with it! it works like magic on hair ... curls them flawlessly with least possible damage as other curling rods do.  styling flicks was never that easy but with instyler its simple and quick ..... All in all its an extremely helpful device for women who wish to have beautifully styled hair in minutes....</li>
            <li> If you have thick kinky hair don&#x27;t waste your money. This thing was useless. My hand hurt so bad after trying this product. I had to use my regular flat iron to do my hair right after. This must be amazing for girls with medium to fine hair b</li>
            <li> My in styler is already broken! Has been for two weeks and just gave it to my daughter April 30th so I&#x27;d say it defiantly did not meet any expectations!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. I still prefer for a flat iron or a curling iron.</li>
            <li> not using it anymore....flat iron still work the best and gives you more smoother and shinier hair than this.... i thought it will be faster and easier to straighten my hair using this or to give some wavy style but it did not....could not return it as threw the box and wanted to give a fair chance if it is really going to work but its been 4 months now could not really convince myself...</li>
            <li> I bought the InStyler back when it was new and just shown in infomercials lol. I have never looked back! This makes my hair look better than when I go to a salon. I have a lot of very curly hair and this is the only thing that works for me. It leaves my hair silky smooth, shiny, and bouncy. AND it doesn&#x27;t fry my ends!!!!! I am always getting compliments and people always ask &amp;#34;How do you get your hair so bouncy and shiny?&amp;#34;. I can&#x27;t count how many people I&#x27;ve recommended this to lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reversible rotation for this one in particular has made the process THAT much easier! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair. I have curly hair.  its thick and long and when I want to go from curly to straight it&#x27;s an extensive process. The rotating brush kept getting caught in my hair pulling and tangling my hair. I could only use small areas at a time. I still had to use my blow dryer and flat irons to get desired outcome.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that will curl my hair. Love the pink!</li>
            <li> Not the worst but not the best, I expected a lot more out of it from the reviews and things YouTubers said but it just was not for me. I have wavy n a tad bit curly Indian hair but sometimes it falls straight and I was hoping for a volume but sleek look and this gives the same results as blow drying with a round brush. I would still recommend this and tell you to give it a try, everyone&#x27;s hair is different and you might like the look you get from it</li>
            <li> Works geeat!  Received quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for Revostyler that we cannot buy anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this iron. I use it on frizzy curly afro hair, too and it smooths it unlike anything else. Very very highly recommend this. I have thin hair and this is healthy on it and curls well!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it, but it is a total waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> i love this product. i have not picked up a flat iron since I&#x27;ve discovered the instyler and the new max has made life in the mirror even easier.</li>
            <li> Burned my hair. Also didn&#x27;t like the results either.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get mine off Amazon, but I LOVE IT!!!  I have naturally curly hair.  I don&#x27;t use this to straighten it, but I do use it to give some volume and to curl the ends and &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; the top.  It can be a little tricky to use, but you will get the hang of it.  Be careful though.  It is really easy to burn yourself with this.  Once my hair gets more bast my shoulders, I want to use it the curl my hair.  Yes, I have natural curly hair, but it isn&#x27;t the type of curl I want.  I am hoping this will help me get the type of curls, like the picture above, that I want.</li>
            <li> When the original InStyler first came out my daughter saw the infomercial and bought two of them for Christmas gifts. One of them went to me and I loved it! I have very thick, curly, wavy, and frizzy hair. If I used hot rollers I was able to somewhat control my hair, but hot rollers were a bother sometimes. I tried regular flatirons and even though they straightened my hair they left the ends looking really ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using the Instyler my hair came out great! No more ugly ends and my hair was so soft and smooth I could brush through my hair with my fingers without pulling! After using it for years it finally started to break,...I would be pulling it through my hair and I would hear a clicking noise and then it would turn off.  I started looking at new InStylers and kept putting off buying one because of the price. I checked around and they were all around the same price but I still didn&#x27;t want to pay almost $100 (plus tax) for a hair straightener, I just don&#x27;t like spending that much on myself, it makes me feel guilty. Then my old one decided to stay off more than it stayed on and I spent 3 days with very ugly hair. So I finally bought a new one, and so far I am loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like my old one it straightens my hair very nicely. I love the pretty pink color too. I didn&#x27;t want the wet2dry Instyler because I would rather straighten my hair when it was dry, so that feature wouldn&#x27;t be used, this one has the ability of changing the direction of the cylinder rotation. Even though I was used to my old one, it&#x27;s still easier to style using this direction changing cylinder. Like the original one  this includes a comb to separate and section your hair for styling, but it also includes a heat mat to set the hot Instyler on, a heat guard, and a stay cool end tip for extra control. I like the extras!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have used mine for years I never learned how to make curls like they show on the videos. I guess I am just a bit too uncoordinated, but for doing flips on my ends, and giving my hair lift at the roots this is great! After using this my hair really does look and feel smoother and the frizz is gone. These Instylers work very well. Crossing my fingers that this one lives as long as my last one did! :)on my ends, and giving my hair lift at the roots this is great!

            <li> I was extremely pleased with the results that this product provided however after one use I noticed substantial wear on the outer heating element of the iron (see photo attached, worn areas are the white spots towards the base of the plate *far right* as well parallel to the upper brush).  I exchanged it for an identical iron and found that the new iron held up a bit better than the first but unfortunately there were still signs of wear after only one use.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It took my spiral curly hair and made it smooth and straight! I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it!</li>
            <li> Did. Not like it, it doesn&#x27;t roll the entire hair. On the roller and it did not give me nice curls.</li>
            <li> After one use the bristles were destroyed. It&#x27;s too hard to tell what way the barrel is rolling and sometimes switches without you knowing. I have very curly hair and this made it a frizzy mess and it was IMPOSSIBLE to straighten my roots. Returned it and will be going back to my flat iron. Also, it is so easy to burn yourself with this. I did three times.</li>
            <li> If you want split ends, this product is for you!  I used it every 3 days for about a month.  The split ends I have now are horrible.  I&#x27;ve used flat irons, blow dry, perm, coloring - nothing has ever compared to this level of hair damage.  I even felt guilty putting it in my donate pile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and used many in-stylers over the years, I found the InStyler max-2 way iron burned and damaged my hair,I compared it to my others InStylers and noted the quality of this item was not of the others same items Ive purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair gets caught in the roller part.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of great reviews for this, what can I say? This thing is wonderful, I have never done my hair so fast! Good bye curling irons and fried hair! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love my 2-way InStyler!  I started out with the original InStyler one-way rotating barrel and was continually frustrated.  It would have worked great had I wanted to have my hair flip up on one side and turn under on the other.  With the one-way rotating barrel, trying to maneuver the InStyler around without burning myself was almost impossible.  I returned it and purchased the 2-way rotating barrel - what a world of difference!  Now with 2 clicks of the handle, the barrel rotates in the other direction.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron 3/4&amp;#34; for short hair&lt;br /&gt;InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron 1-1/4&amp;#34; for shoulder length or longer hair</li>
            <li> Love this!! Best purchase!!! My hair is so frizzy and this product takes that away....and it stays away!!! Very happy!!!</li>
            <li> The product is awesome.  It does exactly what it says it would do.  The only issue is I ordered pink and got a purple one and didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning or exchanging.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised. Still takes a long time to curl, but better than the regular straight ones.  Hand hurts from gripping it so much, but it would happen with a regular one anyways.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly sturdy for being so light weight. Love the new 2-way rotating. I retired my old one (still working) after 6 years when I bought this. The improvements are the 2-way rotating, it&#x27;s much lighter, prettier colors, and somehow the new lightweight material it is made of does not get gunked up with hair products like gels, serums, and mousses. I used to have to windex collected product off my old one about once a month. Very pleased with this and I use it every day on my waist length hair.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because my Rolling Styler broke (I dropped it to be more precise after over 3 years of doing an awesome job). If you look carefully, you will see that the comb is made out of plastic in the Rolling Styler, and it will actually comb you hair as it straightens it, making it so much more effective. The comb is soft and absolutely worthless, it&#x27;s almost equal to some average ceramic plates. And my hair is not thick or hard to comb by any means. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product at all. It didn&#x27;t work well for My type of hair maybe it will work better for others. I believe that the price for this product is way too high for the lack of quality it has. I&#x27;ll be better off with a rusk flat iron that&#x27;s affordable and easy to manage.</li>
