    <ol>
            <li>the best non-adhesive silk wrap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>They work great!  </li>
            <li>This silk is a great deal and the perfect material to mend cracked nails.</li>
            <li>and they worked great</li>
            <li>Great product, plenty of silk, good quality.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so delighted to find a resource for silk wrap.  </li>
            <li>You can also lightly file it off your nail on the edges, and it still does wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It does what its supposed to do, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It does what it claims and it is almost as good as the type that is formed in the shape of nails.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Product arrived nicely packaged and there is a lot of silk in there</li>
            <li>It did the trick rather nicely, paired with IBD 5-Second Brush-On Gel Resin.</li>
            <li>This allowed me to save my nails and after a week they are still holding strong!</li>
            <li>great product fast delivery.thanx</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my nails, and sometimes looks of disbelief when I tell someone they are my own...not acrylic or paste-on.  </li>
            <li>Lots of material, will probably never have to buy more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect from this product.</li>
            <li>takes a bit more time and concentration but much better result.</li>
            <li>Really good for patching real fingernails that are cracked</li>
            <li>but it feels silky smooth</li>
            <li>I like this better than the precut because I can cut the exact size I need to repair my nail without wasting any material.  </li>
            <li>so I was super excited when I saw it on amazon.</li>
            <li>I thought I was purchasing the silk wrap in the green package,  but this works just as good and arrived quickly, Thank you!</li>
            <li>You can then do a wrap over the whole nail or not, depending on your taste, and buff smooth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Excellent to patch your broken nails.</li>
            <li>described,&lt;br /&gt;the wrap is of good quality and it was carefully packed,&lt;br</li>
            <li>The key to getting the silk to adhere to your nail is to use the right kind of glue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had long nails for some 30 years, and they are my own.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered...</li>
            <li>There was a lot of product, a lot, so I know it will last a really long time, and that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Hahahahaha...</li>
            <li>Works great to repair a broken nail</li>
            <li>very please with this will buy again when i run out.</li>
            <li>You get alot for your money and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy it again but it will take me awhile to use all of this.</li>
            <li>Second Nail Glue Professional]], and not Nail Wrap or any other kind of glue.</li>
            <li>I can cut this silk to fit my entire nail instead of using several of the tabs.</li>
            <li>I did find it a little challenging to work with, but not enough to not want to use it again.</li>
            <li>After using this product I developed a nail fungus.</li>
            <li>I use a dot of glue near the cuticle to hold it in place--once the silk touches the glue, it sticks immediately--</li>
            <li>I have used this both in small strips and as full patches to cover and repair torn natural nails.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve had to clip them to a &#x27;workable&#x27; size, and I&#x27;ve used silk wrap for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>It seals the silk on your nail instantly, no slipping,</li>
            <li>This is my first time using plain silk wrap</li>
            <li>My natural nails are very long, and I have been silk wrapping them for almost 18 years.</li>

            <li> This is my first time using plain silk wrap</li>
            <li> My natural nails are very long, and I have been silk wrapping them for almost 18 years.</li>
            <li> The amount provided will last a long time.</li>
            <li> then I cover the entire nail silk/nail with glue and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> but on one of the strips it has been cut and sewed together on a diagonal which means you cannot use that whole area (about 3 inches long), at least not the way I apply my silk.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally long nails and can&#x27;t stand when one breaks, there is hope!</li>
            <li> I waited up to 10 minutes and it was still slipping and sliding all over the nail..</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful or it&#x27;ll come off the nail</li>
            <li> I tried the tabs, but they are too much trouble due to the length of my nails.</li>
            <li> both when I was little, and now.  </li>
            <li> Just plain silk fabric, and you don&#x27;t need alot to pop on your nail to strengthen it, protect it.  </li>
            <li> Cut small piece a bit longer than the tear, and glue over it.</li>
            <li> I have used silk wrap in the past, but none that performed as well as these.  </li>
            <li> &quot; but it&#x27;s hard to find the silk strips like these.</li>
            <li> product is hard to use</li>
            <li> It is impossible for the glue to dry on the silk.  </li>
            <li> I also use crazy glue to keep it down.  </li>
            <li> This silk wrap has been very hard for me to find</li>
            <li> Thin sheets that you have to cut and shape</li>
            <li> I purchased this to silk wrap a broken nail.</li>
            <li> This was disappointing, but the rest of the silk is usable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of using silk on nails and it&#x27;s annoying to cut the fabric and glue it on and then file it off.</li>
            <li> pre cut tabs are horrible and if you have even the slightest amount of creativity/craftiness you should be buying this product and cutting it out yourself.</li>

            <li> great product fast delivery.thanx</li>
            <li> After using this product I developed a nail fungus. I have been doing my nails for years with acrylic never had this problem until I switched.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered...the best non-adhesive silk wrap. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My natural nails are very long, and I have been silk wrapping them for almost 18 years. I found it to be healthier for my nails than acrylic. I tried the tabs, but they are too much trouble due to the length of my nails. I can cut this silk to fit my entire nail instead of using several of the tabs. The key to getting the silk to adhere to your nail is to use the right kind of glue. I ONLY use [[ASIN:B000PO1NSY IBD-5 Second Nail Glue Professional]], and not Nail Wrap or any other kind of glue. It seals the silk on your nail instantly, no slipping,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long nails for some 30 years, and they are my own.  I attribute it to drinking LOTS of milk both when I was little, and now.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my nails, and sometimes looks of disbelief when I tell someone they are my own...not acrylic or paste-on.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve had to clip them to a &#x27;workable&#x27; size, and I&#x27;ve used silk wrap for as long as I can remember.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so delighted to find a resource for silk wrap.  Just plain silk fabric, and you don&#x27;t need alot to pop on your nail to strengthen it, protect it.  I also use crazy glue to keep it down.  You can also lightly file it off your nail on the edges, and it still does wonderfully.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product!  Hahahahaha...the name on this review is my Dad, but I&#x27;m his daughter.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally long nails and can&#x27;t stand when one breaks, there is hope! This silk is a great deal and the perfect material to mend cracked nails.</li>
            <li> It is impossible for the glue to dry on the silk.  I waited up to 10 minutes and it was still slipping and sliding all over the nail.. I gave up</li>
            <li> This silk wrap has been very hard for me to find so I was super excited when I saw it on amazon. It seems everyone has the pre-cut \\&quot;stickers\\&quot; but it&#x27;s hard to find the silk strips like these. Product arrived nicely packaged and there is a lot of silk in there but on one of the strips it has been cut and sewed together on a diagonal which means you cannot use that whole area (about 3 inches long), at least not the way I apply my silk. This was disappointing, but the rest of the silk is usable.</li>
            <li> Just what MOM was looking for!</li>
            <li> Really good for patching real fingernails that are cracked</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.Thin sheets that you have to cut and shape</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing the silk wrap in the green package,  but this works just as good and arrived quickly, Thank you!</li>
            <li> It does what it claims to do to help repair splits or cracks in nails. I like this better than the precut because I can cut the exact size I need to repair my nail without wasting any material.  The amount provided will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used this both in small strips and as full patches to cover and repair torn natural nails.  They work great!  I use them with the All Season Light-Less Gel and Cure.  I can salvage nails that have torn over halfway across and give them a chance to grow out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of using silk on nails and it&#x27;s annoying to cut the fabric and glue it on and then file it off. You need to be careful or it&#x27;ll come off the nail but it feels silky smooth and it was required for my class</li>
            <li> I used this to repair two nails I broke in the same evening. Cut small piece a bit longer than the tear, and glue over it. You can then do a wrap over the whole nail or not, depending on your taste, and buff smooth. This allowed me to save my nails and after a week they are still holding strong!</li>
            <li> Lots of material, will probably never have to buy more.  Works great to repair a broken nail</li>
            <li> I purchased this to silk wrap a broken nail. It did the trick rather nicely, paired with IBD 5-Second Brush-On Gel Resin.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using plain silk wrap and I love it!  I started using the self adhesive silk tabs to fix cracks and they worked great so I wrapped all my nails but I had to keep buying them. So I upgraded to this. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Yes it takes longer to do my nails now but it&#x27;s so totally worth it. I wrap my nails every week or so and there&#x27;s still so much of it left! I will not buy anything else, EVER!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect from this product. It does what its supposed to do, so that&#x27;s good. I did find it a little challenging to work with, but not enough to not want to use it again. There was a lot of product, a lot, so I know it will last a really long time, and that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Great product, plenty of silk, good quality. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent to patch your broken nails. When you break your nails you don&#x27;t need to cut it simply repear it!</li>
            <li> Did what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> product is hard to use</li>
            <li> pre cut tabs are horrible and if you have even the slightest amount of creativity/craftiness you should be buying this product and cutting it out yourself. takes a bit more time and concentration but much better result. very please with this will buy again when i run out.</li>
            <li> it is simply as it is described,&lt;br /&gt;the wrap is of good quality and it was carefully packed,&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely recommend it to others</li>
            <li> I have used silk wrap in the past, but none that performed as well as these.  If applied correctly, they hold tight--over 5 weeks in my case. I like this product because it&#x27;s customizable--it can be cut to any size that is required.  I use a dot of glue near the cuticle to hold it in place--once the silk touches the glue, it sticks immediately--then I cover the entire nail silk/nail with glue and let it dry.  I then apply an instant gel application to finish the manicure.  I have enough product to last for months.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but you have to cut the pieces correctly.  It does what it claims and it is almost as good as the type that is formed in the shape of nails.  Thank goodness we have availability of such products!</li>
            <li> You get alot for your money and it works really well. I am very pleased. I would absolutely buy it again but it will take me awhile to use all of this.</li>
