            <li>I really liked this brush.</li>
            <li>Very strong product and did not work well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more effective for me than the Clarisonic that I had which just vibrated</li>

            <li>For the price it wuz an okay</li>
            <li>after using this I start having more pimples then before</li>
            <li>Be sure to change the batteries often.</li>
            <li>I love the spinning brush.</li>
            <li>It most defiantly cleans my face better than just using my hands.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 17yr old daughter and the result is great.</li>
            <li>I suspect that cleanser was too strong for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I received the item just fine</li>
            <li>Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t even properly fit in the box</li>
            <li>I use the Acne Free Severe formula, but will try the one that came with this brush when that runs out.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>Out of paranoia, I decided to buy a cheap cleansing brush to get the satisfaction of clean skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li>The price was good, and since we have not spent the $ for Proactive yet, I can not compare the two.  </li>
            <li>It was not the original content AT ALL.</li>
            <li>(it works well but is NOT waterproof, like the original is).</li>
            <li>The lotion was NOT the original one.</li>
            <li>My face felt so clean afterwards, I didn&#x27;t think it would work so well</li>
            <li>great product, not as rough as people say .</li>
            <li>Overall, this product doesn&#x27;t deserve a 1 star since it has a nice, clean design</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been breaking out recently and read an article how our own hands could spread bacteria and clog holes in our skin.</li>
            <li>So far I love this product it has cleared my face in one week</li>
            <li>Actually I love this brush, it rotates and is quite soft.  </li>
            <li>No biggie, right?</li>
            <li>Box got pretty f-up during shipment but the producy was golden</li>
            <li>After this very first night of use my skin was looking better by the next morning.</li>
            <li>Might work better on someone else, since every body and skin type is different.  </li>
            <li>The anticipation for this product was better than the actual product...</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Really?!</li>
            <li>First time using the acne brush</li>
            <li>Within 2 days it was 80% clear and after 4 days was almost blemish free.</li>
            <li>it took a few uses to get use to i really like its efficiency it clean quite well especially for the price i highly and greatly recommend.</li>
            <li>little face cleaner and cleansing lotion works like magic!</li>
            <li>and I need to wipe them off often to prevent them from completely rusting over and this may contribute to why  the buttons broke so quickly.</li>
            <li>if that.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely spend a little bit more money for a better brush.</li>
            <li>This really disappoints me.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even the real brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the real brush before</li>
            <li>Wanting to avoid the hi cost of a Clarisonic face brush I found AcneFree&#x27;s Advanced Deep  Cleansing Duo.  </li>
            <li>The battery compartment&#x27;s much easier to open/close too.</li>
            <li>The Acne Free Severe is the only thing that worked.</li>
            <li>The brush works very well.</li>
            <li>I think he just wasn&#x27;t cleaning his skin very well.  </li>
            <li>This brush really helped....</li>
            <li>I now have pretty much no acne at all because I use this every night and cannot live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and the instructions were pretty clear.</li>
            <li>The briscles are soft and seem to wash pretty well.</li>
            <li>The AcneFree brush head whirls in a circle but is easily stopped unless you carefully hold the brush head against your skin.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this pairing was for the brush.</li>
            <li>I got it for the brush mainly but decided to give the cleaning product a try.</li>
            <li>and I felt took too long to clean.  </li>
            <li>If it starts to get weak just change them out and good as new.</li>
            <li>I thought the battery compartment was easy to open and you can press firmly with the brush to get a deep clean.</li>
            <li>Well after using the wipes and this brush you can certainly see just how much makeup is left inside your pores because the brush brings it all out onto the white bristles!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking to clear up there acne.</li>
            <li>I use it for my Ambi Even &amp; Clear Foaming Cleanser.</li>
            <li>The accompanying oil-free purifying cleanser with &amp;#34;micro-benzoyl peroxide&amp;#34; did a great job cleaning my face, but the following day I noticed a myriad of tiny bumps &amp; patchy redness that made my skin look WORSE.  </li>
            <li>I developed cystic acne after a gum infection.</li>
            <li>I left the brush perfectly clean and dry for the next use).</li>
            <li>I think it is a good alternative if you extra careful not to get it too wet and only wet the bristle part.</li>
            <li>used to always use baby wipes to remove my makeup until I thought my skin was clean as the wipes had no more residue on them.</li>
            <li>I am going to start using it every other day switching between the high and low setting and see how that works.</li>
            <li>The two speed settings seem pretty distant since one is too soft while the other is too rough; I would use the &amp;#34;if</li>

            <li> Only time will tell how long it will last for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING to get my skin clear, Accutane,  retin A, tea tree soaps and oils, antibiotics, sulfur soap, black soap, scrubs, masks, peels, ointments etc.</li>
            <li> And I only try to wet the brush head, not the entire unit.</li>
            <li> Also, although it says it is waterproof I would not suggest bringing it in the shower or submerging it in water too long, if at all.</li>
            <li> It has two settings slow and fast.</li>
            <li> I thought it had the faster speed left, but the brush had stopped functioning when I pressed the other speed.</li>
            <li> Helped dry out my pimples in just 2days...</li>
            <li> Overall I found the whirling brush motion pretty weak, &amp; there were no included directions for using the little machine.  </li>
            <li> But careful it does dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I can use mine for about a month and 1/2 before I need to change the batteries because it starts to slow down a bit and not spin as fast.</li>
            <li> However after only using it for little over two weeks the on/off button no longer works correctly.</li>
            <li> In few days, BIG CHANGE in my face appearance......</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be used in the shower because it can&#x27;t get wet!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after 3 weeks, the on and off button no longer works, it was touch and go after the first week.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting into a routine with acne washes, but with this, you only wash for 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> So the verdict: it is a cheaper alternative to those the more expensive spin brushes however the longevity of the brush is questionable.</li>
            <li> Sad it eats so many batteries but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I used it almost 3 days in a row which made my face a little tender.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the batteries inside of it get rusted a little bit</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t return it as I left the country but recommend to go buy it at the store to not have a bad surprised!</li>
            <li> Have had to replace the heads a few times, you can buy them off Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I turned on the brush, the settings seemed a little slower than usual.</li>
            <li> My face was so broken out</li>
            <li> I put the brush away, and i angrily washed my face with my hands.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s another hint that it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> For me the unit&#x27;s battery compartment was nearly IMPOSSIBLE to access, &amp; after sounding like a sailor on shore leave</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The price was good, and since we have not spent the $ for Proactive yet, I can not compare the two.  We bought this for our daughter (teenager) since they advertise to be as good as Proactive.  This product has not done anything for her.  She has been faithfully using the product daily for almost 2 months now and has shown no difference.  Might work better on someone else, since every body and skin type is different.  Fast delivery and excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> The anticipation for this product was better than the actual product... I&#x27;ve been breaking out recently and read an article how our own hands could spread bacteria and clog holes in our skin. Out of paranoia, I decided to buy a cheap cleansing brush to get the satisfaction of clean skin. I also said &amp;#34;what the heck, why not get the kit&amp;#34; with the brush I had planned on getting. Both products have their issues, but I will be discussing the brush. I received the item just fine and the instructions were pretty clear. The briscles are soft and seem to wash pretty well. The two speed settings seem pretty distant since one is too soft while the other is too rough; I would use the &amp;#34;if it stings, it&#x27;s working&amp;#34; rule for my cleansing.  After a week of the brush and kit, the only changes I saw were dryer skin (note: I have oily skin). I decided to keep the routine for the rest of the month until I noticed my acne worsening. I decided to end the use of the brush for a week to see if the kit was the culprit of my breakout. After a week, my skin had no changes and I decided to return to my brush routine (note: I left the brush perfectly clean and dry for the next use). Unfortunately, when I turned on the brush, the settings seemed a little slower than usual. No biggie, right? I thought it had the faster speed left, but the brush had stopped functioning when I pressed the other speed. I changed the batteries and it would not give me the faster speed. I put the brush away, and i angrily washed my face with my hands. Overall, this product doesn&#x27;t deserve a 1 star since it has a nice, clean design but it stopped functioning in a week or two. I would NOT buy any products from this company again, but this experience could vary depending on the person. I hope the company takes time to read my rant, and decides to deal with their product...</li>
            <li> Great brush it took a few uses to get use to i really like its efficiency it clean quite well especially for the price i highly and greatly recommend.</li>
            <li> Got for my son who was battling acne.  Very strong product and did not work well.</li>
            <li> I used it almost 3 days in a row which made my face a little tender. I am going to start using it every other day switching between the high and low setting and see how that works.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiancee for xmas and she absolutely loves it! Box got pretty f-up during shipment but the producy was golden</li>
            <li> This really disappoints me. The main reason I bought this pairing was for the brush. Well stopped working about a week after my purchase arrived.  The cleanser is good but I&#x27;m sure would work better with its partner scrubber.</li>
            <li> I really liked this brush. It has two settings slow and fast. My skin feels well exfoliated after each use. However after only using it for little over two weeks the on/off button no longer works correctly. It turns on for no reason and I cannot turn it off. I have to take the cover off/on to turn it on or off. Also, although it says it is waterproof I would not suggest bringing it in the shower or submerging it in water too long, if at all. I noticed that the batteries inside of it get rusted a little bit and I need to wipe them off often to prevent them from completely rusting over and this may contribute to why  the buttons broke so quickly. So the verdict: it is a cheaper alternative to those the more expensive spin brushes however the longevity of the brush is questionable. I think it is a good alternative if you extra careful not to get it too wet and only wet the bristle part.</li>
            <li> This produce is awesome HOWEVER do NOT order it on amazon!!! It was not the original content AT ALL. I received a cheaper version of the brush (it works well but is NOT waterproof, like the original is). The lotion was NOT the original one. The expiration date and lot number don&#x27;t match  AND the lotion expires NEXT MONTH instead of next year like it is written on the box. Couldn&#x27;t return it as I left the country but recommend to go buy it at the store to not have a bad surprised!</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be used in the shower because it can&#x27;t get wet! Really?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this it is clearing up me acne and acne marks day by day!! So happy with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Great product for price.. Helped dry out my pimples in just 2days... But careful it does dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking to clear up there acne. First time using the acne brush and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even the real brush. It&#x27;s some knockoff. I&#x27;ve had the real brush before and it&#x27;s orange like the picture on the box. Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t even properly fit in the box so there&#x27;s another hint that it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> The machine does not wash my face well at all.</li>
            <li> I love it. Dries the pimples up. Will need to moisturizer afterwards or don&#x27;t go outside. I got it for the brush mainly but decided to give the cleaning product a try. And I like how it doesn&#x27;t foam up and splatter in my eye. If you have acne and need a fix. This will do it.</li>
            <li> great product, not as rough as people say . works great for me</li>
            <li> I love the cleanser brush, helps me cleanse deeper</li>
            <li> So far I love this product it has cleared my face in one week no lie</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than the Clarisonic but I think this is great for traveling so you don&#x27;t have to take the clarisonic and its charger on vacation with you.</li>
            <li> Wanting to avoid the hi cost of a Clarisonic face brush I found AcneFree&#x27;s Advanced Deep  Cleansing Duo.  I don&#x27;t have acne but wanted the facial brush.  For me the unit&#x27;s battery compartment was nearly IMPOSSIBLE to access, &amp; after sounding like a sailor on shore leave I finally installed the provided AA batteries.  The AcneFree brush head whirls in a circle but is easily stopped unless you carefully hold the brush head against your skin.  The accompanying oil-free purifying cleanser with &amp;#34;micro-benzoyl peroxide&amp;#34; did a great job cleaning my face, but the following day I noticed a myriad of tiny bumps &amp; patchy redness that made my skin look WORSE.  I suspect that cleanser was too strong for my skin.  Overall I found the whirling brush motion pretty weak, &amp; there were no included directions for using the little machine.  For the price it wuz an okay machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the Burlway skin brush system with 4 different detachable heads, including 2 different skin brushes, and that unit is of the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type that vibrates.  I prefer using the Burlway, the results are great with a simple cleansing lotion, &amp; it came with a nifty base to park the brush in when not in use.  The battery compartment&#x27;s much easier to open/close too.</li>
            <li> I love this system! I have a hard time getting into a routine with acne washes, but with this, you only wash for 60 seconds. It&#x27;s quick and perfect for me! And I definitely have noticed a reduction in the acne on my chin. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING to get my skin clear, Accutane,  retin A, tea tree soaps and oils, antibiotics, sulfur soap, black soap, scrubs, masks, peels, ointments etc. Nothing worked and one day I happened across this in Walmart. I was thinking of buying a Clairsonic and this entire set was around $13.00 (a lot cheaper than a Clairsonic) so I thought why not give it a try. Best decision I have EVER made hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little face cleaner and cleansing lotion works like magic! My face was so broken out I was actually embarrassed to leave the house at times. After this very first night of use my skin was looking better by the next morning. Within 2 days it was 80% clear and after 4 days was almost blemish free. I now have pretty much no acne at all because I use this every night and cannot live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to always use baby wipes to remove my makeup until I thought my skin was clean as the wipes had no more residue on them. Well after using the wipes and this brush you can certainly see just how much makeup is left inside your pores because the brush brings it all out onto the white bristles! Nothing works as good as this and like I said I&#x27;ve tried everything...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush spins and has 2 speeds. I can use mine for about a month and 1/2 before I need to change the batteries because it starts to slow down a bit and not spin as fast. This exfoliates your skin as well as helping with acne so it&#x27;s a win win product. Trust me, if you have problem skin get this it will change your life!</li>
            <li> In few days, BIG CHANGE in my face appearance...... Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the brush, not the cleanser. I use the Acne Free Severe formula, but will try the one that came with this brush when that runs out. The brush is great! I developed cystic acne after a gum infection. The Acne Free Severe is the only thing that worked. I wanted to try the brush after seeing it in store. I ordered it on Amazon because I had a gift card. The brush works very well. My face feels so clean and smooth after I use it. I thought the battery compartment was easy to open and you can press firmly with the brush to get a deep clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 17yr old daughter and the result is great. So I got one for myself and for a good friend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.... after using this I start having more pimples then before</li>
            <li> Broke in about three weeks ..if that.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely spend a little bit more money for a better brush.</li>
            <li> Have had to replace the heads a few times, you can buy them off Amazon as well. Be sure to change the batteries often. If it starts to get weak just change them out and good as new. Sad it eats so many batteries but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine at Walmart. The price was $13.98, or something like that. I have only used it two or three times. So far so good. I love the spinning brush. It most defiantly cleans my face better than just using my hands. That was the only reason I bought it. I use it for my Ambi Even &amp; Clear Foaming Cleanser. I don&#x27;t use it in the shower. And I only try to wet the brush head, not the entire unit. I hope by doing it that way it will help prolong it. Only time will tell how long it will last for me. So for now it gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My face felt so clean afterwards, I didn&#x27;t think it would work so well but it does</li>
            <li> Actually I love this brush, it rotates and is quite soft.  It&#x27;s more effective for me than the Clarisonic that I had which just vibrated and I felt took too long to clean.  Unfortunately after 3 weeks, the on and off button no longer works, it was touch and go after the first week. Now its no go.  So I&#x27;m concerned about the quality. The cleanser is awesome and even more effective with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son also uses it, he was getting a lot of zits, we were using another brand of cream with benzyl peroxide, we tried a gel with salicylic acid, we even used tazorac occasionally.  All of them kept his condition manageable....but this system cleared it up.  I think he just wasn&#x27;t cleaning his skin very well.  This brush really helped....when it works.  I&#x27;m going to try and contact the company.  Anyone else have an issue with durability?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;durability, 1 star&lt;br /&gt;effectiveness, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;cleanser, 5 stars</li>
