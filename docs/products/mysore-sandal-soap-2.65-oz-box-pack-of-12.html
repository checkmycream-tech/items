            <li>I would have liked for the scent to be stronger, but it is acceptable.</li>
            <li>It is mild, creamy with a strong yet wonderfully mellow scent.</li>

            <li>fast delivey, great deal, good stuff</li>
            <li>this is by far the best soap i have ever used.  </li>

            <li>If you have used Mysore Sandal products and have liked the smell, you will love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Thank you to this soaps maker for continuing to make this one of a kind product that so many of us love.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally like strong scents, but this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>I am a mechanic, and this will easily get out any kind of grime and motor oil that&#x27;s on my skin way better than anything I can get from the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I love sandlewood soap and have gotten it from L&#x27;Occitane.  </li>

            <li>I recommend this soap to many of my friends</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this when i run out.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love the smell of sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I Love this soap.</li>
            <li>They use real sandalwood oil in this product and it smells great after a shower and the smell lingers on your body and bathroom for hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal and a great price for the states.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of sandal wood soap and this product has a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>- what more could you want.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy and love using it</li>
            <li>As a kid I would run the beads under the tapwater to bring out the smell, LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus</li>
            <li>I love the sandalwood scent.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Its OK, this brand seems like it has detergent in it unlike the one by Chandrika.</li>
            <li>It also fills your bathroom with the aroma of Sandalwood and leaves your skin very richly scented.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling soap, lasts well in the shower, makes lather &amp; gets you clean</li>
            <li>Divine smell, fairly long-lasting, great lather and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li>Mysore Sandal soap is, quite simply, the best soap available on the market today.  </li>
            <li>This soap lathers quite good, but the smell is intense.  </li>
            <li>a rich, wonderfully scented (not overbearing) lather that does not leave a residue and also seems to condition my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly neatly packed.</li>
            <li>I prefer the clean scent of Mysore, so that&#x27;s what I buy most often.  </li>
            <li>may be strong  scent in the shower</li>
            <li>I think my skin feels smooth, clean, and lightly scented like it should be!  </li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>It has quickly become my favorite.</li>
            <li>They really seem to love it!</li>
            <li>When you open the package it smells really strong and like nagchampa, but once in a lather and on your skin it smells great and like sandalwood.</li>
            <li>washing with this soap, I apply some pure rose oil (also purchased there), and I&#x27;m in a state of aroma bliss all day.</li>
            <li>I am a huge sandlewood fan and this soap does not dissapoint.</li>
            <li>I rarely make online purchases and this one will make me ever more cautious.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent of sandalwood, so, after doing some research, I decided to try the Mysore Sandal Soap.  </li>
            <li>The skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>not because I&#x27;m cheap</li>
            <li>Has lanolin so not cruelty free for vegetarians.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a plus for us because my husband likes to take it to the gym in a soap box and this bar will fit in the box.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was on time, packaging was secure item was sold just as posted.</li>
            <li>, most were very positive so this soap was on my radar.  </li>
            <li>Mild and good for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike another great smelling soap I like (Chandrika), this one is much more moisturizing, or rather, less de-moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Its fragrance and the way it feels is unique, no US made soap comes close.  </li>
            <li>Not too overpowering, and leaves you feeling and smelling clean.  </li>
            <li>It has a great scent but even nicer is the dry itchy skin syndrome that winter brings about</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you&#x27;re certain this is what you want, it might be better to buy one bar instead of 12.</li>
            <li>It gets you clean, makes your skin soft, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell not heavy .</li>
            <li>Really wants not to love..</li>
            <li>Ridiculously cheap to do such magic : )</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smell like true Sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>I get told daily by strangers that I smell good.</li>
            <li>True sandal.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a true sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>Good, traditional scent.</li>
            <li>The pleasant fragrance lingers for a very, very long time.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh and natural!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Gives you a fresh and clean feel.</li>
            <li>Beautiful fine lather, no soap scum in the shower and a lingering</li>
            <li>A new love.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Buying it in relative bulk from Amazon is a very nice way to do so; it comes quickly with reasonable packaging as it is \\&quot;ready to ship\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding!</li>
            <li>The scent is strong enough through the box, that I was able to follow the suggestion of another reviewer and put it in drawers.  </li>
            <li>Worth $4.00, on less frequent occasions,  to get that wonderful scent!!</li>
            <li>This soap makes my skin so soft absolutly love it.</li>
            <li>I make my own laundry detergent, but essential oils don&#x27;t cut it for that fresh laundry smell.</li>
            <li>It is packaged in a sealed envelope that is inside of a colorful box, so even if a flood happened to it in transit, the soap itself would still arrive perfectly fresh.</li>
            <li>so they smell fresh.</li>
            <li>Kind of short for 12 bars.</li>
            <li>Bought enough to share with my family and friends because it was so popular.</li>
            <li>I really liked Bee &amp; Flower Sandalwood soap which I stumbled upon on a family vacation recently.  </li>
            <li>I thought I liked sandalwood, apparently not.  </li>
            <li>The price was right so 1 star (I was paying $3-4.00 per bar).  </li>
            <li>It just had a strange kind of lye smell when I was using it.  </li>
            <li>but I swear the other version had a strong smell and cleaned much better.</li>
            <li>A great shaving deal that exceeds even the more expensive soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>Always loved  sandalwood since I was I little girl.</li>
            <li>I shower two times a day and one bar will not last more than a week.</li>
            <li>I purchased some locally at a store specializing in Indian and Pakistani goods and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase more when we run low!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a bunch of it individually boxed : )</li>
            <li>Thus is the only authentic sandlewood soap out there.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well and is smooth with no harsh chemicals or burn, and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>is almost gone after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>There are some dishonest vendors pirating a cheap copy and some reviewers (those with good ratings) got the real one, 2.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The store is mostly frequented by the local Eastern population, (India, Pakistan etc.), and everything sold there must be authentic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Sandlewood, but have dry, sensitive skin which complains about most highly scented soaps/shower gels.  </li>
            <li>However, the bars do not last that long - only about two weeks at best between two people.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the product is old or if it is a less superior version - the items that I purchased for $4.00 are labeled \\&quot;Superior</li>
            <li>The packaging is kind of feminine and the overall scent is borderline feminine (which I don&#x27;t usually think about sandalwood), but my husband hasn&#x27;t complained &amp; I think he smells delicious after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I love sandalwood scents, and it&#x27;s hard to find a sandalwood soap that is not mixed with something else (usually rose).</li>
            <li>It smells up your whole bathroom, just from this one bar.  </li>
            <li>and the whole bathroom.</li>
            <li>Lasts a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li>The real thing from Mysore.</li>
            <li>If you like sandalwood, Mysore soap is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood fragrance is very soothing and up lifting.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Very aromatic with long-lasting scent.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of people that like this stink and have never smelt real sandalwood before.</li>
            <li>Really wakes me up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I do really like the product though</li>
            <li>Gentle on my skin, (not like Chandrika, which gives me a rash and dries out my skin).  </li>
            <li>I found this soap at a local store and bought two bars - and was excited to bring them home.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited after having read the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Smell is subjective, but it certainly was a clear goat in my house (come to think of it, maybe it kind of smelled a bit like dead, decomposing goat).  </li>
            <li>The sandal wood scent is great, and for me at least, it does not dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>Nice soap but small for price</li>
            <li>I particularly like using it during the hot sticky summer months because it leaves my skin refreshed and soft.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, and it lasts longer than typical store-bought brands.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin you may need to put on some light lotion after showering.  </li>
            <li>Super addictive!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I think that I like this a little better.  </li>
            <li>&quot; (and definitely worth exporting back).</li>
            <li>I am super sensitive to artificial fragrance, but love to smell clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to place a new order for another dozen bars.</li>
            <li>but I am always trying new skin products to see what helps and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>You can find similar quality from boutique soap crafters, but I happen to enjoy this specific scent which is why I rate it 5 out of 5 stars,</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not especially strong - you will not come out of the shower smelling like sandalwood perfume - but you will come out clean as heck.</li>
            <li>Delivery was OUTSTANDING and just in time as my other bar of soap was almost gone!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find some of the more classic scents in bath products these days.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok and the bars are small</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s always been the same product - made by Karnataka of Rajajinagar - and I only see three notable changes from recent batches: the package is now marked &amp;</li>
            <li>Bars are on the smallish side, so they don&#x27;t last very long in the shower, but that&#x27;s ok, as it is so inexpensive, and a dozen will last  plenty of time.</li>
            <li>The scent was clearly of chemicals and NOT Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I suppose it goes without saying that Sandalwood is, by far, my favoutite aroma.  </li>
            <li>I am far too modest for that.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised by the results:  </li>
            <li>The bar seems to last a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>had tried to purchase it direct from India but was unable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I get mine at my local Indian grocery store; it has &#x27;export quality&#x27; written on the box, however, everything in this store is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he loves the smell of sandalwood and that its natural.</li>
            <li>When we shower, our entire bathroom smells like sandalwood and it is so much nicer than air fresheners.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen a change so far from this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and noticeable, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, it is the only soap with pure sandalwood oil in it.  </li>
            <li>For some reason it really helped clear all that up when used daily with a wooden body brush, and it continues to work</li>
            <li>#34;Export Quality&amp;#34;, it no longer claims to be &amp;#34;the only soap with pure sandalwood oil&amp;#34;, and there&#x27;s no sign of the price in Rupees on the back.  </li>
            <li>Very masculine scent that last all day.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of this soaps aroma, and only wish I could find a cologne that has the exact same scent -if</li>
            <li>Not a natural soap by any means, but a decent one nonetheless.</li>
            <li>The extremely strong McDonald&#x27;s bathroom detergent smell of this soap in no way resembles sandalwood which is a base, very light yummy woody smell.</li>
            <li>It is a soft scent, not perfumy like regular soaps.  </li>
            <li>Well, dang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon can vary wildly from one seller to the next.  </li>
            <li>I do not really mind it all that much though</li>
            <li>Other brands we have tried are way too large.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Ill be ordering more in the near future.</li>
            <li>Fresh sandalwood fragrance, prompt delivery as usual</li>
            <li>This soap was so bad that it inspired me to make my own soap with real sandalwood essential oil earlier this week.</li>
            <li>It leaves a lasting soft scent on the body all day long.  </li>
            <li>so i wash with the plain soap first and use these for final pass to make them last .</li>
            <li>Some how the one i got is ithink very old stock.or due to some.</li>

            <li> Why are there so many good reviews?</li>
            <li> exceed my expectations, the timing and the quality was good, better than buying from a store in my own country.</li>
            <li> At $2.00 a bar it is a bargain and it makes a nice inexpensive gift.</li>
            <li> I would have liked for the scent to be stronger, but it is acceptable.</li>
            <li> It is mild, creamy with a strong yet wonderfully mellow scent.</li>
            <li> Great scent and gets you clean.  </li>
            <li> the savings I get from buying from Amazon in &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; with their subscription service, and I am one happy, clean, sandlewoody person.</li>
            <li> fast delivey, great deal, good stuff</li>
            <li> this is by far the best soap i have ever used.  </li>
            <li> One of the best soaps with the natural aroma of Sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> If you have used Mysore Sandal products and have liked the smell, you will love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Thank you to this soaps maker for continuing to make this one of a kind product that so many of us love.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like strong scents, but this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> I am a mechanic, and this will easily get out any kind of grime and motor oil that&#x27;s on my skin way better than anything I can get from the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I love sandlewood soap and have gotten it from L&#x27;Occitane.  </li>
            <li> Gave to my in-laws for Christmas, they love sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> Elegant</li>
            <li> I love the soap.  </li>

            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I recommend this soap to many of my friends</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this when i run out.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love the smell of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I Love this soap.</li>
            <li> They use real sandalwood oil in this product and it smells great after a shower and the smell lingers on your body and bathroom for hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal and a great price for the states.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of sandal wood soap and this product has a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> - what more could you want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and love using it</li>
            <li> As a kid I would run the beads under the tapwater to bring out the smell, LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus</li>
            <li> I love the sandalwood scent.  </li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> Its OK, this brand seems like it has detergent in it unlike the one by Chandrika.</li>
            <li> It also fills your bathroom with the aroma of Sandalwood and leaves your skin very richly scented.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling soap, lasts well in the shower, makes lather &amp; gets you clean</li>
            <li> Divine smell, fairly long-lasting, great lather and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li> Mysore Sandal soap is, quite simply, the best soap available on the market today.  </li>
            <li> This soap lathers quite good, but the smell is intense.  </li>
            <li> a rich, wonderfully scented (not overbearing) lather that does not leave a residue and also seems to condition my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly neatly packed.</li>
            <li> I prefer the clean scent of Mysore, so that&#x27;s what I buy most often.  </li>
            <li> may be strong  scent in the shower</li>
            <li> I think my skin feels smooth, clean, and lightly scented like it should be!  </li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> It has quickly become my favorite.</li>
            <li> They really seem to love it!</li>
            <li> When you open the package it smells really strong and like nagchampa, but once in a lather and on your skin it smells great and like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> washing with this soap, I apply some pure rose oil (also purchased there), and I&#x27;m in a state of aroma bliss all day.</li>
            <li> I am a huge sandlewood fan and this soap does not dissapoint.</li>
            <li> I rarely make online purchases and this one will make me ever more cautious.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent of sandalwood, so, after doing some research, I decided to try the Mysore Sandal Soap.  </li>
            <li> The skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> not because I&#x27;m cheap</li>
            <li> Has lanolin so not cruelty free for vegetarians.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a plus for us because my husband likes to take it to the gym in a soap box and this bar will fit in the box.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was on time, packaging was secure item was sold just as posted.</li>
            <li> , most were very positive so this soap was on my radar.  </li>
            <li> Mild and good for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike another great smelling soap I like (Chandrika), this one is much more moisturizing, or rather, less de-moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Its fragrance and the way it feels is unique, no US made soap comes close.  </li>
            <li> Not too overpowering, and leaves you feeling and smelling clean.  </li>
            <li> It has a great scent but even nicer is the dry itchy skin syndrome that winter brings about</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re certain this is what you want, it might be better to buy one bar instead of 12.</li>
            <li> It gets you clean, makes your skin soft, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell not heavy .</li>
            <li> Really wants not to love..</li>
            <li> Ridiculously cheap to do such magic : )</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like true Sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> I get told daily by strangers that I smell good.</li>
            <li> True sandal.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a true sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> Good, traditional scent.</li>
            <li> The pleasant fragrance lingers for a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh and natural!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Gives you a fresh and clean feel.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fine lather, no soap scum in the shower and a lingering</li>
            <li> A new love.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying it in relative bulk from Amazon is a very nice way to do so; it comes quickly with reasonable packaging as it is \\&quot;ready to ship\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding!</li>
            <li> The scent is strong enough through the box, that I was able to follow the suggestion of another reviewer and put it in drawers.  </li>
            <li> Worth $4.00, on less frequent occasions,  to get that wonderful scent!!</li>
            <li> This soap makes my skin so soft absolutly love it.</li>
            <li> I make my own laundry detergent, but essential oils don&#x27;t cut it for that fresh laundry smell.</li>
            <li> It is packaged in a sealed envelope that is inside of a colorful box, so even if a flood happened to it in transit, the soap itself would still arrive perfectly fresh.</li>
            <li> so they smell fresh.</li>
            <li> Kind of short for 12 bars.</li>
            <li> Bought enough to share with my family and friends because it was so popular.</li>
            <li> I really liked Bee &amp; Flower Sandalwood soap which I stumbled upon on a family vacation recently.  </li>
            <li> I thought I liked sandalwood, apparently not.  </li>
            <li> The price was right so 1 star (I was paying $3-4.00 per bar).  </li>
            <li> It just had a strange kind of lye smell when I was using it.  </li>
            <li> but I swear the other version had a strong smell and cleaned much better.</li>
            <li> A great shaving deal that exceeds even the more expensive soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> Always loved  sandalwood since I was I little girl.</li>
            <li> I shower two times a day and one bar will not last more than a week.</li>
            <li> I purchased some locally at a store specializing in Indian and Pakistani goods and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase more when we run low!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a bunch of it individually boxed : )</li>
            <li> Thus is the only authentic sandlewood soap out there.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well and is smooth with no harsh chemicals or burn, and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> is almost gone after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> There are some dishonest vendors pirating a cheap copy and some reviewers (those with good ratings) got the real one, 2.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The store is mostly frequented by the local Eastern population, (India, Pakistan etc.), and everything sold there must be authentic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Sandlewood, but have dry, sensitive skin which complains about most highly scented soaps/shower gels.  </li>
            <li> However, the bars do not last that long - only about two weeks at best between two people.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product is old or if it is a less superior version - the items that I purchased for $4.00 are labeled \\&quot;Superior</li>
            <li> The packaging is kind of feminine and the overall scent is borderline feminine (which I don&#x27;t usually think about sandalwood), but my husband hasn&#x27;t complained &amp; I think he smells delicious after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I love sandalwood scents, and it&#x27;s hard to find a sandalwood soap that is not mixed with something else (usually rose).</li>
            <li> It smells up your whole bathroom, just from this one bar.  </li>
            <li> and the whole bathroom.</li>
            <li> Lasts a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> The real thing from Mysore.</li>
            <li> If you like sandalwood, Mysore soap is the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood fragrance is very soothing and up lifting.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic with long-lasting scent.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of people that like this stink and have never smelt real sandalwood before.</li>
            <li> Really wakes me up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I do really like the product though</li>
            <li> Gentle on my skin, (not like Chandrika, which gives me a rash and dries out my skin).  </li>
            <li> I found this soap at a local store and bought two bars - and was excited to bring them home.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited after having read the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Smell is subjective, but it certainly was a clear goat in my house (come to think of it, maybe it kind of smelled a bit like dead, decomposing goat).  </li>
            <li> The sandal wood scent is great, and for me at least, it does not dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> Nice soap but small for price</li>
            <li> I particularly like using it during the hot sticky summer months because it leaves my skin refreshed and soft.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent, and it lasts longer than typical store-bought brands.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you may need to put on some light lotion after showering.  </li>
            <li> Super addictive!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I think that I like this a little better.  </li>
            <li> &quot; (and definitely worth exporting back).</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive to artificial fragrance, but love to smell clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to place a new order for another dozen bars.</li>
            <li> but I am always trying new skin products to see what helps and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> You can find similar quality from boutique soap crafters, but I happen to enjoy this specific scent which is why I rate it 5 out of 5 stars,</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not especially strong - you will not come out of the shower smelling like sandalwood perfume - but you will come out clean as heck.</li>
            <li> Delivery was OUTSTANDING and just in time as my other bar of soap was almost gone!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find some of the more classic scents in bath products these days.  </li>
            <li> The smell is ok and the bars are small</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s always been the same product - made by Karnataka of Rajajinagar - and I only see three notable changes from recent batches: the package is now marked &amp;</li>
            <li> Bars are on the smallish side, so they don&#x27;t last very long in the shower, but that&#x27;s ok, as it is so inexpensive, and a dozen will last  plenty of time.</li>
            <li> The scent was clearly of chemicals and NOT Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I suppose it goes without saying that Sandalwood is, by far, my favoutite aroma.  </li>
            <li> I am far too modest for that.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by the results:  </li>
            <li> The bar seems to last a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li> had tried to purchase it direct from India but was unable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I get mine at my local Indian grocery store; it has &#x27;export quality&#x27; written on the box, however, everything in this store is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he loves the smell of sandalwood and that its natural.</li>
            <li> When we shower, our entire bathroom smells like sandalwood and it is so much nicer than air fresheners.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen a change so far from this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and noticeable, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, it is the only soap with pure sandalwood oil in it.  </li>
            <li> For some reason it really helped clear all that up when used daily with a wooden body brush, and it continues to work</li>
            <li> #34;Export Quality&amp;#34;, it no longer claims to be &amp;#34;the only soap with pure sandalwood oil&amp;#34;, and there&#x27;s no sign of the price in Rupees on the back.  </li>
            <li> Very masculine scent that last all day.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this soaps aroma, and only wish I could find a cologne that has the exact same scent -if</li>
            <li> Not a natural soap by any means, but a decent one nonetheless.</li>
            <li> The extremely strong McDonald&#x27;s bathroom detergent smell of this soap in no way resembles sandalwood which is a base, very light yummy woody smell.</li>
            <li> It is a soft scent, not perfumy like regular soaps.  </li>
            <li> Well, dang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon can vary wildly from one seller to the next.  </li>
            <li> I do not really mind it all that much though</li>
            <li> Other brands we have tried are way too large.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Ill be ordering more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Fresh sandalwood fragrance, prompt delivery as usual</li>
            <li> This soap was so bad that it inspired me to make my own soap with real sandalwood essential oil earlier this week.</li>
            <li> It leaves a lasting soft scent on the body all day long.  </li>
            <li> so i wash with the plain soap first and use these for final pass to make them last .</li>
            <li> Some how the one i got is ithink very old stock.or due to some.</li>
            <li> Has a sharp, detergent-like smell, rather than the rich, softly complex aroma that I recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little soft  </li>
            <li> Long living Mysore Sandal</li>
            <li> Lasts for long time.  </li>
            <li> I feel everything is too complexly scented and full of harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but since it is so drying for my sensitive facial skin I usually use it only from the neck down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell is very long</li>
            <li> It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin</li>
            <li> In any event, I am not joking, this soap did not work for me at all (even though other brands of Sandalwood soaps were really great) because this soap smelled very bad.</li>
            <li> The bars could last a little longer but the scent can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming scent and long lasting bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Opened the package and missing from it is the fragrance (!)</li>
            <li> (well, not much),</li>
            <li> was way ahead of the expected times given.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t put up with my under sinks cabinet smelling of this stuff (from the closed packages!)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a little strange.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is made in a government run factory in India means that it costs a fraction of the price of other quality soaps.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Mysore no longer carries the premium version or they just send me a different version.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other soaps it has no animal products or detergents.</li>
            <li> They seem to last a little longer too and they are a few cents cheaper per bar from Amazon.</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I used to have awful problems with back breakouts and would easily develop heat rashes on my back and sides.</li>
            <li> This soap keeps your skin moist in the winter for a lot less money than other products.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple soap without all the complex chemistry coming from the mega conglomerates these days.  </li>
            <li> it is not, but what do you expect for less than $3 per bar?  </li>
            <li> It is just not there (as the previous writer said).  </li>
            <li> I was buying Chandrika Sandal Soap previously.  </li>
            <li> My husband tends to be slightly oily so he uses it on his face and body.</li>
            <li> When used as a bath or shower soap, it scents the body just a little, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any perfumes or colognes.</li>
            <li> My friend brought a few bars from India for me</li>
            <li> Sister visited India quite a few years ago and gave me some of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the soap really smelled terrible through the box (which I ignored in the store) and it didn&#x27;t get better when unboxed and used.  </li>
            <li> Everyone in my family young and old who smelled this soap hated it - I even could smell how bad I smelled after using this soap - it basically smells like really cheap, disgusting industrial soap, but with cheap spices added to the mix.  </li>
            <li> you my bathroom is not that small</li>
            <li> I usually go for the cheapest 75g bars....</li>
            <li> see noting wrong with the quality of this soap; in fact, I use it as deodorant (lather under my arms, and leave the lather there), the aroma is nothing short of heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I received a bar as a gift some time ago and it stayed on the shelf for a year before I ran out of my usual soap and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The bar is sort of on the small size</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past, so I knew the soap was what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This batch wasn&#x27;t as fragrant as my usual orders.</li>
            <li> The bars were very heavily scented.</li>
            <li> and this thing stinks outside of it.  </li>
            <li> Having traveled to Mysore, India  and purchased some sandalwood soap while I was there, I can say that this soap was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> There are dishonest reviewers that are promoting the product, or 3.</li>
            <li> So I had been searching Amazon and noticed at least one amazon review for the B&amp;F soap recommended Mysore&#x27;s sandalwood soap instead.  </li>
            <li> I showered with it and was forced by the family to shower again this time with another soap.  </li>
            <li> It is not drying or irritating and has a calming effect on all the senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is kinda weird sometimes, but I take it in the spirit it was intended.</li>
            <li> Now everything smells faintly of sandalwood when we go to put it on.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34; in the ingredients list is a fancy marketing way of saying that an artificial scent was created based off of the smell of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> To store it I keep it in a clothing drawer, as it scents the clothes very faintly</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of the mysore soap and aside from one or two bad reviews about the smell</li>
            <li> I believe the base is a rice byproduct as it has to conform to vegetarian rules.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product, makes you clean and smelling great!!</li>
            <li> Nice soap but small for price</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Smells amazing. This soap makes my skin so soft absolutly love it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It has quickly become my favorite.The sandal wood scent is great, and for me at least, it does not dry out the skin. Work good a a face soap too.</li>
            <li> I have used this before when i was 11. Looked it up on Amazon and guess what? Its nothing but chemicals now. I stopped using and ordered something else on Amazon. The scent was clearly of chemicals and NOT Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I thought I liked sandalwood, apparently not.  This soap lathers quite good, but the smell is intense.  It smells up your whole bathroom, just from this one bar.  Mind you my bathroom is not that small it is around 32 sq ft and this thing stinks outside of it.  I ordered it once and cancelled my subscription.  If you can get around that, then it works well.  I just couldn&#x27;t put up with my under sinks cabinet smelling of this stuff (from the closed packages!) and the whole bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love sandlewood soap and have gotten it from L&#x27;Occitane.  They stopped carrying it so I decided to try this brand.  It just had a strange kind of lye smell when I was using it.  Couldn&#x27;t stand it. My mistake for buying a dozen.  Now I need to find another source for sandlewod soap.  I would suggest you try Sappo Hill Sandalwood soap.  Heres a link:   [[ASIN:B00028QF22 Soap-Sandalwood - 1 - Bar Soap]]</li>
            <li> It has very good sandle wood scent. I shower two times a day and one bar will not last more than a week. Next I am going to try out sandle wood premium bar . It matches my expectation.</li>
            <li> Gave to my in-laws for Christmas, they love sandalwood.  They really seem to love it!</li>
            <li> Great scent and gets you clean.  Lasts a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> Mysore Sandal soap is, quite simply, the best soap available on the market today.  The fact that it is made in a government run factory in India means that it costs a fraction of the price of other quality soaps.  Elegant it is not, but what do you expect for less than $3 per bar?  I suppose it goes without saying that Sandalwood is, by far, my favoutite aroma.  I&#x27;m obviously not alone in that.  Several people who have come to our house after I have taken a shower have asked what was the source of the marvellous smell.  Mysore Sandal Soap.!</li>
            <li> The price was right so 1 star (I was paying $3-4.00 per bar).  Opened the package and missing from it is the fragrance (!) - my reason for loving this product.  It is just not there (as the previous writer said).  So disappointed!!!  Worth $4.00, on less frequent occasions,  to get that wonderful scent!! Not sure if the product is old or if it is a less superior version - the items that I purchased for $4.00 are labeled \\&quot;Superior Quality\\&quot; (and they are!) while these bars say \\&quot;Export Quality\\&quot; (and definitely worth exporting back). I rarely make online purchases and this one will make me ever more cautious.  Lesson learned!  I will try to return - unsure of policy at this time.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent of sandalwood, so, after doing some research, I decided to try the Mysore Sandal Soap.  I purchased some locally at a store specializing in Indian and Pakistani goods and was pleased with the results.  I then ordered a package of 12 at about 60% of the unit cost at the local store.  I&#x27;m about to place a new order for another dozen bars.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap before, and wanted to get some more! It is just perfect!  My skin feels better, it helps with your face even!  My blemishes are clearing up finally!  This soap is a winner and I already new this when I ordered some!!!!!!!!!  I think the price was fair and even more than fair.  Delivery was OUTSTANDING and just in time as my other bar of soap was almost gone!!!  I recommend this soap for anyone!  Even my daughter likes it!  I think my skin feels smooth, clean, and lightly scented like it should be!  I will purchase more when we run low!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s mother-in-law sent me two of these soaps...I had never heard of it so I decided to give it a try.  I love the soap.  It leaves a lasting soft scent on the body all day long.  It is a soft scent, not perfumy like regular soaps.  I, in turn, bought some and shared with one of my friends.  She also liked it.</li>
            <li> Very good. I&#x27;ll loved.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling sandalwood soap ever. I use it exclusively to wash my hands. Hard to find in local stores. So glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price. The real thing from Mysore.</li>
            <li> Really wants not to love.. My grown Son, came for a visit, walked in the bathroom and stole a bar of Mysore. I use to buy from local Indian market, but this is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Long living Mysore Sandal Soap!..Just great....Arrive as scheduled....Great!</li>
            <li> Always loved  sandalwood since I was I little girl. If you like sandalwood, Mysore soap is the real stuff. I do recomend it 100%. Thank you</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh and natural!&lt;br /&gt;This soap is my favorite and I have used it for years.  It is not drying or irritating and has a calming effect on all the senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying it in relative bulk from Amazon is a very nice way to do so; it comes quickly with reasonable packaging as it is \\&quot;ready to ship\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this soap and threat it clears and softens the skin.  Used to buy it at health food store but they have stopped ordering it. Apparently, it is the only soap with pure sandalwood oil in it.  Will order it again.</li>
            <li> When you open the package it smells really strong and like nagchampa, but once in a lather and on your skin it smells great and like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> The skin feels smooth. The pleasant fragrance lingers for a very, very long time. Sandalwood fragrance is very soothing and up lifting.</li>
            <li> This is great! warm and earthy but not overpowering.  I am a huge sandlewood fan and this soap does not dissapoint.</li>
            <li> the best soap there is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mysore Sandal Soap for &amp;#34;a number of years&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always been the same product - made by Karnataka of Rajajinagar - and I only see three notable changes from recent batches: the package is now marked &amp;#34;Export Quality&amp;#34;, it no longer claims to be &amp;#34;the only soap with pure sandalwood oil&amp;#34;, and there&#x27;s no sign of the price in Rupees on the back.  Well, dang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon can vary wildly from one seller to the next.  I usually go for the cheapest 75g bars.... not because I&#x27;m cheap (well, not much), but because it&#x27;s reliable.  If it&#x27;s Mysore Sandal Soap, it&#x27;s always the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost over the last couple of years has gone up by about $3, which is only to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, the soap is still the same as it always was.  Its fragrance and the way it feels is unique, no US made soap comes close.  I can&#x27;t see any reason to change.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the smell and how amazing my skin looks and feels. Ridiculously cheap to do such magic : )</li>
            <li> I was buying Chandrika Sandal Soap previously.  I think that I like this a little better.  The scent and lather is about the same, but the Mysore Bars are firmer and finer texture.  They seem to last a little longer too and they are a few cents cheaper per bar from Amazon.</li>
            <li> best smelling soap in the world.  my favorite soap.  so glad they sell this online, otherwise I would have to fly all the way to India to get some....it is that good.  great sandalwood smell.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best. My skin feels great everytime I use this soap and the price is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling soap, lasts well in the shower, makes lather &amp; gets you clean and there&#x27;s a bunch of it individually boxed : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap exclusively for over a decade.  I love the scent, and it lasts longer than typical store-bought brands.</li>
            <li> This soap smells awesome.  Not too overpowering, and leaves you feeling and smelling clean.  Ill be ordering more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent..lingers in bathroom.  Lasts for long time.  Thus is the only authentic sandlewood soap out there.  Don&#x27;t have to go to India to buy it. Thanks amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Has lanolin so not cruelty free for vegetarians. Could not use.</li>
            <li> Mild and good for sensitive skin like mine. Gives you a fresh and clean feel. Not overwhelming scent and long lasting bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent that last all day.  It&#x27;s hard to find some of the more classic scents in bath products these days.  I feel everything is too complexly scented and full of harsh ingredients.  This is a very simple soap without all the complex chemistry coming from the mega conglomerates these days.  You can find similar quality from boutique soap crafters, but I happen to enjoy this specific scent which is why I rate it 5 out of 5 stars,</li>
            <li> I use this daily for my beard with a boar&#x27;s hair shaving brush. It lathers well and is smooth with no harsh chemicals or burn, and it lasts forever. A great shaving deal that exceeds even the more expensive soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> They are the best soaps from India. I will continue using them. Arrived very quickly neatly packed. Smell is amazing and gave one to my friends and they loved it.</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive to artificial fragrance, but love to smell clean. This soap smells absolutely amazing. I make my own laundry detergent, but essential oils don&#x27;t cut it for that fresh laundry smell. I powder these bars and add a spoonful to each wash and voila! The freshest smelling laundry ever. Love this soap and hope it never changes.</li>
            <li> Having traveled to Mysore, India  and purchased some sandalwood soap while I was there, I can say that this soap was a big disappointment.  Has a sharp, detergent-like smell, rather than the rich, softly complex aroma that I recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re certain this is what you want, it might be better to buy one bar instead of 12.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It lathers well, does what it is supposed to do and smells great! I particularly like using it during the hot sticky summer months because it leaves my skin refreshed and soft.  A new love.  I hope that I am never without this product and my husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> I used to use this some years back and decided to try it once again. It has a great scent but even nicer is the dry itchy skin syndrome that winter brings about is almost gone after the first couple uses. Good product.</li>
            <li> Great deal and fastest shipping. I love this soap and feel like a glam-queen when swathed in it&#x27;s scent. Did I mention my flawless complexion? No. I am far too modest for that.</li>
            <li> I was very excited after having read the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t smell like true Sandalwood.  It leaves my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t bother to return this item.  I&#x27;ll just give it away at work, maybe someone there will like it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Sandlewood, but have dry, sensitive skin which complains about most highly scented soaps/shower gels.  I decided to give this soap a try because of recommendations from Indian co-workers.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the results:  a rich, wonderfully scented (not overbearing) lather that does not leave a residue and also seems to condition my dry skin.  I can even use it on my face which is prone to breakouts from scented products.  Add to that the savings I get from buying from Amazon in &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; with their subscription service, and I am one happy, clean, sandlewoody person.</li>
            <li> I buy this soap by the case. Chandrika soap and the Mysore Sandal Soap is all we use. It gets you clean, makes your skin soft, and smells amazing. I get told daily by strangers that I smell good. Which is kinda weird sometimes, but I take it in the spirit it was intended.</li>
            <li> This is honestly one of the soapiest soaps I&#x27;ve ever seen. I am a mechanic, and this will easily get out any kind of grime and motor oil that&#x27;s on my skin way better than anything I can get from the grocery store. However, the bars do not last that long - only about two weeks at best between two people. The fragrance is not especially strong - you will not come out of the shower smelling like sandalwood perfume - but you will come out clean as heck.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  Its wonderful for the skin and has a pleasant smell of sandlewood.  I would recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> My friend brought a few bars from India for me and I love it, this is why I checked amazon and again u came through. I like the fragrance of this soap. I recommend this soap to many of my friends</li>
            <li> I love this soap and the price for the quantity is spot on!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Great price, fast shipping, excellent quality</li>
            <li> Great value for na Indian soap!</li>
            <li> Great soap &amp; great price</li>
            <li> What a wonderful soap this is! It is THE most famous Sandalwood soap on the planet, and it does a wonderful job of cleansing your skin without over drying it. It also fills your bathroom with the aroma of Sandalwood and leaves your skin very richly scented. I can&#x27;t get enough of this soaps aroma, and only wish I could find a cologne that has the exact same scent -if you know of one please comment here and let me know. Thank you to this soaps maker for continuing to make this one of a kind product that so many of us love.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance  .Not overpowering.  True sandal.  My husband has used it for may years.  If you have dry skin you may need to put on some light lotion after showering.  My husband tends to be slightly oily so he uses it on his face and body.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Smells really nice and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best soap i have ever used.  The smell is phenomenal and is a great lathering soap too.  I will be buying more of this when i run out.</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent.  Divine smell, fairly long-lasting, great lather and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike another great smelling soap I like (Chandrika), this one is much more moisturizing, or rather, less de-moisturizing.</li>
            <li> a little soft  so i wash with the plain soap first and use these for final pass to make them last . may be strong  scent in the shower but after you get out the door to work lasts  as good as splash aftershave .</li>
            <li> Very aromatic with long-lasting scent.  Nice lather.  The bar seems to last a reasonable time.  The packaging is kind of feminine and the overall scent is borderline feminine (which I don&#x27;t usually think about sandalwood), but my husband hasn&#x27;t complained &amp; I think he smells delicious after a shower.  Good price on this bulk package.  Glad to have found this cruelty-free soap!</li>
            <li> smells great will continue to order</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 30 years-love it.</li>
            <li> Fresh sandalwood fragrance, prompt delivery as usual</li>
            <li> The picture shows that it was the premium version but I received the superior version.  I&#x27;m not sure if Mysore no longer carries the premium version or they just send me a different version.  It works fine but I swear the other version had a strong smell and cleaned much better.</li>
            <li> I buy in indian stores here. I will get a nice fragrance and smell. Some how the one i got is ithink very old stock.or due to some. The fragrance is gone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iam using this.but next time i will go store.</li>
            <li> This and the Bee &amp; Flower Sandalwood soap is all my husband will use and we can&#x27;t find either in stores here in TN.  I prefer the clean scent of Mysore, so that&#x27;s what I buy most often.  The item came before the estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li> This soap rules! It smells amazing and it&#x27;s a true sandalwood scent. Super addictive!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. The bars could last a little longer but the scent can&#x27;t be beat. I buy 12-24 bars at a time.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love the smell of sandalwood. This is not sandalwood. &amp;#34;Sandalwood oil based fragrance...&amp;#34; in the ingredients list is a fancy marketing way of saying that an artificial scent was created based off of the smell of sandalwood. The extremely strong McDonald&#x27;s bathroom detergent smell of this soap in no way resembles sandalwood which is a base, very light yummy woody smell. Why are there so many good reviews? My guess is that 1. There are some dishonest vendors pirating a cheap copy and some reviewers (those with good ratings) got the real one, 2. There are dishonest reviewers that are promoting the product, or 3. There are a lot of people that like this stink and have never smelt real sandalwood before. This soap was so bad that it inspired me to make my own soap with real sandalwood essential oil earlier this week. Mine turned out great.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my son in law every Christmas and he just loves it.  It has a nice clean smell not heavy .</li>
            <li> I Love this soap. It&#x27;s smell is very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;The Delivery was from USA to AUS within 7 working days.&lt;br /&gt;This was way ahead of the expected times given. I am very happy with this service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Sister visited India quite a few years ago and gave me some of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried to purchase it direct from India but was unable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for having this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase. ( I purchased two x12 packs)</li>
            <li> This is the purest Mysore Sandalwood Soap in the world, produced by the official government factory. Unlike other soaps it has no animal products or detergents. I believe the base is a rice byproduct as it has to conform to vegetarian rules. I have been using it for years. I commend the seller, as it arrived well packaged and ahead of time, and best of all, at a great price! It is packaged in a sealed envelope that is inside of a colorful box, so even if a flood happened to it in transit, the soap itself would still arrive perfectly fresh. To store it I keep it in a clothing drawer, as it scents the clothes very faintly so they smell fresh.When used as a bath or shower soap, it scents the body just a little, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any perfumes or colognes. It also cleans the skin well, without drying it out!! Kudos to Amazon and the seller!!!</li>
            <li> exceed my expectations, the timing and the quality was good, better than buying from a store in my own country.</li>
            <li> Good quality and great fragrance!</li>
            <li> I have been using Mysore Sandalwood soap for over 40 years. It is mild, creamy with a strong yet wonderfully mellow scent. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> One of the best soaps with the natural aroma of Sandalwood.  They use real sandalwood oil in this product and it smells great after a shower and the smell lingers on your body and bathroom for hours. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is the same soap I bought on India while on yoga teacher training. It&#x27;s the real deal and a great price for the states.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling soap (if you like sandlewood). It&#x27;s spicy smelling and it lathers well. The smell will last for hours. I&#x27;d order it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I get mine at my local Indian grocery store; it has &#x27;export quality&#x27; written on the box, however, everything in this store is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;The store is mostly frequented by the local Eastern population, (India, Pakistan etc.), and everything sold there must be authentic.&lt;br /&gt;I see noting wrong with the quality of this soap; in fact, I use it as deodorant (lather under my arms, and leave the lather there), the aroma is nothing short of heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;After washing with this soap, I apply some pure rose oil (also purchased there), and I&#x27;m in a state of aroma bliss all day.</li>
            <li> Lovely oval shaped bars of soap with great sandalwood scent. Does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap from India.  Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  Really wakes me up in the morning.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap ther is. I received a bar as a gift some time ago and it stayed on the shelf for a year before I ran out of my usual soap and decided to give it a try. This is all I use now. The product was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of sandal wood soap and this product has a lovely scent.  The bar is sort of on the small size but that&#x27;s a plus for us because my husband likes to take it to the gym in a soap box and this bar will fit in the box.  Other brands we have tried are way too large.  At $2.00 a bar it is a bargain and it makes a nice inexpensive gift.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that my husband will use. He loves everything about it! It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin and he loves the smell of sandalwood and that its natural.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fine lather, no soap scum in the shower and a lingering relaxing scent  - what more could you want.</li>
            <li> Everybody in my family loves this soap.  I&#x27;m a guy and love using it and so does my wife and children.  It is the cleanest smell you can imagine.</li>
            <li> This soap smells amazing.  Even though the scent is no longer from sandalwood trees from Mysore, India, it still smells amazing.  If you have used Mysore Sandal products and have liked the smell, you will love this soap.  The bars themselves are smaller than standard soap bars, but they do make a larger size if you prefer.  When we shower, our entire bathroom smells like sandalwood and it is so much nicer than air fresheners.  The smell is strong and noticeable, but not overwhelming.  I don&#x27;t normally like strong scents, but this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the glycerin soaps I get from India. The smell is ok and the bars are small</li>
            <li> GREAT SOAP! You travel with this fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;And great service! Second order from them.</li>
            <li> Bought this and it had an expiration 2 months. Kind of short for 12 bars. The bars were very heavily scented.</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I used to have awful problems with back breakouts and would easily develop heat rashes on my back and sides. I found this soap at the local Indian store and thought to try it out. For some reason it really helped clear all that up when used daily with a wooden body brush, and it continues to work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use it on my face once in a great while but since it is so drying for my sensitive facial skin I usually use it only from the neck down. I love sandalwood scents, and it&#x27;s hard to find a sandalwood soap that is not mixed with something else (usually rose). The scent reminds me of my grandmother&#x27;s sandalwood tasbihs (prayer beads) in Pakistan. As a kid I would run the beads under the tapwater to bring out the smell, LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star because of the lye undertones. I do not really mind it all that much though, it&#x27;s just a little strange.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past, so I knew the soap was what I wanted. I cannot find sandalwood soap locally anymore, so I ran out several months ago. I may have overdone it, tho, ordering 12 pkgs.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this soap and I use it all the time in conjunction with a sandalwood cologne and shave cream.  I&#x27;ll keep ordering it</li>
            <li> I have HS a skin condition that haunts me day and night. I have given up wheat which helps a ton but I am always trying new skin products to see what helps and what doesn&#x27;t. I wish I could say it has helped improve my skin but I haven&#x27;t seen a change so far from this product. I am still using it so we will see over time. I do really like the product though, the smell is amazing, it feels great in my skin and I like the way my skin feels when I am out of the shower. Great product, I am happy I found it.</li>
            <li> you get a lot of soap for the price.  I love the sandalwood scent.  I would have liked for the scent to be stronger, but it is acceptable.</li>
            <li> One of the best Sandal soaps I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years!</li>
            <li> Excellent soap.  Gentle on my skin, (not like Chandrika, which gives me a rash and dries out my skin).  Pleasant aroma.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. THE best. Bought enough to share with my family and friends because it was so popular.</li>
            <li> This soap keeps your skin moist in the winter for a lot less money than other products.</li>
            <li> Best soap in the world!!!</li>
            <li> Great soap. Great price!</li>
            <li> Good, traditional scent. Very authentic. Not a natural soap by any means, but a decent one nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Mysore sandal soap has a gorgeous earthy smell that lingers on in the bathroom all day. My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Its OK, this brand seems like it has detergent in it unlike the one by Chandrika. Delivery was on time, packaging was secure item was sold just as posted.</li>
            <li> This batch wasn&#x27;t as fragrant as my usual orders.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful.  The scent is strong enough through the box, that I was able to follow the suggestion of another reviewer and put it in drawers.  Now everything smells faintly of sandalwood when we go to put it on.  Bars are on the smallish side, so they don&#x27;t last very long in the shower, but that&#x27;s ok, as it is so inexpensive, and a dozen will last  plenty of time.</li>
            <li> fast delivey, great deal, good stuff</li>
            <li> I really liked Bee &amp; Flower Sandalwood soap which I stumbled upon on a family vacation recently.  So I had been searching Amazon and noticed at least one amazon review for the B&amp;F soap recommended Mysore&#x27;s sandalwood soap instead.  I read the reviews of the mysore soap and aside from one or two bad reviews about the smell, most were very positive so this soap was on my radar.  I found this soap at a local store and bought two bars - and was excited to bring them home.  Unfortunately, the soap really smelled terrible through the box (which I ignored in the store) and it didn&#x27;t get better when unboxed and used.  I showered with it and was forced by the family to shower again this time with another soap.  Everyone in my family young and old who smelled this soap hated it - I even could smell how bad I smelled after using this soap - it basically smells like really cheap, disgusting industrial soap, but with cheap spices added to the mix.  My bathroom was smelling from the soap still in its box as well.  I ended up throwing both bars out.  My advice is that you should probably try one bar before contemplating purchasing a pack of 12.  Smell is subjective, but it certainly was a clear goat in my house (come to think of it, maybe it kind of smelled a bit like dead, decomposing goat).  In any event, I am not joking, this soap did not work for me at all (even though other brands of Sandalwood soaps were really great) because this soap smelled very bad.</li>
