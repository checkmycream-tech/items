            <li>Item is good quality.</li>
            <li>This mirror is really good.</li>
            <li>, it looks good.</li>
            <li>This mirror is unique and is the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome product, it was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Just when I thought my beard trimming couldn&#x27;t look any better!</li>
            <li>It was easy to install, holds perfectly to the smooth tile surface of shower, mirror not distorted, and does not steam up.  </li>
            <li>Great products with simple mechanics for reliable setup, like this one, are real joy to find.</li>
            <li>Nice mirror.</li>
            <li>Nice mirror.  </li>
            <li>Good suction and stays fog free</li>
            <li>This is a great product and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The twisty bendy arm comes in a lot more handy than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is by the far the best I&#x27;ve seen for shower mirrors!</li>
            <li>Have been using for a couple of weeks and so far is working great!</li>
            <li>Great product, no fog at all, easy to install, and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Very high quality with a great &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; lock and unlock to attach to any smooth surface!</li>
            <li>and I never have any more nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>Still this is better than any others I&#x27;ve owned and cleaning the surface with toothpaste (as they recommend)</li>
            <li>Love that I can move the mirror.  </li>
            <li>and it was okay.</li>
            <li>This thing somehow works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and the quality of the mirror is stellar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may be magic.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband who wanted to be able to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>The twist lock suction cup works way better than any others I have used.  </li>
            <li>Suction cup couldn&#x27;t attach to the tile in my shower whereas the mirror it replaced was able to without any issue.  </li>
            <li>No complaints, 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This mirror is leaps and bounds better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of these over the years.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that the mirror pivots and moves, so that you can put it at the angle that is most comfortable.</li>
            <li>Best to find a spot you like the first time, by the second attempt for sure.</li>
            <li>So many shower mirrors I see are nothing but a cheap mirror on cheap plastic or metal.  </li>
            <li>They all seem to tarnish and fog so easily, but it&#x27;s not a surprise because it looks like they cost 8 cents to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t always hunched over to shave easily.</li>
            <li>It adheres strongly with suction, and I&#x27;m not worried about it going anywhere until I release the rotating locking ring, and coax/beg it off my polished marble shower wall.</li>
            <li>Suction cup is strong and has no problem holding in place even when moving the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s the first fog-free mirror that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>The fact that I can move the mirror is a huge add to me.  </li>
            <li>It works great and the suction cup actually works.</li>
            <li>It also stays securely on the wall.</li>
            <li>Great mirror, suction cup actually works and it doesn&#x27;t fog up like all the others that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Although this one promises to hold on smooth surface, that was not the case.  </li>
            <li>Genuinely fog free.  </li>
            <li>This is not one of those cheap ones.</li>
            <li>This one is light years ahead if the rest.</li>
            <li>Love the pivot feature-- lightweight and really does stay fog free!</li>
            <li>So far so good, but suction cup does not work on textured tile.</li>
            <li>So far , my new NO FOG SHOWER MIRROR has a great locking system, extremely no fog and looks great .</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>We purchased a battery operated shaver that could be used in water which was perfect, except he was having a problem using it over a small  sink in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made, the mirror clarity is very good, it is, in fact, fog-free (without any rinsing) and the locking suction cup mechanism feels very solid when used.  </li>
            <li>I often opt to spend more to get a better quality product and early-</li>
            <li>makes this mirror superior to the many other I have owned is the swivel mount</li>
            <li>My previous shower mirror was the kind you filled with warm water</li>
            <li>that is really fog free too!</li>
            <li>There were many and after I read pretty much all of the reviews, I decided to try this mirror since all reviews were excellent, even though it had very few.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>After a lot of searching and trying different shower mirrors, I&#x27;ve finally found one that is perfect in every regard.  </li>
            <li>Now I can do a quick shave without using braille.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s kind of a unique method of finding the most advantageous location for the  mirror and locking it down with the rotating screw.</li>
            <li>I had given up on finding one that meets a reasonable expectation and was relegated to buying cheap $10 ones every six months at BB&amp;B.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All kidding aside, damn well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>The item came quickly, without damage, and exactly as promised by the seller.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to position the mirror completely out of the way when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>After going through a few fog mirrors, this one is definitely the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I have a little nook where soap containers go that I was able to stick it to that was smooth</li>
            <li>Placed on my clean, new tile it seemed it was going to do the job.  </li>
            <li>every couple of days, returns the surface to a smooth, clear image.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked when my mother gave it to me because I was used to just sticking the suction cup to the wall.  </li>
            <li>One handful of water, as directed, and it&#x27;s completely fog free.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The mirror does not fog, even during hot showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item is as described, one splash of hot water and you have all day to shave.</li>
            <li>Some reviews said to splash hot water on it to prevent from fogging up...</li>
            <li>After that one died, I got the Cumberland one, and it was more of the same.  </li>
            <li>I had some reservations about the size, but you can see your entire head reflected in the mirror up-close, and you can get even closer for a good look at specific areas of your face that may need closer examination.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my fair share of &amp;#34;shaving mirrors&amp;#34; over the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li>So far it seems completely fog free.  </li>
            <li>also really like the 360-degree pivot</li>
            <li>I have been using this mirror for a month straight</li>
            <li>I find the shave so much closer than before</li>
            <li>It lives up to it&#x27;s fog free claim, but like all the others, the surface &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; up after the initial month or so.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really much you can say about a mirror.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It really likes to stay in place.</li>
            <li>mean I look really good in this mirror.</li>
            <li>My husband is right handed and recently lost the use of his right arm.  </li>
            <li>tired similar products and this one is the best so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent size.  </li>
            <li>For all you guys that prefer shaving in the shower, I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>his is a greater little mirror.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it can be easily placed on the wall (without ever falling) and then easily removed by turning the base.</li>
            <li>I feel like my old mirrors I was always having to take them off the wall and put them back on to get them in the right position</li>
            <li>, it fogs a bit when the shower initially gets hot, as all mirrors do.  </li>
            <li>That being said, the bar for shower mirrors is pretty low.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>As long as one throws a handful of hot water on the mirror at the outset, shower the mirror is as clear as day for the remainder of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I get a clear reflection and</li>
            <li>So far after a couple of weeks, the mirror has stayed put and hasn&#x27;t fogged up during his shower.</li>
            <li>The swivel arm makes it much easier to use than the standard shower mirror.  </li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin so shaving in the shower is a must for him to avoid breakouts.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about the mirror falling off the wall because it seems that anything with a suction cup isn&#x27;t able to stay up for very long.</li>
            <li>I have had cheap shaving mirrors in the past.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other mirrors we’ve tried this is the only one that is not made of cheap plastic but solid material</li>
            <li>Whereas my old mirror had three smaller suction cups that didn&#x27;t have a problem, this new one has one large suction cup that&#x27;s not able to get a grip.   </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fog up and now my boyfriend actually shaves his whole face and doesn&#x27;t miss one single spot!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is, I wish the razor holder fit my Gillette Fusion razor, but I think a Dremel tool can remedy that.</li>
            <li>This one gives a big, clear image and is totally nonfogging.  </li>
            <li>quick delivery, installed easily, no fog!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of shower mirrors unfortunately and most wake you up in the middle of the night with a loud crash.  </li>

            <li> I often opt to spend more to get a better quality product and early-</li>
            <li> makes this mirror superior to the many other I have owned is the swivel mount</li>
            <li> My previous shower mirror was the kind you filled with warm water</li>
            <li> that is really fog free too!</li>
            <li> There were many and after I read pretty much all of the reviews, I decided to try this mirror since all reviews were excellent, even though it had very few.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> After a lot of searching and trying different shower mirrors, I&#x27;ve finally found one that is perfect in every regard.  </li>
            <li> Now I can do a quick shave without using braille.</li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s kind of a unique method of finding the most advantageous location for the  mirror and locking it down with the rotating screw.</li>
            <li> I had given up on finding one that meets a reasonable expectation and was relegated to buying cheap $10 ones every six months at BB&amp;B.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All kidding aside, damn well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> The item came quickly, without damage, and exactly as promised by the seller.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to position the mirror completely out of the way when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> After going through a few fog mirrors, this one is definitely the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I have a little nook where soap containers go that I was able to stick it to that was smooth</li>
            <li> Placed on my clean, new tile it seemed it was going to do the job.  </li>
            <li> every couple of days, returns the surface to a smooth, clear image.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked when my mother gave it to me because I was used to just sticking the suction cup to the wall.  </li>
            <li> One handful of water, as directed, and it&#x27;s completely fog free.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The mirror does not fog, even during hot showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item is as described, one splash of hot water and you have all day to shave.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said to splash hot water on it to prevent from fogging up...</li>
            <li> After that one died, I got the Cumberland one, and it was more of the same.  </li>
            <li> I had some reservations about the size, but you can see your entire head reflected in the mirror up-close, and you can get even closer for a good look at specific areas of your face that may need closer examination.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my fair share of &amp;#34;shaving mirrors&amp;#34; over the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> So far it seems completely fog free.  </li>
            <li> also really like the 360-degree pivot</li>
            <li> I have been using this mirror for a month straight</li>
            <li> I find the shave so much closer than before</li>
            <li> It lives up to it&#x27;s fog free claim, but like all the others, the surface &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; up after the initial month or so.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really much you can say about a mirror.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It really likes to stay in place.</li>
            <li> mean I look really good in this mirror.</li>
            <li> My husband is right handed and recently lost the use of his right arm.  </li>
            <li> tired similar products and this one is the best so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent size.  </li>
            <li> For all you guys that prefer shaving in the shower, I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> his is a greater little mirror.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it can be easily placed on the wall (without ever falling) and then easily removed by turning the base.</li>
            <li> I feel like my old mirrors I was always having to take them off the wall and put them back on to get them in the right position</li>
            <li> , it fogs a bit when the shower initially gets hot, as all mirrors do.  </li>
            <li> That being said, the bar for shower mirrors is pretty low.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> As long as one throws a handful of hot water on the mirror at the outset, shower the mirror is as clear as day for the remainder of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I get a clear reflection and</li>
            <li> So far after a couple of weeks, the mirror has stayed put and hasn&#x27;t fogged up during his shower.</li>
            <li> The swivel arm makes it much easier to use than the standard shower mirror.  </li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin so shaving in the shower is a must for him to avoid breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the mirror falling off the wall because it seems that anything with a suction cup isn&#x27;t able to stay up for very long.</li>
            <li> I have had cheap shaving mirrors in the past.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other mirrors we’ve tried this is the only one that is not made of cheap plastic but solid material</li>
            <li> Whereas my old mirror had three smaller suction cups that didn&#x27;t have a problem, this new one has one large suction cup that&#x27;s not able to get a grip.   </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fog up and now my boyfriend actually shaves his whole face and doesn&#x27;t miss one single spot!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is, I wish the razor holder fit my Gillette Fusion razor, but I think a Dremel tool can remedy that.</li>
            <li> This one gives a big, clear image and is totally nonfogging.  </li>
            <li> quick delivery, installed easily, no fog!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of shower mirrors unfortunately and most wake you up in the middle of the night with a loud crash.  </li>
            <li> He was having a hard time shaving, since he was right handed.  </li>
            <li> I should have expected this since suction cups in general never really work.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe that it took me this long to start shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It sticks fantastically as long as you don&#x27;t have porous tiles.</li>
            <li> again and this time I lightly wet the back of the suction cup before attaching it.</li>
            <li> I put it in my shower, secured it to the wall, came back later and it had fallen down and shattered into pieces in tub.</li>
            <li> Needs an initial wet down, but otherwise solid.</li>
            <li> I installed it as per the directions and unfortunately it fell off in the middle of the first night.</li>
            <li> When I shave in the shower with my other mirrors would fog up.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It was so confining that once I put those other mirrors on, it was there for life.</li>
            <li> Anyone who shares a shower with a woman knows that it can get crowded with shampoos, conditioners, washes and other paraphernalia even when she is not in there.  </li>
            <li> I, like an idiot, didn&#x27;t twist the suction cup the first time and the mirror dropped pretty hard.</li>
            <li> I think it has some kind of water repellent coating on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s early in the game, but I am optimistic and believe that it will hold up over time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fog up and it doesn&#x27;t fall down.</li>
            <li> Just a flat mirror that loses its &amp;#34;no fog&amp;#34; protection after a month and you have to keep running it under the water ever 5 minutes if you want it to not fog.  </li>
            <li> Well today is the second with this mirror, its suction cup doesn&#x27;t stick, has fallen numerous times, and broke today, sorry</li>
            <li> The tile in my shower has a slight waviness to it.  </li>
            <li> It took a little to get used to, but now I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Its the little things...</li>
            <li> This little mirror sits conveniently off in a corner and comes out to the desired position without being overly intrusive.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of use, this mirror seems to be all that it&#x27;s rated to be.  </li>
            <li> It has fallen several times to the point where the bottom plastic has broken off.  </li>
            <li> next morning, on the shower floor now with razor holder broken in pieces.</li>
            <li> It sticks to the wall firmly and rotates so he never misses a spot when shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a very sturdy base that sticks to the wall simply by twisting it to lock and unlock.  </li>
            <li> I would of rated it a 5 but was a little too small.</li>
            <li> They are either too small or they become tarnished</li>
            <li> Then I remembered I twisted it locked, and so by just twisting it back</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this mirror when my wife brought it home from a local shop because she said that our bathroom mirror always gets so foggy whenever I am in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about the &amp;#34;no fog&amp;#34; part , but it actually doesn&#x27;t fog up, ever.</li>
            <li> All have failed to hold up for long.  </li>
            <li> The suction cup is useless.</li>
            <li> I got sick of the Cassani one because I got annoyed having to run it under the water 3 times every shower</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to move because you ruin the adhesive.  </li>
            <li> No Fog Shower Mirror :(</li>
            <li> And yes I have tightened the stupid suction cup...  </li>
            <li> And the base allows you to twist the mirror to whatever viewing angle you want, which is not something I even considered I wanted until I had it.  </li>
            <li> This one you have to twist the base to lock it to the wall.  </li>
            <li> Once &amp;#34;locked&amp;#34; in by turning the base, the thing WILL NOT COME OFF!  </li>

            <li> Great mirror. Good suction and stays fog free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my fair share of &amp;#34;shaving mirrors&amp;#34; over the past 20 years.  And they invariably suck.  They are either too small or they become tarnished and I have to rub shampoo on it to get 5 minutes before it fogs up again.  This mirror is unique and is the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it fogs a bit when the shower initially gets hot, as all mirrors do.  As long as one throws a handful of hot water on the mirror at the outset, shower the mirror is as clear as day for the remainder of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the 360-degree pivot the mirror is on.  It makes it easy to position the mirror completely out of the way when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the suction, that&#x27;s also different.  Never seen this before in a mirror.  Once &amp;#34;locked&amp;#34; in by turning the base, the thing WILL NOT COME OFF!  I thought I may need to rip it off the wall with a chisel.  Then I remembered I twisted it locked, and so by just twisting it back counter-clockwise, it detached easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After going through a few fog mirrors, this one is definitely the best bang for the buck. It works great and the suction cup actually works.</li>
            <li> Of all the shower mirrors I have tried over the years this one out does them all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mirror for a month straight and I can&#x27;t believe that it took me this long to start shaving in the shower.  I find the shave so much closer than before and I never have any more nicks or cuts.  I was skeptical about this mirror when my wife brought it home from a local shop because she said that our bathroom mirror always gets so foggy whenever I am in the shower.  I don&#x27;t know what the technology is that prevents this mirror from fogging, but I would like to have it for my car windshield.</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror perfect for shaving in the shower</li>
            <li> Best shower mirror out there.&lt;br /&gt;No problems with it at all.Locking Suction cup the best&lt;br /&gt;way to attach to the wall.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality product.  So many shower mirrors I see are nothing but a cheap mirror on cheap plastic or metal.  They all seem to tarnish and fog so easily, but it&#x27;s not a surprise because it looks like they cost 8 cents to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a very sturdy base that sticks to the wall simply by twisting it to lock and unlock.  And the base allows you to twist the mirror to whatever viewing angle you want, which is not something I even considered I wanted until I had it.  I feel like my old mirrors I was always having to take them off the wall and put them back on to get them in the right position so I wasn&#x27;t always hunched over to shave easily.</li>
            <li> Works great. Quick shipping. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Well today is the second with this mirror, its suction cup doesn&#x27;t stick, has fallen numerous times, and broke today, sorry I bought this item</li>
            <li> This is the best shower mirror I have ever owned. That being said, the bar for shower mirrors is pretty low. I had given up on finding one that meets a reasonable expectation and was relegated to buying cheap $10 ones every six months at BB&amp;B.&lt;br /&gt;What makes this mirror superior to the many other I have owned is the swivel mount an the clarity of the mirror. It lives up to it&#x27;s fog free claim, but like all the others, the surface &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; up after the initial month or so. Still this is better than any others I&#x27;ve owned and cleaning the surface with toothpaste (as they recommend) every couple of days, returns the surface to a smooth, clear image. If you are a shower shaver, I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and worth every penny.  Honestly it&#x27;s the first fog-free mirror that I&#x27;ve used that is really fog free too!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, it was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really much you can say about a mirror.  I can see my reflection in it.  It doesn&#x27;t fog.  It&#x27;s a decent size.  It sticks on the wall when you want it to stick. It comes off the wall when you want it off.  You can move the mirror around like you would with a rearview mirror.  So that&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t&#x27;s a mirror.  That you use.  In the shower.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, this mirror seems to be all that it&#x27;s rated to be.  It&#x27;s very well made, the mirror clarity is very good, it is, in fact, fog-free (without any rinsing) and the locking suction cup mechanism feels very solid when used.  I often opt to spend more to get a better quality product and early-on it looks like this was money well-spent.  I have had cheap shaving mirrors in the past.  This one feels like a winner.</li>
            <li> What a piece of garbage.  This thing does not stay stuck on anything.  It has fallen several times to the point where the bottom plastic has broken off.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  And yes I have tightened the stupid suction cup...  Thanks No Fog Shower Mirror :(</li>
            <li> quick delivery, installed easily, no fog!</li>
            <li> Item is good quality. It has remained fog-free since I&#x27;ve bought it.  It also stays securely on the wall.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend shaves in the shower but never actually used a mirror to do it!  I&#x27;ve never seen a mirror that has a suction cup like this.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked when my mother gave it to me because I was used to just sticking the suction cup to the wall.  This one you have to twist the base to lock it to the wall.  It took a little to get used to, but now I like it a lot.  It&#x27;s easier to put on the wall and take off if you want to use it.</li>
            <li> his is a greater little mirror.  Suction works great.  Love that I can move the mirror.  The twisty bendy arm comes in a lot more handy than I thought it would.  I find myself adjusting the mirror almost every shower to get it in perfect position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; mirror, the all-important question is &amp;#34;does it actually prevent fog&amp;#34;.  One handful of water, as directed, and it&#x27;s completely fog free.</li>
            <li> Great mirror, suction cup actually works and it doesn&#x27;t fog up like all the others that I have tried.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> After a lot of searching and trying different shower mirrors, I&#x27;ve finally found one that is perfect in every regard.  I can sum up my opinion of this &amp;#34;No Fog Shower Mirror&amp;#34; in one word.  Superlative. Exactly what I was looking for.  I had some reservations about the size, but you can see your entire head reflected in the mirror up-close, and you can get even closer for a good look at specific areas of your face that may need closer examination.  I&#x27;ve used this mirror in the shower to shave, and I&#x27;ve also used it to apply facial scrubs and creams with a water-proof rotating facial brush. It adheres strongly with suction, and I&#x27;m not worried about it going anywhere until I release the rotating locking ring, and coax/beg it off my polished marble shower wall. It really likes to stay in place. Best to find a spot you like the first time, by the second attempt for sure. Great products with simple mechanics for reliable setup, like this one, are real joy to find.</li>
            <li> tired similar products and this one is the best so far</li>
            <li> My previous shower mirror was the kind you filled with warm water and it was okay. After some time it still looked like you were trying to see details in a cartoon mirror. This thing somehow works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and the quality of the mirror is stellar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean I look really good in this mirror. It may be magic. All kidding aside, damn well worth the purchase. I can&#x27;t believe I was considering some contraption that connected to the shower head or used batteries to heat the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sticks fantastically as long as you don&#x27;t have porous tiles. Nothing sticks on that.</li>
            <li> Best shower mirror I have ever had. Does everything it says!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of shower mirrors unfortunately and most wake you up in the middle of the night with a loud crash.  So far , my new NO FOG SHOWER MIRROR has a great locking system, extremely no fog and looks great . Thank you for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love the pivot feature-- lightweight and really does stay fog free!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised- very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  When I shave in the shower with my other mirrors would fog up.  This one doesn&#x27;t, every guy should have one of these!</li>
            <li> Broke trying to put up!! Don&#x27;t buy...</li>
            <li> So far so good, but suction cup does not work on textured tile. Luckily I have a little nook where soap containers go that I was able to stick it to that was smooth</li>
            <li> This is definitely an excellent product.  My husband is right handed and recently lost the use of his right arm.  He was having a hard time shaving, since he was right handed.  Also he likes to shave with shaving cream and water.  We purchased a battery operated shaver that could be used in water which was perfect, except he was having a problem using it over a small  sink in the bathroom. Water was splashing everywhere.  I checked Amazon to see if I could find a mirror that could be used in the shower.  There were many and after I read pretty much all of the reviews, I decided to try this mirror since all reviews were excellent, even though it had very few.  It was easy to install, holds perfectly to the smooth tile surface of shower, mirror not distorted, and does not steam up.  He shaves and uses the no fog shower mirror every day and loves it!!</li>
            <li> This mirror is really good. I, like an idiot, didn&#x27;t twist the suction cup the first time and the mirror dropped pretty hard. Thankfully it is constructed well and it hasn&#x27;t fallen since. I like the razor holder too, well thought out. Its the little things...</li>
            <li> Nice mirror. Not to bulky and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made. I installed it as per the directions and unfortunately it fell off in the middle of the first night. Cleaned the wall (cultured marble) again and this time I lightly wet the back of the suction cup before attaching it. The directions say this is not necessary but since I reinstalled it this way it has not come off. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This one actually works. Buy It</li>
            <li> Love the way it can be easily placed on the wall (without ever falling) and then easily removed by turning the base. Great mirror.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who wanted to be able to shave in the shower. I was a little worried about the mirror falling off the wall because it seems that anything with a suction cup isn&#x27;t able to stay up for very long. So far after a couple of weeks, the mirror has stayed put and hasn&#x27;t fogged up during his shower. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Although this one promises to hold on smooth surface, that was not the case.  Placed on my clean, new tile it seemed it was going to do the job.  Going back to the bathroom a couple hours later, found it on the shower floor.  Re-wiped the surface...tightened as instructed...maybe this time...next morning, on the shower floor now with razor holder broken in pieces.</li>
            <li> Best shower mirror I have purchased</li>
            <li> Very Good mirror.  As Advertised.  No issues with it.</li>
            <li> Locks onto tile and I think you could do pull-ups with it.  Genuinely fog free.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I would of rated it a 5 but was a little too small.</li>
            <li> Wow! I have had a number of shower mirrors through the years and all were lacking in some respect. You know, like falling off the shower wall and sometimes breaking, a supposedly fogless mirror eventually fogging up, distorted reflection, etc. Well, I have had none of those issues with this mirror. I was really skeptical about the &amp;#34;no fog&amp;#34; part , but it actually doesn&#x27;t fog up, ever. Yea!!! I get a clear reflection and the rotating locking device is great. To me it&#x27;s kind of a unique method of finding the most advantageous location for the  mirror and locking it down with the rotating screw. When you set the locking device, it feels like the mirror will actually stay in place. For all you guys that prefer shaving in the shower, I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Birthday gift for Hubby. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Very high quality with a great &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; lock and unlock to attach to any smooth surface!</li>
            <li> works great. does not fog. would recomend</li>
            <li> Nice mirror.  So far it seems completely fog free.  The twist lock suction cup works way better than any others I have used.  My only complaint is, I wish the razor holder fit my Gillette Fusion razor, but I think a Dremel tool can remedy that.</li>
            <li> Excellent shower mirror. Works great as advertise.</li>
            <li> Suction cup couldn&#x27;t attach to the tile in my shower whereas the mirror it replaced was able to without any issue.  The tile in my shower has a slight waviness to it.  Whereas my old mirror had three smaller suction cups that didn&#x27;t have a problem, this new one has one large suction cup that&#x27;s not able to get a grip.   Had to attach it to the glass on the shower door.  Other than that, it looks good. Super fast shipping.  Excellent transaction.</li>
            <li> The suction cup is great, keeping the base affixed to the wall. What&#x27;s even better is that the mirror pivots and moves, so that you can put it at the angle that is most comfortable. The mirror does not fog, even during hot showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that it comes with a piece of protective plastic over the mirror during shipment that must be peeled off upon receipt. I am considering purchasing another for my guest bathroom. I like this product!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!  The swivel arm makes it much easier to use than the standard shower mirror.  The item came quickly, without damage, and exactly as promised by the seller.</li>
            <li> Fog-free feature works great! It took a while to get it to stick to our shower wall, though. There&#x27;s definitely a trick to it!</li>
            <li> Great mirror. This is not one of those cheap ones. It doesn&#x27;t fog up and it doesn&#x27;t fall down.</li>
            <li> Item is as described, one splash of hot water and you have all day to shave. Suction cup is strong and has no problem holding in place even when moving the mirror.  No complaints, 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This mirror is by the far the best I&#x27;ve seen for shower mirrors! It doesn&#x27;t fog up and now my boyfriend actually shaves his whole face and doesn&#x27;t miss one single spot! The spot for the razor is great too, now it&#x27;s not just sitting on the side of the tub!</li>
            <li> I gotta say I&#x27;m impressed. Some reviews said to splash hot water on it to prevent from fogging up... I didn&#x27;t have to do that yet. The mirror is inside my shower. I think it has some kind of water repellent coating on.&lt;br /&gt;And, I especially like the locking to-the-wall mechanism. Wouldn&#x27;t buy without it.</li>
            <li> Solid mirror. My husband has sensitive skin so shaving in the shower is a must for him to avoid breakouts. A friend of mine had recommended this so I bought one for my house and my husband loves it. Compared to other mirrors we’ve tried this is the only one that is not made of cheap plastic but solid material (so we have peace of mind that it won’t break if it falls). It sticks to the wall firmly and rotates so he never misses a spot when shaving. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works as posted. Needs an initial wet down, but otherwise solid.</li>
            <li> What a keeper this mirror is! Perfect for every guy. Just when I thought my beard trimming couldn&#x27;t look any better!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> Great product, no fog at all, easy to install, and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I have owned each of the two best selling mirrors on Amazon.  I got sick of the Cassani one because I got annoyed having to run it under the water 3 times every shower and it&#x27;s impossible to move because you ruin the adhesive.  After that one died, I got the Cumberland one, and it was more of the same.  Just a flat mirror that loses its &amp;#34;no fog&amp;#34; protection after a month and you have to keep running it under the water ever 5 minutes if you want it to not fog.  So after a bathroom renovation, I figured I would get a different one.  I decided to &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; and spend another $15 to get one that looked nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy I did.  It&#x27;s not even comparable to the others.  This mirror is leaps and bounds better.  The fact that I can move the mirror is a huge add to me.  It was so confining that once I put those other mirrors on, it was there for life.</li>
            <li> This mirror works awesome and it even rotates. Finally found a quality shower mirror!</li>
            <li> Simply put the mirror works great.......easy to install......there&#x27;s nothing left to say......try it !</li>
            <li> Anyone who shares a shower with a woman knows that it can get crowded with shampoos, conditioners, washes and other paraphernalia even when she is not in there.  This little mirror sits conveniently off in a corner and comes out to the desired position without being overly intrusive.  Now I can do a quick shave without using braille.</li>
            <li> The suction cup is useless. I put it in my shower, secured it to the wall, came back later and it had fallen down and shattered into pieces in tub. I should have expected this since suction cups in general never really work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of these over the years. This one is light years ahead if the rest.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a couple of weeks and so far is working great!</li>
            <li> Finally one that actually works. Stays on the wall and doesn&#x27;t fog up. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Best shower mirror I&#x27;ve tried, and I have tried several.  All have failed to hold up for long.  This one gives a big, clear image and is totally nonfogging.  It&#x27;s early in the game, but I am optimistic and believe that it will hold up over time.</li>
