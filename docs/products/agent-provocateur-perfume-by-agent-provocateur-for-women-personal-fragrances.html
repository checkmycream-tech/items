            <li> Although, I have had maybe a handful of people  make the old lady smell comment over the past 12 years of use... not enough to sway my feelings on it!</li>
            <li> Your bottles must have been sitting in the warehouse way too long.</li>
            <li> but fragrance doesnt seem distinctive as expected &amp; does not seem to last ??</li>
            <li> However, the perfume which sent to me by this seller, is not real one.</li>
            <li> I know this, because I myself shipped them to other discount companies like yourself all over the United States.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> Wish I would have complained earlier or maybe I could have gotten an exchange.  </li>
            <li> It has this seductive, musky and feminine smell that isn&#x27;t overly floral or heavy.</li>
            <li> Provacative and just plain yummy, scentful!  </li>
            <li> The perfume smells old and bad.</li>
            <li> Not sure where it went bad?!</li>
            <li> is because they are BAD or DEFECTIVE in someway.</li>
            <li> However, we never sent BAD perfume like yours.</li>
            <li> 100% bad perfume &amp; 100%</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Agent Provocateur for many years. However, the perfume which sent to me by this seller, is not real one. it doesn&#x27;t smell as real agent prov. actually, it doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have some doubts if this perfume is faked. If I can, I will try to contact with a police department which is occupying with faked items and counterfeiting.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I bought 3 items by this seller and these items cannot be returned. maybe, counterfeiting department will be interest in this seller.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent! It has this seductive, musky and feminine smell that isn&#x27;t overly floral or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent since I was 18 years old. I&#x27;m thirty now, and while I&#x27;ll try new frangrances here and there, I always come back to this one! I get so many compliments on it. Whenever I&#x27;m out and greeting friends with hugs, most of my guy friends will comment on how good I smell. Although, I have had maybe a handful of people  make the old lady smell comment over the past 12 years of use... not enough to sway my feelings on it! It&#x27;s a Classic floral fragrance for a classy lady!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find it after falling in love with the scent when my friend wore it.  When it arrived - I open it and used it.  It didn&#x27;t smell good at all!  It smelled of alcohol.  Wish I would have complained earlier or maybe I could have gotten an exchange.  Not sure where it went bad?!</li>
            <li> Sophisticated and elegant for evenings, I found that smells really strong when first out of the bottle almost overpowering, but eventually the softer notes come into play and its not overwhelming. If you are new to this product I personally recommed that you find a sample, it is not to everyones liking.</li>
            <li> This company has been graded a C- with the BBB (Better Business Bureau) See below:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Name: AAA Perfume Merchants&lt;br /&gt;Phone: (201) 941-1835&lt;br /&gt;Address: 568 Broad Ave Ste 1&lt;br /&gt;Ridgefield, NJ 07657-2335&lt;br /&gt;Website: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the original perfume is delicious, what your company sent was not. Doesn&#x27;t even smell close to the original. Your bottles must have been sitting in the warehouse way too long. The perfume smells old and bad. Let&#x27;s not forget to mention that the packaging enclosing the item was OPENED, though AAA Merchants deny it.&lt;br /&gt;Dear AAA, Now I&#x27;m going to address the email you sent me... What you don&#x27;t know is that I have worked for this company &amp; the owners in London. The main reason companies like yourselves are able to buy highend perfumes at a low cost is because they are BAD or DEFECTIVE in someway. Whether it be the packaging, the bottle, the lettering on the bottle or even the perfume itself. However, we never sent BAD perfume like yours. I know this, because I myself shipped them to other discount companies like yourself all over the United States.&lt;br /&gt;So while you may say direct from the manufacturer, it is true...It went direct from manufacturer to the original company, then to you because of the defects.&lt;br /&gt;I only wanted an exchange for the same thing considering what you sent me is 100% bad perfume &amp; 100% unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;I vow to never buy ANYTHING from AAA Merchants again. And, I promise you, will do my best to dissuade anyone from using your services. I may have lost $54.27 + shipping now, but you will be losing way more than that in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate your understanding and patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;A Customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great company I have ordered from before:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> The best ever... This is the best for sure. Good price and good quality.. Recommend it highly. Will keep using it again.</li>
            <li> An all time favorite of mine. I love it and will probably continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> quick arrival &amp; brand new.....but fragrance doesnt seem distinctive as expected &amp; does not seem to last ?? not sellers fault</li>
            <li> Agent Provocateur by Agent Provocaterur 100mL 3.3oz EDP Spray&lt;br /&gt;Agent Provocateur&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great perfume&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and always get lots of compliments. Always have an extra bottle at hand.</li>
            <li> This is the most fab perfume you&#x27;ll ever wear!  Provacative and just plain yummy, scentful!  Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> Love this  perfume very much!&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to get it for half-price.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I fully believe this is a knock off. The smell is much stronger of alcohol than then perfume. I sent a message to the seller but no response.</li>
            <li> My signature scent for years now. Adore this scent and have bought many products in their line. Sexy, alluring, soft, kinda powdery but a little musky. Like when you lean into a woman by chance and smell her and she smells so good you want to get close enough to her again to try and smell her again. That&#x27;s how I hope this smells to people when I wear it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and this is the only place I could find it with a decent prcie.  Will order again.</li>
