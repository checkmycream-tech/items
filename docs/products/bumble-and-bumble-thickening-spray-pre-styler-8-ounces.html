            <li>I&#x27;ve been using B&amp;B Thickening Spray in combo with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverStrong Volume Shampoo and Conditioner with great results.  </li>

            <li>Great product as always</li>

            <li>happy with price and delivery.</li>
            <li>Great product, good deal</li>
            <li>I think the best thing about this stuff is that is smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>My hair just isn&#x27;t as nice without it!</li>
            <li>Best stuff on the market for fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair fairly often, and it&#x27;s been a while since it has looked that</li>
            <li>(The one spray that smells actively good is Aveda Air Control).</li>
            <li>But when I&#x27;ve used it alone, the results have not been as good, hence the four stars.  </li>
            <li>and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>I received Bumble and Bumble Thickening Hair Spray from Good Looking Discounts.</li>
            <li>so I am always looking for a good deal on it.</li>
            <li>Good for the day.</li>
            <li>But when I layer it with a styling spray I get a very sexy, tousled, bedhead look</li>
            <li>Always a great product, wish more salons carried it.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the</li>
            <li>i love this product!</li>
            <li>I used to love this thickening spray (now called thickening hairspray)!  </li>
            <li>once more!  </li>
            <li>I love B&amp;B thickening spray!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Glad they carry this on amazon!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year and love it!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I also think it would be great for fine hair</li>
            <li>Gave great body to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Kind of amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice hairspray, but I have not noticed any thickening taking place.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Got a sample of this product at Sephora and liked it.  </li>
            <li>But I think this is a great combination of drug store salon brands that makes my hair look full and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love this because it is easy to apply after I shampoo my hair and gives great volume to very fine hair.</li>
            <li>This this hairspray works good on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, lightweight thickening spray that works better than any otherI have used.  </li>
            <li>As far as B &amp; B products go...this is the best way to purchase them.  </li>
            <li>If you put in on at exactly the right moisture when you want to get a good curl, it&#x27;s a good to great product.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and this product gives me some body.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised and pleased to see that included with my order was a beautiful stuffed animal plus samples of additional hair products!</li>
            <li>Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
            <li>Great transaction - quick and easy.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been able to minimize this by applying a flexible hold hairspray like the one sold by Garnier Fructis.  </li>
            <li>It holds my style better throughout the day, too.</li>
            <li>So glad that I found this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li>As the thickening spray dries, it becomes tacky (sticky) and that is when it does its magic.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It gives my hair body, keeps it from getting static electricity</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I think the spray makes my hair feel somewhat thicker, but Air Control works much better.</li>
            <li>Since when adding alcohol to a product is better for consumers?  </li>
            <li>Will never buy again, and moving away from Bumble and bumble, who seem to make too many changes to their products.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I do love BB</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the results I get when I layer it with another product.  </li>
            <li>it was a thickening spray, and made blowouts easier and with better results.  </li>
            <li>I like application after blow-drying my hair better than before.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, and it keeps my hair looking thicker even 3 days after washing.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair thickener because it doesn&#x27;t feel still or gummy</li>
            <li>Thicker and more substantial looking.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>A lot of the techniques advised by beauty magazines, and most of their product recommendations for &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair just don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>And it makes me look like I have more volume at the roots than I</li>
            <li>I love this product and always save up to buy it...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is pricey....</li>

            <li>Love it, have used it for years</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I think this would work best for either short layered styles or all one length styles.</li>
            <li>have used this product for some time and just love it...</li>
            <li>Most &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34;  products make my hair look like Albert Einstein&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this spray.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>it will make my hair feel a bit more tacky than I like.</li>
            <li>Its not gooey or sticky and like a nice light spray.</li>
            <li>love it, have used it for years...</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good thickening spray.  </li>
            <li>I loved the way the product was packaged and appreciated the thank you gifts!</li>
            <li>She loved it so much that I decided to buy one for myself!</li>
            <li>This is a great product- natural volume without sticky or crispy looking/feeling hair.</li>
            <li>It works best when applied on clean hair (since I am a daily washer, that is fine by me).&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and give just the right beachy wave texture on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely left my stringy hair looking great, but I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone touching my hair after I used this.  </li>
            <li>My hair did not feel as good as it normally does, and it made my head itch.</li>
            <li>I have thinning, fine, shoulder-length flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>I have spider web fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for fine hair to keep it looking fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>Stylist uses this when curling my ultra fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It adds body to my baby fine hair and makes it look fuller.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be make my fine hair thicker</li>
            <li>My on-line order worked fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light, but strong and all my attempts to find a drugstore dupe have been futile.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my fine hair have more body  and stays that way !  </li>
            <li>GREAT GREAT GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a product that could help me with my desperately thin (and thinning),</li>
            <li>It does lift the hair and make it easier to control, but did not make the hair feels comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is light pump spray that I use before my hair drys to give it some body.  </li>
            <li>Light spraying and running my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li>The product is definitely light hold.</li>
            <li>This does not make your hair tacky and adds body with a silky smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Great spray that last all day!  </li>
            <li>It really gives a nice hold to my hair as a setting lotion</li>
            <li>I spray it on my roots and it totally gives volume and looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>Light hold.</li>
            <li>Fantastic after every shampoo -- cannot do without it.</li>
            <li>It makes my very fine, straight hair so full!  </li>
            <li>I just love it makes your hair feel so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>just a light clean smell.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the purchase, I have been using it for more than 1 year, i only wish that it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m now on the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I noticed the third bottle didn&#x27;t make my hair as full... it also had a more pleasant fragrance (not the burning in my lungs that i experienced with my first two bottles)...</li>
            <li>I am willing to pay more for a product if it does the job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth the price!  </li>
            <li>The best lightweight yet firm holding hairspray!</li>
            <li>I love Bumble and Bumble products and this product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I keep trying different combinations, but so far I have been just moderately impressed.</li>
            <li>If it works great and has been working great for years, why change it for something mediocre?</li>
            <li>This product works great for my baby fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>So, the search is back on for a product that will make my hair as gorgeous as B&amp;b thickening SPRAY used to do.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Thickening Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After trying a sample of this product I took the plunge and bought the full size.  </li>
            <li>I have lived with this fine, thin hair for 62 years and it feels really good to have a product that works!!!!</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin aging hair and this has proved to be the best product for adding fulness.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this spray gives my hair so much body!  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and love this one and will finally stick to this.  </li>
            <li>Not the case anymore as the product is super sticky.  </li>
            <li>I was out of this and needed to get it quick.</li>
            <li>Every morning I dampen my roots with the thickening spray and quickly blow it with a hair drier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge skeptic when it comes to hair products, but the thickening spray really works!  </li>
            <li>And a bottle this size lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>It was worth the high price before but not any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years to help lightly thicken my very fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>The combination of these two products gives me a great blow dry that lasts for a couple of days on my straight hair.</li>
            <li>It gives the hair great texture and a little bit of hold without limiting movement.  </li>
            <li>I did try many products this is the only company that puts out a product for fine hair that works.</li>
            <li>I purchase this thickener every few months, and continue to be happy with it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This product is wonderful for thin, lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It also has changed the smell, which used to be fresh and is now...</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money paid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Has a distinct alcohol odor.</li>
            <li>Worth the $.</li>
            <li>But the right amount works wonders.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s so on trend right now.  </li>
            <li>I quite like the effect I get with this new formula, but then I really liked the old one too.  </li>
            <li>It really adds volume to my straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The end result is clean feeling, soft, full hair.</li>
            <li>This product is very good, but I didn&#x27;t have the same result that I expected.</li>
            <li>Although the price has gone up and the bottle grows smaller over the years and it is not often available for free Prime shipping, I&#x27;m still hooked.</li>
            <li>I would very much like to return this.  </li>
            <li>This spray is great if you have fine hair and want a little extra thickness to your curls.</li>
            <li>This stuff gives my hair so much volume and makes it shiney and pretty!</li>
            <li>I suppose you might get even greater effects if you blow dry, but frankly, when I&#x27;ve done that, my hair ends up super tangled which leads to breakage when I brush it.</li>
            <li>This is the first Bumble and Bumble product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will be my first B&amp;B purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I finally have some volume for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I keep hoping that Bumble and Bumble products are going to work better than they actually do.</li>
            <li>May as well spray water on it, no more effective than that!</li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife wanted.  </li>
            <li>For this price, I definitely expecting to have more than the most basic benefits.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different volumizing products.  </li>
            <li>It definitely adds some heft to my tresses and makes them look more voluminous.  </li>
            <li>I use BB Thickening Hairspray first and then add BB</li>
            <li>and it definitely looks like I have more hair.  </li>
            <li>On my damp hair I use Bumble and Bumble Styling Lotion first and then spray this product over before blow drying.  </li>
            <li>It does help some on those hot, sweaty, wind-blown days.  </li>
            <li>This spray is nothing short of a magic wand.</li>
            <li>This product did a good job on my flat and fine hair but after using it for about a week it weighed my hair down and made it look and feel greasy, didn&#x27;t work for me and isn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
            <li>but it is very fine and really long</li>
            <li>I rarely order hair spray of any particular brand more than once, but I am on my fourth bottle of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight styling spray that works well with my fine hair, not stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product to ever successfully thicken my very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>The volume it created looked dry and more like straw</li>
            <li>in fact a true aerosol spray seems to work better for the everyday hold I need.</li>
            <li>Wish the bottle was bigger but it gives my hair great volume without weighing it down</li>
            <li>B&amp;b&#x27;s response was that they had to comply with certain health regulations...?  </li>
            <li>This made my fine hair actually look stringy at the ends.</li>
            <li>This does not have the same thickening effect anymore, i need to spray 3 times more to feel 1/4 of the effect, the hair remains softer than with previous versions (which is good), but the hold is just not the same...</li>
            <li>I have straight silver colored hair, so I am always looking for products that give volume and shine.  </li>
            <li>is a beauty secret I am happy to share...</li>
            <li>It worked about the same as cheap drugstore hairspray.</li>
            <li>The product use to make hair smooth, bouncy, shiny and add lots of volume and, for someone like me who washes her hair every 2-3 days, I could spray it back on in the morning, use the blowdryer and...</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>I am really amazed at how well it works.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a finishing spray so the name &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really correct.  </li>
            <li>But my hair is really resistant</li>
            <li>They work really well together</li>
            <li>If I put too much (which doesn&#x27;t require that much product) then my hair feels sticky.</li>
            <li>this one really does make my hair look thicker..</li>
            <li>It really does thicken your locks but is pricey.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Really like this for summertime hair.  </li>
            <li>This really thickens my hair with no stiffness.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair so much volume, and it even makes it feel thicker.</li>
            <li>My choice for years is now so much easier to find and order.</li>
            <li>I love it - spray on while hair is wet and then style.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>You can really see a difference after applying this spray and blow drying your hair.</li>
            <li>The volume doesn&#x27;t last for the whole day but considering I have extremely thin hair, this is already a great progress!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair fuller and can style it much easier</li>
            <li>I actually use a dryer very rarely</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, which is probably a good thing given that most spray smells unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li>I love how it dries completely and isn&#x27;t sticky and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>I almost sent this back because it was so expensive, but it turns out that I am using it the most - even more than the smooth in stuff.  </li>
            <li>(my stylist used all B&amp;B products) but I have been so pleased with the thickening spray, I may need to break down and buy them as well.</li>
            <li>Been using this for 10 years and can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>This new formula can be sticky if you spray too much</li>
            <li>It was nothing at all like the typical product, rather much more like water.  </li>
            <li>When hair is dry the spray gives a light hold.</li>
            <li>This more expensive product is when I have to look &#x27;better&#x27; and the difference shows after styling.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and only wish I had discovered it earlier.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for B&amp;B Thickening Spray, that were soon dashed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, especially for fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li>Upon purchasing this product, I&#x27;d hoped it would be equivilant to the product I normally purchase at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Thickening spray was my favorite of ALL my beauty products but now it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li>and then add a few spritzes of BB Thickening Hairspray on top or</li>
            <li>It gives more volume and body without being sticky or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>my hair is naturally wavy in some areas and thinner and less manageable on the top.  </li>
            <li>So it dries fairly quickly, but I learned long ago, that it helps to use the Bumble &amp; Bumble thickening spray.  </li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend it and it lasted a long time since you do need to use very much.</li>
            <li>I need to find a new thickening product.</li>
            <li>Oh well, time to find a new volumizing spray...</li>
            <li>cant live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Halas, they have changed the formula, adding alcohol to the new one, which makes hair super dry, sticky and straw-like.  </li>
            <li>I use it before I dry my hair for a super sleek look with volume</li>
            <li>I had attributed the great finish my hair had due to her styling technique, but finally decided to break down and purchase this thickening spray.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that if I get a little over excited and spray too much of the spray</li>
            <li>I hope other will find success with this combo!</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this product for the past year and I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After years of trying out sprays, shampoos and conditioners, I came across this and - WOW!  </li>
            <li>Thickening Spray is probably the first and only one that</li>
            <li>I accidentally ordered 2 bottles but after the first couple uses decided to keep the second bottle instead of returning it</li>
            <li>I love both products, and together I think they add lots of body and texture to my otherwise slick hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin, straight, Asian hair if that serves as a good reference.</li>
            <li>I spray it on the roots as best as possible while my hair is wet and then dry as usual.</li>
            <li>But a quick brush through and my hair is soft again, so it&#x27;s really no biggie.  </li>
            <li>I use it while blow drying, and although it makes my hair slightly less soft, it also makes it MUCH fuller and bouncier, well worth the trade</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the spray on my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell reminds me a bit of toothpaste, but it doesn&#x27;t stick, and is quickly covered up by the scent of other products, say, hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is still soft not stiff.</li>
            <li>For those who think this product is not working, you are most likely allowing your hair to air dry (which would make your hair stick together in an undesirable flat position).</li>
            <li>Here is why: it works!&lt;br /&gt;The product does not have any smell, is clear, and does require generous application</li>
            <li>I was completely floored -</li>
            <li>By itself, it doesn&#x27;t really have any hold so in my experience, it definitely needs the addition of a styling spray.  </li>
            <li>but too much would definitely add weight.  </li>
            <li>The old formula did just that:  </li>
            <li>When I curl it, it holds my hair, without that crusty hairspray feel, leaving it soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>My hair is not limp and has body throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I use it very sparingly so it last longer.</li>
            <li>My normally wavy hair is straight and shiny and not nearly as anemic as before.  </li>
            <li>Love that it only takes a few sprays to get volume and control, and that you can layer it without it flaking or attracting dirt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that this leave no residue and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down at all.</li>
            <li>Gives my fine blonde hair a little more body with out being sticky or heavy!</li>
            <li>It seems to give my straight, flat hair volume.</li>
            <li>B&amp;B&#x27;s Thickening Spray is rather expensive, but it really does give fine, limp hair more volume.</li>
            <li>I have super straight and heavy asian type hair</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time as I have a very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair and I like to make it look thicker.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, I have been using it for the past year.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin and very fine textured.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I quit in order to give other products a try, but I always quickly come back.</li>
            <li>so it definitely was new damage.  </li>
            <li>I recently discovered it, now can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I spray it on my freshly clean hair when it is wet, then flip my head over and blow dry.</li>
            <li>However, it lasts a lot longer than you might think (although it&#x27;s easy to overdo), at least for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to gauge how much I need with my hair dry.</li>
            <li>When I blow dry my hair straight, I&#x27;ll spray this on my damp hair before hand.</li>
            <li>I spray it on damp hair, blow dry&amp; it lasts all day...or really until I have to wash my hair again.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I&#x27;ve forgotten to use it within my morning makeup/hair routine, and before I&#x27;m very far into my day, I can tell.</li>
            <li>The next day I looked in the mirror and the ends were completely split!  </li>
            <li>and apparently ingredients have changed!  </li>
            <li>If you want to use it ad-hoc for varying functions from taming a stray hair to setting a blow dry style; don&#x27;t see anything special that I couldn&#x27;t get with just about any other product --</li>
            <li>The final result looks really natural.</li>
            <li>It actually does what it says it will do, BUT my hair is protein sensitive and this contains protein.  </li>
            <li>But if you use a small amount and are using a good hydrating conditioner, you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems (at least I haven&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much time or patience in the morning to style my hair like the professionals but with just a few sprays and 5 minutes of blow drying, my short, thin, straight hair is frizz-free, more voluminous, and tamed (especially living in humid weather where frizz is a given).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get sticky when on wet hair, but when you blow dry with a brush, it gets less sticky and that is when the magic begins!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>volume less and straight hair; This is THE ONE!</li>
            <li>I can comb my hair thru a couple of times a day, and still not loose its shape.</li>
            <li>This works very well and does not make my scalp itch as  some other hair product.</li>
            <li>The normal scent was not present, the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long.  </li>
            <li>No other product necessary.</li>
            <li>We had a little bit higher exception before making the purchase.</li>
            <li>So much that I tend to transfer the contents of the bottle into spray bottle that releases the liquid faster, so as to cut down on application</li>
            <li>It works very well to add volume, and does not weigh down or make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li>If your not protein sensitive or your hair is not inclined to look dry, then you can give this one a try</li>
            <li>This spray is just enough to give my hair a thickness to style but not too much to weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>Especially since I have very fine and thin hair!  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine but this makes it worse.  </li>
            <li>too much leaves my roots a little greasy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My hair just isn&#x27;t as nice without it!</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the market for fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair fairly often, and it&#x27;s been a while since it has looked that</li>
            <li> (The one spray that smells actively good is Aveda Air Control).</li>
            <li> But when I&#x27;ve used it alone, the results have not been as good, hence the four stars.  </li>
            <li> and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li> I received Bumble and Bumble Thickening Hair Spray from Good Looking Discounts.</li>
            <li> so I am always looking for a good deal on it.</li>
            <li> Good for the day.</li>
            <li> But when I layer it with a styling spray I get a very sexy, tousled, bedhead look</li>
            <li> Always a great product, wish more salons carried it.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the</li>
            <li> i love this product!</li>
            <li> I used to love this thickening spray (now called thickening hairspray)!  </li>
            <li> once more!  </li>
            <li> I love B&amp;B thickening spray!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Glad they carry this on amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and love it!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I also think it would be great for fine hair</li>
            <li> Gave great body to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Kind of amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice hairspray, but I have not noticed any thickening taking place.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this product at Sephora and liked it.  </li>
            <li> But I think this is a great combination of drug store salon brands that makes my hair look full and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I love this because it is easy to apply after I shampoo my hair and gives great volume to very fine hair.</li>
            <li> This this hairspray works good on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight thickening spray that works better than any otherI have used.  </li>
            <li> As far as B &amp; B products go...this is the best way to purchase them.  </li>
            <li> If you put in on at exactly the right moisture when you want to get a good curl, it&#x27;s a good to great product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and this product gives me some body.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised and pleased to see that included with my order was a beautiful stuffed animal plus samples of additional hair products!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
            <li> Great transaction - quick and easy.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been able to minimize this by applying a flexible hold hairspray like the one sold by Garnier Fructis.  </li>
            <li> It holds my style better throughout the day, too.</li>
            <li> So glad that I found this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> As the thickening spray dries, it becomes tacky (sticky) and that is when it does its magic.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It gives my hair body, keeps it from getting static electricity</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I think the spray makes my hair feel somewhat thicker, but Air Control works much better.</li>
            <li> Since when adding alcohol to a product is better for consumers?  </li>
            <li> Will never buy again, and moving away from Bumble and bumble, who seem to make too many changes to their products.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I do love BB</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the results I get when I layer it with another product.  </li>
            <li> it was a thickening spray, and made blowouts easier and with better results.  </li>
            <li> I like application after blow-drying my hair better than before.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, and it keeps my hair looking thicker even 3 days after washing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair thickener because it doesn&#x27;t feel still or gummy</li>
            <li> Thicker and more substantial looking.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> A lot of the techniques advised by beauty magazines, and most of their product recommendations for &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair just don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> And it makes me look like I have more volume at the roots than I</li>
            <li> I love this product and always save up to buy it...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the bumble and bumble productsâ€¦.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is pricey....</li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it, have used it for years</li>
            <li> and I love it...</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I think this would work best for either short layered styles or all one length styles.</li>
            <li> have used this product for some time and just love it...</li>
            <li> Most &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34;  products make my hair look like Albert Einstein&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this spray.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> it will make my hair feel a bit more tacky than I like.</li>
            <li> Its not gooey or sticky and like a nice light spray.</li>
            <li> love it, have used it for years...</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good thickening spray.  </li>
            <li> I loved the way the product was packaged and appreciated the thank you gifts!</li>
            <li> She loved it so much that I decided to buy one for myself!</li>
            <li> This is a great product- natural volume without sticky or crispy looking/feeling hair.</li>
            <li> It works best when applied on clean hair (since I am a daily washer, that is fine by me).&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and give just the right beachy wave texture on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely left my stringy hair looking great, but I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone touching my hair after I used this.  </li>
            <li> My hair did not feel as good as it normally does, and it made my head itch.</li>
            <li> I have thinning, fine, shoulder-length flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> I have spider web fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for fine hair to keep it looking fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> Stylist uses this when curling my ultra fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It adds body to my baby fine hair and makes it look fuller.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be make my fine hair thicker</li>
            <li> My on-line order worked fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light, but strong and all my attempts to find a drugstore dupe have been futile.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my fine hair have more body  and stays that way !  </li>
            <li> GREAT GREAT GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a product that could help me with my desperately thin (and thinning),</li>
            <li> It does lift the hair and make it easier to control, but did not make the hair feels comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is light pump spray that I use before my hair drys to give it some body.  </li>
            <li> Light spraying and running my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li> The product is definitely light hold.</li>
            <li> This does not make your hair tacky and adds body with a silky smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Great spray that last all day!  </li>
            <li> It really gives a nice hold to my hair as a setting lotion</li>
            <li> I spray it on my roots and it totally gives volume and looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Light hold.</li>
            <li> Fantastic after every shampoo -- cannot do without it.</li>
            <li> It makes my very fine, straight hair so full!  </li>
            <li> I just love it makes your hair feel so clean and fresh</li>
            <li> just a light clean smell.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the purchase, I have been using it for more than 1 year, i only wish that it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now on the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I noticed the third bottle didn&#x27;t make my hair as full... it also had a more pleasant fragrance (not the burning in my lungs that i experienced with my first two bottles)...</li>
            <li> I am willing to pay more for a product if it does the job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth the price!  </li>
            <li> The best lightweight yet firm holding hairspray!</li>
            <li> I love Bumble and Bumble products and this product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I keep trying different combinations, but so far I have been just moderately impressed.</li>
            <li> If it works great and has been working great for years, why change it for something mediocre?</li>
            <li> This product works great for my baby fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> So, the search is back on for a product that will make my hair as gorgeous as B&amp;b thickening SPRAY used to do.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Thickening Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After trying a sample of this product I took the plunge and bought the full size.  </li>
            <li> I have lived with this fine, thin hair for 62 years and it feels really good to have a product that works!!!!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin aging hair and this has proved to be the best product for adding fulness.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this spray gives my hair so much body!  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and love this one and will finally stick to this.  </li>
            <li> Not the case anymore as the product is super sticky.  </li>
            <li> I was out of this and needed to get it quick.</li>
            <li> Every morning I dampen my roots with the thickening spray and quickly blow it with a hair drier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge skeptic when it comes to hair products, but the thickening spray really works!  </li>
            <li> And a bottle this size lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> It was worth the high price before but not any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years to help lightly thicken my very fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> The combination of these two products gives me a great blow dry that lasts for a couple of days on my straight hair.</li>
            <li> It gives the hair great texture and a little bit of hold without limiting movement.  </li>
            <li> I did try many products this is the only company that puts out a product for fine hair that works.</li>
            <li> I purchase this thickener every few months, and continue to be happy with it.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for thin, lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It also has changed the smell, which used to be fresh and is now...</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money paid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Has a distinct alcohol odor.</li>
            <li> Worth the $.</li>
            <li> But the right amount works wonders.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s so on trend right now.  </li>
            <li> I quite like the effect I get with this new formula, but then I really liked the old one too.  </li>
            <li> It really adds volume to my straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The end result is clean feeling, soft, full hair.</li>
            <li> This product is very good, but I didn&#x27;t have the same result that I expected.</li>
            <li> Although the price has gone up and the bottle grows smaller over the years and it is not often available for free Prime shipping, I&#x27;m still hooked.</li>
            <li> I would very much like to return this.  </li>
            <li> This spray is great if you have fine hair and want a little extra thickness to your curls.</li>
            <li> This stuff gives my hair so much volume and makes it shiney and pretty!</li>
            <li> I suppose you might get even greater effects if you blow dry, but frankly, when I&#x27;ve done that, my hair ends up super tangled which leads to breakage when I brush it.</li>
            <li> This is the first Bumble and Bumble product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will be my first B&amp;B purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I finally have some volume for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> I keep hoping that Bumble and Bumble products are going to work better than they actually do.</li>
            <li> May as well spray water on it, no more effective than that!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted.  </li>
            <li> For this price, I definitely expecting to have more than the most basic benefits.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different volumizing products.  </li>
            <li> It definitely adds some heft to my tresses and makes them look more voluminous.  </li>
            <li> I use BB Thickening Hairspray first and then add BB</li>
            <li> and it definitely looks like I have more hair.  </li>
            <li> On my damp hair I use Bumble and Bumble Styling Lotion first and then spray this product over before blow drying.  </li>
            <li> It does help some on those hot, sweaty, wind-blown days.  </li>
            <li> This spray is nothing short of a magic wand.</li>
            <li> This product did a good job on my flat and fine hair but after using it for about a week it weighed my hair down and made it look and feel greasy, didn&#x27;t work for me and isn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
            <li> but it is very fine and really long</li>
            <li> I rarely order hair spray of any particular brand more than once, but I am on my fourth bottle of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight styling spray that works well with my fine hair, not stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product to ever successfully thicken my very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> The volume it created looked dry and more like straw</li>
            <li> in fact a true aerosol spray seems to work better for the everyday hold I need.</li>
            <li> Wish the bottle was bigger but it gives my hair great volume without weighing it down</li>
            <li> B&amp;b&#x27;s response was that they had to comply with certain health regulations...?  </li>
            <li> This made my fine hair actually look stringy at the ends.</li>
            <li> This does not have the same thickening effect anymore, i need to spray 3 times more to feel 1/4 of the effect, the hair remains softer than with previous versions (which is good), but the hold is just not the same...</li>
            <li> I have straight silver colored hair, so I am always looking for products that give volume and shine.  </li>
            <li> is a beauty secret I am happy to share...</li>
            <li> It worked about the same as cheap drugstore hairspray.</li>
            <li> The product use to make hair smooth, bouncy, shiny and add lots of volume and, for someone like me who washes her hair every 2-3 days, I could spray it back on in the morning, use the blowdryer and...</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> I am really amazed at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a finishing spray so the name &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really correct.  </li>
            <li> But my hair is really resistant</li>
            <li> They work really well together</li>
            <li> If I put too much (which doesn&#x27;t require that much product) then my hair feels sticky.</li>
            <li> this one really does make my hair look thicker..</li>
            <li> It really does thicken your locks but is pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Really like this for summertime hair.  </li>
            <li> This really thickens my hair with no stiffness.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair so much volume, and it even makes it feel thicker.</li>
            <li> My choice for years is now so much easier to find and order.</li>
            <li> I love it - spray on while hair is wet and then style.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> You can really see a difference after applying this spray and blow drying your hair.</li>
            <li> The volume doesn&#x27;t last for the whole day but considering I have extremely thin hair, this is already a great progress!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair fuller and can style it much easier</li>
            <li> I actually use a dryer very rarely</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, which is probably a good thing given that most spray smells unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> I love how it dries completely and isn&#x27;t sticky and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I almost sent this back because it was so expensive, but it turns out that I am using it the most - even more than the smooth in stuff.  </li>
            <li> (my stylist used all B&amp;B products) but I have been so pleased with the thickening spray, I may need to break down and buy them as well.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 10 years and can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> This new formula can be sticky if you spray too much</li>
            <li> It was nothing at all like the typical product, rather much more like water.  </li>
            <li> When hair is dry the spray gives a light hold.</li>
            <li> This more expensive product is when I have to look &#x27;better&#x27; and the difference shows after styling.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and only wish I had discovered it earlier.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for B&amp;B Thickening Spray, that were soon dashed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, especially for fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li> Upon purchasing this product, I&#x27;d hoped it would be equivilant to the product I normally purchase at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Thickening spray was my favorite of ALL my beauty products but now it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and then add a few spritzes of BB Thickening Hairspray on top or</li>
            <li> It gives more volume and body without being sticky or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> my hair is naturally wavy in some areas and thinner and less manageable on the top.  </li>
            <li> So it dries fairly quickly, but I learned long ago, that it helps to use the Bumble &amp; Bumble thickening spray.  </li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend it and it lasted a long time since you do need to use very much.</li>
            <li> I need to find a new thickening product.</li>
            <li> Oh well, time to find a new volumizing spray...</li>
            <li> cant live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Halas, they have changed the formula, adding alcohol to the new one, which makes hair super dry, sticky and straw-like.  </li>
            <li> I use it before I dry my hair for a super sleek look with volume</li>
            <li> I had attributed the great finish my hair had due to her styling technique, but finally decided to break down and purchase this thickening spray.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that if I get a little over excited and spray too much of the spray</li>
            <li> I hope other will find success with this combo!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this product for the past year and I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After years of trying out sprays, shampoos and conditioners, I came across this and - WOW!  </li>
            <li> Thickening Spray is probably the first and only one that</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered 2 bottles but after the first couple uses decided to keep the second bottle instead of returning it</li>
            <li> I love both products, and together I think they add lots of body and texture to my otherwise slick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight, Asian hair if that serves as a good reference.</li>
            <li> I spray it on the roots as best as possible while my hair is wet and then dry as usual.</li>
            <li> But a quick brush through and my hair is soft again, so it&#x27;s really no biggie.  </li>
            <li> I use it while blow drying, and although it makes my hair slightly less soft, it also makes it MUCH fuller and bouncier, well worth the trade</li>
            <li> so I decided to try the spray on my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell reminds me a bit of toothpaste, but it doesn&#x27;t stick, and is quickly covered up by the scent of other products, say, hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is still soft not stiff.</li>
            <li> For those who think this product is not working, you are most likely allowing your hair to air dry (which would make your hair stick together in an undesirable flat position).</li>
            <li> Here is why: it works!&lt;br /&gt;The product does not have any smell, is clear, and does require generous application</li>
            <li> I was completely floored -</li>
            <li> By itself, it doesn&#x27;t really have any hold so in my experience, it definitely needs the addition of a styling spray.  </li>
            <li> but too much would definitely add weight.  </li>
            <li> The old formula did just that:  </li>
            <li> When I curl it, it holds my hair, without that crusty hairspray feel, leaving it soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> My hair is not limp and has body throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I use it very sparingly so it last longer.</li>
            <li> My normally wavy hair is straight and shiny and not nearly as anemic as before.  </li>
            <li> Love that it only takes a few sprays to get volume and control, and that you can layer it without it flaking or attracting dirt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that this leave no residue and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down at all.</li>
            <li> Gives my fine blonde hair a little more body with out being sticky or heavy!</li>
            <li> It seems to give my straight, flat hair volume.</li>
            <li> B&amp;B&#x27;s Thickening Spray is rather expensive, but it really does give fine, limp hair more volume.</li>
            <li> I have super straight and heavy asian type hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time as I have a very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair and I like to make it look thicker.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, I have been using it for the past year.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin and very fine textured.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I quit in order to give other products a try, but I always quickly come back.</li>
            <li> so it definitely was new damage.  </li>
            <li> I recently discovered it, now can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my freshly clean hair when it is wet, then flip my head over and blow dry.</li>
            <li> However, it lasts a lot longer than you might think (although it&#x27;s easy to overdo), at least for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to gauge how much I need with my hair dry.</li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair straight, I&#x27;ll spray this on my damp hair before hand.</li>
            <li> I spray it on damp hair, blow dry&amp; it lasts all day...or really until I have to wash my hair again.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ve forgotten to use it within my morning makeup/hair routine, and before I&#x27;m very far into my day, I can tell.</li>
            <li> The next day I looked in the mirror and the ends were completely split!  </li>
            <li> and apparently ingredients have changed!  </li>
            <li> If you want to use it ad-hoc for varying functions from taming a stray hair to setting a blow dry style; don&#x27;t see anything special that I couldn&#x27;t get with just about any other product --</li>
            <li> The final result looks really natural.</li>
            <li> It actually does what it says it will do, BUT my hair is protein sensitive and this contains protein.  </li>
            <li> But if you use a small amount and are using a good hydrating conditioner, you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems (at least I haven&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much time or patience in the morning to style my hair like the professionals but with just a few sprays and 5 minutes of blow drying, my short, thin, straight hair is frizz-free, more voluminous, and tamed (especially living in humid weather where frizz is a given).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does get sticky when on wet hair, but when you blow dry with a brush, it gets less sticky and that is when the magic begins!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> volume less and straight hair; This is THE ONE!</li>
            <li> I can comb my hair thru a couple of times a day, and still not loose its shape.</li>
            <li> This works very well and does not make my scalp itch as  some other hair product.</li>
            <li> The normal scent was not present, the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long.  </li>
            <li> No other product necessary.</li>
            <li> We had a little bit higher exception before making the purchase.</li>
            <li> So much that I tend to transfer the contents of the bottle into spray bottle that releases the liquid faster, so as to cut down on application</li>
            <li> It works very well to add volume, and does not weigh down or make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> If your not protein sensitive or your hair is not inclined to look dry, then you can give this one a try</li>
            <li> This spray is just enough to give my hair a thickness to style but not too much to weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> Especially since I have very fine and thin hair!  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine but this makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> too much leaves my roots a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product for those with thin hair and are tired of styling products that leave your hair feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> It is like I have a different head of full thick hair!</li>
            <li> None of them would hold my fine, thin hair \\&quot;up\\&quot; for very long.  </li>
            <li> I have gradually thinning hair and this gives it the oomph it needs to not look so flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li> But as my fringe is long, it weighs, and the product does not have the same effect.</li>
            <li> I finally found something to spray on my fine, thin hair before blowing it dry to make my hair silky and manageable!!!  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very hard to get any texture or volume, but this product really helps give me a little bit of grit to do exactly what I want it to.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that goes flat quickly.</li>
            <li> Neither she nor I have thin or limp hair, but we find that this product gives our hair more body, makes it a bit easier to manage, and just gives our hair a thicker, fuller appearance.</li>
            <li> hair isn&#x27;t particularly thin, so volumizing products don&#x27;t generally do all that much.</li>
            <li> I have never used a products that lasts as long as this one.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold the style as long.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium thick, so I don&#x27;t really need the thickening part of this product&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li> After towel drying my hair, I spray 10-15 spritzes of the Thickening Spray on my (below should length) hair and blow dry on medium heat with a 1.5 inch round bristle brush focusing on the roots for volume and the tips for some soft curl.  </li>
            <li> But the new formula adds a stickiness, like a non-aerosol hairspray would, and I can&#x27;t get past it.  </li>
            <li> A few times I&#x27;ve used too much of this spray and then my hair is a sticky, mangled mess.  </li>
            <li> I think the only negative is that it can feel a little sticky when you first spray it on, but after brushing it through my hair/drying it, that goes away.</li>
            <li> No residue or stickiness and hair remains shiny and supple all day long!</li>
            <li> I tried using other DIY alternatives, but always come back to this spray.  </li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that you have to use it before you blow dry because it is heat activated.</li>
            <li> All Styling Spray on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry but let my hair air dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair and spray in, and blow dry.</li>
            <li> For years my stylist has used this on my hair just before blowing it dry.  </li>
            <li> , I mist my hair after I dry it to give it a polish look.</li>
            <li> despite the limited thickening effects, I DID have the bounciest, shiniest blow dry</li>
            <li> I apply this to my damp hair and blow it out loosely with the blow dryer and my fingers.</li>
            <li> The new product not only doesn&#x27;t provide volume; it smell and feels icky and mats my hair down.  </li>
            <li> But for less amount of money, we can probably find something similar.</li>
            <li> Spray it on wet hair and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things on my hair, and most have left me disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It also left an odd coating and feel on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product can be used on wet or dry hair which is convenient.  </li>
            <li> I also spray it on my wet hair and let it air dry for a beach look!</li>
            <li> It does not give the volume it did before and leaves my hair baby soft, as in limp and not full.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble Thickening Spray for YEARS and a bottle usually lasts  me awhile, so between that and cycling it with other products I only recently had to reorder it.  </li>
            <li> but it very wet on the hair and takes a while to dry - as for thickening</li>
            <li> (I use about ten squirts for my short hair; even so, the bottle lasts at least two months).</li>
            <li> This is the most awful product I&#x27;ve ever tried and then to have paid so much money for it.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I expected thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to go nuts with it-</li>
            <li> No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray on wet hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a hairspray at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems using this spray on wet hair</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t have to work in a formal setting, I just use inexpensive gel and minimal styling.</li>
            <li> I have very baby thin hair</li>
            <li> Note, it is not really hair spray; apply to wet hair as a setting lotion.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair a lift without looking like I stuck my wet finger in an electric outlet.  </li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll never use it when my hair is dry again!!  </li>
            <li> use it when my hair is dry again!!  </li>
            <li> It does not smell like the other (almost empty) bottle I purchased at my salon.  </li>
            <li> This thickening spray is rather wet and it therefore it takes a few minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> I will admit that this can produce a bit of frizz which is probably due to the combination of volume-producing products.  </li>
            <li> and it does give it body without the stickiness of other hair sprays.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like the same product I bought in years past at a salon...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for over a decade now and haven&#x27;t found any other product that works for my thinner hair.</li>
            <li> and when I let my hair air dry after applying the styling spray and thickening spray, it is a little crunchy when it dries.  </li>
            <li> I had to add little serum to soften as I worked to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to wet hair, comb thru, and dry with a hair dryer, while using a round brush to lift the roots (takes less then 2 minutes).</li>
            <li> I spray it on damp hair and then using a round styling brush, I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> So another product is essential, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> I do not use a hair dryer because : my hair has some natural curl, I have trouble holding the x%@# thing which gave me tendonitis many years ago, and I am terrible with styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> hair is already thick but very coarse (and colored).  </li>
            <li> Thickens, but doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and gives lots of body.</li>
            <li> work 11 hour shifts and my hair stays all through my shift, even after combing half way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle, but I&#x27;m afraid I might be hooked.</li>
            <li> all i do is give a little scrunch half way through the day and my hair looks like it did when i walked out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li> so the weight of my hair pulls down any body I would have making my hair look limp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> It also protects my hair if I add a little flat-ironing.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a little pricey to me)</li>
            <li> Then, I apply a few velcro rollers and leave them in for 20-30 min (while I eat my breakfast).</li>
            <li> I used Bumble and Bumble Thickening Spray for years to provide volume for my thin hair and turned several people on to the product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had read a few magazine articles praising this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> doesnt make my hair sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed on my dry bangs and when the spray dried, it was very hard to get a brush through</li>
            <li> No strong scent.</li>
            <li> Finish it with a little hairspray and voila!</li>
            <li> Any insecurities I had about my hair being a little thinner at the crown was gone!</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok but smells terrible!</li>
            <li> usually mix one part BB Styling Lotion to two parts thickening spray to get the lift and separation I want from this product.</li>
            <li> so the only explanation was the difficult time I had brushing through my hair after using this spray.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for ( well, no more than any drugstore product costing $2).</li>
            <li> I feel like this is no better than spraying water on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it escaped from the bottle because it did not seem to leak anymore after it thawed out.</li>
            <li> Doubtful at first</li>
            <li> I ordered \\&quot;Hair Thickening Spray\\&quot;, was sent ordinary Hair Spray - at a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like hair products that make my hair hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Gives you lots of volume without being sticky and hard</li>
            <li> This sucks.  </li>
            <li> Well, they seem to have added a styling element to it that makes it sticky, and I am forced to return it.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is quite thin, and this thickening spray adds body while firmly holding her hair in inclement weather.</li>
            <li> It does provide some volume but is a bit difficult to maneuver a round brush and blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t crack, but it did leak and make a mess in the package, thus I lost some (about a tablespoon)  of the product which was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> I was never able to get a beach look before this product, my hair always ended up looking dirty or crispy.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that this product just makes my hair sticky and matted down.</li>
            <li> But a little bit disappointed after using it.</li>
            <li> Yes, this spray is expensive.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> because I know when it&#x27;s gone ill</li>
            <li> It has a weird odor.  </li>
            <li> I have coupled the spray with BB Straightening gel because my hair can get weird and wavy in moisture.  </li>
            <li> However, I hate stiff sticky lacquered up hair, that this spray helps me avoid this.  </li>
            <li> Illogical and majorly disappointing.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out how to get the maximum effect, so don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the product itself is bad.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was horribly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I still hate it.  </li>
            <li> I have used the thickening conditioner and hate it too.  </li>
            <li> I hate my hair without it</li>
            <li> Oh, how deeply disappointed I am with Bumble and bumble!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like hair products that make my hair hard and crunchy. I like this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
            <li> It seems to give my straight, flat hair volume.</li>
            <li> It is a nice hairspray, but I have not noticed any thickening taking place.</li>
            <li> This spray is the best thickening spray I have ever used.  It really helps my fine hair have more body  and stays that way !  It&#x27;s great, try it!!!&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> I have thin-to-medium, wavy, highlighted hair.  I&#x27;ve been using B&amp;B Thickening Spray in combo with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverStrong Volume Shampoo and Conditioner with great results.  After towel drying my hair, I spray 10-15 spritzes of the Thickening Spray on my (below should length) hair and blow dry on medium heat with a 1.5 inch round bristle brush focusing on the roots for volume and the tips for some soft curl.  I will admit that this can produce a bit of frizz which is probably due to the combination of volume-producing products.  But I&#x27;ve been able to minimize this by applying a flexible hold hairspray like the one sold by Garnier Fructis.  Granted, this will not work for everyone.  But I think this is a great combination of drug store salon brands that makes my hair look full and shiny.  I hope other will find success with this combo!</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok but smells terrible!</li>
            <li> i love this product! My hair was thinning at the ends because of heat damage and this totally hid that. I just spray it on damp hair for best result</li>
            <li> This is the first Bumble and Bumble product I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s true that this leave no residue and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down at all. The smell reminds me a bit of toothpaste, but it doesn&#x27;t stick, and is quickly covered up by the scent of other products, say, hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair isn&#x27;t particularly thin, so volumizing products don&#x27;t generally do all that much. This one worked a bit, but only after adding quite a lot. So much that I tend to transfer the contents of the bottle into spray bottle that releases the liquid faster, so as to cut down on application time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say though, despite the limited thickening effects, I DID have the bounciest, shiniest blow dry I&#x27;ve ever had after using this product. I was completely floored - I dye my hair fairly often, and it&#x27;s been a while since it has looked that healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually mix one part BB Styling Lotion to two parts thickening spray to get the lift and separation I want from this product. It holds my style better throughout the day, too.</li>
            <li> I have straight silver colored hair, so I am always looking for products that give volume and shine.  I am willing to pay more for a product if it does the job.  Bumblke and Bumble Thickening Spray is an excellent product.  It is worth the money.  It gives volume. shine, and controlabilty to my hair.  So glad that I found this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to eight years now. Sometimes I quit in order to give other products a try, but I always quickly come back. Here is why: it works!&lt;br /&gt;The product does not have any smell, is clear, and does require generous application (I use about ten squirts for my short hair; even so, the bottle lasts at least two months). I apply it to wet hair, comb thru, and dry with a hair dryer, while using a round brush to lift the roots (takes less then 2 minutes). Then, I apply a few velcro rollers and leave them in for 20-30 min (while I eat my breakfast). I then style my hair with fingers and go! No other product necessary. As the thickening spray dries, it becomes tacky (sticky) and that is when it does its magic. Still, it remains weightless and invisible. I can comb my hair thru a couple of times a day, and still not loose its shape. For those who think this product is not working, you are most likely allowing your hair to air dry (which would make your hair stick together in an undesirable flat position). It works best when applied on clean hair (since I am a daily washer, that is fine by me).&lt;br /&gt;It is a beauty secret I am happy to share...Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this product for the past year and I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I order this through my salon but the prices seem to incease each time I get my hair done!&lt;br /&gt;This will be my first B&amp;B purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I finally found something to spray on my fine, thin hair before blowing it dry to make my hair silky and manageable!!!  I have tried so many products and love this one and will finally stick to this.  It gives my hair body, keeps it from getting static electricity and I finally have some volume for most of the day.  I have lived with this fine, thin hair for 62 years and it feels really good to have a product that works!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I first got a small bottle as a sample,and had to buy a larger bottle. I&#x27;ve told all my friends about it.</li>
            <li> I keep hoping that Bumble and Bumble products are going to work better than they actually do. I like the Thickening Spray well enough to use the bottle that I purchased, but I&#x27;m not planning to purchase another one. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, which is probably a good thing given that most spray smells unpleasant to me. (The one spray that smells actively good is Aveda Air Control). I think the spray makes my hair feel somewhat thicker, but Air Control works much better. I keep trying different combinations, but so far I have been just moderately impressed.</li>
            <li> This is the only thickener I&#x27;ll ever use.  I love how it dries completely and isn&#x27;t sticky and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> For the price, I expected thicker hair.  My hair just did not seem to get thicker.  It worked about the same as cheap drugstore hairspray.</li>
            <li> I think this product is a total waste of money. It does absolutly nothing for my hair. May as well spray water on it, no more effective than that!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted.  Received in a timely fashion.  Would use this product and supplier again.</li>
            <li> I used Bumble and Bumble Thickening Spray for years to provide volume for my thin hair and turned several people on to the product.  Then they changed the formula to Bumble and Bumble Thickening HAIR Spray.  The new product not only doesn&#x27;t provide volume; it smell and feels icky and mats my hair down.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> We had a little bit higher exception before making the purchase. But a little bit disappointed after using it. I am not saying it does not work. But for less amount of money, we can probably find something similar. It does lift the hair and make it easier to control, but did not make the hair feels comfortable. For this price, I definitely expecting to have more than the most basic benefits. Find something else or wait the price of this one go under $10</li>
            <li> I have tried this spray every which way I can, wet,dry,blowdry,airdry,after styling and I still hate it.  It might work if I could keep the flyaways from happening. I have used the thickening conditioner and hate it too.  It makes my hair stringy.  I have given up on Bumble &amp; Bumble.  My hair is fine but this makes it worse.  Don&#x27;t try - it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Spray it on wet hair and then blow dry.  It provides body, yet there is no stiffness of hair nor is the volume of the hair suppressed by the product itself.  The final result looks really natural.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that gives my hair fullness and body. i also use it in combination with b&amp;b&#x27;s surf spray. all i do is give a little scrunch half way through the day and my hair looks like it did when i walked out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for thin, lifeless hair.  Just keep in mind that you have to use it before you blow dry because it is heat activated.</li>
            <li> I almost sent this back because it was so expensive, but it turns out that I am using it the most - even more than the smooth in stuff.  Again, like all B &amp; B products, this isn&#x27;t sticky - I can walk out of the bathroom after applying it an not have to rinse my hands.  I don&#x27;t know how they do it!</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing this product, I&#x27;d hoped it would be equivilant to the product I normally purchase at the salon.  I was horribly disappointed.  It was nothing at all like the typical product, rather much more like water.  The normal scent was not present, the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long.  I would very much like to return this.  It&#x27;s not at all the same product that is purchased at the salon.  I was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great for providing fuller hair. I use it in combination with B&amp;B Prep. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Thickening spray was my favorite of ALL my beauty products but now it is a waste of money. It was worth the high price before but not any more. It does not give the volume it did before and leaves my hair baby soft, as in limp and not full. I need to find a new thickening product. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Oh, how deeply disappointed I am with Bumble and bumble!  I used to love this thickening spray (now called thickening hairspray)!  Halas, they have changed the formula, adding alcohol to the new one, which makes hair super dry, sticky and straw-like.  It also has changed the smell, which used to be fresh and is now...Stincking of alcohol!  The product use to make hair smooth, bouncy, shiny and add lots of volume and, for someone like me who washes her hair every 2-3 days, I could spray it back on in the morning, use the blowdryer and...Voila!  Beautiful hair once more!  Not the case anymore as the product is super sticky.  So, the search is back on for a product that will make my hair as gorgeous as B&amp;b thickening SPRAY used to do.  B&amp;b&#x27;s response was that they had to comply with certain health regulations...?  Really?  Since when adding alcohol to a product is better for consumers?  Illogical and majorly disappointing. Will never buy again, and moving away from Bumble and bumble, who seem to make too many changes to their products.  If it works great and has been working great for years, why change it for something mediocre?</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the purchase, I have been using it for more than 1 year, i only wish that it was cheaper. Loehman has it to for $22.00.</li>
            <li> I just received my thickening spray and I&#x27;m sure it is fake.  It does not smell like the other (almost empty) bottle I purchased at my salon.  My hair did not feel as good as it normally does, and it made my head itch. Buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> I love B&amp;B thickening spray!  Doubtful at first, I tried it because of my sister-in-law&#x27;s recommendation.  It really adds volume to my straight, fine hair.  Try it!  It lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different volumizing products.  None of them would hold my fine, thin hair \\&quot;up\\&quot; for very long.  This one holds all day.  I am really amazed at how well it works.  I have never used a products that lasts as long as this one.  I have to be careful not to go nuts with it- too much leaves my roots a little greasy.  But the right amount works wonders.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good thickening spray.  It definitely adds some heft to my tresses and makes them look more voluminous.  However, I don&#x27;t use it by itself but instead layer it with a styling spray that has some hold.  I either use Living Proof No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray on wet hair and then add a few spritzes of BB Thickening Hairspray on top or I use BB Thickening Hairspray first and then add BB Does It All Styling Spray on dry hair.  I don&#x27;t blow dry but let my hair air dry overnight.  In the morning I use a curling iron to create beachy waves that I brush through only once.  This thickening spray is rather wet and it therefore it takes a few minutes to dry.  It isn&#x27;t a finishing spray so the name &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really correct.  I know that BB recently changed the formula, adding alcohol and thereby changing the results.  This new formula can be sticky if you spray too much and it will definitely lead to tangled hair if you do so.  But if you&#x27;re sparing with the amount, it can give your strands added thickness and volume.  I quite like the effect I get with this new formula, but then I really liked the old one too.  By itself, it doesn&#x27;t really have any hold so in my experience, it definitely needs the addition of a styling spray.  But my hair is really resistant and I don&#x27;t want to spend 15 minutes curling my hair, only to have it droop 30 minutes later.  So another product is essential, at least for me.  I do love BB Does It All and have used it for years.  It&#x27;s really light, but strong and all my attempts to find a drugstore dupe have been futile.  It&#x27;s just a really great product and so is this thickening spray.  They work really well together and it definitely looks like I have more hair.  The hold lasts for several days and if I need to recurl, I don&#x27;t need any additional product.  This thickening spray now smells like alcohol, which means it can be drying.  But if you use a small amount and are using a good hydrating conditioner, you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems (at least I haven&#x27;t).  I suppose you might get even greater effects if you blow dry, but frankly, when I&#x27;ve done that, my hair ends up super tangled which leads to breakage when I brush it. A big no no!  I actually use a dryer very rarely and when I let my hair air dry after applying the styling spray and thickening spray, it is a little crunchy when it dries.  But a quick brush through and my hair is soft again, so it&#x27;s really no biggie.  A few times I&#x27;ve used too much of this spray and then my hair is a sticky, mangled mess.  But when I layer it with a styling spray I get a very sexy, tousled, bedhead look that&#x27;s so on trend right now.  Yes, this spray is expensive.  However, it lasts a lot longer than you might think (although it&#x27;s easy to overdo), at least for me.  If you buy it at Sephora or from the BB website, you can always return it if you don&#x27;t like it.  But if you use it judiciously, you&#x27;ll get great results.  I also think it would be great for fine hair but too much would definitely add weight.  All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the results I get when I layer it with another product.  But when I&#x27;ve used it alone, the results have not been as good, hence the four stars.  I definitely recommend using it the way I do.  It works for me and gives me body, volume and increased thickness.  But the name is misleading.  It&#x27;s not really a hairspray at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This spray gave me split ends!!  I sprayed on my dry bangs and when the spray dried, it was very hard to get a brush through and there was some breakage.  The next day I looked in the mirror and the ends were completely split!  I had a haircut the week before so it definitely was new damage.  I don&#x27;t even curl or flatiron my bangs so the only explanation was the difficult time I had brushing through my hair after using this spray.  Now I have to have them trimmed when I actually wanted to grow them out.  This sucks.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems using this spray on wet hair but I&#x27;ll never use it when my hair is dry again!!  If this happens again, I&#x27;ll definitely change my rating.ver use it when my hair is dry again!!  If this happens again, I&#x27;ll definitely change my rating.</li>
            <li> Why oh why cant this be alittle cheaper? This stuff gives my hair so much volume and makes it shiney and pretty! Best stuff on the market for fine hair</li>
            <li> This is light pump spray that I use before my hair drys to give it some body.  I do not use a hair dryer because : my hair has some natural curl, I have trouble holding the x%@# thing which gave me tendonitis many years ago, and I am terrible with styling my hair. So it dries fairly quickly, but I learned long ago, that it helps to use the Bumble &amp; Bumble thickening spray.  When hair is dry the spray gives a light hold. I have been using it for years. Found it at a hair salon and my stylist used it on me..</li>
            <li> I ordered \\&quot;Hair Thickening Spray\\&quot;, was sent ordinary Hair Spray - at a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium thick, so I don&#x27;t really need the thickening part of this product&#x27;s name.  However, I hate stiff sticky lacquered up hair, that this spray helps me avoid this.  Light spraying and running my fingers through my hair and I am good to go.  It gives the hair great texture and a little bit of hold without limiting movement.  I rarely order hair spray of any particular brand more than once, but I am on my fourth bottle of this stuff.  I like the smell too, not fruity or too perfumy...just a light clean smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble Thickening Spray for YEARS and a bottle usually lasts  me awhile, so between that and cycling it with other products I only recently had to reorder it.  I noticed as soon as I received it that the name had changed to Thickening HAIRspray.  Well, they seem to have added a styling element to it that makes it sticky, and I am forced to return it.  The old formula did just that:  it was a thickening spray, and made blowouts easier and with better results.  The volumizing element was unparalleled!  But the new formula adds a stickiness, like a non-aerosol hairspray would, and I can&#x27;t get past it.  Oh well, time to find a new volumizing spray...</li>
            <li> The product is definitely light hold. It smells nice. If I put too much (which doesn&#x27;t require that much product) then my hair feels sticky. I have thin, straight, Asian hair if that serves as a good reference. I like application after blow-drying my hair better than before. It&#x27;s easier to gauge how much I need with my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, and it keeps my hair looking thicker even 3 days after washing.</li>
            <li> This product did a good job on my flat and fine hair but after using it for about a week it weighed my hair down and made it look and feel greasy, didn&#x27;t work for me and isn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair thickener because it doesn&#x27;t feel still or gummy and I search for it online when I can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I have thinning, fine, shoulder-length flyaway hair. When I don&#x27;t have to work in a formal setting, I just use inexpensive gel and minimal styling. This more expensive product is when I have to look &#x27;better&#x27; and the difference shows after styling. Thicker and more substantial looking. So yes, it works.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gives you lots of volume without being sticky and hard</li>
            <li> This product works great for my baby fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Wish I would have found this product years ago.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. When I blow dry my hair straight, I&#x27;ll spray this on my damp hair before hand. When I curl it, it holds my hair, without that crusty hairspray feel, leaving it soft and bouncy. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge skeptic when it comes to hair products, but the thickening spray really works!  After years of trying out sprays, shampoos and conditioners, I came across this and - WOW!  It makes my very fine, straight hair so full!  I use it while blow drying, and although it makes my hair slightly less soft, it also makes it MUCH fuller and bouncier, well worth the trade off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I noticed the third bottle didn&#x27;t make my hair as full... it also had a more pleasant fragrance (not the burning in my lungs that i experienced with my first two bottles)...and apparently ingredients have changed!  This does not have the same thickening effect anymore, i need to spray 3 times more to feel 1/4 of the effect, the hair remains softer than with previous versions (which is good), but the hold is just not the same... but i guess i&#x27;d rather have that, than carcinogenic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Thickening Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things on my hair, and most have left me disappointed.  My hair is thin and very fine textured.  A lot of the techniques advised by beauty magazines, and most of their product recommendations for &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair just don&#x27;t work for me.  Thickening Spray is probably the first and only one that has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just spray a bit on my damp roots and tousle in before blow drying.  It gives my hair enough weight to help hold a style.  And it makes me look like I have more volume at the roots than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the price!  And a bottle this size lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for B&amp;B Thickening Spray, that were soon dashed. This made my fine hair actually look stringy at the ends. So next application I used only at crown. My hair did not get the thickening look I was hoping for ( well, no more than any drugstore product costing $2). It also left an odd coating and feel on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight thickening spray that works better than any otherI have used.  I have gradually thinning hair and this gives it the oomph it needs to not look so flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I had read a few magazine articles praising this product so I decided to try the spray on my fine, limp hair.  Needless to say I am very disappointed.  I feel like this is no better than spraying water on my hair.  I wish I could return the product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love this product and always save up to buy it... Wish the bottle was bigger but it gives my hair great volume without weighing it down</li>
            <li> Did not thicken my hair!</li>
            <li> I like the way it holds and is not layered on each day.  I brush out at night before bed. I have very baby thin hair and it does give it body without the stickiness of other hair sprays.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have thin hair that goes flat quickly. I apply this to my damp hair and blow it out loosely with the blow dryer and my fingers. Finish it with a little hairspray and voila! Big hair all day.</li>
            <li> I love the bumble and bumble productsâ€¦. this one really does make my hair look thicker.. It&#x27;s a little pricey. But I still buy it.</li>
            <li> Great product, good deal</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much time or patience in the morning to style my hair like the professionals but with just a few sprays and 5 minutes of blow drying, my short, thin, straight hair is frizz-free, more voluminous, and tamed (especially living in humid weather where frizz is a given).  An added plus is that my hair is NOT waxy or sticky to the touch afterwards.  My hair is not limp and has body throughout the day.  Excellent product for those with thin hair and are tired of styling products that leave your hair feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> It really does thicken your locks but is pricey. I use it very sparingly so it last longer. Great product from Bumble andBumble!</li>
            <li> I have spider web fine hair.  Love this stuff.  Not sticky at all - just does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and it works really well.  I spray it on damp hair and then using a round styling brush, I dry my hair.  It gives body to my hair which lasts two or three days.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I received Bumble and Bumble Thickening Hair Spray from Good Looking Discounts. I was so surprised and pleased to see that included with my order was a beautiful stuffed animal plus samples of additional hair products! I loved the way the product was packaged and appreciated the thank you gifts! I will continue to order from this company plus tell my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this spray gives my hair so much body!  I towel dry my hair and spray in, and blow dry. Love it</li>
            <li> On my damp hair I use Bumble and Bumble Styling Lotion first and then spray this product over before blow drying.  The combination of these two products gives me a great blow dry that lasts for a couple of days on my straight hair.</li>
            <li> Always a great product, wish more salons carried it.  Sunspray proctector for hair was the best.  Have to check if they still make it</li>
            <li> As far as B &amp; B products go...this is the best way to purchase them.  It is a bit cheaper for the same product, so why wouldn&#x27;t you purchase it this way?  I love this product and it is pricey....so I am always looking for a good deal on it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I use it all the time and it is my favorite hair product. I have recommended this product to friends and i cant stop bragging about it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product- natural volume without sticky or crispy looking/feeling hair. No strong scent. Perfect for fine hair to keep it looking fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Note, it is not really hair spray; apply to wet hair as a setting lotion.  I believe it is called hair spray because it contains some alcohol.</li>
            <li> I started using it per stylist and I have been very happy with the product.  Especially since I have very fine and thin hair!  Would certainly recommend it and it lasted a long time since you do need to use very much.</li>
            <li> Not only a hairspray but my hair stylist sprayed this on the roots and my hair before blow drying as a styling spray. This does not make your hair tacky and adds body with a silky smooth finish. Love this product.</li>
            <li> It froze during shipment and the bottle expanded.  It didn&#x27;t crack, but it did leak and make a mess in the package, thus I lost some (about a tablespoon)  of the product which was disappointing.  Not sure how it escaped from the bottle because it did not seem to leak anymore after it thawed out.</li>
            <li> I love this because it is easy to apply after I shampoo my hair and gives great volume to very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Stylist uses this when curling my ultra fine hair.  It is the only product I can get to hold my curls when styling at home.  Ulta does not carry it and they recommended a heat styling spray instead but that did not work.  Glad they carry this on amazon!</li>
            <li> Totally works. I hate my hair without it</li>
            <li> The best lightweight yet firm holding hairspray!</li>
            <li> This this hairspray works good on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin aging hair and this has proved to be the best product for adding fulness. Wish I could purchase it locally.</li>
            <li> I used this product a couple of months. If you put in on at exactly the right moisture when you want to get a good curl, it&#x27;s a good to great product. If you want to use it ad-hoc for varying functions from taming a stray hair to setting a blow dry style; don&#x27;t see anything special that I couldn&#x27;t get with just about any other product -- in fact a true aerosol spray seems to work better for the everyday hold I need.</li>
            <li> I think the best thing about this stuff is that is smells fantastic! No hairspray smell here. That said, my hair stylist used this and suggested it to me. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and I can best describe my hair as \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; when I use it. I use it instead of mousse or volumizer, and it doubles as hairspray. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> would not get it again - saw it in a magazine and tried it - spray goods but it very wet on the hair and takes a while to dry - as for thickening I didn&#x27;t notice a difference -</li>
            <li> Really like this for summertime hair.  It does help some on those hot, sweaty, wind-blown days.  Thickens, but doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Great spray that last all day!  Totally worth the money paid.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. Sticky and don&#x27;t like the hold or smell.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out how to get the maximum effect, so don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment. It adds body to my baby fine hair and makes it look fuller. It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be make my fine hair thicker but no such luck</li>
            <li> I have always used BB Thickening spray - when I run out, there is a big difference in the thickness of my hair.  Great transaction - quick and easy.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this product.  It did nothing to thicken my hair and actually had the opposite effect. Has a distinct alcohol odor. Save your money. Go with another product line.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and love it!  Adds lots of volume to anyone with &amp;#34;baby fine&amp;#34; hair.  No residue or stickiness and hair remains shiny and supple all day long!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like the same product I bought in years past at a salon...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> This product works well with the shampoo.  This product can be used on wet or dry hair which is convenient.  This really thickens my hair with no stiffness.</li>
            <li> B&amp;B&#x27;s Thickening Spray is rather expensive, but it really does give fine, limp hair more volume. I spray and comb it through my damp hair before blow drying and am amazed at the difference. It also protects my hair if I add a little flat-ironing. I recently discovered it, now can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Love it, have used it for years</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I don&#x27;t think the product itself is bad.  It actually does what it says it will do, BUT my hair is protein sensitive and this contains protein.  The volume it created looked dry and more like straw and my hair broke quite a bit.  If your not protein sensitive or your hair is not inclined to look dry, then you can give this one a try</li>
            <li> Great product as always</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all, directed or otherwise.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and I love it...I had to get a bigger bottle. My hair had been thinning a bit (the issue is resolved now), but this spray truly does a great job. It gives my hair so much volume, and it even makes it feel thicker. I spray it on damp hair, blow dry&amp; it lasts all day...or really until I have to wash my hair again. Any insecurities I had about my hair being a little thinner at the crown was gone! I think the only negative is that it can feel a little sticky when you first spray it on, but after brushing it through my hair/drying it, that goes away.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do.  Kind of amazing.  With no stickiness.  This is my first bottle, but I&#x27;m afraid I might be hooked.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and this product gives me some body. Very pleased. Highly recommend to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> The best of the best for thickening and holding. Offered by Amazon, the price is righter! My choice for years is now so much easier to find and order.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. I spray it on my roots before blow drying. Works great for added volume!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is quite thin, and this thickening spray adds body while firmly holding her hair in inclement weather.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time as I have a very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair and I like to make it look thicker. This works very well and does not make my scalp itch as  some other hair product. I was out of this and needed to get it quick. My on-line order worked fine. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have used it for many years. It really gives a nice hold to my hair as a setting lotion</li>
            <li> I did try many products this is the only company that puts out a product for fine hair that works.</li>
            <li> It did work on my hair!</li>
            <li> This a great product. I have very fine hair. This product gives it great body but it is still soft not stiff. Worth the $.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I accidentally ordered 2 bottles but after the first couple uses decided to keep the second bottle instead of returning it (it&#x27;s a little pricey to me) because I know when it&#x27;s gone ill just end up getting another! I have super straight and heavy asian type hair that&#x27;s very hard to get any texture or volume, but this product really helps give me a little bit of grit to do exactly what I want it to. I use this along with a tiny dab of B&amp;Bs Texture Hair Un Dressing Creme. Awesome products.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.  I&#x27;ve been buying this for over a decade now and haven&#x27;t found any other product that works for my thinner hair.</li>
            <li> This is the most awful product I&#x27;ve ever tried and then to have paid so much money for it.  It does not give volume to your hair, what it does it makes it greasy.</li>
            <li> cant live without this stuff.  use it for volume and to keep my style in check.  doesnt make my hair sticky or stiff.  no chemically smell.</li>
            <li> I love Bumble and Bumble products and this product does exactly what it says. I spray it on my roots and it totally gives volume and looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.  Just bought my second bottle, it took 2 months to use one bottle and I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is already thick but very coarse (and colored).  This thickening spray gives my hair an all day holding lift at my roots without using tons of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;It does get sticky when on wet hair, but when you blow dry with a brush, it gets less sticky and that is when the magic begins!&lt;br /&gt;I work 11 hour shifts and my hair stays all through my shift, even after combing half way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;I use Bumble and Bumble tonic with the thickening hair spray and it is a great combination for great hair days.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, when we start our day with a great hair day feel, it makes our day great all day!!</li>
            <li> For years my stylist has used this on my hair just before blowing it dry.  I had attributed the great finish my hair had due to her styling technique, but finally decided to break down and purchase this thickening spray.  I have been amazed at how great my hair looks since using this product. My normally wavy hair is straight and shiny and not nearly as anemic as before.  Haven&#x27;t bought the shampoo or conditioner (my stylist used all B&amp;B products) but I have been so pleased with the thickening spray, I may need to break down and buy them as well.</li>
            <li> I swear there is nothing but water in the bottle I received.  No fragrance, no volume, no nothing.</li>
            <li> This spray is nothing short of a magic wand. I use it for everything! I use it before I dry my hair for a super sleek look with volume, I mist my hair after I dry it to give it a polish look. I also spray it on my wet hair and let it air dry for a beach look! I was never able to get a beach look before this product, my hair always ended up looking dirty or crispy.  Not with this, this is awesome, period.</li>
            <li> This spray is just enough to give my hair a thickness to style but not too much to weigh it down.  I love it - spray on while hair is wet and then style. Hair style seems to be fluffier and stays longer.</li>
            <li> Instead of washing daily, I get my hair blown out twice a week. Every morning I dampen my roots with the thickening spray and quickly blow it with a hair drier. It dries in seconds. This works great to get rid of bed head and keep my blow outs longer.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair volume and body without being sticky. Would purchase again although you get quite a lot of use in one bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various B&amp;B hair products for years and the verdict is still out on whether or not this one lives up to what it claims to do.  It has a weird odor.  It does provide some volume but is a bit difficult to maneuver a round brush and blow dryer.  I had to add little serum to soften as I worked to dry my hair.  FYI - my hair is naturally wavy in some areas and thinner and less manageable on the top.  I think this would work best for either short layered styles or all one length styles.</li>
            <li> have used this product for some time and just love it...it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and gives lots of body.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Very lightweight styling spray that works well with my fine hair, not stiff or sticky.  Light hold.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and only wish I had discovered it earlier. It&#x27;s the only product to ever successfully thicken my very fine, thin hair. I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> Gave great body to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I purchase this thickener every few months, and continue to be happy with it. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I just love it makes your hair feel so clean and fresh and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair for couple of days</li>
            <li> After trying a sample of this product I took the plunge and bought the full size.  It gives my hair a lift without looking like I stuck my wet finger in an electric outlet.  Most &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34;  products make my hair look like Albert Einstein&#x27;s hair.  Can&#x27;t feel any residue from the product.  I spray it on the roots as best as possible while my hair is wet and then dry as usual.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this product at Sephora and liked it.  Ordered the 8-ozs bottle online and use it every day after I wash my hair.  It gives more volume and body without being sticky or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> This product is very good, but I didn&#x27;t have the same result that I expected. I bought to use on the fringe of hair to give volume. But as my fringe is long, it weighs, and the product does not have the same effect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter for Christmas, at her request. She loved it so much that I decided to buy one for myself! Neither she nor I have thin or limp hair, but we find that this product gives our hair more body, makes it a bit easier to manage, and just gives our hair a thicker, fuller appearance. Occasionally I&#x27;ve forgotten to use it within my morning makeup/hair routine, and before I&#x27;m very far into my day, I can tell. My hair just isn&#x27;t as nice without it! It doesn&#x27;t hold the style as long.  Definitely give this a try!</li>
            <li> It is a truly incredible thickening spray.  I have fine hair and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with Bb&#x27;s texturizing cream. I love both products, and together I think they add lots of body and texture to my otherwise slick hair. I can tell a difference if I don&#x27;t use this spray.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 10 years and can&#x27;t live without! Gives my fine blonde hair a little more body with out being sticky or heavy!</li>
            <li> This spray is great if you have fine hair and want a little extra thickness to your curls.</li>
            <li> Fantastic after every shampoo -- cannot do without it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this spray.  It has a nice smell and give just the right beachy wave texture on my fine hair.  I tried using other DIY alternatives, but always come back to this spray.  On my 3rd bottle now.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, I have been using it for the past year.  It works very well to add volume, and does not weigh down or make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> GREAT GREAT GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a product that could help me with my desperately thin (and thinning), volume less and straight hair; This is THE ONE! You can really see a difference after applying this spray and blow drying your hair. The volume doesn&#x27;t last for the whole day but considering I have extremely thin hair, this is already a great progress!</li>
            <li> as expected. used before. happy with price and delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years to help lightly thicken my very fine blonde hair. Although the price has gone up and the bottle grows smaller over the years and it is not often available for free Prime shipping, I&#x27;m still hooked.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this spray.</li>
            <li> Love that it only takes a few sprays to get volume and control, and that you can layer it without it flaking or attracting dirt.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this product just makes my hair sticky and matted down.</li>
            <li> This product definitely left my stringy hair looking great, but I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone touching my hair after I used this.  It was crunchy and sticky all day.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  I have a lot of hair but it is very fine and really long so the weight of my hair pulls down any body I would have making my hair look limp. I&#x27;ve also had a baby recently and all my hair is falling out!! However, after about 5 squirts of the BB Thickening Spray, I have fuller, bouncier hair and who doesn&#x27;t want that?! I spray it on my freshly clean hair when it is wet, then flip my head over and blow dry. I have coupled the spray with BB Straightening gel because my hair can get weird and wavy in moisture.  The end result is clean feeling, soft, full hair. I have noticed that if I get a little over excited and spray too much of the spray it will make my hair feel a bit more tacky than I like. So I would say you have to experiment with the amount that will work for you.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and I have been using this product for years.  This product makes it easier to style my hair and the style holds.</li>
            <li> a Thickener but it definitely helps keep your hair in place.Its not gooey or sticky and like a nice light spray. Good for the day.</li>
            <li> love it, have used it for years...it is the best product I have ever used. It makes your hair fuller and can style it much easier</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, especially for fine limp hair.  It is like I have a different head of full thick hair! I love this product.</li>
