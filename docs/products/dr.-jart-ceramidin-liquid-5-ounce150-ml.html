            <li>Wonderful serum-type feel to it.</li>
            <li>It also does a great job in preventing and repairing any skin</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s working really great for me</li>
            <li>I use it as a serum during my skin care regime, but think its also great to use as a toner step</li>
            <li>This is great -</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better!!</li>
            <li>Good in the mornings.</li>
            <li>The sample &amp;#34;skin saver&amp;#34; pack sells for about 20 here on amazon, and is a good deal if you are just wanting to try it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a sample of this from Birchbox and loved it.</li>

            <li>Effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I purchased this full-size bottle after receiving a sample in my Birchbox and loving it.</li>
            <li>But that wouldn&#x27;t be nice.</li>
            <li>and this is a nice moisturiser for summer.</li>
            <li>Holes weren&#x27;t sealed but it seems fine! :)</li>
            <li>But I have been using the liquid by itself and really love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more nourishing and the \\&quot;Star\\&quot; of the system.</li>
            <li>love this duo, it has saved my chronically parched skin in winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more nourishing and the \\&quot;Star\\&quot; of the system.</li>
            <li>love this duo, it will save my chronically parched skin in winter.</li>
            <li>- I LOVE how my skin is now.</li>
            <li>I love the concept of creating barriers in maintaining moisture in your skin with the ceramidin line.</li>
            <li>Then I apply my SPF on top.</li>
            <li>I love using it during my skin care regime, morning and night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to look any further, these two products make my skin resilient, glowing and the lines and wrinkles are greatly diminished!!</li>
            <li>I have only been using the lotion for a week, but I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(another product I love)</li>
            <li>Might be a good moisturizer, can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the clean moist feel.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell very much, to me, it has a nice herbal lolly smell.</li>
            <li>Says it&#x27;s a moisturizer get rid of fine lines and wrinkles, doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients that would indicate that it will do that.</li>
            <li>I now use it twice a day on clean skin at the first sign of a flare up, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a huge improvement in the quality of my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, finding a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my skin was huge for me.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge, HUGE fan of Dr. Jartt products.  </li>
            <li>I received the dr jart ceramidin liquid and cream as a free sample, and was amazed at the transformation in my skin.</li>
            <li>Love how fresh my skin feels after this product.</li>
            <li>The liquid is hydrating and dries with a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>When i apply the soft liquid in my hand and gently pat it onto my face, i enjoy the feel of my skin drinking up the goodness and becoming bright and supple.</li>
            <li>Jart&#x27; uses time-release microcapsule ceramides, which penetrate skin more effectively than regular ceramides.</li>
            <li>I actually got a sample of the Ceramidin Cream in one of my monthly Birch Boxes and loved it.  </li>
            <li>My forehead is still full of pimple marks and I get flare ups during my period.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of Dr. Jart, and I am a product junkie with a full drawer of moisturisers that didn&#x27;t work to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to disappear into my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t, it dries down beautifully.</li>
            <li>though it doesn&#x27;t exactly change my skin right away, I can sense it getting cleaner and cleaner :)</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found a way to return to normal looking skin!</li>
            <li>However, it does mildly moisturize and does not break me out.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very interested to see how well it works as we move into fall and winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part is that the combination of the liquid and the cream clears my flare ups in a day or two, and leaves my skin looking completely normal!No other treatment has done that for me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a reduction in fine wrinkles.undation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a reduction in fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My son is on accurate and it really dries out his skin.</li>
            <li>It is still brand new (and I bought the cream too - also brand new) and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Ceramidin strengthens the skin barrier, \\&quot;re-training\\&quot; it to modulate hydration more effectively like a microfine mesh strainer vs. a loose woven net.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Smells funny when you apply it</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Smells funny when you apply it</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m willing to overlook that part.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin, so I have not be using it all over my face during the day.  </li>
            <li>:) Definitely give this product a try!</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon and thanks to the seller for importing this from Korea for us!</li>
            <li>I have mature (cough,cough), fair, and dry skin.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it on my face, a refreshing feeling comes up, feels like it moisturizes my face all night long</li>
            <li>This product, along with the Ceramidin Cream, is all I use now after trying pretty much everything else out there for my aging skin.</li>
            <li>The formula is the same as the U.S. one - works the same - amazingly well.</li>
            <li>have also noticed that skin breakouts caused by monthly hormonal cycle seem to be reduced; my skin just really really likes this as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have not noticed much difference in my skin yet.  </li>
            <li>Using for about 2 months, kinda expected more results already.  </li>
            <li>We just don&#x27;t produce as much.</li>
            <li>WAY too much alcohol</li>
            <li>Really keeps moisture locked in.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to get a lot out of it.</li>
            <li>bottle is nice and large and it should last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I have the most chronic sensitive skin and dry patches.</li>
            <li>I scrubbed it all off with Cetaphil cleanser and then immediately applied this Ceramidin Liquid; my skin cleared up much faster than it normally would in a situation like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure this combination will keep my skin from drying out when the winds blow down from the north.</li>
            <li>Healthy skin acts as a respiratory barrier, filtering out anything bad, while keeping in the good stuff like moisture and ceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>See babies with their highly elastic, dewdrop lustrous skin?</li>
            <li>No thick residue buildup.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Those of you suffering from chronic dryness : the answer is not thick creams, the answer is how to repair your compromised skin</li>
            <li>So, this size would normally be $50 or so.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any new pimple since I started using this.</li>
            <li>I spread on some of my new Dr. Jart&#x27;s Beauty Balm SPF 45</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this doesn&#x27;t do very much for me.  </li>
            <li>As box says, Ceramidin is the first step in the skin care regimen, and I can feel how that would be good strategy for cold weather.</li>
            <li>And then on my 25th year, I developed adult acne.</li>
            <li>Just soft soft skin.</li>
            <li>Ceramides are lipids that naturally occur in our skin and provide long-term moisture, glowy skin.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on my neck consistently where my skin was dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that has give me back some of my confidence and has me thinking my skin and face actually look youthful!</li>
            <li>It feels hydrating and gentle to my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>My sample pack lasted me for about a month (5 or 6 flare ups of about a 3&amp;#34; round patch) and I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy the full sized jars afterwards.</li>
            <li>live in Central Florida</li>
            <li>In each case, the treatment resulted in a short term improvement but was less and less effective over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I can tell a significant improvement between using it and not using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old, and up until about 3 years ago, I looked maybe a decade younger than my age.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin, so I am only using the liquid, not the cream or the combo</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t impress me as much as the accompanying ceramidin moisturizer, but I use it in conjunction when I feel my face is extra dry.  </li>
            <li>only negative comments would be: I haven&#x27;t seen a reduction in fine lines or wrinkles, it takes a while to absorb into your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t smell the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it at night before going to bed and have noticed that my skin is never dry or flaky anymore.  </li>
            <li>and had resigned myself to the physical discomfort and social awkwardness</li>
            <li>With regular use, you&#x27;ll see your skin retain moisture on its own, needing less and less \\&quot;help\\&quot; from heavy occlusive creams.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been searching forever for a moisturizer that won&#x27;t make my skin break out and still keeps my skin hydrated during these awful MN winter months.  I actually got a sample of the Ceramidin Cream in one of my monthly Birch Boxes and loved it.  I decided to try the liquid when I reordered.  They actually recommend using the liquid and then putting the cream over it.  But I have been using the liquid by itself and really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a huge improvement in the quality of my skin since using this product.  I use it at night before going to bed and have noticed that my skin is never dry or flaky anymore.  It also does a great job in preventing and repairing any skin breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I break out very bad when I use any foundation with chemical sunscreen (anything other than titanium oxide or zinc oxide) and accidentally used some foundation with this in it.  My skin immediately started to break out.  I scrubbed it all off with Cetaphil cleanser and then immediately applied this Ceramidin Liquid; my skin cleared up much faster than it normally would in a situation like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that skin breakouts caused by monthly hormonal cycle seem to be reduced; my skin just really really likes this as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comments would be: I haven&#x27;t seen a reduction in fine lines or wrinkles, it takes a while to absorb into your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t smell the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, finding a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my skin was huge for me.  The fact that it actually improves my skin tone and quality is a giant bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;- Has drastically improved my skin quality; less redness and flaking&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts like other moisturizers I have tried (and I have tried a million of them).&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to speed up time it takes for my skin to recover from a breakout episode (whether from hormonal cycles or allergic reaction to foundation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Takes some time to absorb into the skin&lt;br /&gt;- Smells funny when you apply it (but this smell goes away quickly)&lt;br /&gt;- I haven&#x27;t really seen a reduction in fine wrinkles.undation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Takes some time to absorb into the skin&lt;br /&gt;- Smells funny when you apply it (but this smell goes away quickly)&lt;br /&gt;- I haven&#x27;t really seen a reduction in fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed much difference in my skin yet.  Using for about 2 months, kinda expected more results already.  However, it does mildly moisturize and does not break me out.</li>
            <li> Effective moisturizer. Good in the mornings. I pair with the skin laser at night.</li>
            <li> Pimples never used to be a problem for me. And then on my 25th year, I developed adult acne. My forehead is still full of pimple marks and I get flare ups during my period. I tried this product on a whim and wish I had discovered it earlier. It keeps my skin supple and seems to have calmed down my breakouts. I haven&#x27;t noticed any new pimple since I started using this. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell but it&#x27;s working really great for me, I&#x27;m willing to overlook that part. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  It has helped my skin retain it&#x27;s moisture. I use it 2x&#x27;s a day and use the moisturizer with it at night. This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used for my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I love the clean moist feel. Not sticky.  No thick residue buildup.  Just soft soft skin.</li>
            <li> I am a huge, HUGE fan of Dr. Jartt products.  I have been using this for about three weeks.  I have pretty oily skin, so I have not be using it all over my face during the day.  It is, however, a thinner formula that is not too moisturizing for oily skin.  I have been using it at night and I think that it is brightening and improving my skin.  I am very interested to see how well it works as we move into fall and winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone with dry skin, you will probably want to try the other version of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on my neck consistently where my skin was dry and irritated.  It has definitely healed that skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is nice and large and it should last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Ceramides are lipids that naturally occur in our skin and provide long-term moisture, glowy skin. We are born with a ton of ceramides. See babies with their highly elastic, dewdrop lustrous skin? that&#x27;s ceramides. Healthy skin acts as a respiratory barrier, filtering out anything bad, while keeping in the good stuff like moisture and ceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with time and age, our ceramide load shrivels up. We just don&#x27;t produce as much. And our skin barrier becomes thinner and thinner, esp. if you overexfoliate or do acid peels. You can try using all the Hyaluronic Acid you want, but it won&#x27;t help --it&#x27;ll just evaporate and escape from the loose barrier. You need ceramide lipids to hold that water in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to replenish our body&#x27;s store of ceramides, we need to ADD ceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Jart&#x27; uses time-release microcapsule ceramides, which penetrate skin more effectively than regular ceramides. With regular use, you&#x27;ll see your skin retain moisture on its own, needing less and less \\&quot;help\\&quot; from heavy occlusive creams. Ceramidin strengthens the skin barrier, \\&quot;re-training\\&quot; it to modulate hydration more effectively like a microfine mesh strainer vs. a loose woven net. And when you do end up using hyaluronic acid and other hydrators, the moisture will stay withIN your skin instead of evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you suffering from chronic dryness : the answer is not thick creams, the answer is how to repair your compromised skin barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jart&#x27;s Ceramidin system consists of a Cream and Liquid. The two are to be used in synergy with each other. Both are loaded with Ceramides. The serum-like milky liquid acts as a \\&quot;magnet\\&quot; to draw in the cream&#x27;s additional Ceramide power, when layered together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you need to just get one, consider your skin type. if you&#x27;re drier, make it the Cream. It&#x27;s more nourishing and the \\&quot;Star\\&quot; of the system. if you&#x27;re acne-prone and oilier, get the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this duo, it has saved my chronically parched skin in winter.But if you need to just get one, consider your skin type. if you&#x27;re drier, make it the Cream.

            <li> I purchased this full-size bottle after receiving a sample in my Birchbox and loving it. I&#x27;ve been using the liquid now for two weeks, and my skin is noticeably healthier. In fact, it&#x27;s emboldened me to leave the house without any makeup on whatsoever. I&#x27;m 45 years old, and up until about 3 years ago, I looked maybe a decade younger than my age. Then I hit peri-menopause, and everything changed, including my skin. This is the first product that has give me back some of my confidence and has me thinking my skin and face actually look youthful! I have naturally oily skin, so I am only using the liquid, not the cream or the combo (my understanding is that for dry skin, the cream is recommended as well). It moisturizes all day. I use it on my neck, as well, and what a difference! I&#x27;m telling you- this is as close to a miracle product as I&#x27;ve found, and I was almost hesitant to write a review because I wanted to keep the secret to myself. But that wouldn&#x27;t be nice. :) Definitely give this product a try!</li>
            <li> I have recently begun to suffer from a recurring patch of psoriasis on my hand. It&#x27;s ugly, red and maddeningly itchy. I went through a variety of moisturizers and over the counter medications (coal tar, salicylic acid, petroleum jelly and all manner of deep moisturizing creams). In each case, the treatment resulted in a short term improvement but was less and less effective over time. I did not want to use a prescription steroid cream (can&#x27;t have my baby chewing on that!) and had resigned myself to the physical discomfort and social awkwardness (yes, it does look like a flesh eating virus, but no, it&#x27;s not really contagious). I received the dr jart ceramidin liquid and cream as a free sample, and was amazed at the transformation in my skin. The liquid penetrates deeply, and instantly provides some cooling relief. The best part is that the combination of the liquid and the cream clears my flare ups in a day or two, and leaves my skin looking completely normal!No other treatment has done that for me. I now use it twice a day on clean skin at the first sign of a flare up, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. The sample &amp;#34;skin saver&amp;#34; pack sells for about 20 here on amazon, and is a good deal if you are just wanting to try it out. My sample pack lasted me for about a month (5 or 6 flare ups of about a 3&amp;#34; round patch) and I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy the full sized jars afterwards. I am so glad to have found a way to return to normal looking skin!</li>
            <li> This is one of those &amp;quot;holy grail&amp;quot; products - as it has transformed my skin. If you have chronically dry skin (like myself) or even dry patches or just dry and aging skin - this is something that pumps new life into your skin. It is so nourishing and so moisturizing - I LOVE how my skin is now. I also do chemical peels on my face -and using this afterwards is just perfect. A little goes a long way. I never bought a bottle of this stuff this large because it is highly expensive on Sephora - and in the past I never thought of buying it on here. So, this size would normally be $50 or so. Thank you Amazon and thanks to the seller for importing this from Korea for us! The formula is the same as the U.S. one - works the same - amazingly well. Some have said that it doesn&#x27;t have a seal on it - and I too have had concerns. But, I was thinking, if it came from Korea, it might need to be inspected in transit and the seal broken...but I don&#x27;t know. It is still brand new (and I bought the cream too - also brand new) and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love the concept of creating barriers in maintaining moisture in your skin with the ceramidin line. It helps maintain moisture but I recommend if you have severe face eczema like me, then you&#x27;ll want to add a face cream or face gel that works for you at the end. Think of this as a face primer like in your make up routine.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on my face, a refreshing feeling comes up, feels like it moisturizes my face all night long (I use it as a night cream)</li>
            <li> WAY too much alcohol; actually smells like rubbing alcohol .  Just get the Ceramidin Cream and use CerVe PM for something lighter instead of this trash.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is really supposed to do. Says it&#x27;s a moisturizer get rid of fine lines and wrinkles, doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients that would indicate that it will do that. Might be a good moisturizer, can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li> I have the most chronic sensitive skin and dry patches. This takes care of both. I use it like a serum all over my face, down my neck and on my chest. Then I apply my SPF on top. My skin has never looked better!! Love it! I will never be without it from now on!</li>
            <li> Love how fresh my skin feels after this product. though it doesn&#x27;t exactly change my skin right away, I can sense it getting cleaner and cleaner :)</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I am thankful that i purchased this product. It feels hydrating and gentle to my sensitive and dry skin. I enjoy the smell very much, to me, it has a nice herbal lolly smell. I love using it during my skin care regime, morning and night. When i apply the soft liquid in my hand and gently pat it onto my face, i enjoy the feel of my skin drinking up the goodness and becoming bright and supple. Also, at first i was confused whether this product is a serum or toner. I believe it is a serum but has consistency of a toner. I use it as a serum during my skin care regime, but think its also great to use as a toner step</li>
            <li> My son is on accurate and it really dries out his skin. He loves this product because it moisurizes without any reaction</li>
            <li> This product, along with the Ceramidin Cream, is all I use now after trying pretty much everything else out there for my aging skin. I don&#x27;t need to look any further, these two products make my skin resilient, glowing and the lines and wrinkles are greatly diminished!!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Dr. Jart, and I am a product junkie with a full drawer of moisturisers that didn&#x27;t work to my satisfaction. I have mature (cough,cough), fair, and dry skin. I bought Ceramidin on the recommendations of the reviewers, which is the reason I decided to write one myself. I have only been using the lotion for a week, but I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on a .05 Retinol routine of every other day because my skin so is sensitive. I was concerned after I got the product when I read on Dr. Jart&#x27;s box that there were Alpha Hydroxides in the Liquid (this was not mentioned on Amazon, or I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it),  but that was only on the promotional information. I couldn&#x27;t find any listed on the ingredient list.  Bottom line I am using the Liquid except on the Retinol nights, and nothing negative has happened. Actually, my skin is less dry from the Retinol than it used to be with my other moisturiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture on the Liquid is more like a serum, thin and slightly runny. I shake the product out onto my fingers and apply a generous layer of the lotion to my face and neck. I thought it was going to disappear into my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t, it dries down beautifully. The liquid is hydrating and dries with a smooth finish. I spread on some of my new Dr. Jart&#x27;s Beauty Balm SPF 45 (another product I love) and I am good to go for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Central Florida and this is a nice moisturiser for summer. As box says, Ceramidin is the first step in the skin care regimen, and I can feel how that would be good strategy for cold weather. As our weather cools down I will use another moisturiser on top and Ceramidin will be my serum base.  I am sure this combination will keep my skin from drying out when the winds blow down from the north.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sample of this from Birchbox and loved it. Wonderful serum-type feel to it. I like the price that I got here.</li>
            <li> So good. Really keeps moisture locked in. You don&#x27;t need much to get a lot out of it. The bottle lasted me a hundred years it seems. But as soon as it was gone, I was like, &amp;#34;Noooooooo!!!!!! I need the juice!&amp;#34;. I rely on it for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t impress me as much as the accompanying ceramidin moisturizer, but I use it in conjunction when I feel my face is extra dry.  I&#x27;m not sure I can tell a significant improvement between using it and not using it.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this doesn&#x27;t do very much for me.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This will nourish, help repair, and flakes go away. Received quickly. Holes weren&#x27;t sealed but it seems fine! :)</li>
            <li> This is great - I use it every time after I wash my face or shower. It feels so hydrating - like what I would imagine soaking my face with cucumbers!</li>
