            <li>I met a guy in his 40s who&#x27;s been using ORA MD for the better part of a decade - and he has just the most perfect teeth.  </li>
            <li>I guess that is good, kind of...</li>
            <li>but gives you more confidence!</li>
            <li>I use it either alone on the toothbrush, a drop or two on the tongue as a breath freshener, drip it onto dental floss, or on top of my toothpaste as a booster!</li>
            <li>It sure does freshen the breath!</li>
            <li>Love it and it has NO fluoride!</li>

            <li>started using this along with an additional popular mouth wash by crest</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>I met a man who was suffering from (acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis)</li>
            <li>or if I just make my own.</li>
            <li>I love the peppermint as it makes your breath smell good.</li>
            <li>Plaque and tartar still form very easy.</li>
            <li>and I tried as an oral rinse but feel it is more effective on a brush in my problem area.</li>
            <li>does make my gums feel better.  </li>
            <li>and it will be interesting to see what they say.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>After using it for some time, my oral health is much better.</li>
            <li>I will order some more soon....</li>
            <li>OraMD works better than I ever hoped, and my dental hygienist is amazed with the results.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have that more tartar up than if I was seeing him every 3 months.  </li>
            <li>One thing I love about this product is that there&#x27;s no SLS or Carageen.  </li>
            <li>It will not make your hair shinier and more manageable.</li>
            <li>BUT it sure makes a difference in how my mouth feels and smells and looks.  </li>
            <li>The combination of oils kills many oral bacteria, and offer health benefits for gum tissue.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love OraMD.  </li>
            <li>followed everything in the instruction, it said something like swallowing it would be ok.</li>
            <li>My husband uses the OraMD products to keep his teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>this was helpful :-)</li>
            <li>with an offer for a free bottle and all you have to do is pay for shipping!</li>
            <li>Most oils are made synthetically using chemicals.</li>
            <li>I went from having bleeding gums to healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>Made my gums feel better but still see some infection.</li>
            <li>My dentist said my gums never looked better.</li>
            <li>I will buy some more.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is also very usable on the go, which is very handy for me.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that trying to make your own blend of this product can be hazardous to your health.  </li>
            <li>and he was surprise how clean and nice my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>And I love how clean and refreshed my mouth feels after using it!</li>
            <li>okay fine,</li>
            <li>clean all day.&amp;#34;Brilliant&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how really clean my teeth feel with OraMD!  </li>
            <li>So  it does seem to make your gums more comfortable, but I would not trust it for cavity</li>
            <li>is a good indicator of how much your gums need this.</li>
            <li>I have pretty healthy gums, but after doing some research, I&#x27;ve decided to stay away from toxic toothpaste!</li>
            <li>i love the clean feeling that my mouth has after using this product.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and convenient.</li>
            <li>This is a strong oil, but I like it.</li>
            <li>The taste is strong but it did not bother me.</li>
            <li>My kids love this product and I notice a huge difference on my breath smell, feeling fresh, and I see my teeth is more presentable than before.</li>
            <li>OraMD is one smart product!!!    </li>
            <li>still got  Periodontal gum disease along with 4 infected teeth which need to be extracted, and still need periodontal dental surgery even though this item claims none of what I experienced would occur, if I brushed my teeth with these items, and of course I also flossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product free from</li>
            <li>: I received this product free from</li>
            <li>This is a great replacement / supplement for regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a fantastic rinse...</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean and my breath is so fresh.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, no bad reaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be prepared tho cause the very first time I added this liquid to my toothbrush, I experienced a big boost of minty goodness.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t squirt toothpaste in your mouth and use as a breath freshener, so I was excited alone by the liquid breath freshener aspect of this product.</li>
            <li>, I was so excited to see that OraMD is Made in the USA.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product as a preventative more than a cure, but find that is has helped my gums heal more than before I used it!</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>It makes your teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>but it does make my mouth feel clean..</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try and to my surprise not only has it worked, but it worked fairly quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>I really do support US made products now more than ever.</li>
            <li>I have been utilizing this product for a full week and already i can see a change in tartar build up</li>
            <li>but after you get used to the taste which is fast, I love using it morning and night.</li>
            <li>I also feel good about avoiding a lot of toxic chemicals found in traditional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>I am HIGHLY positive that after a month of using this product that my gums will completely be rid of redness so that when I go into see my doctor it will be good results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really strong at first and does take some getting used to...</li>
            <li>If you wanna end your pain in the gums you are lucky to have found this product as I have.</li>
            <li>Also, active charcoal is a very good cleaning agent, it really helped to heal my swelling gum.</li>
            <li>Very intense flavor but leaves your mouth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>had such HIGH hopes about this product after reading the great reviews that this product helped reverse gum recession.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit getting used to the strong peppermint taste, but really does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth, and is better for you than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>In response, I&#x27;ve been receiving deep cleanings, and most recently, mild surgery to clean the gums.</li>
            <li>health is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>like the fresh feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is pretty strong, and has somewhat of a burning sensation if you get too much, but it seems to help with cleansing my mouth.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having any dental problems at all, you&#x27;ll want to give this routine a try right away (even if you don&#x27;t have a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Worst of all, it doesn&#x27;t clean very well.</li>
            <li>This product is very strong, but rid of all my gum swelling and such within days!</li>
            <li>First, it is made of peppermint,  spearmint and almond oil.</li>
            <li>I combine this with a coconut oil and bashing soda paste once a week for extra cleaning but not every day because it&#x27;s more abrasive.  </li>
            <li>I do not know for sure if it is the ultimate answer to oral health</li>
            <li>I am still on first bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to order more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>, it was a healthy diet I follow later</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be interested to see what the hygienist says.</li>
            <li>MY WHOLE FAMILY IS USING IT!</li>
            <li>I had many problems with my gums and they are all gone in a short time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All natural and you can feel the fresh tingle!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It showed positive, my gum started to regrow.  </li>
            <li>Trusted Health Products Inc. I was not required to write a positive review.</li>
            <li>Trusted Health Products Inc. I was not required to write a positive review.</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re all very minty, and the effectiveness is consistent from bottle to bottle.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure how good your dentist really checked this.  </li>
            <li>I bought oramd 3 pack as this would be more cost efficient than a single bottle.  </li>

            <li>These days we must be smart consumers.</li>
            <li>OraMD is one smart product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These days we must be smart consumers.</li>
            <li>I ordered my first OraMd many years ago because I developed very severe gum swelling back 2006-7, and nothing seem to work</li>
            <li>It had a very strong minty taste as stated but after the first few days I could have handle it.</li>
            <li>breath much fresher.</li>
            <li>We really can see and smell the difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for awhile now,  works very well.</li>
            <li>no matter how much  you brush your teeth</li>
            <li>I was very worried</li>
            <li>I was floored and he even said I don&#x27;t see any real periodontis issues see you in 6 months.</li>
            <li>My gums feel much healthier and stronger now after using it a while.</li>
            <li>I like it and really feel its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My gum condition improved so much I was overjoyed.</li>
            <li>Especially carrier oils or the cheap oils you see on Ebay.  </li>
            <li>thankyou so much for your product</li>
            <li>To brush 2 times a day each with this solution and toothpaste might be more then your gums can take even with an extra soft brush</li>
            <li>also leaves my mouth very fresh - lasting for hours.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using my teeth and gums hurt and felt very sensitive</li>
            <li>product truly provides three purposes and performs all three purposes better than any other tooth product I have used.</li>
            <li>This product truly provides three purposes and performs all three purposes better than any other tooth product I have used.</li>
            <li>I do feel the people who clean my teeth and treat the gum disease try to hold back information as to how my teeth have improved unless you asked them.  </li>
            <li>A huge improvement back to normal.</li>
            <li>Along with sea salt to gargle (he had sores inside and that helped to clean his mouth), He gargled with ORAMD, he also took the following herbs:  garlic, echinacea, eyebright, and tumeric</li>
            <li>Now I brush with my regular whitening toothpaste, but after I put 3 drops onto my clean toothbrush and brush again.  </li>
            <li>Seriously if people say something, about how good you smell....and its your breath ah</li>
            <li>Within the first couple of weeks almost all of the sensitive areas in my mouth have healed and/or gone away.</li>
            <li>My gums are healthier and I absolutely love that the only ingredients are essential oils!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product,your teeth look whiter,your mouth feels clean,and your teeth,</li>
            <li>I really had faith in it because all that promises it claimed to do, plus it claimed to be natural</li>
            <li>stopping use of whiteners and normal toothpastes, c) taking vitamin c -</li>
            <li>Since beginning use of OraMD my gums rarely bleed; in addition, it has definitely reversed my receding gum line!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other natural liquid tooth cleaners in the past and enjoyed being able  to stow the .5 oz bottle into my jean pocket or purse and conveniently use when I need a breath freshener.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using ORAmd for 3 months, I had new pocket measurements - 2/3/4.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product hoping it would live up to the claims.</li>
            <li>Anyway, just started using as I did before when I probably should have started out slower and not with a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Every morning and last thing at night I brush my teeth manually or with my Sonicare, toothpaste and one drop of OraMD, then use my Waterpik to get it into my gums, and then I brush with my Sonicare again and 2-3 drops more for about 45-60 sec.  </li>
            <li>My mouth is all better and I have started OraMD slowly and gently with the brushing.</li>
            <li>so I thought why not order something that&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Now I need to figure out why I have recently been getting gum issues in the first place so that I don&#x27;t need to rely on this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps it smells a little bit strong.</li>
            <li>My dentist began to clean my teeth and there was excessive bleeding, which was a first.  </li>
            <li>I left his office very depressed and almost in tears after he finished speaking to me about my excessive bleeding and the extractions that I would surely have too</li>
            <li>Even when I was trying to be careful, the aroma alone is too strong to stay in my mouth, especially when you have tender gum and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you do want to make this product yourself you need to use 100% PURE essential oils.  </li>
            <li>On my old regimen, I had not had any cavities in literally years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much, too date we are using ORA MD daily and will continue too.</li>
            <li>I use this as a toothpase substitute whenever my gums get sensitive</li>
            <li>My dentist has been telling me for years that I have soft gums.</li>
            <li>Watching this man heal made me a believer in natural healing.  </li>
            <li>trying to get a drop out of the bottle is near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really reallllly wanted it to do the same for me.  </li>
            <li>I get it that to be all natural</li>
            <li>Soft tissue sores in my mouth from orthodontics cleared up faster when I used this as a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li>I have a recurring problem with a front tooth (cap with root canal - 50 year old surgery).</li>
            <li>he almost seem surprised I had these pockets.</li>
            <li>This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, but this is the first time that I&#x27;m using it regularly.  </li>
            <li>The taste take a little getting used to but, not a bad product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I give this product raves because after using it just once my teeth felt clean all day long even though I only brushed my teeth with it in the morning!!!</li>
            <li>and my gums are almost back to normal...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to other toothpaste you can really feel the difference when brushing with OraMD, you can feel your entire mouth being much, much cleaner</li>
            <li>tho I gave up the bad-for-you chemically-laced toothpastes long ago (after not using those products for awhile, if you do try them again, the sugar is so evident and the paste actually tastes chalky [yuck])</li>
            <li>I had to take 2 weeks to treat my mouth with warm salt water, baking soda and peroxide to get it back to normal - kinda scary.</li>
            <li>and you will see result almost right away when it comes to cavities and other mouth related</li>
            <li>(you can look up the benefits of these herbs; each helps to clean out different things...mucus and infection especially thru either cleaning out the bloodstream or taking down swelling or eliminating excess mucus).  </li>
            <li>The tartar always seems to coat my teeth by early afternoon, especially after eating breakfast, drinking coffee, a glass of wine and</li>
            <li>I also like to buy it in the 3 pack to save $$, and so that I don&#x27;t run out unexpectedly as I have become used to using it daily, and miss it when I don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>The best part is after the 3rd day I have no longer pussing gums and after this week I no longer wake up with extreme bad breath and even through out the day.</li>
            <li>I got a little on my lip and was surprised how much it tingled.</li>
            <li>Due to the strength of these oils, I really would not recommend for children.</li>
            <li>I was eagerly awaiting my next visit, which was last November when my dentist  did not waste time in reminding me about my extraction and then proceeded to take another X-ray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wanting so badly to only use natural products in my mouth that would actually work</li>
            <li>it did burn a little bit the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>, I began to experience issues with my gums despite the fact that my oral hygiene was probably no worse then the average person&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at over the counter items but none seemed to help.</li>
            <li>Other than the normal routine, this was it.</li>
            <li>My mouth became very irritated, bleeding gums, little bumps, so darn sore.</li>

            <li> Really good.</li>
            <li> it surprisingly works quite well</li>
            <li> I have a good relationship with my dental hygienist and we&#x27;ve been working to fix my gum recession.</li>
            <li> Good product delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Ive had strangers say that smells so good.</li>
            <li> I met a guy in his 40s who&#x27;s been using ORA MD for the better part of a decade - and he has just the most perfect teeth.  </li>
            <li> I guess that is good, kind of...</li>
            <li> but gives you more confidence!</li>
            <li> I use it either alone on the toothbrush, a drop or two on the tongue as a breath freshener, drip it onto dental floss, or on top of my toothpaste as a booster!</li>
            <li> It sure does freshen the breath!</li>
            <li> Love it and it has NO fluoride!</li>
            <li> The mint scent is potent!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and effective.</li>
            <li> started using this along with an additional popular mouth wash by crest</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I met a man who was suffering from (acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis)</li>
            <li> or if I just make my own.</li>
            <li> I love the peppermint as it makes your breath smell good.</li>
            <li> Plaque and tartar still form very easy.</li>
            <li> and I tried as an oral rinse but feel it is more effective on a brush in my problem area.</li>
            <li> does make my gums feel better.  </li>
            <li> and it will be interesting to see what they say.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> After using it for some time, my oral health is much better.</li>
            <li> I will order some more soon....</li>
            <li> OraMD works better than I ever hoped, and my dental hygienist is amazed with the results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that more tartar up than if I was seeing him every 3 months.  </li>
            <li> One thing I love about this product is that there&#x27;s no SLS or Carageen.  </li>
            <li> It will not make your hair shinier and more manageable.</li>
            <li> BUT it sure makes a difference in how my mouth feels and smells and looks.  </li>
            <li> The combination of oils kills many oral bacteria, and offer health benefits for gum tissue.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love OraMD.  </li>
            <li> followed everything in the instruction, it said something like swallowing it would be ok.</li>
            <li> My husband uses the OraMD products to keep his teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> this was helpful :-)</li>
            <li> with an offer for a free bottle and all you have to do is pay for shipping!</li>
            <li> Most oils are made synthetically using chemicals.</li>
            <li> I went from having bleeding gums to healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> Made my gums feel better but still see some infection.</li>
            <li> My dentist said my gums never looked better.</li>
            <li> I will buy some more.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is also very usable on the go, which is very handy for me.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that trying to make your own blend of this product can be hazardous to your health.  </li>
            <li> and he was surprise how clean and nice my teeth looked.</li>
            <li> And I love how clean and refreshed my mouth feels after using it!</li>
            <li> okay fine,</li>
            <li> clean all day.&amp;#34;Brilliant&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how really clean my teeth feel with OraMD!  </li>
            <li> So  it does seem to make your gums more comfortable, but I would not trust it for cavity</li>
            <li> is a good indicator of how much your gums need this.</li>
            <li> I have pretty healthy gums, but after doing some research, I&#x27;ve decided to stay away from toxic toothpaste!</li>
            <li> i love the clean feeling that my mouth has after using this product.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and convenient.</li>
            <li> This is a strong oil, but I like it.</li>
            <li> The taste is strong but it did not bother me.</li>
            <li> My kids love this product and I notice a huge difference on my breath smell, feeling fresh, and I see my teeth is more presentable than before.</li>
            <li> OraMD is one smart product!!!    </li>
            <li> still got  Periodontal gum disease along with 4 infected teeth which need to be extracted, and still need periodontal dental surgery even though this item claims none of what I experienced would occur, if I brushed my teeth with these items, and of course I also flossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product free from</li>
            <li> : I received this product free from</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement / supplement for regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a fantastic rinse...</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean and my breath is so fresh.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, no bad reaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be prepared tho cause the very first time I added this liquid to my toothbrush, I experienced a big boost of minty goodness.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t squirt toothpaste in your mouth and use as a breath freshener, so I was excited alone by the liquid breath freshener aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> , I was so excited to see that OraMD is Made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product as a preventative more than a cure, but find that is has helped my gums heal more than before I used it!</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> but it does make my mouth feel clean..</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try and to my surprise not only has it worked, but it worked fairly quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> I really do support US made products now more than ever.</li>
            <li> I have been utilizing this product for a full week and already i can see a change in tartar build up</li>
            <li> but after you get used to the taste which is fast, I love using it morning and night.</li>
            <li> I also feel good about avoiding a lot of toxic chemicals found in traditional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> I am HIGHLY positive that after a month of using this product that my gums will completely be rid of redness so that when I go into see my doctor it will be good results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really strong at first and does take some getting used to...</li>
            <li> If you wanna end your pain in the gums you are lucky to have found this product as I have.</li>
            <li> Also, active charcoal is a very good cleaning agent, it really helped to heal my swelling gum.</li>
            <li> Very intense flavor but leaves your mouth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> had such HIGH hopes about this product after reading the great reviews that this product helped reverse gum recession.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit getting used to the strong peppermint taste, but really does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth, and is better for you than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> In response, I&#x27;ve been receiving deep cleanings, and most recently, mild surgery to clean the gums.</li>
            <li> health is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> like the fresh feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is pretty strong, and has somewhat of a burning sensation if you get too much, but it seems to help with cleansing my mouth.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having any dental problems at all, you&#x27;ll want to give this routine a try right away (even if you don&#x27;t have a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Worst of all, it doesn&#x27;t clean very well.</li>
            <li> This product is very strong, but rid of all my gum swelling and such within days!</li>
            <li> First, it is made of peppermint,  spearmint and almond oil.</li>
            <li> I combine this with a coconut oil and bashing soda paste once a week for extra cleaning but not every day because it&#x27;s more abrasive.  </li>
            <li> I do not know for sure if it is the ultimate answer to oral health</li>
            <li> I am still on first bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to order more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> , it was a healthy diet I follow later</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be interested to see what the hygienist says.</li>
            <li> MY WHOLE FAMILY IS USING IT!</li>
            <li> I had many problems with my gums and they are all gone in a short time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All natural and you can feel the fresh tingle!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It showed positive, my gum started to regrow.  </li>
            <li> Trusted Health Products Inc. I was not required to write a positive review.</li>
            <li> Trusted Health Products Inc. I was not required to write a positive review.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re all very minty, and the effectiveness is consistent from bottle to bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how good your dentist really checked this.  </li>
            <li> I bought oramd 3 pack as this would be more cost efficient than a single bottle.  </li>
            <li> Worldwide 100% Pure Mouthwash for Receding Gums]]</li>
            <li> These days we must be smart consumers.</li>
            <li> OraMD is one smart product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These days we must be smart consumers.</li>
            <li> I ordered my first OraMd many years ago because I developed very severe gum swelling back 2006-7, and nothing seem to work</li>
            <li> It had a very strong minty taste as stated but after the first few days I could have handle it.</li>
            <li> breath much fresher.</li>
            <li> We really can see and smell the difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile now,  works very well.</li>
            <li> no matter how much  you brush your teeth</li>
            <li> I was very worried</li>
            <li> I was floored and he even said I don&#x27;t see any real periodontis issues see you in 6 months.</li>
            <li> My gums feel much healthier and stronger now after using it a while.</li>
            <li> I like it and really feel its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My gum condition improved so much I was overjoyed.</li>
            <li> Especially carrier oils or the cheap oils you see on Ebay.  </li>
            <li> thankyou so much for your product</li>
            <li> To brush 2 times a day each with this solution and toothpaste might be more then your gums can take even with an extra soft brush</li>
            <li> also leaves my mouth very fresh - lasting for hours.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using my teeth and gums hurt and felt very sensitive</li>
            <li> product truly provides three purposes and performs all three purposes better than any other tooth product I have used.</li>
            <li> This product truly provides three purposes and performs all three purposes better than any other tooth product I have used.</li>
            <li> I do feel the people who clean my teeth and treat the gum disease try to hold back information as to how my teeth have improved unless you asked them.  </li>
            <li> A huge improvement back to normal.</li>
            <li> Along with sea salt to gargle (he had sores inside and that helped to clean his mouth), He gargled with ORAMD, he also took the following herbs:  garlic, echinacea, eyebright, and tumeric</li>
            <li> Now I brush with my regular whitening toothpaste, but after I put 3 drops onto my clean toothbrush and brush again.  </li>
            <li> Seriously if people say something, about how good you smell....and its your breath ah</li>
            <li> Within the first couple of weeks almost all of the sensitive areas in my mouth have healed and/or gone away.</li>
            <li> My gums are healthier and I absolutely love that the only ingredients are essential oils!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product,your teeth look whiter,your mouth feels clean,and your teeth,</li>
            <li> I really had faith in it because all that promises it claimed to do, plus it claimed to be natural</li>
            <li> stopping use of whiteners and normal toothpastes, c) taking vitamin c -</li>
            <li> Since beginning use of OraMD my gums rarely bleed; in addition, it has definitely reversed my receding gum line!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other natural liquid tooth cleaners in the past and enjoyed being able  to stow the .5 oz bottle into my jean pocket or purse and conveniently use when I need a breath freshener.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using ORAmd for 3 months, I had new pocket measurements - 2/3/4.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping it would live up to the claims.</li>
            <li> Anyway, just started using as I did before when I probably should have started out slower and not with a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Every morning and last thing at night I brush my teeth manually or with my Sonicare, toothpaste and one drop of OraMD, then use my Waterpik to get it into my gums, and then I brush with my Sonicare again and 2-3 drops more for about 45-60 sec.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is all better and I have started OraMD slowly and gently with the brushing.</li>
            <li> so I thought why not order something that&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Now I need to figure out why I have recently been getting gum issues in the first place so that I don&#x27;t need to rely on this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps it smells a little bit strong.</li>
            <li> My dentist began to clean my teeth and there was excessive bleeding, which was a first.  </li>
            <li> I left his office very depressed and almost in tears after he finished speaking to me about my excessive bleeding and the extractions that I would surely have too</li>
            <li> Even when I was trying to be careful, the aroma alone is too strong to stay in my mouth, especially when you have tender gum and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do want to make this product yourself you need to use 100% PURE essential oils.  </li>
            <li> On my old regimen, I had not had any cavities in literally years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much, too date we are using ORA MD daily and will continue too.</li>
            <li> I use this as a toothpase substitute whenever my gums get sensitive</li>
            <li> My dentist has been telling me for years that I have soft gums.</li>
            <li> Watching this man heal made me a believer in natural healing.  </li>
            <li> trying to get a drop out of the bottle is near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really reallllly wanted it to do the same for me.  </li>
            <li> I get it that to be all natural</li>
            <li> Soft tissue sores in my mouth from orthodontics cleared up faster when I used this as a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> I have a recurring problem with a front tooth (cap with root canal - 50 year old surgery).</li>
            <li> he almost seem surprised I had these pockets.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, but this is the first time that I&#x27;m using it regularly.  </li>
            <li> The taste take a little getting used to but, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I give this product raves because after using it just once my teeth felt clean all day long even though I only brushed my teeth with it in the morning!!!</li>
            <li> and my gums are almost back to normal...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to other toothpaste you can really feel the difference when brushing with OraMD, you can feel your entire mouth being much, much cleaner</li>
            <li> tho I gave up the bad-for-you chemically-laced toothpastes long ago (after not using those products for awhile, if you do try them again, the sugar is so evident and the paste actually tastes chalky [yuck])</li>
            <li> I had to take 2 weeks to treat my mouth with warm salt water, baking soda and peroxide to get it back to normal - kinda scary.</li>
            <li> and you will see result almost right away when it comes to cavities and other mouth related</li>
            <li> (you can look up the benefits of these herbs; each helps to clean out different things...mucus and infection especially thru either cleaning out the bloodstream or taking down swelling or eliminating excess mucus).  </li>
            <li> The tartar always seems to coat my teeth by early afternoon, especially after eating breakfast, drinking coffee, a glass of wine and</li>
            <li> I also like to buy it in the 3 pack to save $$, and so that I don&#x27;t run out unexpectedly as I have become used to using it daily, and miss it when I don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> The best part is after the 3rd day I have no longer pussing gums and after this week I no longer wake up with extreme bad breath and even through out the day.</li>
            <li> I got a little on my lip and was surprised how much it tingled.</li>
            <li> Due to the strength of these oils, I really would not recommend for children.</li>
            <li> I was eagerly awaiting my next visit, which was last November when my dentist  did not waste time in reminding me about my extraction and then proceeded to take another X-ray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wanting so badly to only use natural products in my mouth that would actually work</li>
            <li> it did burn a little bit the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> , I began to experience issues with my gums despite the fact that my oral hygiene was probably no worse then the average person&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at over the counter items but none seemed to help.</li>
            <li> Other than the normal routine, this was it.</li>
            <li> My mouth became very irritated, bleeding gums, little bumps, so darn sore.</li>
            <li> Right now, I have an expensive organic, 100% pure mouthwash on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> , I was not expecting OraMD to be a much different experience than my usual 100% pure</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that for any other natural toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li> As long as you always use an electric toothbrush, the liquid/non-foam thing isn&#x27;t that big of an issue.</li>
            <li> I have a half a dozen all natural (good-for-you) toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Then a month later, because of bite change, I developed a small gap between two teeth which led to a constantly inflamed gum.</li>
            <li> 3 months ago I visited my dentist due to some discomfort I was having in my upper back tooth.</li>
            <li> But when I used this product my teeth are ok for drinking cold drinks.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have had very bad oral health most of my adult life as a result of lack of dental insurance/money, genetics, and probably years of smoking (previously, not anymore)</li>
            <li> The freshness lingers for a long time, it doesn&#x27;t dry out the mouth the way mouthwashes do, and I wake in the morning with a cleaner-feeling mouth.  </li>
            <li> I still get some dry mouth effects from this product</li>
            <li> I have returned to supplementing  the ORA MD with some Fluoride gels and rinses to try to cut down on cavities  in the future, rather than using it exclusively like I was doing.  </li>
            <li> When I started using the product as directed, I discovered that I had 4 small cavities at my next check up with the regular dentist..  </li>
            <li> Starting using about a year and half ago</li>
            <li> The product seemed a little different to me, stronger perhaps.</li>
            <li> Each bottle should last at least 2 months, so this is cheaper than my regular brand of non-fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Did not help at all and was a total waste of money and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As expected</li>
            <li> Sometimes trying to make something yourself when you don&#x27;t know the dynamics of a product can end up with a person becoming very ill; immune disorders, toxic poisoning or even killing you.</li>
            <li> However, I stopped using it for awhile, no real reason why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been grinding and clenching my teeth (due to anxiety) for at least a year and a half, and my gums were receding, loosening, discoloring even with frequent Sonicare use.  </li>
            <li> My dentist told me that I would have too extract them, due to my gum loss.</li>
            <li> I made other changes like flossing and increasing my magnesium.  </li>
            <li> This and other products from Trusted Health Products work when used as directed.</li>
            <li> I like the freshness using this product affords, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make me extremely thirsty all night, the way mouthwashes always have.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had bought it a year ago before I had the other issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in the place of toothpaste just short if two months, adding nothing else to my routine save the usual flossing.</li>
            <li> I think at first it tasted weird</li>
            <li> What I want to advise is that it&#x27;s NOT OK to swallow this stuff down (whether on purpose or accidentally), my literally lost my voice one time when I wasn&#x27;t being careful enough.</li>
            <li> iwas a little skeptical at first,some of the reviews i was reading were right</li>
            <li> My gums have totally stopped bleeding, have lots their &#x27;inflamed&#x27; look, and are hard.</li>
            <li> My wife smelled it from the other room!</li>
            <li> The root becomes slightly infected and the tooth loosens.  </li>
            <li> In less than a week of using this to brush twice a day, the symptoms disappeared - no need for antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Some bottles of Ora MD burn a little, especially if you brush too hard, and, watch out!</li>
            <li> so any little thing I can do to boost it</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey but my health and my families</li>
            <li> The periodontist did not say there was an improvement after I had been  using the product, but only that my gums were not any worse than before.  </li>
            <li> thorough disappointment, and a total waste of time and money....should have had a second dental opinion before believing this  hype.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and will not be without it...</li>
            <li> Dr. Christopher&#x27;s tooth and gum POWDER is easier to use in my opinion, and that&#x27;s still messy and a pain too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was a few years ago and since then I have been putting it off</li>
            <li> but the product itself is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> My teeth stopped hurting too (actually they hurt worse for a couple of days, then stopped altogether).  </li>
            <li> The product is not to mask poor dental hygiene, but along with proper hygiene, will give you, will boost your confidence to have a conversation with someone without the offensive mouth odor.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> My teeth feels like they are polished everyday.</li>
            <li> This ORAMD really helped relieved the painful symptoms until the swelling went down.  </li>
            <li> How bad it hurts when you first start using it</li>
            <li> I will be getting the usual cleaning in a few weeks</li>
            <li> and I have had only red gums swelling and bad breath to accompany pus whenever the gums are squeezed.</li>
            <li> In this world where everything seems to be a con and where you have people giving false recommendations on Amazon for products they are affiliated with, it might seem unlikely that this is the real deal, but it worked for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure about that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My teeth are so sensitive for cold water.</li>
            <li> No more irritation.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think yet still don&#x27;t know if this stuff is legit or not</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about to product but figured to give it a dry.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone that is having a hard time with their teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, but I just find it too hard to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but this product has made a huge difference, and averted an otherwise terrible process with my dentist.</li>
            <li> this surprised me as i have a history of bad gum disease in my family...</li>
            <li> my late 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> hope i&#x27;m not sounding too negative.  </li>
            <li> it likely won&#x27;t foam well, but I&#x27;ll accept any paste form, regardelss of how poorly it foams, over a liquid that&#x27;s difficult to brush with at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know that I had the gum issue for at least a month before I used this product.</li>
            <li> i started to see results in at least two weeks after using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little over a week, and I can see my gums have become noticeably healthier, sounds crazy</li>
            <li> My pocket measurements have been in the 4-6 level, and getting worse.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I want to say that this stuff is hella expensive and the result is not that glorified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , they only care about selling you stuff that does not work and tastes awful</li>
            <li> The procedures have been painful and expensive.</li>
            <li> Terrible taste and company sucks , contacted company</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t burn as bad</li>
            <li> but no where as bad as toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was having terrible bleeding gums and bad taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my gums were always very bad...</li>
            <li> Does not work and tastes terrible!</li>
            <li> I have terrible sinus problems and breathe through my mouth at night.</li>
            <li> i think i found the secret!!!!!</li>

            <li> I like  using the OR MD product;it does make my gums feel better.  The periodontist did not say there was an improvement after I had been  using the product, but only that my gums were not any worse than before.  I guess that is good, kind of... However,beware.  When I started using the product as directed, I discovered that I had 4 small cavities at my next check up with the regular dentist..  On my old regimen, I had not had any cavities in literally years.  I have returned to supplementing  the ORA MD with some Fluoride gels and rinses to try to cut down on cavities  in the future, rather than using it exclusively like I was doing.  So  it does seem to make your gums more comfortable, but I would not trust it for cavity protection.[[ASIN:B009GMYACC OraMD 3-pack - Dentist Recommended Worldwide 100% Pure Mouthwash for Receding Gums]]</li>
            <li> My dentist asked what we were doing.  Other than the normal routine, this was it.</li>
            <li> I was having terrible bleeding gums and bad taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this along with an additional popular mouth wash by crest and my gums are almost back to normal...breath much fresher. Lasts a long time. It&#x27;s really strong at first and does take some getting used to...but gives you more confidence!</li>
            <li> This product simply takes brushing to another level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other toothpaste you can really feel the difference when brushing with OraMD, you can feel your entire mouth being much, much cleaner and you will see result almost right away when it comes to cavities and other mouth related problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that is having a hard time with their teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. What a difference in our teeth, breath and oral hygiene now. We really can see and smell the difference. The plaque feels gone from our teeth too...going to dentist next month and it will be interesting to see what they say. We love it.</li>
            <li> Starting using about a year and half ago and I was told by my dentist that I had periodontal disease and had to start treatments and keep doing treatments every 3 months. After my 1st visit my dentist noticed a big difference and dropped my to every 6 months, now I only have to go once a year.</li>
            <li> I AM HAPPY!  3 months ago I visited my dentist due to some discomfort I was having in my upper back tooth. My dentist began to clean my teeth and there was excessive bleeding, which was a first.  My dentist told me that I would have too extract them, due to my gum loss. I left his office very depressed and almost in tears after he finished speaking to me about my excessive bleeding and the extractions that I would surely have too do.&lt;br /&gt;My husband, after I told him what had happened, immediately he did some research and came upon this product ORA MD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was in the month of September, I started using ORA MD.  It had a very strong minty taste as stated but after the first few days I could have handle it. I made other changes like flossing and increasing my magnesium.  I was eagerly awaiting my next visit, which was last November when my dentist  did not waste time in reminding me about my extraction and then proceeded to take another X-ray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It showed positive, my gum started to regrow.  Apart from that, the bleeding had stopped about 2 weeks after I started using ORA MD.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much, too date we are using ORA MD daily and will continue too.</li>
            <li> Did not help at all and was a total waste of money and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still got  Periodontal gum disease along with 4 infected teeth which need to be extracted, and still need periodontal dental surgery even though this item claims none of what I experienced would occur, if I brushed my teeth with these items, and of course I also flossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thorough disappointment, and a total waste of time and money....should have had a second dental opinion before believing this  hype.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile now,  works very well.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with my gums, constantly bleeding (gum disease). I decided this product to see if it will help.....After a week of using this product my gum is stop bleeding. My kids love this product and I notice a huge difference on my breath smell, feeling fresh, and I see my teeth is more presentable than before. Do experienced there is a time no matter how much  you brush your teeth is still look dirty,,,,,stain, yellowish and smell. This one will definitely the answer. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a strong oil, but I like it. After using it for some time, my oral health is much better. Tooth paste wears away tooth enamel. this does not.</li>
            <li> In this world where everything seems to be a con and where you have people giving false recommendations on Amazon for products they are affiliated with, it might seem unlikely that this is the real deal, but it worked for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my late 40&#x27;s, I began to experience issues with my gums despite the fact that my oral hygiene was probably no worse then the average person&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at over the counter items but none seemed to help. I decided to give this a try and to my surprise not only has it worked, but it worked fairly quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to say that if you have receding gum lines you will want to either use this INSTEAD of your toothpaste or just use it as a mouthwash. To brush 2 times a day each with this solution and toothpaste might be more then your gums can take even with an extra soft brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for only two week and can tell the difference it&#x27;s making to my gums...I will order some more soon....maybe I won&#x27;t have to have the deep cleaning that I&#x27;m scheduled for in two weeks....</li>
            <li> I have tried several dentifrices with mixed results. OraMD works better than I ever hoped, and my dental hygienist is amazed with the results.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit getting used to the strong peppermint taste, but really does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth, and is better for you than regular toothpaste. I have use similar products, but none can compare to OralMD.</li>
            <li> Very nice for your mouth a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean and my breath is so fresh.  My teeth do not bleed anymore. One bottle last over a month.</li>
            <li> I use this as a toothpase substitute whenever my gums get sensitive or I have a bit of pain. It works quite well, just using it for 3-4 days does the trick. I believe part of the advantage is there is no abrasive, whereas toothpaste has some abrasives in it. Even sodium bicarbonate (IE Tom&#x27;s) has an abrasive effect.&lt;br /&gt;I also try to use perhaps once a week for &#x27;maintenance.&#x27; My gums have looked great ever since, according to the dentist - they were showing some recession before.</li>
            <li> Saved $3,000 at the dentist!</li>
            <li> I changed my mind about this product I think it is an excellent product.  I visit my dentist and found after I hadn&#x27;t seen him in about 6 months I didn&#x27;t have that more tartar up than if I was seeing him every 3 months.  I do feel the people who clean my teeth and treat the gum disease try to hold back information as to how my teeth have improved unless you asked them.  So, if you haven&#x27;t tried this product, try it you will be happy you did. A.L.</li>
            <li> If you wanna end your pain in the gums you are lucky to have found this product as I have.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been telling me for years that I have soft gums. My pocket measurements have been in the 4-6 level, and getting worse. In response, I&#x27;ve been receiving deep cleanings, and most recently, mild surgery to clean the gums. The procedures have been painful and expensive. Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve been brushing and flossing constantly, with no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using ORAmd for 3 months, I had new pocket measurements - 2/3/4. A huge improvement back to normal. My gums have totally stopped bleeding, have lots their &#x27;inflamed&#x27; look, and are hard. They even seem to be moving back up the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the combination of a) this product b) stopping use of whiteners and normal toothpastes, c) taking vitamin c - has made a massive difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but this product has made a huge difference, and averted an otherwise terrible process with my dentist.</li>
            <li> This product has all the properties I seek in an oral care product. First, it is made of peppermint,  spearmint and almond oil. Read the ingredients for yourself! [...]. Secondly, no GMO&#x27;s!!!! Third, this product truly does serve three purposes: toothpaste, mouthwash and breath freshener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared tho cause the very first time I added this liquid to my toothbrush, I experienced a big boost of minty goodness. I got a little on my lip and was surprised how much it tingled. However, I was prepared for this sensation as I read all of the literature and the website before reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even tho I gave up the bad-for-you chemically-laced toothpastes long ago (after not using those products for awhile, if you do try them again, the sugar is so evident and the paste actually tastes chalky [yuck]), I was not expecting OraMD to be a much different experience than my usual 100% pure toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other natural liquid tooth cleaners in the past and enjoyed being able  to stow the .5 oz bottle into my jean pocket or purse and conveniently use when I need a breath freshener. You can&#x27;t squirt toothpaste in your mouth and use as a breath freshener, so I was excited alone by the liquid breath freshener aspect of this product. I assumed it would serve two purposes well (mouthwash, breath freshener on the go).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I give this product raves because after using it just once my teeth felt clean all day long even though I only brushed my teeth with it in the morning!!! I can&#x27;t say that for any other natural toothpaste I have ever used. The tartar always seems to coat my teeth by early afternoon, especially after eating breakfast, drinking coffee, a glass of wine and dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was so excited to see that OraMD is Made in the USA. I really do support US made products now more than ever. I recommend OraMD also because it will save you money. Right now, I have an expensive organic, 100% pure mouthwash on my bathroom sink. I have a half a dozen all natural (good-for-you) toothpastes. Then, throughout my house and in my purse and in the car, I am always hunting for gum and breath mints.I am always buying products. Leave a bottle of OraMD in your medicine cabinet, in your car, and in your purse. Also, buy your friends three bottles each for their Christmas stocking and for Hanukah, Kwanza, or whatever you celebrate. These days we must be smart consumers. OraMD is one smart product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product truly provides three purposes and performs all three purposes better than any other tooth product I have used. Since I am a Berean, I recommend you research the clinical study results of OraMD for yourself here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product free from Trusted Health Products Inc.

            <li> ORAMD is a great product for removing plaque and oral disease.  I met a man who was suffering from (acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis) ANUG, his face and mouth were swollen to the point where he couldn&#x27;t eat and his gum line was starting to deteriorate.  Along with sea salt to gargle (he had sores inside and that helped to clean his mouth), He gargled with ORAMD, he also took the following herbs:  garlic, echinacea, eyebright, and tumeric (you can look up the benefits of these herbs; each helps to clean out different things...mucus and infection especially thru either cleaning out the bloodstream or taking down swelling or eliminating excess mucus).  He also did an enema but his disease turned around.  This ORAMD really helped relieved the painful symptoms until the swelling went down.  I use it everyday and will not be without it...throw away your toothpaste would be my suggestion and turn to ORAMD.  Watching this man heal made me a believer in natural healing.  If you have never seen ANUG, look it up.</li>
            <li> I received my OraMD on time. Before my gum pockets where averaging at 5. I even had some pockets showing at an 8. I was very worried so I ended up going to a specialist, but at that time in between my visit I started the drops about 1 1/2 weeks. When the specialist started reading my measurements at 2, 3, 1,. I was floored and he even said I don&#x27;t see any real periodontis issues see you in 6 months. Wow!</li>
            <li> trying to get a drop out of the bottle is near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a plastic squeeze bottle, but it is actually glass. okay fine, but how do I get a drop out ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, plastic would be toxic and wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t care if it is made from plastic or glass or whatever, I just want a drop to come out.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is awesome. Very intense flavor but leaves your mouth feeling super clean. My dentist actually noticed improvement on my gums. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I use it either alone on the toothbrush, a drop or two on the tongue as a breath freshener, drip it onto dental floss, or on top of my toothpaste as a booster! It is pretty strong, and has somewhat of a burning sensation if you get too much, but it seems to help with cleansing my mouth. I have had very bad oral health most of my adult life as a result of lack of dental insurance/money, genetics, and probably years of smoking (previously, not anymore) so any little thing I can do to boost it I appreciate. I would definitely recommend this product as a preventative more than a cure, but find that is has helped my gums heal more than before I used it! If only I had discovered it earlier it might have prevented some of the issues I suffer from now!? I also like to buy it in the 3 pack to save $$, and so that I don&#x27;t run out unexpectedly as I have become used to using it daily, and miss it when I don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a liquid.  So it works alright as a mouthwash when diluted with water.  But how am I supposed to brush my teeth with it???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had such HIGH hopes about this product after reading the great reviews that this product helped reverse gum recession.  I really reallllly wanted it to do the same for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, but I just find it too hard to use.  Dr. Christopher&#x27;s tooth and gum POWDER is easier to use in my opinion, and that&#x27;s still messy and a pain too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope i&#x27;m not sounding too negative.  One thing I love about this product is that there&#x27;s no SLS or Carageen.  But why does it have to be a liquid.  I get it that to be all natural it likely won&#x27;t foam well, but I&#x27;ll accept any paste form, regardelss of how poorly it foams, over a liquid that&#x27;s difficult to brush with at all.&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;Edit 1.9.17 - I met a guy in his 40s who&#x27;s been using ORA MD for the better part of a decade - and he has just the most perfect teeth.  I&#x27;ve upped my review from 3 to 4 stars.  And I&#x27;ve started to try to use it again.  As long as you always use an electric toothbrush, the liquid/non-foam thing isn&#x27;t that big of an issue.</li>
            <li> my dentist recommended this because I am now reacting to the toothpaste.  did you know that toothpaste has a cancer agent it in?</li>
            <li> This and other products from Trusted Health Products work when used as directed. I suspect this mouthwash/toothpaste substitute also inhibits viruses and bacteria. Soft tissue sores in my mouth from orthodontics cleared up faster when I used this as a mouth rinse. It will not make your hair shinier and more manageable. But it does improve gum tissue when used as part of your regular home oral care program. Floss. Brush. Use this product as directed.</li>
            <li> i love the clean feeling that my mouth has after using this product. Teeth feel clean. No pasty aftertaste or feeling on the teeth. You can brush with it or use as a mouth wash. Really good.</li>
            <li> So i bought this because i have had gum issues and the last time i went to the dentist i was at risk for gingivitis. This was a few years ago and since then I have been putting it off and I have had only red gums swelling and bad breath to accompany pus whenever the gums are squeezed. I have been utilizing this product for a full week and already i can see a change in tartar build up and my teeth actually look WHITER compared to the reviews that some would need a teeth whitener after using this product. The taste is strong but it did not bother me. The best part is after the 3rd day I have no longer pussing gums and after this week I no longer wake up with extreme bad breath and even through out the day. I use the product in the morning and at night and I tried as an oral rinse but feel it is more effective on a brush in my problem area. I can even see the teeth lightening there and the redness is almost gone. I am HIGHLY positive that after a month of using this product that my gums will completely be rid of redness so that when I go into see my doctor it will be good results. I also bought the 3 pack to maintain and will be buying a water flosser because I love my teeth and therefore should be using best practice to keep them.</li>
            <li> How bad it hurts when you first start using it is a good indicator of how much your gums need this. My gums feel much healthier and stronger now after using it a while. Especially when I use this with a sonic toothbrush. Great for grown-ups that don&#x27;t go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This was my 3rd time ordering this product! I love it!!</li>
            <li> Works great with an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Did not help at all. Save your money.  The shipping and everything went well but the product itself is a waste of money.  As expected</li>
            <li> All natural and you can feel the fresh tingle!  I use for toothpaste mouthwash and just to freshen my breath.  I notice an improvement in my overall oral health.  My gums are healthier and I absolutely love that the only ingredients are essential oils!  I combine this with a coconut oil and bashing soda paste once a week for extra cleaning but not every day because it&#x27;s more abrasive.  It was a little pricey but my health and my families health is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product cleans my teeth and freshens my breath.  I also am amazed at how it stops gums from bleeding.</li>
            <li> I do not know for sure if it is the ultimate answer to oral health BUT it sure makes a difference in how my mouth feels and smells and looks.  I am still on first bottle but after you get used to the taste which is fast, I love using it morning and night. I will probably buy it again when I start to run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months, as a substitute for toothpaste and mouthwash.  The combination of oils kills many oral bacteria, and offer health benefits for gum tissue.  The freshness lingers for a long time, it doesn&#x27;t dry out the mouth the way mouthwashes do, and I wake in the morning with a cleaner-feeling mouth.  The manufacturer states that all bottles possess the same quality oils, but as in nature, sometimes the same oil will taste slightly different.  But they&#x27;re all very minty, and the effectiveness is consistent from bottle to bottle.  Some bottles of Ora MD burn a little, especially if you brush too hard, and, watch out! -- it can take your breath away if you inhale through your mouth while brushing the back of your tongue!  I like the freshness using this product affords, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make me extremely thirsty all night, the way mouthwashes always have.  Due to the strength of these oils, I really would not recommend for children.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> It seems to work well.  It sure does freshen the breath!</li>
            <li> This product is very strong, but rid of all my gum swelling and such within days! Love it</li>
            <li> I have had moderate gum disease for some years now, necessitating in seeing a dentist or periodontist every 3 months, instead of every six, for cleaning in an effort to keep my oral health in check. Since beginning use of OraMD my gums rarely bleed; in addition, it has definitely reversed my receding gum line! Within the first couple of weeks almost all of the sensitive areas in my mouth have healed and/or gone away. And I love how clean and refreshed my mouth feels after using it! I also feel good about avoiding a lot of toxic chemicals found in traditional toothpaste. Great to know what I&#x27;m putting in my mouth is 100% good for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gum infection I had around a crowned molar. By the time I got hold of the stuff, I&#x27;d had the dentist replace the crown and apply some antibiotic on the gum area so I forgot to bother with the OraMD. Then a month later, because of bite change, I developed a small gap between two teeth which led to a constantly inflamed gum. When I finally remembered that I had the OraMD, I started using it and within 3 days the problem had gone. I can&#x27;t think of anything else I did differently and I know that I had the gum issue for at least a month before I used this product. Wish I had bought it a year ago before I had the other issues. Now I need to figure out why I have recently been getting gum issues in the first place so that I don&#x27;t need to rely on this stuff.</li>
            <li> iwas a little skeptical at first,some of the reviews i was reading were right it did burn a little bit the first time i used it. it didn&#x27;t burn as bad i thought it would though. i started to see results in at least two weeks after using this. I would skip a day or two here and there. when i would use it again the results still showed through. I;m currently still using my supply of three bottles,almost done with the last one though. I&#x27;m definitely going to order more of this stuff. it surprisingly works quite well</li>
            <li> Have already ordered twice of these and my wife always use it.</li>
            <li> Love OraMD.  This is a great replacement / supplement for regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product,your teeth look whiter,your mouth feels clean,and your teeth,gums&lt;br /&gt;feel clean all day.&amp;#34;Brilliant&amp;#34; ! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered my first OraMd many years ago because I developed very severe gum swelling back 2006-7, and nothing seem to work so I thought why not order something that&#x27;s very natural. Upon some research, I stumbled across OraMD, I order like 3 months supply of it. I really had faith in it because all that promises it claimed to do, plus it claimed to be natural (I&#x27;m not sure about that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed everything in the instruction, it said something like swallowing it would be ok.What I want to advise is that it&#x27;s NOT OK to swallow this stuff down (whether on purpose or accidentally), my literally lost my voice one time when I wasn&#x27;t being careful enough. Even when I was trying to be careful, the aroma alone is too strong to stay in my mouth, especially when you have tender gum and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, it doesn&#x27;t clean very well. Plaque and tartar still form very easy. In conclusion, I want to say that this stuff is hella expensive and the result is not that glorified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution wasn&#x27;t this, it was a healthy diet I follow later helped me with my gum. Also, active charcoal is a very good cleaning agent, it really helped to heal my swelling gum.</li>
            <li> I will never use tooth paste again. This product has help my gum problem and it is very good as a mouth wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been grinding and clenching my teeth (due to anxiety) for at least a year and a half, and my gums were receding, loosening, discoloring even with frequent Sonicare use.  I was freaking out so I did some research and bought OraMD and a Waterpik Ultra, and I swear my gums started coming back after 2 (yes, two) days.  Every morning and last thing at night I brush my teeth manually or with my Sonicare, toothpaste and one drop of OraMD, then use my Waterpik to get it into my gums, and then I brush with my Sonicare again and 2-3 drops more for about 45-60 sec.  I can&#x27;t believe how really clean my teeth feel with OraMD!  It&#x27;s a little over a week, and I can see my gums have become noticeably healthier, sounds crazy but it&#x27;s true.  My teeth stopped hurting too (actually they hurt worse for a couple of days, then stopped altogether).  If you&#x27;re having any dental problems at all, you&#x27;ll want to give this routine a try right away (even if you don&#x27;t have a Sonicare.  You&#x27;ll still get results brushing manually.)</li>
            <li> Very nice toothpaste substitute and mouthwash. I like it and really feel its effectiveness. It is also very usable on the go, which is very handy for me.</li>
            <li> Wanting so badly to only use natural products in my mouth that would actually work I bought oramd 3 pack as this would be more cost efficient than a single bottle.  when it arrived I followed the instructions that came with the products. After weeks of using I notice I still had bleeding gums and to add to the dissapointment I now have full blown tooth sensitivity on the left side of my mouth to anything hot or cold. NO! this was not for me.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and effective. My teeth are so sensitive for cold water. But when I used this product my teeth are ok for drinking cold drinks. Thanks</li>
            <li> My husband uses the OraMD products to keep his teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping it would live up to the claims. Within one week I knew it was all it was claimed to be.&lt;br /&gt; My gum condition improved so much I was overjoyed. I have been using it once a day as a preventative for one year, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have bought this numerous times.</li>
            <li> I have a recurring problem with a front tooth (cap with root canal - 50 year old surgery). The root becomes slightly infected and the tooth loosens.  In less than a week of using this to brush twice a day, the symptoms disappeared - no need for antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves my mouth very fresh - lasting for hours.  I like this product a lot. Each bottle should last at least 2 months, so this is cheaper than my regular brand of non-fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No noticeable difference n gum bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fresh feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> Your self esteem will definitely increase if you have periodontal disease or chronic halitosis.  The product is not to mask poor dental hygiene, but along with proper hygiene, will give you, will boost your confidence to have a conversation with someone without the offensive mouth odor.  Simply use after a meal or before a speaking engagement.  Hope this was helpful :-)</li>
            <li> My husband has periodontal disease and I thought I&#x27;d give the Extra Strength OraMD a try for him. It&#x27;s working wonders. I have pretty healthy gums, but after doing some research, I&#x27;ve decided to stay away from toxic toothpaste! In my search for the cheapest place to order OraMD, I came across Sarah Simply Me&#x27;s blog [...] with an offer for a free bottle and all you have to do is pay for shipping! I thought I&#x27;d see if I like it before I spend the money on it or if I just make my own. Thought I&#x27;d share. Here&#x27;s the link to the offer. [...] I just ordered mine!</li>
            <li> This was my third order, two drops is all you need.  Love it and it has NO fluoride!</li>
            <li> I think this products works wonders.  I had an irritation in my mouth.  Now I brush with my regular whitening toothpaste, but after I put 3 drops onto my clean toothbrush and brush again.  No more irritation.  This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, but this is the first time that I&#x27;m using it regularly.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Please be aware that trying to make your own blend of this product can be hazardous to your health.  Not all oils are meant to be used internally.  Most oils are made synthetically using chemicals. Especially carrier oils or the cheap oils you see on Ebay.  While they can seem to be doing the job they can also be poisoning your bloodstream.  If you do want to make this product yourself you need to use 100% PURE essential oils.  I am a Holistic Practitioner and not associated with this product although I do use it.  If you want further information about choosing oils you can Google.  Sometimes trying to make something yourself when you don&#x27;t know the dynamics of a product can end up with a person becoming very ill; immune disorders, toxic poisoning or even killing you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years. I went from having bleeding gums to healthy gums.  So easy to use and convenient.</li>
            <li> When I first started using my teeth and gums hurt and felt very sensitive all the time&lt;br /&gt;After using this product I don&#x27;t have this issue any longer!!!</li>
            <li> gave this to my daughter, and she says it&#x27;s wonderful. That she saw the results of a cleaner mouth immediately. And, the three bottles are lasting her for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Made my gums feel better but still see some infection. Still hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> The taste take a little getting used to but, not a bad product. Did an excellent job at reducing the inflammation in my gums.</li>
            <li> Does not work and tastes terrible! Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about to product but figured to give it a dry. I have a good relationship with my dental hygienist and we&#x27;ve been working to fix my gum recession. I have terrible sinus problems and breathe through my mouth at night. The lack of saliva wrecks havoc on my gum health. I&#x27;ve been using this product in the place of toothpaste just short if two months, adding nothing else to my routine save the usual flossing. It took a week to get used to the intensity. After three weeks I noticed a vast improvement in my gum health. There is reduced gum sensitivity too. I still get some dry mouth effects from this product but no where as bad as toothpaste. It&#x27;s also a fantastic rinse... The mint scent is potent! My wife smelled it from the other room! No complaints, though. I will be getting the usual cleaning in a few weeks and I&#x27;ll be interested to see what the hygienist says.</li>
            <li> Terrible taste and company sucks , contacted company , they only care about selling you stuff that does not work and tastes awful</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and loved it! My dentist said my gums never looked better. However, I stopped using it for awhile, no real reason why. I started up again. The product seemed a little different to me, stronger perhaps. Anyway, just started using as I did before when I probably should have started out slower and not with a new toothbrush. My mouth became very irritated, bleeding gums, little bumps, so darn sore. I had to take 2 weeks to treat my mouth with warm salt water, baking soda and peroxide to get it back to normal - kinda scary. :/ My mouth is all better and I have started OraMD slowly and gently with the brushing. I am up to once a day with it, using at night only. I use regular peroxide toothpaste in the morning. So far so good, no bad reaction. But if I even begin to have any discomfort I will stop immediately which may tell me they changed their ingredients in some way from the last time I used it. My husband has had no issues with OraMD.</li>
            <li> Every 6 months I go in for a cleaning and 1 time I went and my pockets went from 2 or 3 to some around 6 so my dentist had me see a paradontist. I asked the paradontist how this could be and he said around 80% of the people will get paradontal disease and I&#x27;m not sure how good your dentist really checked this.  I changed paradontist because I wanted the LDAP procedure and he was surprise how clean and nice my teeth looked. he almost seem surprised I had these pockets. At this point I had been using this for about 6 months.  My teeth feels like they are polished everyday. I wished I started using this earlier.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!! MY WHOLE FAMILY IS USING IT!</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel so clean.  I love the peppermint as it makes your breath smell good. I will buy some more.</li>
            <li> my gums were always very bad...thuis time when i went to the dentist...he said my gums were very good...this surprised me as i have a history of bad gum disease in my family...i think i found the secret!!!!! thankyou so much for your product</li>
            <li> Good product delivered on time. Would have been a five stars if was a bit cheaper but still recommended.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think yet still don&#x27;t know if this stuff is legit or not but it does make my mouth feel clean..I will have to see but I use kmf toothpaste with it too I put the drops on my toothpaste it feels cleaner that way I don&#x27;t know I can&#x27;t give up toothpaste</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Expensive sure but well worth it. It just takes a drop...I put it in the back of my mouth on each back molar and people alwaysssss say oh my whats that great smell!! Seriously if people say something, about how good you smell....and its your breath ah yeah. Ive had strangers say that smells so good. Since I cant chew gum on my job I tried this. I no longer even chew gum. I have a bottle in my car, purse and home. I think at first it tasted weird but im used to it and welcome it with all the comments.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I had many problems with my gums and they are all gone in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it smells a little bit strong.</li>
            <li> I love it! It taste great and works great in a water pick. Great for brushing your teeth with too!</li>
