            <li>That said, I could see if being perfect for someone whose hair is already quite healthy and doesn&#x27;t need a lot of help from hair products to lock in moisture and ward off damage.  </li>
            <li>Nice, lightweight conditioner!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant and my roommate</li>
            <li>I received a mini version of this conditioner to review and I found using it to be a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant</li>
            <li>Perfect for people with baby fine</li>
            <li>so it seems like it would be good for a variety of hair types.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>For a girl with curls, a good conditioner can make all the difference.</li>
            <li>conditioner did a good job of helping reduce the tangles in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Good for the money.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Pros  -Loved</li>
            <li>-Good price point for conditioner and hair products.   </li>
            <li>This is some good stuff, you should use the conditioner and the intensive treatment along with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The scent also lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li>I loved the intensive treatment.</li>
            <li>The good news is that I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on conditioner to get the results that I am after.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that the shampoo was really good</li>
            <li>but it was good</li>
            <li>The scent of this conditioner is wonderful and unique.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and refreshing.</li>
            <li>My hair felt very light afterwards!</li>
            <li>It would be great to use with the shampoo as a once a month treatment for my hair, but I would not be able to use it every day.</li>
            <li>I got this product as a free trial to test and I absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant and fresh - yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li>After I got out of the shower my hair felt healthy!</li>
            <li>This was even better than the shampoo!</li>
            <li>Glad I found it!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed regarding this conditioner was how awesome it smelled.  </li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product!</li>
            <li>This detoxifying conditioner is amazing.  </li>
            <li>soonI realize that it smells amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of the Herbal Essence line and this one is another great addition to it.</li>
            <li>All in all these products are AMAZING</li>
            <li>It has a great lemony scent that I really enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Also, the shampoo had this great, light citrus scent but</li>
            <li>and it is amazing...</li>
            <li>This works great and smells fantastic</li>
            <li>it smell nice?</li>
            <li>I thought it more fair to give it a 3 star rating.</li>
            <li>I grow a lot of Thai Basil and honestly, I could not find this fragrance in the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This worked nicely in getting the tangles out.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are my own and are my honest thoughts on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smoothed into my hair and washed out nicely.</li>
            <li>This is not an every day kind of product for me.</li>
            <li>As with all Herbal Essences products, the scent was really nice.</li>
            <li>Good conditioner with interesting texture.</li>
            <li>I like something that will leave my hair smelling nice for a while</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how it performs on its own as a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will say I liked the scent.</li>
            <li>My hair feels good and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>&amp; I really liked the shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I liked them</li>
            <li>To me, they have a nice citrus scent - almost grapefruit.</li>
            <li>I loved the shampoo but was not so much in love with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy and use this conditioner on my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice scent for the spring.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it has any kind of &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li>It does still have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying this lineup of shampoo conditioner and intense treatment, excellent for damaged hair!!</li>
            <li>I received the product as a free sample through Influenster and love it!!</li>
            <li>The lemon scent is a great pick-me-up right now with winter dragging on!</li>
            <li>I got this conditioner free to test and review, and I liked it!</li>
            <li>The conditioner is super creamy and my hair ate it up happily.</li>
            <li>I do not like conditioner that has a very strong scent all day.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and fresh, but it&#x27;s not a scent for a hair product I would have chosen on my own.</li>
            <li>I loved the conditioner from this line, the smell is just amazing and fresh!</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled more like pineapple than lemon, but I liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smelling good and light</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is color treated...</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells great, very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>However, as I became older and more experienced in taking care of my hair I quickly realized that not all drug store products were great for the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The scent was a pleasant, fresh, lemon.</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner with a lingering, strong scent of passionfruit.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner did not work well for me but the deep conditioning kind was amazing!!</li>
            <li>The shampoo smelled great, while this one was not such a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily comb through hair after showering, which was nice as I often have to add a detangling product.</li>
            <li>This is certainly a brand and fragrance that I would happily keep in my guest room.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner</li>
            <li>This creamy conditioner has a refreshing spicy lemon fragrance.</li>
            <li>No wonder it feels more like hand sanitizer than it does like a conditioner.</li>
            <li>more flyaway.&lt;br /&gt;-Was</li>
            <li>Since it might work for non curly girls better</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>First of all it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I am not too fond of the smell, it is okay</li>
            <li>However, I like lemons, too, so I still enjoyed the scent even though it was not what I</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>Yes the smell is fantastic, never have I used a shampoo/conditioner combination like this!</li>
            <li>I was given a sample product from Influenster.com to test and review and that is how I became acquainted with it.  </li>
            <li>While I was sent this product, this review is my own genuine opinion.  </li>
            <li>although I think that was mostly from the intensive conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>This did more than I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the citrusy scent of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It was simply ok.</li>
            <li>My daughter has been gifted with tangly hair.</li>
            <li>Had a light, nice scent.</li>
            <li>the scent is my favorite part.</li>
            <li>My wife has conditioning treatments that work much better and more</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this conditioner is the scent.  </li>
            <li>I started being more selective about the brands I would buy and eventually, moved on to using salon products exclusively.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying this, I don&#x27;t love it for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>The scent was nice, but it was too light of a scent for my liking.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had more body added</li>
            <li>but it is definitely more moisture and anti frizz than Organix.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It worked well enough for my hair, and I am always on the look out for the best conditioners.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from Influenster!</li>
            <li>It even made my face oily from touching it.</li>
            <li>Also the scent is lite but still smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Not to mention i got this for free to test and review!</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d a deluxe sample of this to try free from influenster in my VoxBox</li>
            <li>conditioner was ok.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is better suited for people with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I would not be able to use this conditioner every day.  </li>
            <li>conditioner is as equally satisfying as the shampoo.</li>
            <li>love the way my hair smells throughout the day...and can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li>and I noticed my hair had more bounce after using.</li>
            <li>Feels lovely after shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>The shampoo takes frizz better than the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>I can tell that my hair is happy, my curls are nice and soft and the fizz is reduced well.</li>
            <li>I got the conditioner for free from Influenster!</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try this conditioner out for free!</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the results from this product!</li>
            <li>I love how well the shampoo works and also love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed how silky the conditioner made my hair feel and took away my frizzes.</li>
            <li>the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t work the best with my hair type which is curly.</li>
            <li>I recieved a small/medium sized product but am pleased with the size.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll love to have this and the conditioner for travels.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Lemon basil with cassia flower sent.</li>
            <li>The sent is so refreshing that it makes me feel relaxed.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this conditioner</li>
            <li>I was not as satisfied with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this line.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and my hair felt healthy and clean after use.</li>
            <li>it was the best experience I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to try it!  </li>
            <li>I am happy with Herbal Essences new product</li>
            <li>It is perfect for the dry winters here in Colorado.</li>
            <li>received this product as part of a free trial but am very impressed with how they work together and will definitely continue to purchase these items!</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling smooth, tangle-free and smelled great!</li>
            <li>And was so clean!</li>
            <li>Not the best for someone with very dry hair</li>
            <li>Clean fresh scent and a good product.</li>
            <li>short, this isn&#x27;t the ideal conditioner for my hair type and needs, but I can see where someone else would like this a lot.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free from my Herbal Essence Voxbox from Influenster.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would buy it and recommend it to someone who was looking for a good smelling conditioner that isn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
            <li>I received this free to test out, and I like the shampoo better than the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li>Although it smelt great and my hair feels somewhat  soft?</li>
            <li>Which is good on some days and not so much on others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how it detoxifies, but it did leave my hair silky smooth and easy to brush after I used it.</li>
            <li>The lemon basil and cassia flower were quite pleasant smelling to me and reminded me a lot of the way spas normally smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair feeling very light and smelled great.</li>
            <li>The smell was fresh and clean, lemon with a hint of ginger, very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Overall good product and would recommend!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair uber greasy like some other conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li>other than that it is a great product and i would recommen!!</li>
            <li>; kind of vibes.. I use a lot of this brand hair products very much and is excited for what much more products would be evolved.</li>
            <li>My hair feels supple, healthy and clean and it does not effect the curliness of my hair when I apply gel.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on and just as easy to wash out</li>
            <li>-Rinsed out easily.  </li>
            <li>It feels lightweight and is easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>Wild Naturals products for free to review, and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as the shampoo</li>
            <li>And I prefer a conditioner without a strong, lingering scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>It is pretty watery, not as creamy as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really great, nice smell, also make my hair after use it be softer than other conditioners that I use before.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty nice</li>
            <li>I remember LOVING their products in high school because the potent, floral scents.  </li>

            <li>Received this in a VoxBox to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine curly hair</li>
            <li>My hair was clean, soft , smelled nice and had a nice shine to it...</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered wonderfully and the conditioner is light so your hair is not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it is instantly absorbed into the hair, and easily rinsed out.  </li>
            <li>I found that it rinses out easily and does not cause it to feel heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>I seem to notice while I was using it every two days that it has made a huge impact on my scalp</li>
            <li>I could tell a huge difference in the texture of my hair after I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>It applies easily and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>also found the scent a bit bizarre.  </li>

            <li>so conditioner is important and this did the job.</li>
            <li>The smell is light, herbally, and has a hint of basil.</li>
            <li>I received this conditioner for free as part of the Influenster testing program.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I received a free travel size bottle in a voxbox.</li>
            <li>but it left my hair feeling very moisturized and smelling great!</li>
            <li>I found the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying conditioner to be a fairly good one.  </li>
            <li>but it left my hair feeling very moisturized and smelling great!</li>
            <li>But wow it sure does smell nice in the heat of a</li>
            <li>I love the clean, fresh, citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>It did have slip so I was able to detangle very quickly and easily, and my hair was very soft but strong and not overly mushy at all.</li>
            <li>Good conditioner is really important to keep my curly, dry hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s more like an average conditioner with great smell.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair smelling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>My hair was less fly away and has a lot more control.</li>
            <li>and it is the only kind that will be in my shopping cart!</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent</li>
            <li>but once I used it in the shower for the first time the smell was lovely.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>My hair was clean and not oily.</li>
            <li>The lemon Thai basil is really clean and invigorating.</li>
            <li>This has a fresh  somewhat unusual scent and conditions nicely.</li>
            <li>Really liked this conditioner, along with the shampoo it left me hair feeling silky smooth, and does not seem to leave any build up on my hair!</li>
            <li>The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection is nothing short of wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel clean without feeling &#x27;too clean.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I use product, gels, oils, creams in my hair and after using the Detoxifying Conditioner with my shampoo my hair felt what I consider squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I look for more natural ingredients and better outcome in my conditioners.</li>
            <li>Smells pleasant, goes on well, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lasting effect towards conditioning hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is the best one for me, but not a bad product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, which I love!</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft I was in love!</li>
            <li>I much preferred the Intensive Treatment as my hair felt significantly slicker and more well-conditioned after that.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos which is a good sign, and my hair felt awakened and healthy again.</li>
            <li>easy to open bottle of nice smelling conditioner that makes your hair feel smooth but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smell of the new line, it&#x27;s floral-y to me and the dry oil spray adds a beautiful non greasy shine.</li>
            <li>Although I really enjoyed the scent, it didn&#x27;t stick around as long as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>I really love the fresh, lemony scent and the fact that the conditioner is pretty lightweight once my hair dries.</li>
            <li>It really helped my hair to feel healthy.</li>
            <li>However this product made my scalpel feel cool and minty with a kick of citrus or tea scent which was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and refreshing.   </li>
            <li>Of course, my hair is very oily and finnicky, so many products don&#x27;t work well on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural lemongrass scent and to be honest, I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is really full and the fullness lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to @Influester who provided me with a free sample!</li>
            <li>Afterwards my hair had a nice shine to it and also was super soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner to those who are looking for a light conditioner with a pleasant fragrance that makes your hair shine and feel very clean.</li>
            <li>It is so fresh and clean and invigorating.</li>
            <li>and I both agreed it did an adequate job of rejuvenating our hair.  </li>
            <li>The lemon basil scent is fairly mild.  </li>
            <li>Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner for it has a light lemon scent and it did condition my hair more than my Organix conditioner.</li>
            <li>Once my hair is dry, the hint of lemon is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Not only does it perfume your shower with this amazing scent, but your hair feels soft and healthy all day!</li>
            <li>When I first applied this to my hair it felt super light weight</li>
            <li>This conditioner was light, left my hair feeling very clean and rinsed out easily.  </li>
            <li>I used this product in conjunction with the Detoxifying Shampoo and am overall very pleased with the products.</li>
            <li>The lemony smell is subtly sharp and combines with the basil to make a nice refreshing aroma.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell and my hair looks better than normal after using it and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I had to use quite a bit more than I normally would</li>
            <li>It does smell pretty fantastic</li>
            <li>It left my hair smelling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The texture is creamy and light which makes your hair feels soft, airy, and of course, extremely clean!</li>
            <li>wait for more new products ^.^</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of moisturizing without leaving a greasy, heavy feel to your hair very light weight.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s a nice light conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say my hair was easy to comb through after towel drying, which is always a concern for me since my hair is stick straight, fine and thin, and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I received this particular conditioner for free in the mail via my Voxbox and was excited to see the results on my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would certainly recommend this product to try only because it&#x27;s herbal essences and everything of this product works for a reason and every individual has their own unique options to many more of herbal essences</li>
            <li>Over all my hair is clean, but I am not any more in love with it then any other drug store conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells great and left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>After a few more uses I have come to really love this product!</li>
            <li>I particulary like the crisp clean smell of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have long baby fine hair, which tends to easily get split ends and break easily.</li>
            <li>I received this conditioner free to test and review the product and while I did enjoy the scent I was less than thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>I loved the clean, citrusy smell of the products and felt it left my hair clean and soft and gave it lightweight feeling.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works very well and makes my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this conditioner, it&#x27;s nice and lemony with some green notes.</li>
            <li>My hair was softer and shinier within a few days and I have to say this product is a great finish to the detoxifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>received the whole collection (shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment) free to review from Influenster/VoxBox</li>
            <li>received this complimentary as a set in order to rate and review.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase it for myself, they also sent me the hair treatment that is pay of the set, now that was worth it, I didn&#x27;t even bother with the conditioner I just used the treatment after I shampooed.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this product on my own.</li>
            <li>I love the soft smell.</li>
            <li>Also it is not an overly powerful conditioner.</li>

            <li>I didnt feel that my hair was as easy to comb through as with my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair has been super manageable since the first day.</li>
            <li>and it was a very nice conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li>and it was a very nice conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li>This is relatively cheap conditioner but it leaves your hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My brush glided right through.  </li>
            <li>I used the treatment condition right after so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the detoxifying claim, but for people who enjoy scented hair products this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of this particular product because it did not give me that &amp;#34;yes</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to lather my fine, easily-tangled hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner made my hair very soft and was easy to comb through after washing it.</li>
            <li>product is very easy to open -</li>
            <li>shampoo is a clear liquid with a distinct aroma of grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;Their milky conditioner has a strong lemon</li>
            <li>The scent is a crisp, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth putting up with the smell when the look was not as good as I could get with no conditioner at all.</li>
            <li>I just tried the herbal essence natural wild conditioner this week as a sample/tester from Influenster and I am in love!</li>
            <li>It stripped away too much of the natural oils that kept it healthy looking</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences has three lines of their Wild Naturals product, &amp;#34;Illuminating,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Detoxifying,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Rejuvenating.&amp;#34; The illuminating line is designed to make your hair shinier and has a strong fruity berry scent.</li>
            <li>Also the description strongly implies it is natural,  which it is not.  </li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and last for hours, one of the things I really like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, and my hair is so far so good.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is a perfect balance of enough moisture but not too much to weigh my curly locks down.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a nice fresh smell due to the lemon basil scent.</li>
            <li>I also really love the smell, it&#x27;s a very unisex scent and is not super feminine like many hair products.</li>
            <li>Definitely a new line I&#x27;m excited about.</li>
            <li>measuring the success of a conditioner my biggest need is that my hair should not feel oily or greasy afterward, it washes out cleanly, and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>I love that it didn&#x27;t weight down my fine</li>
            <li>Well, my hair looks a bit wild after using this, with fly-away strands instead of smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li>Able to use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t consistent with what I expect from a conditioner.</li>
            <li>It seems like more of a deep cleaner than it does</li>
            <li>Sure, but it was not moisturized enough to make it look good.&lt;br /&gt;-Did</li>
            <li>When you use the conditioner and shampoo together it works pretty well and makes your hair shiny and helps with frizz.</li>
            <li>Its like pouring a lemon and orange straight out of the bottle!</li>
            <li>I have mostly straight, relatively healthy shoulder length hair of average thickness, and this did a nice job keeping the tangles out and leaving my hair soft.</li>
            <li>The deep conditioner is my favorite, as it seems my hair has been craving it for years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is for everone though, and perhaps it is better suited for male users.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>Especially for people who many not want to spend the money on salon and specialty haircare brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid dove user and my hair has never felt</li>
            <li>Although the scents are quite different, my hair is not confused and came out of the shampoo/conditioner process in great condition overall.</li>
            <li>I received Herbal Essences Wild Naturals conditioner as well as the shampoo as a free trial to test and review from Influenster.</li>
            <li>The conditioner felt lightweight at first, but throughout the day, my hair started to feel oily.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like it, I really did!</li>
            <li>Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li>Not to mention it is very affordable!</li>
            <li>The matching intensive treatment works way better, of course, but I will definitely not purchase this one.</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner as a free sample from Influenster to try and review.</li>
            <li>Thanks Influenster!</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t already using a sulfate-free conditioner, I would definitely suggest using this one, but if you&#x27;re already using one you love, skip it and just spring for the Intensive Treatment.</li>
            <li>what I can tell you is that this conditioner makes my hair feel soft and smooth and not greasy or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Intense soothing smell makes you feel like your scalp is exfoliating!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this would be effective for longer hair that tends to get more tangled simply because it is not conditioning enough for more extreme cases.</li>
            <li>It also washed out nicely as well and left my hair feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>I found it a pleasant deviation from the usual fruity, floral, and tropical scents.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time with tangles mostly because I only wash my hair a couple times a week, and I was thrilled with the quality of this product!</li>
            <li>I liked that it wasn&#x27;t extremely floral-y.  </li>
            <li>While I liked the other two in this collection, I did not like the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Left hair soft and smells amazing</li>
            <li>The top of the bottle flips open without any difficulty and the product comes out with a gentle tilt and squeeze of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The complimentary sample I got via Influenster will definitely have me coming back for more!</li>
            <li>The deep conditioner had a strong smell first going on</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant- not overwhelming and very up-to-date scents.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4a kinky curly hair &amp; it left my hair feeling really clean &amp; strong</li>
            <li>But it did condition my hair without weighting it down and it did have a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>but I prefer something a little more sweet.</li>
            <li>I had to go out the next day and purchase the full size bottle!</li>
            <li>What I should have paid attention to more was the word &amp;#34;detoxifying.&amp;#34;  Apparently, Herbal Essences has a Wild Naturals Detoxifying, Rejuvenating and  Illuminating products.</li>
            <li>I think this conditioner may be better for people with finer hair versus dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a black woman and these products were a nice surprise</li>
            <li>br /&gt;later left tangle-free and easy to comb out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own to be quite runny, which made me very skeptical as to how good of a product it is.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this conditioner to people with fine or lifeless hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was thick and lathered nicely and it left my hair clean, fresh and shiny!</li>
            <li>I have a huge problem with fly aways and static in the cold and dry winter months</li>
            <li>It has a nice little curl at the bottom and looks like I have a ton of volume-</li>
            <li>All in all this is probably just an average conditioner, however I really liked the results I got with my particular hair type when using this with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Its a clear crisp smell, light on lather, and felt so light as opposed to other products.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to find a good conditioner</li>
            <li>I have thinner hair that tends to get weighed down very easily, so I like clarifying or detoxifying products to reset my hair every once in a while.</li>
            <li>It was not very thick and ran right off of my hand.</li>
            <li>I am not a big user of conditioners, so when I do use one it really needs to fit my needs for me to even bother.</li>
            <li>This Detoxifying Conditioner has made my hair much stronger.</li>
            <li>it probably won&#x27;t condition as much as you need though.</li>
            <li>But the product as a whole works well.</li>
            <li>and I think this one is a real winner as men as well as women would like the scent.</li>
            <li>I recently received a sample of the Herbal Essences Detoxifying Conditioner for free</li>
            <li>All in all I really like this conditioner, but</li>
            <li>so it really didn&#x27;t have that going for it either.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use both this and the intense conditioner though as it makes my hair stuff.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t care much for the elixir.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was very watery</li>
            <li>It really is just a conditioner.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>I really like the floral, citrus smell because itâ€™s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Feels really luxurious.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the scent of it, but this conditioner does not lather my hair very well.</li>
            <li>It left my hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and this has really helped that.  </li>
            <li>Its very energizing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see if these really turn out well.</li>
            <li>This product did not give my hair much volume - but that was not what it was designed to do, so</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>so I assumed that this was a shampoo meant to give body and not moisturize too much.</li>
            <li>It was much softer in the shower than smelling it straight out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I recently received this item for free to test and review it.</li>
            <li>I received my Herbal Essence Wild Naturals complimentary from Influenster to review.</li>
            <li>I normally have fairly straight hair that dries without much body but these products have made my hair va-va- voom!</li>
            <li>small amount of shampoo quickly works into a thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing it out the hair is impressively thicker in volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight, fluffy hair that gets weighed down and greasy easily, I have been using this conditioner daily for over a week now and while I love the shampoo and Intensive Treatment, I was less than thrilled by the conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is fine for me to use every so often though, particularly in between deep conditionings.</li>
            <li>Combine that with the current dry winter conditions and I need a pretty rich conditioner to keep my hair feeling and looking soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is the best option for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>This creamy but not overly heavy conditioner has an unusual and strong but not unpleasant fruity herbal scent.</li>
            <li>Its light and fluffy and just feeling it you can tell that its going to do a great job moisturizing without completely weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li>I used it after using the Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo and my hair feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The scent is botanical, but more sharp than floral, and doesn&#x27;t linger (that I could tell).</li>
            <li>Personally, I like the unique Thai Lemon Basil scent.</li>
            <li>It might be better suited for other hair types than mine.  </li>
            <li>my hair didn&#x27;t feel any better than when i use any other conditioner.</li>
            <li>Fortunately most of that went away after the hair dried, although I did get a whiff of it now and then on the first day.</li>
            <li>I pretty much try every conditioner that Amazon offers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would grab about a quarter size amount since I have long fine curly/wavy hair and rubbing it into my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, tending to oily.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried it I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a good product because of how thin the conditioner was when it came out of the bottle -</li>
            <li>It is fine for me to use as a single conditioning treatement between shampooings, since the trend nowadays is not to wash your hair too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about conditioners because they can weigh my hair down and make my roots even more oily.  </li>
            <li>After a long day, I enjoy using this product so I can relax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s maybe a once a week as a break from my normal shampoo or to remove any intense hair product build up.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how intensely it moisturized my hair!</li>
            <li>but my hair became very oily by the end of the day, which does not happen with my normal regimen.</li>
            <li>I think the detoxifying label is a gimmick, but overall not a bad conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair conditioner hands down.</li>
            <li>My tangles were also more manageable due to the greatness of the conditioner!</li>
            <li>I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review!</li>
            <li>I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review!</li>
            <li>When I first applied the conditioner, I thought it might not work well, because it was so light and not thick as other conditioners I&#x27;ve become accustomed to using.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner itself is decent.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got this because I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li>After pairing with the shampoo, it left my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to others with the same hair issues! :)</li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoyed the conditioner and will definitely consider purchasing.</li>
            <li>I will likely use the shampoo again for clarifying purposes, but will pair it with a different conditioner for more moisture.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to those of you who use a lot of product and/or color your hair as this set gives love back to your hair.</li>
            <li>I used Dove before and will most likely go back to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying the shampoo, skipping the regular conditioner and will most definately buy the deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>The main thing is that it did not make me break out.  </li>
            <li>The whole line left my hair clean and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>As for me, I have fairly thick hair and it does a fair job of conditioning if left in for about 5 minutes while in a hot shower and</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair nice and soft and tame.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both this conditioner and its shampoo sister.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these products</li>
            <li>but I saw that isopropyl myristate was high up on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though, after a few days of use, it really has made my damaged hair look better and it has made it very soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The conditioner definitely works because my hair was super soft immediately after I rinsed out the product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t bad, or especially good.</li>
            <li>In whole though my hair has been wonderfully soft from root to tip.</li>
            <li>I normally use a detangling product to comb my hair, but I did not need one after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>As conditioners go, I would not say it was my least favorite of those Iâ€™ve tried, but it wasnâ€™t my first choice either.  </li>
            <li>but I will say out of the two that the conditioner has a more pleasing scent; the smell really comes out once your hair is dried!</li>
            <li>the way it made my hair feel almost instantly was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair felt better and cleaner after I dried it.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this I didn&#x27;t think I liked it as the texture is a bit thin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even need to use the leave in conditioner I normally do after washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I received complimentary bottles of the shampoo, conditioner and the deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>And it most definitely does not help untangle long hair.</li>
            <li>Although I wasn&#x27;t aware that my hair was toxic, this product will apparently take care of that in a jiffy.</li>
            <li>I loved the treatment and almost felt like the conditioner was an unnecessary step.</li>
            <li>Love how soft my hair was and how it didn&#x27;t feel weighed down.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really helped calm my hair down and made it feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Currently my hair is very short and it looks better if I use shampoo only but when its a little longer I will love the silky smoothness from this formula.  </li>
            <li>But I still like it for what it is - a decent modestly priced conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the smell, but that&#x27;s my own personal preference.</li>
            <li>While it did not weight my fine, color treated hair down, it is not volumizing either.</li>
            <li>My hair felt very soft after I used it.</li>
            <li>My hair was very soft and shiny afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It did not leave my hair feeling very soft like I would expect.</li>
            <li>Although the product is not from Herbal Essence, I thought they worked very well together and made my scalp feel tight and clean.</li>
            <li>The scent is my favorite thing, along with just the right amount of hydration for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, its nothing like the Herbal Essence products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I like the natural elements as well!</li>
            <li>However, I normally associate this with shampoo and wasn&#x27;t clear from everything I looked into what the benefit would be of having a clarifying conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a sample to review, and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and soft, as expected.</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth without feeling weighted down.  </li>
            <li>but it does make it look smooth and silky but not weighted down.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am always worried new products will cause breakouts and this did not.</li>
            <li>you are stuck with special conditioners due to allergies and you feel that your conditioner just doesn&#x27;t do it for you...</li>
            <li>It has the same refreshing smell as the shampoo, and seemed to do a decent job of conditioning, but the product itself just seemed a little &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; as far as conditioners go.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the results - my hair turned out very soft after use</li>
            <li>After my first time use I was relieved to find that this conditioner did not leave me hair looking oily or flat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty thick and should be okay for those with mid length hair.</li>
            <li>The deep conditioner made my hair really feel brand new.</li>
            <li>and I found that this conditioner worked fine on my hair and did not make it limp.</li>
            <li>will certainly use the rest of my sample bottles, and look for this conditioner when shopping in the future.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it, since I have liked other Herbal Essences products in the past, but this conditioner just didn&#x27;t seem to cut it for me.</li>
            <li>It seems that I can use less of this than other conditioners I have used, which is nice.</li>
            <li>After styling my hair (without using any additional products) it left my hair very smooth and tame - without any frizz.</li>
            <li>clean hair with a slight citrus perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put:</li>
            <li>with this conditioner, I find I have to use at least a quarter more than with the thicker conditioners.</li>
            <li>Wild naturals detoxifying...</li>
            <li>It does contain some herbs so they must be the natural part.</li>
            <li>Do they pick them in the wild?</li>
            <li>Or does this make your hair wild?</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner.</li>
            <li>my hair soft?</li>
            <li>It leaves hair feeling soft and silky after using it.</li>
            <li>As I have quite a bit of natural curl, a conditioner is a must for me.  </li>
            <li>but in fact made it extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is not heavy</li>
            <li>but it did make my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would put Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying on the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; end of conditioners that I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair soft, managable and touchable, but not &amp;#34;deeply renewed&amp;#34; as the packaging states.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t get as straight, even though I use the same straightening spray as I had been using.  </li>
            <li>will say I was pleasantly surprised with the smell.  </li>
            <li>but this didn&#x27;t come anywhere near that.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft that you can&#x27;t style it</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair.</li>
            <li>I also received the shampoo and the intensive treatment from this Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection.</li>
            <li>Or wild.</li>
            <li>but I tried the Herbal Essence Wild Naturals</li>
            <li>I have naturally staight hair</li>
            <li>and I am so pleasantly surprised by this</li>
            <li>I received a complementary sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo, conditioner,  and the Intensive Treatment cream from influenster.com for testing purposes</li>
            <li>Kept my hair feeling soft all day</li>
            <li>I would absolutely purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my hair really soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I received this Wild Naturals Detoxifying set for testing purposes</li>
            <li>B00OP25LBW Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo]] and</li>
            <li>I also used the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensice treatment and shampoo.</li>
            <li>Essences Wild Naturals has created what they call a detoxifying conditioner - this variety with the scent of thai lemon basil essences.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t speak to the detoxification aspect because I haven&#x27;t done a chemical analysis of my hair&#x27;s current state, but</li>
            <li>Herbal Essesnce Wild Naturals</li>
            <li>I left it one for a few minutes, applying a more generous amount to the ends.</li>
            <li>I have used Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner, which is a product I received free to test and review, for a few weeks</li>
            <li>I love that the conditioner feels thick and silky in my hands.  </li>
            <li>, my hair is fine and dry and using these products was a plus, didn&#x27;t strip my hair dry.</li>
            <li>The scent was subtle and lovely throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner was very thick and felt nice on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It works, but takes a large amount to actually cover your hair, as the products consistency is not thick enough.</li>
            <li>Rather than leaving hair feeling smooth and soft, it feels like it has very little effect.</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean, but was limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li>but overall a decent conditioner</li>
            <li>I highly doubt I will be purchasing this product in the future.</li>
            <li>This conditioner might be great for someone with less moisture needs, but it was too thin for my liking.</li>
            <li>Also its not have strong smell like other conditioners ( the feeling like you buy a different conditioner that not have the same scent with your shampoo).</li>
            <li>Looking at the ingredients list, the first two ingredients are water (expected) and alcohol.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li>Conditioner is hard for me to find because my hair tangles so easy.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t live up to other conditioners that I have used.</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first that I would not benefit from a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; and smooth as other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty thick and although it didn&#x27;t mess up my hair, there are better products for me.</li>
            <li>it seems less dry and more moist I was using Shampoo conditioner and as well as a deep conditioner that they gave to me</li>
            <li>It did nothing much for my hair no deep detox, no deep conditioning</li>
            <li>This brand has really gone over the top with meaningless and misleading descriptors.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and this conditioner left it greasy, weighed down and gross.</li>
            <li>My hair was left feeling so soft and it was not frizzy after blow drying it!</li>
            <li>My hair has been on the dry, frizzy side lately, and I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth and silky my hair feels today after just one use!</li>
            <li>I have very dry, straight hair and these</li>
            <li>Hair did not feel soft and silky like it normally does after I wash and dry it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally picky about my conditioner, but this is acceptable.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft and looking shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair can also be very tangly while wet.  </li>
            <li>This product of HERBAL ESSENCES Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo and Detoxifying Conditioner was very different to me from the smell, to the function.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling soft but not too &#x27;conditioned&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Definitely made it seen natural with the texture.</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d the complete set of these as part of my last Vox Box.</li>
            <li>only wash my hair twice a week, and my hair still feels soft three days after I washed it, which isn&#x27;t something that all conditioners can</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling soft</li>
            <li>it left my hair soft</li>
            <li>I was given an opportunity to test the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo, Conditioner, and Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Influenster has recently given me the opportunity to test and review Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I also made sure each time that I was THOROUGHLY rinsing every drop of it out of my hair but each time it left my hair so dull, flat, and oily that I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also given it a little shake to get the product down near the opening and it seems to move freely within the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my fine, thin hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The conditioner left my hair shiny and soft - I have platinum bleached blonde hair</li>
            <li>I like this conditioner very much because it did not make my hair feel heavy</li>
            <li>Most of the time when I even use a little conditioner my hair gets greasy so there are only a few brands I use.</li>
            <li>In combination with the Intensive Treatment, I found that this did make my hair significantly more manageable, as it is prone to tangles, but also left it limp prior to my typical overnight styling technique of leaving my hair in braids.</li>
            <li>Its smell is stronger than I prefer, but the conditioner rinses out well  and left my hair soft and shiny without making it flat.</li>
            <li>The detoxifying conditioners tend to be much easier on my hair, and this one is about the same as any other conditioner I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use that much to get it all the way through my hair which is pretty long and thick.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s pleasing, at the right level for both men and women (I think), and doesn&#x27;t linger excessively during the day.</li>
            <li>I used this condition just as I wouldve any other and was highly dissatisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Left my thin hair feeling so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I imagine if you have thicker hair than I do (mine is quite fine) that you&#x27;ll find this to be much less heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li>I did not absolutely hate it, however it was not remarkable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the treatment can/should be used everyday, but shampoo + treatment would be an economical choice since I don&#x27;t feel like the conditioner added much.</li>
            <li>made them feel soft - especially the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is a fairly thin white liquid that goes into the hair easily.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like perfumy shampoo or conditioners, so this is perfect for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even using it before I straightened my hair it was awesome.</li>
            <li> and it even helps with frizz and fly aways!</li>
            <li> I especially enjoyed the lemony fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with the feel of my hair when I used the shampoo that goes with the conditioner.</li>

            <li> That said, I could see if being perfect for someone whose hair is already quite healthy and doesn&#x27;t need a lot of help from hair products to lock in moisture and ward off damage.  </li>
            <li> Nice, lightweight conditioner!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant and my roommate</li>

            <li> The smell is pleasant</li>
            <li> Perfect for people with baby fine</li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> For a girl with curls, a good conditioner can make all the difference.</li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Pros  -Loved</li>
            <li> -Good price point for conditioner and hair products.   </li>
            <li> This is some good stuff, you should use the conditioner and the intensive treatment along with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The scent also lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li> I loved the intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> The good news is that I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on conditioner to get the results that I am after.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that the shampoo was really good</li>
            <li> but it was good</li>
            <li> The scent of this conditioner is wonderful and unique.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and refreshing.</li>
            <li> My hair felt very light afterwards!</li>
            <li> It would be great to use with the shampoo as a once a month treatment for my hair, but I would not be able to use it every day.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a free trial to test and I absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasant and fresh - yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li> After I got out of the shower my hair felt healthy!</li>
            <li> This was even better than the shampoo!</li>
            <li> Glad I found it!</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed regarding this conditioner was how awesome it smelled.  </li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product!</li>
            <li> This detoxifying conditioner is amazing.  </li>
            <li> soonI realize that it smells amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of the Herbal Essence line and this one is another great addition to it.</li>
            <li> All in all these products are AMAZING</li>
            <li> It has a great lemony scent that I really enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Also, the shampoo had this great, light citrus scent but</li>
            <li> and it is amazing...</li>
            <li> This works great and smells fantastic</li>
            <li> it smell nice?</li>
            <li> I thought it more fair to give it a 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> I grow a lot of Thai Basil and honestly, I could not find this fragrance in the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This worked nicely in getting the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> All opinions are my own and are my honest thoughts on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smoothed into my hair and washed out nicely.</li>
            <li> This is not an every day kind of product for me.</li>
            <li> As with all Herbal Essences products, the scent was really nice.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner with interesting texture.</li>
            <li> I like something that will leave my hair smelling nice for a while</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how it performs on its own as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will say I liked the scent.</li>
            <li> My hair feels good and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> &amp; I really liked the shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I liked them</li>
            <li> To me, they have a nice citrus scent - almost grapefruit.</li>
            <li> I loved the shampoo but was not so much in love with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy and use this conditioner on my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scent for the spring.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it has any kind of &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li> It does still have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this lineup of shampoo conditioner and intense treatment, excellent for damaged hair!!</li>
            <li> I received the product as a free sample through Influenster and love it!!</li>
            <li> The lemon scent is a great pick-me-up right now with winter dragging on!</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner free to test and review, and I liked it!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is super creamy and my hair ate it up happily.</li>
            <li> I do not like conditioner that has a very strong scent all day.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very nice and fresh, but it&#x27;s not a scent for a hair product I would have chosen on my own.</li>
            <li> I loved the conditioner from this line, the smell is just amazing and fresh!</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled more like pineapple than lemon, but I liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling good and light</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is color treated...</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great, very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> However, as I became older and more experienced in taking care of my hair I quickly realized that not all drug store products were great for the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> The scent was a pleasant, fresh, lemon.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner with a lingering, strong scent of passionfruit.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner did not work well for me but the deep conditioning kind was amazing!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo smelled great, while this one was not such a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily comb through hair after showering, which was nice as I often have to add a detangling product.</li>
            <li> This is certainly a brand and fragrance that I would happily keep in my guest room.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner</li>
            <li> This creamy conditioner has a refreshing spicy lemon fragrance.</li>
            <li> No wonder it feels more like hand sanitizer than it does like a conditioner.</li>
            <li> more flyaway.&lt;br /&gt;-Was</li>
            <li> Since it might work for non curly girls better</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> First of all it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I am not too fond of the smell, it is okay</li>
            <li> However, I like lemons, too, so I still enjoyed the scent even though it was not what I</li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> Yes the smell is fantastic, never have I used a shampoo/conditioner combination like this!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample product from Influenster.com to test and review and that is how I became acquainted with it.  </li>
            <li> While I was sent this product, this review is my own genuine opinion.  </li>
            <li> although I think that was mostly from the intensive conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> This did more than I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the citrusy scent of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It was simply ok.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been gifted with tangly hair.</li>
            <li> Had a light, nice scent.</li>
            <li> the scent is my favorite part.</li>
            <li> My wife has conditioning treatments that work much better and more</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this conditioner is the scent.  </li>
            <li> I started being more selective about the brands I would buy and eventually, moved on to using salon products exclusively.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying this, I don&#x27;t love it for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> The scent was nice, but it was too light of a scent for my liking.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had more body added</li>
            <li> but it is definitely more moisture and anti frizz than Organix.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It worked well enough for my hair, and I am always on the look out for the best conditioners.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Influenster!</li>
            <li> It even made my face oily from touching it.</li>
            <li> Also the scent is lite but still smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Not to mention i got this for free to test and review!</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d a deluxe sample of this to try free from influenster in my VoxBox</li>
            <li> conditioner was ok.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is better suited for people with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I would not be able to use this conditioner every day.  </li>
            <li> conditioner is as equally satisfying as the shampoo.</li>
            <li> love the way my hair smells throughout the day...and can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> and I noticed my hair had more bounce after using.</li>
            <li> Feels lovely after shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> The shampoo takes frizz better than the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture.</li>

            <li> I can tell that my hair is happy, my curls are nice and soft and the fizz is reduced well.</li>
            <li> I got the conditioner for free from Influenster!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this conditioner out for free!</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with the results from this product!</li>
            <li> I love how well the shampoo works and also love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed how silky the conditioner made my hair feel and took away my frizzes.</li>
            <li> the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t work the best with my hair type which is curly.</li>
            <li> I recieved a small/medium sized product but am pleased with the size.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll love to have this and the conditioner for travels.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Lemon basil with cassia flower sent.</li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this conditioner</li>
            <li> I was not as satisfied with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>

            <li> it was the best experience I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to try it!  </li>
            <li> I am happy with Herbal Essences new product</li>
            <li> It is perfect for the dry winters here in Colorado.</li>
            <li> received this product as part of a free trial but am very impressed with how they work together and will definitely continue to purchase these items!</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling smooth, tangle-free and smelled great!</li>
            <li> And was so clean!</li>
            <li> Not the best for someone with very dry hair</li>
            <li> Clean fresh scent and a good product.</li>
            <li> short, this isn&#x27;t the ideal conditioner for my hair type and needs, but I can see where someone else would like this a lot.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free from my Herbal Essence Voxbox from Influenster.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would buy it and recommend it to someone who was looking for a good smelling conditioner that isn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
            <li> I received this free to test out, and I like the shampoo better than the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> Although it smelt great and my hair feels somewhat  soft?</li>
            <li> Which is good on some days and not so much on others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how it detoxifies, but it did leave my hair silky smooth and easy to brush after I used it.</li>
            <li> The lemon basil and cassia flower were quite pleasant smelling to me and reminded me a lot of the way spas normally smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair feeling very light and smelled great.</li>
            <li> The smell was fresh and clean, lemon with a hint of ginger, very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Overall good product and would recommend!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair uber greasy like some other conditioners I have used.</li>

            <li> Wild Naturals products for free to review, and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as the shampoo</li>
            <li> And I prefer a conditioner without a strong, lingering scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> It is pretty watery, not as creamy as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really great, nice smell, also make my hair after use it be softer than other conditioners that I use before.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty nice</li>

            <li> The shampoo lathered wonderfully and the conditioner is light so your hair is not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it is instantly absorbed into the hair, and easily rinsed out.  </li>
            <li> I found that it rinses out easily and does not cause it to feel heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> I seem to notice while I was using it every two days that it has made a huge impact on my scalp</li>
            <li> I could tell a huge difference in the texture of my hair after I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> It applies easily and rinses cleanly.</li>

            <li> so conditioner is important and this did the job.</li>
            <li> The smell is light, herbally, and has a hint of basil.</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner for free as part of the Influenster testing program.</li>

            <li> I received a free travel size bottle in a voxbox.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling very moisturized and smelling great!</li>
            <li> I found the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying conditioner to be a fairly good one.  </li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling very moisturized and smelling great!</li>
            <li> But wow it sure does smell nice in the heat of a</li>
            <li> I love the clean, fresh, citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> It did have slip so I was able to detangle very quickly and easily, and my hair was very soft but strong and not overly mushy at all.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner is really important to keep my curly, dry hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s more like an average conditioner with great smell.</li>
            <li> They leave my hair smelling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> My hair was less fly away and has a lot more control.</li>
            <li> and it is the only kind that will be in my shopping cart!</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent</li>
            <li> but once I used it in the shower for the first time the smell was lovely.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair</li>
            <li> My hair was clean and not oily.</li>
            <li> The lemon Thai basil is really clean and invigorating.</li>
            <li> This has a fresh  somewhat unusual scent and conditions nicely.</li>
            <li> Really liked this conditioner, along with the shampoo it left me hair feeling silky smooth, and does not seem to leave any build up on my hair!</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection is nothing short of wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel clean without feeling &#x27;too clean.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I use product, gels, oils, creams in my hair and after using the Detoxifying Conditioner with my shampoo my hair felt what I consider squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I look for more natural ingredients and better outcome in my conditioners.</li>
            <li> Smells pleasant, goes on well, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lasting effect towards conditioning hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the best one for me, but not a bad product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, which I love!</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft I was in love!</li>
            <li> I much preferred the Intensive Treatment as my hair felt significantly slicker and more well-conditioned after that.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos which is a good sign, and my hair felt awakened and healthy again.</li>
            <li> easy to open bottle of nice smelling conditioner that makes your hair feel smooth but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of the new line, it&#x27;s floral-y to me and the dry oil spray adds a beautiful non greasy shine.</li>
            <li> Although I really enjoyed the scent, it didn&#x27;t stick around as long as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> I really love the fresh, lemony scent and the fact that the conditioner is pretty lightweight once my hair dries.</li>
            <li> It really helped my hair to feel healthy.</li>
            <li> However this product made my scalpel feel cool and minty with a kick of citrus or tea scent which was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very relaxing and refreshing.   </li>
            <li> Of course, my hair is very oily and finnicky, so many products don&#x27;t work well on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural lemongrass scent and to be honest, I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is really full and the fullness lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to @Influester who provided me with a free sample!</li>
            <li> Afterwards my hair had a nice shine to it and also was super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner to those who are looking for a light conditioner with a pleasant fragrance that makes your hair shine and feel very clean.</li>
            <li> It is so fresh and clean and invigorating.</li>
            <li> and I both agreed it did an adequate job of rejuvenating our hair.  </li>
            <li> The lemon basil scent is fairly mild.  </li>
            <li> Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner for it has a light lemon scent and it did condition my hair more than my Organix conditioner.</li>
            <li> Once my hair is dry, the hint of lemon is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> Not only does it perfume your shower with this amazing scent, but your hair feels soft and healthy all day!</li>
            <li> When I first applied this to my hair it felt super light weight</li>
            <li> This conditioner was light, left my hair feeling very clean and rinsed out easily.  </li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the Detoxifying Shampoo and am overall very pleased with the products.</li>
            <li> The lemony smell is subtly sharp and combines with the basil to make a nice refreshing aroma.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell and my hair looks better than normal after using it and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had to use quite a bit more than I normally would</li>
            <li> It does smell pretty fantastic</li>
            <li> It left my hair smelling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The texture is creamy and light which makes your hair feels soft, airy, and of course, extremely clean!</li>
            <li> wait for more new products ^.^</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of moisturizing without leaving a greasy, heavy feel to your hair very light weight.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s a nice light conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say my hair was easy to comb through after towel drying, which is always a concern for me since my hair is stick straight, fine and thin, and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> I received this particular conditioner for free in the mail via my Voxbox and was excited to see the results on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would certainly recommend this product to try only because it&#x27;s herbal essences and everything of this product works for a reason and every individual has their own unique options to many more of herbal essences</li>
            <li> Over all my hair is clean, but I am not any more in love with it then any other drug store conditioner.</li>
            <li> It smells great and left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> After a few more uses I have come to really love this product!</li>
            <li> I particulary like the crisp clean smell of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have long baby fine hair, which tends to easily get split ends and break easily.</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner free to test and review the product and while I did enjoy the scent I was less than thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> I loved the clean, citrusy smell of the products and felt it left my hair clean and soft and gave it lightweight feeling.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well and makes my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of this conditioner, it&#x27;s nice and lemony with some green notes.</li>
            <li> My hair was softer and shinier within a few days and I have to say this product is a great finish to the detoxifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> received the whole collection (shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment) free to review from Influenster/VoxBox</li>
            <li> received this complimentary as a set in order to rate and review.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase it for myself, they also sent me the hair treatment that is pay of the set, now that was worth it, I didn&#x27;t even bother with the conditioner I just used the treatment after I shampooed.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this product on my own.</li>
            <li> I love the soft smell.</li>
            <li> Also it is not an overly powerful conditioner.</li>
            <li> received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I also recieved this complimentary from the Influenster team.  </li>

            <li> So far, I&#x27;m really enjoying them.</li>
            <li> My hair is really smooth and free of friz so far, waiting to see if my hair becomes oily or not.</li>

            <li> I received this complimentary product via Influenster for review</li>
            <li> I didnt feel that my hair was as easy to comb through as with my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair has been super manageable since the first day.</li>
            <li> and it was a very nice conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li> and it was a very nice conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li> This is relatively cheap conditioner but it leaves your hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My brush glided right through.  </li>
            <li> I used the treatment condition right after so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the detoxifying claim, but for people who enjoy scented hair products this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of this particular product because it did not give me that &amp;#34;yes</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to lather my fine, easily-tangled hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner made my hair very soft and was easy to comb through after washing it.</li>
            <li> product is very easy to open -</li>
            <li> shampoo is a clear liquid with a distinct aroma of grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;Their milky conditioner has a strong lemon</li>
            <li> The scent is a crisp, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth putting up with the smell when the look was not as good as I could get with no conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> I just tried the herbal essence natural wild conditioner this week as a sample/tester from Influenster and I am in love!</li>
            <li> It stripped away too much of the natural oils that kept it healthy looking</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences has three lines of their Wild Naturals product, &amp;#34;Illuminating,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Detoxifying,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Rejuvenating.&amp;#34; The illuminating line is designed to make your hair shinier and has a strong fruity berry scent.</li>
            <li> Also the description strongly implies it is natural,  which it is not.  </li>
            <li> The scent is amazing and last for hours, one of the things I really like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, and my hair is so far so good.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is a perfect balance of enough moisture but not too much to weigh my curly locks down.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a nice fresh smell due to the lemon basil scent.</li>
            <li> I also really love the smell, it&#x27;s a very unisex scent and is not super feminine like many hair products.</li>
            <li> Definitely a new line I&#x27;m excited about.</li>
            <li> measuring the success of a conditioner my biggest need is that my hair should not feel oily or greasy afterward, it washes out cleanly, and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> I love that it didn&#x27;t weight down my fine</li>
            <li> Well, my hair looks a bit wild after using this, with fly-away strands instead of smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Able to use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t consistent with what I expect from a conditioner.</li>
            <li> It seems like more of a deep cleaner than it does</li>
            <li> Sure, but it was not moisturized enough to make it look good.&lt;br /&gt;-Did</li>
            <li> When you use the conditioner and shampoo together it works pretty well and makes your hair shiny and helps with frizz.</li>
            <li> Its like pouring a lemon and orange straight out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> I have mostly straight, relatively healthy shoulder length hair of average thickness, and this did a nice job keeping the tangles out and leaving my hair soft.</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner is my favorite, as it seems my hair has been craving it for years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is for everone though, and perhaps it is better suited for male users.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> Especially for people who many not want to spend the money on salon and specialty haircare brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid dove user and my hair has never felt</li>
            <li> Although the scents are quite different, my hair is not confused and came out of the shampoo/conditioner process in great condition overall.</li>
            <li> I received Herbal Essences Wild Naturals conditioner as well as the shampoo as a free trial to test and review from Influenster.</li>
            <li> The conditioner felt lightweight at first, but throughout the day, my hair started to feel oily.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, I really did!</li>
            <li> Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li> Not to mention it is very affordable!</li>
            <li> The matching intensive treatment works way better, of course, but I will definitely not purchase this one.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner as a free sample from Influenster to try and review.</li>
            <li> Thanks Influenster!</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t already using a sulfate-free conditioner, I would definitely suggest using this one, but if you&#x27;re already using one you love, skip it and just spring for the Intensive Treatment.</li>
            <li> what I can tell you is that this conditioner makes my hair feel soft and smooth and not greasy or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Intense soothing smell makes you feel like your scalp is exfoliating!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this would be effective for longer hair that tends to get more tangled simply because it is not conditioning enough for more extreme cases.</li>
            <li> It also washed out nicely as well and left my hair feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> I found it a pleasant deviation from the usual fruity, floral, and tropical scents.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time with tangles mostly because I only wash my hair a couple times a week, and I was thrilled with the quality of this product!</li>
            <li> I liked that it wasn&#x27;t extremely floral-y.  </li>
            <li> While I liked the other two in this collection, I did not like the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Left hair soft and smells amazing</li>
            <li> The top of the bottle flips open without any difficulty and the product comes out with a gentle tilt and squeeze of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The complimentary sample I got via Influenster will definitely have me coming back for more!</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner had a strong smell first going on</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant- not overwhelming and very up-to-date scents.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a kinky curly hair &amp; it left my hair feeling really clean &amp; strong</li>
            <li> But it did condition my hair without weighting it down and it did have a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> but I prefer something a little more sweet.</li>
            <li> I had to go out the next day and purchase the full size bottle!</li>
            <li> What I should have paid attention to more was the word &amp;#34;detoxifying.&amp;#34;  Apparently, Herbal Essences has a Wild Naturals Detoxifying, Rejuvenating and  Illuminating products.</li>
            <li> I think this conditioner may be better for people with finer hair versus dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman and these products were a nice surprise</li>
            <li> br /&gt;later left tangle-free and easy to comb out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own to be quite runny, which made me very skeptical as to how good of a product it is.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this conditioner to people with fine or lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was thick and lathered nicely and it left my hair clean, fresh and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have a huge problem with fly aways and static in the cold and dry winter months</li>
            <li> It has a nice little curl at the bottom and looks like I have a ton of volume-</li>
            <li> All in all this is probably just an average conditioner, however I really liked the results I got with my particular hair type when using this with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Its a clear crisp smell, light on lather, and felt so light as opposed to other products.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find a good conditioner</li>
            <li> I have thinner hair that tends to get weighed down very easily, so I like clarifying or detoxifying products to reset my hair every once in a while.</li>
            <li> It was not very thick and ran right off of my hand.</li>
            <li> I am not a big user of conditioners, so when I do use one it really needs to fit my needs for me to even bother.</li>
            <li> This Detoxifying Conditioner has made my hair much stronger.</li>
            <li> it probably won&#x27;t condition as much as you need though.</li>
            <li> But the product as a whole works well.</li>
            <li> and I think this one is a real winner as men as well as women would like the scent.</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of the Herbal Essences Detoxifying Conditioner for free</li>
            <li> All in all I really like this conditioner, but</li>
            <li> so it really didn&#x27;t have that going for it either.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use both this and the intense conditioner though as it makes my hair stuff.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care much for the elixir.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was very watery</li>
            <li> It really is just a conditioner.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> I really like the floral, citrus smell because itâ€™s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Feels really luxurious.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent of it, but this conditioner does not lather my hair very well.</li>
            <li> It left my hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and this has really helped that.  </li>
            <li> Its very energizing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see if these really turn out well.</li>
            <li> This product did not give my hair much volume - but that was not what it was designed to do, so</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> so I assumed that this was a shampoo meant to give body and not moisturize too much.</li>
            <li> It was much softer in the shower than smelling it straight out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I recently received this item for free to test and review it.</li>
            <li> I received my Herbal Essence Wild Naturals complimentary from Influenster to review.</li>
            <li> I normally have fairly straight hair that dries without much body but these products have made my hair va-va- voom!</li>
            <li> small amount of shampoo quickly works into a thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing it out the hair is impressively thicker in volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight, fluffy hair that gets weighed down and greasy easily, I have been using this conditioner daily for over a week now and while I love the shampoo and Intensive Treatment, I was less than thrilled by the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is fine for me to use every so often though, particularly in between deep conditionings.</li>
            <li> Combine that with the current dry winter conditions and I need a pretty rich conditioner to keep my hair feeling and looking soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the best option for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This creamy but not overly heavy conditioner has an unusual and strong but not unpleasant fruity herbal scent.</li>
            <li> Its light and fluffy and just feeling it you can tell that its going to do a great job moisturizing without completely weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> I used it after using the Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo and my hair feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> The scent is botanical, but more sharp than floral, and doesn&#x27;t linger (that I could tell).</li>
            <li> Personally, I like the unique Thai Lemon Basil scent.</li>
            <li> It might be better suited for other hair types than mine.  </li>
            <li> my hair didn&#x27;t feel any better than when i use any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Fortunately most of that went away after the hair dried, although I did get a whiff of it now and then on the first day.</li>
            <li> I pretty much try every conditioner that Amazon offers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would grab about a quarter size amount since I have long fine curly/wavy hair and rubbing it into my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, tending to oily.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a good product because of how thin the conditioner was when it came out of the bottle -</li>
            <li> It is fine for me to use as a single conditioning treatement between shampooings, since the trend nowadays is not to wash your hair too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about conditioners because they can weigh my hair down and make my roots even more oily.  </li>
            <li> After a long day, I enjoy using this product so I can relax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s maybe a once a week as a break from my normal shampoo or to remove any intense hair product build up.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how intensely it moisturized my hair!</li>
            <li> but my hair became very oily by the end of the day, which does not happen with my normal regimen.</li>
            <li> I think the detoxifying label is a gimmick, but overall not a bad conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair conditioner hands down.</li>
            <li> My tangles were also more manageable due to the greatness of the conditioner!</li>
            <li> I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review!</li>
            <li> I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review!</li>
            <li> When I first applied the conditioner, I thought it might not work well, because it was so light and not thick as other conditioners I&#x27;ve become accustomed to using.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is decent.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got this because I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> After pairing with the shampoo, it left my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to others with the same hair issues! :)</li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoyed the conditioner and will definitely consider purchasing.</li>
            <li> I will likely use the shampoo again for clarifying purposes, but will pair it with a different conditioner for more moisture.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to those of you who use a lot of product and/or color your hair as this set gives love back to your hair.</li>
            <li> I used Dove before and will most likely go back to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying the shampoo, skipping the regular conditioner and will most definately buy the deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> The main thing is that it did not make me break out.  </li>
            <li> The whole line left my hair clean and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> As for me, I have fairly thick hair and it does a fair job of conditioning if left in for about 5 minutes while in a hot shower and</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair nice and soft and tame.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both this conditioner and its shampoo sister.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these products</li>
            <li> but I saw that isopropyl myristate was high up on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though, after a few days of use, it really has made my damaged hair look better and it has made it very soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner definitely works because my hair was super soft immediately after I rinsed out the product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t bad, or especially good.</li>
            <li> In whole though my hair has been wonderfully soft from root to tip.</li>
            <li> I normally use a detangling product to comb my hair, but I did not need one after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> As conditioners go, I would not say it was my least favorite of those Iâ€™ve tried, but it wasnâ€™t my first choice either.  </li>
            <li> but I will say out of the two that the conditioner has a more pleasing scent; the smell really comes out once your hair is dried!</li>
            <li> the way it made my hair feel almost instantly was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair felt better and cleaner after I dried it.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this I didn&#x27;t think I liked it as the texture is a bit thin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to use the leave in conditioner I normally do after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I received complimentary bottles of the shampoo, conditioner and the deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> And it most definitely does not help untangle long hair.</li>
            <li> Although I wasn&#x27;t aware that my hair was toxic, this product will apparently take care of that in a jiffy.</li>
            <li> I loved the treatment and almost felt like the conditioner was an unnecessary step.</li>
            <li> Love how soft my hair was and how it didn&#x27;t feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really helped calm my hair down and made it feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Currently my hair is very short and it looks better if I use shampoo only but when its a little longer I will love the silky smoothness from this formula.  </li>
            <li> But I still like it for what it is - a decent modestly priced conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the smell, but that&#x27;s my own personal preference.</li>
            <li> While it did not weight my fine, color treated hair down, it is not volumizing either.</li>
            <li> My hair felt very soft after I used it.</li>
            <li> My hair was very soft and shiny afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It did not leave my hair feeling very soft like I would expect.</li>
            <li> Although the product is not from Herbal Essence, I thought they worked very well together and made my scalp feel tight and clean.</li>
            <li> The scent is my favorite thing, along with just the right amount of hydration for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, its nothing like the Herbal Essence products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I like the natural elements as well!</li>
            <li> However, I normally associate this with shampoo and wasn&#x27;t clear from everything I looked into what the benefit would be of having a clarifying conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a sample to review, and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and soft, as expected.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth without feeling weighted down.  </li>
            <li> but it does make it look smooth and silky but not weighted down.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am always worried new products will cause breakouts and this did not.</li>
            <li> you are stuck with special conditioners due to allergies and you feel that your conditioner just doesn&#x27;t do it for you...</li>
            <li> It has the same refreshing smell as the shampoo, and seemed to do a decent job of conditioning, but the product itself just seemed a little &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; as far as conditioners go.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the results - my hair turned out very soft after use</li>
            <li> After my first time use I was relieved to find that this conditioner did not leave me hair looking oily or flat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and should be okay for those with mid length hair.</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner made my hair really feel brand new.</li>
            <li> and I found that this conditioner worked fine on my hair and did not make it limp.</li>
            <li> will certainly use the rest of my sample bottles, and look for this conditioner when shopping in the future.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it, since I have liked other Herbal Essences products in the past, but this conditioner just didn&#x27;t seem to cut it for me.</li>
            <li> It seems that I can use less of this than other conditioners I have used, which is nice.</li>
            <li> After styling my hair (without using any additional products) it left my hair very smooth and tame - without any frizz.</li>
            <li> clean hair with a slight citrus perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put:</li>
            <li> with this conditioner, I find I have to use at least a quarter more than with the thicker conditioners.</li>
            <li> Wild naturals detoxifying...</li>
            <li> It does contain some herbs so they must be the natural part.</li>
            <li> Do they pick them in the wild?</li>
            <li> Or does this make your hair wild?</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner.</li>
            <li> my hair soft?</li>
            <li> It leaves hair feeling soft and silky after using it.</li>
            <li> As I have quite a bit of natural curl, a conditioner is a must for me.  </li>
            <li> but in fact made it extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is not heavy</li>
            <li> but it did make my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would put Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying on the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; end of conditioners that I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair soft, managable and touchable, but not &amp;#34;deeply renewed&amp;#34; as the packaging states.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t get as straight, even though I use the same straightening spray as I had been using.  </li>
            <li> will say I was pleasantly surprised with the smell.  </li>
            <li> but this didn&#x27;t come anywhere near that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft that you can&#x27;t style it</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily hair.</li>
            <li> I also received the shampoo and the intensive treatment from this Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection.</li>
            <li> Or wild.</li>
            <li> but I tried the Herbal Essence Wild Naturals</li>
            <li> I have naturally staight hair</li>
            <li> and I am so pleasantly surprised by this</li>
            <li> I received a complementary sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo, conditioner,  and the Intensive Treatment cream from influenster.com for testing purposes</li>
            <li> Kept my hair feeling soft all day</li>
            <li> I would absolutely purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> The conditioner makes my hair really soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I received this Wild Naturals Detoxifying set for testing purposes</li>
            <li> B00OP25LBW Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo]] and</li>
            <li> I also used the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensice treatment and shampoo.</li>
            <li> Essences Wild Naturals has created what they call a detoxifying conditioner - this variety with the scent of thai lemon basil essences.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t speak to the detoxification aspect because I haven&#x27;t done a chemical analysis of my hair&#x27;s current state, but</li>
            <li> Herbal Essesnce Wild Naturals</li>
            <li> I left it one for a few minutes, applying a more generous amount to the ends.</li>
            <li> I have used Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner, which is a product I received free to test and review, for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I love that the conditioner feels thick and silky in my hands.  </li>
            <li> , my hair is fine and dry and using these products was a plus, didn&#x27;t strip my hair dry.</li>
            <li> The scent was subtle and lovely throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner was very thick and felt nice on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It works, but takes a large amount to actually cover your hair, as the products consistency is not thick enough.</li>
            <li> Rather than leaving hair feeling smooth and soft, it feels like it has very little effect.</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean, but was limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> but overall a decent conditioner</li>
            <li> I highly doubt I will be purchasing this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This conditioner might be great for someone with less moisture needs, but it was too thin for my liking.</li>
            <li> Also its not have strong smell like other conditioners ( the feeling like you buy a different conditioner that not have the same scent with your shampoo).</li>
            <li> Looking at the ingredients list, the first two ingredients are water (expected) and alcohol.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li> Conditioner is hard for me to find because my hair tangles so easy.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t live up to other conditioners that I have used.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first that I would not benefit from a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; and smooth as other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and although it didn&#x27;t mess up my hair, there are better products for me.</li>
            <li> it seems less dry and more moist I was using Shampoo conditioner and as well as a deep conditioner that they gave to me</li>
            <li> It did nothing much for my hair no deep detox, no deep conditioning</li>
            <li> This brand has really gone over the top with meaningless and misleading descriptors.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and this conditioner left it greasy, weighed down and gross.</li>
            <li> My hair was left feeling so soft and it was not frizzy after blow drying it!</li>
            <li> My hair has been on the dry, frizzy side lately, and I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth and silky my hair feels today after just one use!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, straight hair and these</li>
            <li> Hair did not feel soft and silky like it normally does after I wash and dry it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally picky about my conditioner, but this is acceptable.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and looking shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair can also be very tangly while wet.  </li>
            <li> This product of HERBAL ESSENCES Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo and Detoxifying Conditioner was very different to me from the smell, to the function.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling soft but not too &#x27;conditioned&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Definitely made it seen natural with the texture.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d the complete set of these as part of my last Vox Box.</li>
            <li> only wash my hair twice a week, and my hair still feels soft three days after I washed it, which isn&#x27;t something that all conditioners can</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> it left my hair soft</li>
            <li> I was given an opportunity to test the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo, Conditioner, and Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Influenster has recently given me the opportunity to test and review Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I also made sure each time that I was THOROUGHLY rinsing every drop of it out of my hair but each time it left my hair so dull, flat, and oily that I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also given it a little shake to get the product down near the opening and it seems to move freely within the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my fine, thin hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The conditioner left my hair shiny and soft - I have platinum bleached blonde hair</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner very much because it did not make my hair feel heavy</li>
            <li> Most of the time when I even use a little conditioner my hair gets greasy so there are only a few brands I use.</li>
            <li> In combination with the Intensive Treatment, I found that this did make my hair significantly more manageable, as it is prone to tangles, but also left it limp prior to my typical overnight styling technique of leaving my hair in braids.</li>
            <li> Its smell is stronger than I prefer, but the conditioner rinses out well  and left my hair soft and shiny without making it flat.</li>
            <li> The detoxifying conditioners tend to be much easier on my hair, and this one is about the same as any other conditioner I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use that much to get it all the way through my hair which is pretty long and thick.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s pleasing, at the right level for both men and women (I think), and doesn&#x27;t linger excessively during the day.</li>
            <li> I used this condition just as I wouldve any other and was highly dissatisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Left my thin hair feeling so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> I imagine if you have thicker hair than I do (mine is quite fine) that you&#x27;ll find this to be much less heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li> I did not absolutely hate it, however it was not remarkable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the treatment can/should be used everyday, but shampoo + treatment would be an economical choice since I don&#x27;t feel like the conditioner added much.</li>
            <li> made them feel soft - especially the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is a fairly thin white liquid that goes into the hair easily.</li>
            <li> It loses a star because although it is a good detangler, it is not great.  </li>
            <li> Wild Naturals is certainly not a &amp;#34;Deeply Renewing&amp;#34; conditioner, even left on hair for a while before rinsing.</li>
            <li> Based on how they talk about it on their website, it sounds to me like the Detoxifying line is all about what I would normally refer to as clarifying products, designed to break down and remove styling products from the hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not work like a normal conditioner since it is intended to detoxify your hair rather than weigh it down, but it should still provide some additional moisture since it is a conditioner...</li>
            <li> In my situation it seems it is more difficult to flat iron my hair after using this product.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick, but when I rinsed it out I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth or as moisturized as it is with other products.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft unlike any other conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair silky soft like other products.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a delicate balance to keep it frizz free without ending up weighed down.</li>
            <li> I still have to add dry oil to my hair for that extra shiny look but instead of adding extra hydration sprays it seems like Herbal Essences it the mark for people like</li>
            <li> /&gt;Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner is about average.  </li>
            <li> It also added much needed shine and volume to my usual flat, unvolumized hair.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need a little more than the usual conditioner amount since this product runs a little more thin than typical for a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used Herbal Essences in the past and always had a great experience for a less expensive shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have to use all natural products due to an allergy to sulfates but sometimes those products really dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am also less clear on the benefit of &#x27;detoxification&#x27; for a conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of this product to try for free, Not the worst conditioner i have ever tried but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It removed all of the product build up without making my hair dry and gross.</li>
            <li> While you&#x27;re probably expected to use the shampoo and conditioner from the same brand line, I actually followed the illuminating shampoo with the detoxifying conditioner.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not weigh down my already fine and thin hair, but does give it enough conditioning where it doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> the conditioner left my normally curly hair very limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I usually use a more expensive brand and was pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and brittle and it soaked up this conditioner like a sponge leaving it soft and manageable without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> It could save money in the long run.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a LONG time since I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences hair care products.  </li>
            <li> I was curious to try this to see how Herbal Essences might have evolved since my earlier experiences with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only minus is that there was no sustaining moisture when my hair dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really felt the need to match up my brands as long as each product works well individually, which I feel this one does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think that I have made a mistake not using Herbal Essence for so long!  </li>
            <li> as I have very long hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair</li>
            <li> it gets dry at the ends but is oily at the roots.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> and I have really dry and damaged ends from chemical processing...</li>
            <li> And I could still blow dry and curl it without it feeling to weighted.</li>
            <li> Normally, I use salon quality conditioner, but have used other Herbal Essences products in the past.</li>
            <li> I have thin, stick-straight hair that gets pretty oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every day.</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed in using this product after the coordinating shampoo.</li>
            <li> this conditioned my hair enough but didn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I found It left my hair manageable but no more than my current shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews and was very shocked, I found others saying the only good thing was the smell.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was just not rich enough for my needs.  </li>
            <li> Half way through the day my hair had gone flat and was in my face.</li>
            <li> I have hard water; however it leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> But my big concern with this was how my hair looked, which was messy even after attempting to style it.</li>
            <li> I usually use deep conditioners and expensive shampoos, but these products actually worked really well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has the consistency you&#x27;d expect from conditioner - no real difference there from any other product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little went a long way.</li>
            <li> I found a little of the shampoo goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually just use a product that has shampoo and conditioner in one and using a separate shampoo and this conditioner has definitely made a difference.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would purchase this product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I knew that it dries my hair out from having seen that ingredient in other products.</li>
            <li> I like to use this shampoo and conditioner to remove buildup from other products I use.</li>
            <li> I use it on my non-shampoo days, so every other day, as a maintenance conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I used it in conjunction with the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> In the winter, I have a lot of trouble with dry hair.</li>
            <li> Cons -Conditioner was a bit runny and looked watered down compared to other products I have used  Disclaimer:</li>
            <li> The only down side was that my hair had a bit less body than usual-</li>
            <li> I have to say, before I used this product I had very dry and dead hair with lots of spilt ends,</li>
            <li> I had very damaged hair from bleaching it and was skeptical that this would help.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Herbal Essences products I remember the scent is a lot more subtle and less artificial smelling.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it gives my hair zero volume.</li>
            <li> this conditioner is not exciting.</li>
            <li> Definetly weighs it down.</li>
            <li> it may have weighed my hair down a bit.  </li>
            <li> and this does not weigh it down at all.  </li>
            <li> and I found my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down by the product.</li>
            <li> and she is extremely prickly about her hair care practices!</li>
            <li> Received the conditioner in the mail as a sample from influenster and did not like anything about it other than the smell!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has an odd scent which I did not care for.</li>
            <li> It is your typical conditioner.</li>
            <li> I typically shy away from using too much conditioner, as I feel it makes my hair feel heavy and oily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> so I have trouble finding conditioners that don&#x27;t weigh it down</li>
            <li> I felt like you NEEDED (or at least I needed) the dry oil to supplement the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I thought the conditioner could have been a little thicker/creamer.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a heavy conditioner</li>
            <li> It left behind no residue at all</li>
            <li> its heavy in in)</li>
            <li> I would then wait a few minutes while I washed my body and rinse it out.</li>
            <li> The conditioner made my hair heavy and look oily even though I just washed it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im not a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li> The smell lingers for a little while but is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> so i dont usually use alot of conditioner cause it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> But it remains in the hair well for the usual few minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> In the past, i&#x27;ve had trouble with conditioners leaving my hair greasy, but this washed out of my hair well</li>
            <li> and my hair was not weighed down in the least.  </li>
            <li> I use very little so the scent doesn&#x27;t overwhelm me in the shower.  </li>
            <li> is limp and hard to style.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is my water or the product.</li>
            <li> I have used Herbal Essence in the past but it didn&#x27;t work for me, after trying this detoxifying shampoo/conditioner I am sold</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> I have been given a small sample of this line from influenster to try.  </li>
            <li> This product was too hard on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> but I had a hard time rinsing it.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair dull and lifeless looking.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little thin for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure what they mean by that.</li>
            <li> Any claims of &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; are of course ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Product was very thin, which I don&#x27;t usually like in a conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The conditioner is fairly thin, some conditioners I&#x27;ve used are very thick, so</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin hair</li>
            <li> The formula was way too thin</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> My thin hair needs hydration to keep from frizzing</li>
            <li> I like how thin of a product it is</li>
            <li> but I was no happy with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I understand that this is a detoxifying product and is designed to not weigh down hair or over-condition but the thin consistency makes it almost impossible to work through my hair without using a ton of it.</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though I am ill equipped to deal with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with the scent of this collection.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical that I would like it, but I do.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s the detoxifying aspect of it, but it was a touch unsettling in terms of texture.</li>
            <li> but it is very thin and watery.</li>
            <li> My daughters curls get tangled like crazy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY difficult to find one to solve both of my problems.</li>
            <li> BUT, I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel so silky and shined like crazy!!</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed in the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Disappointed!  </li>

            <li> In the winter, I have a lot of trouble with dry hair. It gets brittle and tends to break off. I&#x27;ve tried several conditioners, but this one actually works. This Detoxifying Conditioner has made my hair much stronger. The hair feels silky and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is fairly thin, some conditioners I&#x27;ve used are very thick, so with this conditioner, I find I have to use at least a quarter more than with the thicker conditioners. The conditioner has a nice fresh smell due to the lemon basil scent. I don&#x27;t like perfumy shampoo or conditioners, so this is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the conditioner with a total care nourishing shampoo. Although the product is not from Herbal Essence, I thought they worked very well together and made my scalp feel tight and clean. I&#x27;m glad I found this conditioner. It has definitely helped my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is relatively cheap conditioner but it leaves your hair soft and clean. I usually just use a product that has shampoo and conditioner in one and using a separate shampoo and this conditioner has definitely made a difference.</li>
            <li> Wild naturals detoxifying... I&#x27;m unsure what they mean by that. It does contain some herbs so they must be the natural part. Do they pick them in the wild? Or does this make your hair wild? Well, my hair looks a bit wild after using this, with fly-away strands instead of smooth and conditioned. I don&#x27;t know what the word detoxifying refers to; I would expect shampoo to wash out toxins but not conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has an odd scent which I did not care for. Fortunately most of that went away after the hair dried, although I did get a whiff of it now and then on the first day. But my big concern with this was how my hair looked, which was messy even after attempting to style it. There was no feeling of body, no cohesiveness. I probably won&#x27;t use this again. It&#x27;s not worth putting up with the smell when the look was not as good as I could get with no conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, its nothing like the Herbal Essence products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  This conditioner works very well and makes my hair smooth and shiny.  I used it in conjunction with the matching shampoo tonight.  Currently my hair is very short and it looks better if I use shampoo only but when its a little longer I will love the silky smoothness from this formula.  I highly recommend both this conditioner and its shampoo sister.</li>
            <li> The scent of this conditioner is wonderful and unique. A very nice scent for  a man or woman. The conditioner itself is decent. It&#x27;s pretty thick and should be okay for those with mid length hair. My hair is pretty thick and although it didn&#x27;t mess up my hair, there are better products for me. This is fine for me to use every so often though, particularly in between deep conditionings. I think the detoxifying label is a gimmick, but overall not a bad conditioner.</li>
            <li> I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review! I have natural hair and it was a very nice conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too heavy but it left my hair feeling very moisturized and smelling great!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. My hair was less fly away and has a lot more control.</li>
            <li> This detoxifying conditioner is amazing.  The scent is very pleasant and fresh - yet not overpowering. I love the way it is instantly absorbed into the hair, and easily rinsed out.  Definitely does not weigh down my already fine and thin hair, but does give it enough conditioning where it doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle.  When I first tried it I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a good product because of how thin the conditioner was when it came out of the bottle - but boy was I wrong.  This, mixed with the detoxifying shampoo is a must for anyone&#x27;s hair care routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary as a set in order to rate and review. I am glad I got this because I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner. I have oily hair and I found that this conditioner worked fine on my hair and did not make it limp. It isn&#x27;t a heavy conditioner so it seems like it would be good for a variety of hair types. If you have dry hair it probably won&#x27;t condition as much as you need though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use anything with too much moisturizer because it is too heavy. This has the perfect amount of moisture and my curls look amazing. Even using it before I straightened my hair it was awesome. My hair was clean and not oily. The smell is great and refreshing. Thank you again Influenster for sending me this test product!</li>
            <li> This combination of the shampoo and conditioner is a great mix. It really helped my hair to feel healthy. I used a quarter size of shampoo and same for thr conditioner. I left them both sit on my head for about 5 to 10 minutes then I used the leave in conditioner for about 10 minutes and rinsed it out. After I got out of the shower my hair felt healthy! I got this product as a free trial to test and I absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner but it&#x27;s a little thin for me.  I do like it when using it with the shampoo and after treatment.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I received the product as a free sample through Influenster and love it!! Left my thin hair feeling so soft and clean.  Able to use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This creamy but not overly heavy conditioner has an unusual and strong but not unpleasant fruity herbal scent. Its smell is stronger than I prefer, but the conditioner rinses out well  and left my hair soft and shiny without making it flat. I&#x27;m not sure about the detoxifying claim, but for people who enjoy scented hair products this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> This creamy conditioner has a refreshing spicy lemon fragrance. It applies easily and rinses cleanly. It left my hair feeling soft and looking shiny. It contains cassia which is reputed to add volume, strength and shine. While it did not weight my fine, color treated hair down, it is not volumizing either. It did help ease tangles. I left it one for a few minutes, applying a more generous amount to the ends. The fragrance lightens but lingers. I found it a pleasant deviation from the usual fruity, floral, and tropical scents.  This is an inexpensive conditioner that performs well.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t consistent with what I expect from a conditioner. Rather than leaving hair feeling smooth and soft, it feels like it has very little effect. Looking at the ingredients list, the first two ingredients are water (expected) and alcohol.  Alcohol? No wonder it feels more like hand sanitizer than it does like a conditioner. It seems like more of a deep cleaner than it does an conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the scent a bit bizarre.  Basil and lemon scented hair product????</li>
            <li> THE SCENT IS EYE OPENING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this in the morning when you need a &amp;#34;wake up!&amp;#34;  The lemon scent invigorates the senses!  The conditioner  is great for it&#x27;s price.  I have used Herbal Essences in the past and always had a great experience for a less expensive shampoo/conditioner.  This is a product I return too.  In this case, I will return because I truly felt &amp;#34;woke up&amp;#34; after using it!  The conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth without feeling weighted down.  I found that it rinses out easily and does not cause it to feel heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> For a girl with curls, a good conditioner can make all the difference. What attracted me to try this one was the &amp;#34;wild naturals&amp;#34; because that made me think of the Suave Naturals line that I sometimes use.  What I should have paid attention to more was the word &amp;#34;detoxifying.&amp;#34;  Apparently, Herbal Essences has a Wild Naturals Detoxifying, Rejuvenating and  Illuminating products. According to their product website, the detoxifying line is to &amp;#34;wash away impurities.&amp;#34; Their catch line is &amp;#34;Buh-bye, build-up.&amp;#34; It seems similar to a clarifying product line that you might use once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Did my hair look moisturized? No. This product was too hard on my curly hair. It stripped away too much of the natural oils that kept it healthy looking and it made my curls more flyaway.&lt;br /&gt;-Was my hair soft? Sure, but it was not moisturized enough to make it look good.&lt;br /&gt;-Did it smell nice? Yes, it smelled great. I thought it smelled more like pineapple than lemon, but I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not get this one again, so for me it would be a 2 star rating. Since it might work for non curly girls better I thought it more fair to give it a 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> Got this to review through Influenster. Smells pleasant, goes on well, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lasting effect towards conditioning hair. Not something I would try again</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free from influnser. When you use the conditioner and shampoo together it works pretty well and makes your hair shiny and helps with frizz.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner free to test and review, and I liked it! It leaves my hair soft, which I love! Just not a fan of the scent. A little seems to go a long way. It seems that I can use less of this than other conditioners I have used, which is nice. It could save money in the long run. I would buy this conditioner in a different scent! They leave my hair smelling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I received this set from influenster for free. Absolutely love the smell of the new line, it&#x27;s floral-y to me and the dry oil spray adds a beautiful non greasy shine. The conditioner is a perfect balance of enough moisture but not too much to weigh my curly locks down. Definitely a new line I&#x27;m excited about.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!! It leaves my hair so soft unlike any other conditioner I have ever used. Great pair with the deep treatment!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It leaves hair feeling soft and silky after using it. I think that it works well with the corresponding shampoo. I could also feel my scalp tingling after applying the conditioner which let me know that it was working to deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I received this sample for free for review.  I did not absolutely hate it, however it was not remarkable.  I would not purchase it for myself, they also sent me the hair treatment that is pay of the set, now that was worth it, I didn&#x27;t even bother with the conditioner I just used the treatment after I shampooed.  All of this stuff smells fantastic though.</li>
            <li> I received the von box with this collection for free asked me to review it and this is my opinion I received it and soonI realize that it smells amazing I seem to notice while I was using it every two days that it has made a huge impact on my scalp it seems less dry and more moist I was using Shampoo conditioner and as well as a deep conditioner that they gave to me highly recommend these products</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner a lot. First of all it smells amazing! The lemon Thai basil is really clean and invigorating. It does a pretty good job of moisturizing without leaving a greasy, heavy feel to your hair very light weight. Perfect for people with baby fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;*i received this product free for testing purposes*</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from Influenster to test and review. After a couple uses this is what I came up with. I am not too fond of the smell, it is okay but I prefer something a little more sweet. But the product as a whole works well. After pairing with the shampoo, it left my hair feeling soft and smooth. I have very fine, straight hair and it even helps with frizz and fly aways! After styling my hair (without using any additional products) it left my hair very smooth and tame - without any frizz. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I found the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying conditioner to be a fairly good one.  I usually use a more expensive brand and was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I especially enjoyed the lemony fragrance.  I grow a lot of Thai Basil and honestly, I could not find this fragrance in the conditioner.  However, I like lemons, too, so I still enjoyed the scent even though it was not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner did a good job of helping reduce the tangles in my hair.  As I have quite a bit of natural curl, a conditioner is a must for me.  This is certainly a brand and fragrance that I would happily keep in my guest room.  I like to have a couple of types available for my guests and I think this one is a real winner as men as well as women would like the scent.</li>
            <li> I received this particular conditioner for free in the mail via my Voxbox and was excited to see the results on my hair. My hair is very fine and thin so I have trouble finding conditioners that don&#x27;t weigh it down but I also need a moisturizing conditioner for my colored/damaged hair. It&#x27;s VERY difficult to find one to solve both of my problems. After my first time use I was relieved to find that this conditioner did not leave me hair looking oily or flat but in fact made it extremely soft and shiny. After a few more uses I have come to really love this product! I would definitely recommend it to others with the same hair issues! :)</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the feel of my hair when I used the shampoo that goes with the conditioner. I love the scent but I had a hard time rinsing it. Not sure if it is my water or the product. I normally only wash my hair every couple of days but with this I had to wash it the next day. It gave me a greasy look.</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of the Herbal Essences Detoxifying Conditioner for free so I could test and review it. I have thin, stick-straight hair that gets pretty oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every day. Normally, I use salon quality conditioner, but have used other Herbal Essences products in the past. This conditioner smells great, very clean and fresh. It is pretty watery, not as creamy as I would&#x27;ve liked. My hair felt very soft after I used it. I normally use a detangling product to comb my hair, but I did not need one after using this conditioner. Although I really enjoyed the scent, it didn&#x27;t stick around as long as I would&#x27;ve liked. Overall, I really enjoyed the conditioner and will definitely consider purchasing.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of conditioners.  My roommate uses a conditioner daily because of his hair type and I use one weekly, well because.  I pretty much try every conditioner that Amazon offers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner is about average.  The fragrance is pleasant and my roommate and I both agreed it did an adequate job of rejuvenating our hair.  As conditioners go, I would not say it was my least favorite of those Iâ€™ve tried, but it wasnâ€™t my first choice either.  Good for the money.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample through Influencer. I read other reviews and was very shocked, I found others saying the only good thing was the smell. I have a hard time with tangles mostly because I only wash my hair a couple times a week, and I was thrilled with the quality of this product! Yes the smell is fantastic, never have I used a shampoo/conditioner combination like this! Its like pouring a lemon and orange straight out of the bottle! After I rinsed out the conditioner I could run my fingers through my hair with ease no tangles! I have used Herbal Essence in the past but it didn&#x27;t work for me, after trying this detoxifying shampoo/conditioner I am sold and it is the only kind that will be in my shopping cart!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is wonderful!  I like it because it is not heavy and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair dull and lifeless looking.  I was given a sample product from Influenster.com to test and review and that is how I became acquainted with it.  I love the clean, fresh, citrus scent.  When I first applied the conditioner, I thought it might not work well, because it was so light and not thick as other conditioners I&#x27;ve become accustomed to using.  I am happy to say my hair was easy to comb through after towel drying, which is always a concern for me since my hair is stick straight, fine and thin, and tangles easily.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner to those who are looking for a light conditioner with a pleasant fragrance that makes your hair shine and feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner is really important to keep my curly, dry hair healthy. This conditioner might be great for someone with less moisture needs, but it was too thin for my liking. I had to use quite a bit to work a comb through my hair. I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the smell, but that&#x27;s my own personal preference. I will likely use the shampoo again for clarifying purposes, but will pair it with a different conditioner for more moisture. Note: I received a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great drug store conditioner.  I have very fine hair that is color treated...it gets dry at the ends but is oily at the roots.  I&#x27;m very picky about conditioners because they can weigh my hair down and make my roots even more oily.  This did neither.  It left behind no residue at all and my hair was not weighed down in the least.  My hair was very soft and shiny afterwards.  My hair can also be very tangly while wet.  This worked nicely in getting the tangles out.  My brush glided right through.  The lemon basil scent is fairly mild.  I noticed that it is a bit stronger in the shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t mind this at all.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample of this conditioner by Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes.  While I was sent this product, this review is my own genuine opinion.  I will definitely purchase this product on my own.</li>
            <li> I got it on my Vox Box. This conditioner really great, nice smell, also make my hair after use it be softer than other conditioners that I use before. Also its not have strong smell like other conditioners ( the feeling like you buy a different conditioner that not have the same scent with your shampoo). Really great products.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product in my Influenster VoxBox. I used this with the shampoo and intensive conditioning treatment. I was surprised at the results - my hair turned out very soft after use although I think that was mostly from the intensive conditioning treatment. The smell is nice and my hair felt healthy and clean after use. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to soften graying hair and bring back the shine. This did more than I&#x27;d hoped for. I love the soft smell.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of the conditioner to test from influenster. I absolutely love the citrusy scent of this conditioner. My hair smelled amazing all day! And was so clean! The conditioner made my hair very soft and was easy to comb through after washing it. My hair felt very light afterwards!</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the Detoxifying Shampoo and am overall very pleased with the products. The shampoo and conditioner have a citrus scent, the scent could be improved a bit as it smells almost like lemon- lime soda but I will say out of the two that the conditioner has a more pleasing scent; the smell really comes out once your hair is dried! I normally have fairly straight hair that dries without much body but these products have made my hair va-va- voom! It has a nice little curl at the bottom and looks like I have a ton of volume- and it lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as part of a free trial but am very impressed with how they work together and will definitely continue to purchase these items!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for free. All opinions are my own and are my honest thoughts on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t bad, or especially good. It was simply ok. It smoothed into my hair and washed out nicely. The scent was a pleasant, fresh, lemon. I much preferred the Intensive Treatment as my hair felt significantly slicker and more well-conditioned after that. This is not an every day kind of product for me. It&#x27;s maybe a once a week as a break from my normal shampoo or to remove any intense hair product build up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally picky about my conditioner, but this is acceptable. I have mostly straight, relatively healthy shoulder length hair of average thickness, and this did a nice job keeping the tangles out and leaving my hair soft. The scent is botanical, but more sharp than floral, and doesn&#x27;t linger (that I could tell). I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my fine, thin hair very soft and manageable. The smell was very pleasant. It is your typical conditioner.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample to review from Influenster and I have to say, although not a fan of ginger nor its smell (its heavy in in) the way it made my hair feel almost instantly was totally worth it. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos which is a good sign, and my hair felt awakened and healthy again. The conditioner is super creamy and my hair ate it up happily. Its a clear crisp smell, light on lather, and felt so light as opposed to other products. The deep conditioner is my favorite, as it seems my hair has been craving it for years. I definitely recommend this product to those of you who use a lot of product and/or color your hair as this set gives love back to your hair.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this collection to review. I had very damaged hair from bleaching it and was skeptical that this would help. I usually use deep conditioners and expensive shampoos, but these products actually worked really well! As with all Herbal Essences products, the scent was really nice. A light, fruity/floral smell that stays even after you wash it off. My hair felt better and cleaner after I dried it. Good product.</li>
            <li> This product of HERBAL ESSENCES Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo and Detoxifying Conditioner was very different to me from the smell, to the function. I like this conditioner very much because it did not make my hair feel heavy but it did make my hair feel soft. I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of this particular product because it did not give me that &amp;#34;yes yes yes YES&amp;#34; kind of vibes.. I use a lot of this brand hair products very much and is excited for what much more products would be evolved. However this product made my scalpel feel cool and minty with a kick of citrus or tea scent which was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this product to try only because it&#x27;s herbal essences and everything of this product works for a reason and every individual has their own unique options to many more of herbal essences products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for more new products ^.^</li>
            <li> My daughter has been gifted with tangly hair. I feel as though I am ill equipped to deal with this. I am jealous of all the parents of girls with straight hair, how nice for you. My daughters curls get tangled like crazy. So my solution is to lather on conditioner in the shower and then brush it through, it is the best way to get the snarls out without tears, so I go through a lot of conditioner. I like the scent of this one and it does its job of detangling the nest. Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling soft but not too &#x27;conditioned&#x27;. Had a light, nice scent. I like the natural elements as well! Overall good product and would recommend!</li>
            <li> This was even better than the shampoo! It made my hair feel so silky and shined like crazy!! I love it so much! I received it in a Voxbox and was so happy to get it! Thank you Influenster!</li>
            <li> Good conditioner with interesting texture. Definitely made it seen natural with the texture. I&#x27;m obsessed with the scent of this collection.</li>
            <li> I particulary like the crisp clean smell of this conditioner.  The lemony smell is subtly sharp and combines with the basil to make a nice refreshing aroma.  Otherwise, it does everything I&#x27;m looking for in a conditioner.  My hair feels supple, healthy and clean and it does not effect the curliness of my hair when I apply gel.  All in all I really like this conditioner, but the scent is my favorite part.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like the unique Thai Lemon Basil scent. I don&#x27;t think it is for everone though, and perhaps it is better suited for male users. So that knocks off a star. Also it is not an overly powerful conditioner. Wild Naturals is certainly not a &amp;#34;Deeply Renewing&amp;#34; conditioner, even left on hair for a while before rinsing. It is fine for me to use as a single conditioning treatement between shampooings, since the trend nowadays is not to wash your hair too much. My wife has conditioning treatments that work much better and more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would put Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying on the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; end of conditioners that I&#x27;ve used over the years. It leaves the hair soft, managable and touchable, but not &amp;#34;deeply renewed&amp;#34; as the packaging states. Results may vary with hair type though. As for me, I have fairly thick hair and it does a fair job of conditioning if left in for about 5 minutes while in a hot shower and not overly rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this conditioner is the scent.  You can definitely smell the lemon basil in this detoxifying conditioner.  Leaves your hair soft and tangle free.  In my situation it seems it is more difficult to flat iron my hair after using this product.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get as straight, even though I use the same straightening spray as I had been using.  Not sure why, and I&#x27;ve used this for a week now, so it&#x27;s not a one time thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a LONG time since I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences hair care products.  I remember LOVING their products in high school because the potent, floral scents.  However, as I became older and more experienced in taking care of my hair I quickly realized that not all drug store products were great for the health of my hair.  I started being more selective about the brands I would buy and eventually, moved on to using salon products exclusively.  I was curious to try this to see how Herbal Essences might have evolved since my earlier experiences with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this, I don&#x27;t love it for my hair type.  My hair gets bleached and toned 4-5 times a year and I also regularly heat style.  Combine that with the current dry winter conditions and I need a pretty rich conditioner to keep my hair feeling and looking soft and healthy.  This conditioner was just not rich enough for my needs.  That said, I could see if being perfect for someone whose hair is already quite healthy and doesn&#x27;t need a lot of help from hair products to lock in moisture and ward off damage.  Especially for people who many not want to spend the money on salon and specialty haircare brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also less clear on the benefit of &#x27;detoxification&#x27; for a conditioner. Based on how they talk about it on their website, it sounds to me like the Detoxifying line is all about what I would normally refer to as clarifying products, designed to break down and remove styling products from the hair.  However, I normally associate this with shampoo and wasn&#x27;t clear from everything I looked into what the benefit would be of having a clarifying conditioner.  Perhaps that it doesn&#x27;t a lot of residue to your hair contributing to build up?  From both reading the product information and trying the product I wasn&#x27;t clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I was pleasantly surprised with the smell.  Compared to the Herbal Essences products I remember the scent is a lot more subtle and less artificial smelling.  I liked that it wasn&#x27;t extremely floral-y.  The lemon basil and cassia flower were quite pleasant smelling to me and reminded me a lot of the way spas normally smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this isn&#x27;t the ideal conditioner for my hair type and needs, but I can see where someone else would like this a lot.</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times just to give it the benefit of the doubt. I also made sure each time that I was THOROUGHLY rinsing every drop of it out of my hair but each time it left my hair so dull, flat, and oily that I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it again. The scent was nice, but it was too light of a scent for my liking. I like something that will leave my hair smelling nice for a while but this didn&#x27;t come anywhere near that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this conditioner. I have long baby fine hair, which tends to easily get split ends and break easily. My hair has also been color treated before. When I first tried this I didn&#x27;t think I liked it as the texture is a bit thin and I had to use quite a bit of it as I have very long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Though, after a few days of use, it really has made my damaged hair look better and it has made it very soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I love the scent of this conditioner, it&#x27;s nice and lemony with some green notes. I will definitely buy this conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I have to use all natural products due to an allergy to sulfates but sometimes those products really dry my hair out. I am happy with Herbal Essences new product Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner for it has a light lemon scent and it did condition my hair more than my Organix conditioner. Easy to put on and just as easy to wash out and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy and dry. I do wish it had more body added but it is definitely more moisture and anti frizz than Organix. I still have to add dry oil to my hair for that extra shiny look but instead of adding extra hydration sprays it seems like Herbal Essences it the mark for people like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are stuck with special conditioners due to allergies and you feel that your conditioner just doesn&#x27;t do it for you... I suggest trying this one out. It worked for me and it might work for you.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does its job. My hair is smooth, silky, and soft. I love that it didn&#x27;t weight down my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the strength of the scent. Other than that, I would purchase this product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer- I was sent this product for free to test and review.*</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing! I used it after using the Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo and my hair feels so soft and clean. The scent is a crisp, fresh scent. I did receive this as a sample to test and review for free.</li>
            <li> I just tried the herbal essence natural wild conditioner this week as a sample/tester from Influenster and I am in love! Not only does it perfume your shower with this amazing scent, but your hair feels soft and healthy all day! I use this with the additional conditioner daily. It is perfect for the dry winters here in Colorado. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft that you can&#x27;t style it but it does make it look smooth and silky but not weighted down. It is the perfect recipe for great a great hair day!</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample to review, and I was pleasantly surprised! I have thinner hair that tends to get weighed down very easily, so I like clarifying or detoxifying products to reset my hair every once in a while. This conditioner left my hair feeling very light and smelled great.</li>
            <li> I had the luxury of testing both the Herbal Essences Conditioner and the Shampoo given to me by Influenster for testing purposes only. I have to say, before I used this product I had very dry and dead hair with lots of spilt ends, but after a couple of uses I noticed a change in my hair. My hair felt healthier than ever and it felt like I had just stepped out of a salon! My hair was softer and shinier within a few days and I have to say this product is a great finish to the detoxifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> Product was very thin, which I don&#x27;t usually like in a conditioner. The smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as the shampoo so it really didn&#x27;t have that going for it either. I used the treatment condition right after so I can&#x27;t say how it performs on its own as a conditioner. In whole though my hair has been wonderfully soft from root to tip. I&#x27;m an avid dove user and my hair has never felt this amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I received a trial size sample of this conditioner. The conditioner is thick, but when I rinsed it out I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth or as moisturized as it is with other products. I think this conditioner may be better for people with finer hair versus dry, curly hair. I will say I liked the scent. I will pass this along to a friend to see what they think of it.</li>
            <li> I have been given a small sample of this line from influenster to try.  I have naturally thin hair so i dont usually use alot of conditioner cause it weighs my hair down. And this is the same. Definetly weighs it down. Its smells great though!</li>
            <li> I also recieved this complimentary from the Influenster team.  I can&#x27;t use both this and the intense conditioner though as it makes my hair stuff. I have naturally oily hair. But alone with the shampoo this conditioner works amazing and it Smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> I received this product free as part of the Influenster program. I have very fine, straight, fluffy hair that gets weighed down and greasy easily, I have been using this conditioner daily for over a week now and while I love the shampoo and Intensive Treatment, I was less than thrilled by the conditioner. It smells great but it is very thin and watery. I understand that this is a detoxifying product and is designed to not weigh down hair or over-condition but the thin consistency makes it almost impossible to work through my hair without using a ton of it. I still use it, I just put the same amount in my hand as I do the shampoo and just try to get it worked into the roots at the front of my hair and then use the Intensive Treatment on the rest.</li>
            <li> Pros  -Loved the scent. Very relaxing and refreshing.   -Cleaned my hair and did not leave it feeling greasy at all.  -Rinsed out easily.  -Good price point for conditioner and hair products.   Cons -Conditioner was a bit runny and looked watered down compared to other products I have used  Disclaimer: I received this as a free sample product from influenster.com.</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff, you should use the conditioner and the intensive treatment along with the shampoo. My hair was clean, soft , smelled nice and had a nice shine to it...I received these products for free thru Influenster. I&#x27;m a black woman and these products were a nice surprise, my hair is fine and dry and using these products was a plus, didn&#x27;t strip my hair dry. My hair feels good and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Leaves hair smelling good and light</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in order to try it and give my opinions. I also received the shampoo and the intensive treatment from this Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection. While I liked the other two in this collection, I did not like the conditioner. The formula was way too thin and I had to use so much to actually coat my hair, and afterwards it didn&#x27;t leave my hair with the silky feeling I like when using conditioner. The next day I tried the shampoo and conditioner WITH the intensive treatment - what a difference! I loved the treatment and almost felt like the conditioner was an unnecessary step. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the conditioner again until they change the formula. I&#x27;m not sure if the treatment can/should be used everyday, but shampoo + treatment would be an economical choice since I don&#x27;t feel like the conditioner added much.</li>
            <li> Nice, lightweight conditioner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of the Herbal Essence line and this one is another great addition to it. The smell is fantastic and the scent stays in my hair throughout the day. I don&#x27;t need to use that much to get it all the way through my hair which is pretty long and thick. Sometimes I feel like there&#x27;s an oily residue in my hair after using some conditioners but I don&#x27;t get that with this one. Well done!</li>
            <li> I received this to try for free and review. I really enjoyed this conditioner. It smelled great and it left my hair soft. I tried it after I washed my hair with their matching shampoo. I would grab about a quarter size amount since I have long fine curly/wavy hair and rubbing it into my hair.  I would then wait a few minutes while I washed my body and rinse it out. My only problem was that it was a bit watery compared to my regular conditioner i use.</li>
            <li> I loved the conditioner from this line, the smell is just amazing and fresh! I was able to try this product for free from my Herbal Essence Voxbox from Influenster. I would definitely buy this product for myself.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences has three lines of their Wild Naturals product, &amp;#34;Illuminating,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Detoxifying,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Rejuvenating.&amp;#34; The illuminating line is designed to make your hair shinier and has a strong fruity berry scent. The detoxifying line softens hair and has a lemon basil smell. Rejuvenating is meant to restore vitality to hair and has a turkish fig scent. I tried the Illuminating shampoo followed by the detoxifying conditioner. The conditioner is a fairly thin white liquid that goes into the hair easily. You&#x27;ll need a little more than the usual conditioner amount since this product runs a little more thin than typical for a conditioner. But it remains in the hair well for the usual few minutes before rinsing. The lemon basil scent is a very nice herbal smell that is pleasant to use. My hair feels clean and soft, as expected. While you&#x27;re probably expected to use the shampoo and conditioner from the same brand line, I actually followed the illuminating shampoo with the detoxifying conditioner. Although the scents are quite different, my hair is not confused and came out of the shampoo/conditioner process in great condition overall. You may wish to pick depending on the scent rather than on the branding line. There is also an oil elixir from each of the three lines, and again you can pick the one you want based on scent since that&#x27;s the final scent that will remain in your hair through the day.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner with a lingering, strong scent of passionfruit.  Although it is touted as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; the list of unpronounceables on the label is extensive.  I have long, fine hair, tending to oily.  This conditioner was light, left my hair feeling very clean and rinsed out easily.  It loses a star because although it is a good detangler, it is not great.  And I prefer a conditioner without a strong, lingering scent.</li>
            <li> This has a fresh  somewhat unusual scent and conditions nicely. Any claims of &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; are of course ridiculous.  Also the description strongly implies it is natural,  which it is not.  Or wild. This brand has really gone over the top with meaningless and misleading descriptors. But I still like it for what it is - a decent modestly priced conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed in using this product after the coordinating shampoo. The shampoo smelled great, while this one was not such a pleasant scent. It worked well enough for my hair, and I am always on the look out for the best conditioners. I&#x27;m not sure this is the best one for me, but not a bad product. I received a free sample from Influenster!</li>
            <li> I received Herbal Essences Wild Naturals conditioner as well as the shampoo as a free trial to test and review from Influenster. I really wanted to like it, since I have liked other Herbal Essences products in the past, but this conditioner just didn&#x27;t seem to cut it for me. Of course, my hair is very oily and finnicky, so many products don&#x27;t work well on it. The conditioner felt lightweight at first, but throughout the day, my hair started to feel oily. It even made my face oily from touching it. It also didn&#x27;t condition it all that well; it was still a bit tangled and frizzy. I wanted to like it, I really did!</li>
            <li> Have not used Herbal essence products in several years but I tried the Herbal Essence Wild Naturals and I think that I have made a mistake not using Herbal Essence for so long!  The shampoo lathered wonderfully and the conditioner is light so your hair is not weighed down.  Also the scent is lite but still smells fantastic!  Will definitely purchase this product!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice conditioner, and it works quite well!! It smells great and left my hair very soft. Works great with the wilds shampoo as well. The scent also lasts for a good while. I would recommend both if you aren&#x27;t someone that is looking for sulfate and paraben free products.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to test and review and I am very pleased! This conditioner smells great and leaves my hair super soft and manageable! I&#x27;m not quite sure how it detoxifies, but it did leave my hair silky smooth and easy to brush after I used it. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would buy it and recommend it to someone who was looking for a good smelling conditioner that isn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
            <li> Really liked this conditioner, along with the shampoo it left me hair feeling silky smooth, and does not seem to leave any build up on my hair! My only complaint is that it gives my hair zero volume. Which is good on some days and not so much on others. Not to mention i got this for free to test and review!</li>
            <li> I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review! I have naturally staight hair and it was a very nice conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too heavy but it left my hair feeling very moisturized and smelling great!</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d a deluxe sample of this to try free from influenster in my VoxBox and I love the way it smells and makes my hair feel so soft.  Will definitely be buying this in the future!  Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong. Over all my hair is clean, but I am not any more in love with it then any other drug store conditioner. I used Dove before and will most likely go back to it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample package of this from influenster &amp; I really liked the shampoo. I have natural 4a kinky curly hair &amp; it left my hair feeling really clean &amp; strong (the cassia extract) but without leaving it with that stripped feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner was ok. It did have slip so I was able to detangle very quickly and easily, and my hair was very soft but strong and not overly mushy at all. The only minus is that there was no sustaining moisture when my hair dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care much for the elixir. I read the ingredients beforehand and saw that it had silicones. I&#x27;m not against silicones at all but I saw that isopropyl myristate was high up on the ingredient list. Companies use it in serums so that your hair isn&#x27;t left with that greasy feeling but I knew that it dries my hair out from having seen that ingredient in other products. I decided to try it out anyway because every companies formulation is different. It dried my hair up sooo much and left it tangled. I decided to rinse my hair and deep condition but that did nothing so I had to shampoo &amp; deep condition all over again to get that product off of my hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is great.  I love that the conditioner feels thick and silky in my hands.  I like the way it works through my hair.  This conditioner is better suited for people with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair.  My hair is very fine and I have to use volumizing products or my hair is limp and hard to style.  I would not be able to use this conditioner every day.  It would be great to use with the shampoo as a once a month treatment for my hair, but I would not be able to use it every day.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I like to use this shampoo and conditioner to remove buildup from other products I use. I use a couple of times per week.</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection is nothing short of wonderful.  received the whole collection (shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment) free to review from Influenster/VoxBox and I am so pleasantly surprised by this system.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is as equally satisfying as the shampoo. I was concerned at first that I would not benefit from a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; and smooth as other products I have used in the past. It feels lightweight and is easy to rinse out. Brushing through the tangles was easier..but the real result was once I dried my hair. My hair remained lightweight, shiny and SO FREAKING SOFT.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my hair smells throughout the day...and can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! A little went a long way. Left my hair feeling smooth, tangle-free and smelled great! In the past, i&#x27;ve had trouble with conditioners leaving my hair greasy, but this washed out of my hair well and I noticed my hair had more bounce after using.</li>
            <li> Feels lovely after shampoo.  I use very little so the scent doesn&#x27;t overwhelm me in the shower.  Once my hair is dry, the hint of lemon is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was sent this conditioner to try along with the shampoo and deep conditioner. I LOVE the scent of this conditioner. I find it&#x27;s a nice light conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down. I was able to easily comb through hair after showering, which was nice as I often have to add a detangling product. All in all this is probably just an average conditioner, however I really liked the results I got with my particular hair type when using this with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used this condition just as I wouldve any other and was highly dissatisfied with it. The conditioner was very watery and I didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything at all for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner. I use it on my non-shampoo days, so every other day, as a maintenance conditioner. I have shoulder length fine hair. I am prone to flyaways. This conditioner helps to keep my hair silky and smooth between shampoo days. It keeps my hair nice and soft and tame. I love the smell as well. It&#x27;s a natural lemongrass scent and to be honest, I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. I used it with the shampoo as well. It left my hair smelling nice and clean. Afterwards my hair had a nice shine to it and also was super soft. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received a complementary sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo, conditioner,  and the Intensive Treatment cream from influenster.com for testing purposes and I absolutely LOVE the smell of these products!! The shampoo was thick and lathered nicely and it left my hair clean, fresh and shiny! The conditioner definitely works because my hair was super soft immediately after I rinsed out the product! Now the intensive cream is to keep the frizzies away and my hair is always frizzy and it seems like no matter what I use nothing works! But this Intensive Cream will definitely will become a regular part of my daily hair care routine because is works! All in all these products are AMAZING and I would recommend them to EVERYONE!!</li>
            <li> I got the shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment for testing purposes and I liked them Okay. The conditioner made my hair heavy and look oily even though I just washed it. It all smells very good.  I loved the intensive treatment. I could tell a huge difference in the texture of my hair after I rinsed it out. It was great!</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner to test but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it. It really is just a conditioner. The shampoo takes frizz better than the conditioner. The only plus is the great smell.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this conditioner. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioner but it&#x27;s great! It smells wonderful, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair uber greasy like some other conditioners I have used. I have thin hair so it&#x27;s hard to find a good conditioner but this one worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!!! I got a free sample to test and review from vox box along with the shampoo and intensive treatment. I had to go out the next day and purchase the full size bottle! It makes your hair feel clean without feeling &#x27;too clean.&#x27; It does not strip it of any needed nutrients it needs. It made my hair very manageable. I didn&#x27;t even need to use the leave in conditioner I normally do after washing my hair. It also smells great which is a plus for me. Not to mention it is very affordable! I would definitely reccomend this conditioner to anyone!</li>
            <li> The scent is my favorite thing, along with just the right amount of hydration for my thin hair. I received the trio of cassia and lemon basil Wild Naturals products for free to review, and am happy with the results. My thin hair needs hydration to keep from frizzing but it&#x27;s a delicate balance to keep it frizz free without ending up weighed down. The lemon scent is a great pick-me-up right now with winter dragging on!</li>
            <li> Four stars for this rockstar! My hair was so soft I was in love! What a great weightless conditioner. I have ultra fine hair so I&#x27;m always hesitant on the conditioners I use. AMAZING! Love how soft my hair was and how it didn&#x27;t feel weighed down. I would definitely recommend this conditioner to people with fine or lifeless hair. Received this beauty from influenster!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this conditioner from influenster and I love it. I like the smell and my hair looks better than normal after using it and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the best option for thin, fine hair. My hair felt clean, but was limp and lifeless. Half way through the day my hair had gone flat and was in my face.</li>
            <li> I really like the floral, citrus smell because itâ€™s not overpowering. However, this conditioner had a runny consistency. I had to use quite a bit more than I normally would and it still didnâ€™t seem to do a very good job. I highly doubt I will be purchasing this product in the future. I used this product for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;** I was given a complimentary sample to test and review. **</li>
            <li> I have used Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner, which is a product I received free to test and review, for a few weeks and it has worked wonders! Not to mention it smells delicious. The texture is creamy and light which makes your hair feels soft, airy, and of course, extremely clean! My hair has been super manageable since the first day. it was the best experience I&#x27;ve had in a long time. This is my favorite hair conditioner hands down. I recommend you use it with the shampoo for extremely great results.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture. Feels really luxurious. Kept my hair feeling soft all day and I have really dry and damaged ends from chemical processing... Overall great product!</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner made my hair really feel brand new. The complimentary sample I got via Influenster will definitely have me coming back for more!</li>
            <li> I am not a big user of conditioners, so when I do use one it really needs to fit my needs for me to even bother. Most of the time when I even use a little conditioner my hair gets greasy so there are only a few brands I use. When I received a free sample to try and review I was quite skeptical that I would like it, but I do. I like how thin of a product it is, it doesn&#x27;t cake my hair or make it oily. Glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I was given this item for free from influenster to test and write a review. Over all I am extremely happy with this line of products. The scent is amazing and last for hours, one of the things I really like. I can tell that my hair is happy, my curls are nice and soft and the fizz is reduced well. My teen likes it as well and she is extremely prickly about her hair care practices! I would absolutely purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this free to test out, and I like the shampoo better than the matching conditioner. I don&#x27;t like the scent of it, but this conditioner does not lather my hair very well. The matching intensive treatment works way better, of course, but I will definitely not purchase this one. It just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to lather my fine, easily-tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner after using the matching shampoo and conditioning treatment.  It left my hair silky and smooth.  The only down side was that my hair had a bit less body than usual- it may have weighed my hair down a bit.  Overall, I recommend it.  I received a free trial of this product to review.</li>
            <li> I got the conditioner for free from Influenster! This is a great conditioner. This conditioner made my hair silky smooth. It also added much needed shine and volume to my usual flat, unvolumized hair. My tangles were also more manageable due to the greatness of the conditioner! A great bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner as a free sample from Influenster to try and review. I have to say I am very happy with tis product.  It has a great lemony scent that I really enjoy.  The conditioner makes my hair really soft and shiny.  I have very fine hair and this does not weigh it down at all.  My hair is really full and the fullness lasts all day.  I have a huge problem with fly aways and static in the cold and dry winter months and this has really helped that.  I will definitely be using this conditioner.  Thanks Influenster!</li>
            <li> I received this to try from inflencter. I found this product to have a light scent and I found my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down by the product. I found It left my hair manageable but no more than my current shampoo.  I did find the conditioner to be light weight and didn&#x27;t leave a residue behind.</li>
            <li> Received the conditioner in the mail as a sample from influenster and did not like anything about it other than the smell! Hair did not feel soft and silky like it normally does after I wash and dry it! Was really disappointed in the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d the complete set of these as part of my last Vox Box. So far, I&#x27;m really enjoying them. To me, they have a nice citrus scent - almost grapefruit. Its very energizing. I have very dry, straight hair and these made them feel soft - especially the dry oil spray. The only reason I am giving this line 4 stars instead of 5 is b/c I thought the conditioner could have been a little thicker/creamer. I felt like you NEEDED (or at least I needed) the dry oil to supplement the conditioner. I&#x27;d buy these, though.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!  I received this conditioner as a free sample to try from Influenster and I was so excited to try it!  BUT, I was really disappointed.  My hair is fine and this conditioner left it greasy, weighed down and gross. It might be better suited for other hair types than mine.  Also, the shampoo had this great, light citrus scent but the conditioner just smelled blah!  Unimpressive!</li>
            <li> Free and it is amazing... definitely going to buy this product again my hair feels fantastic thank you Influenster and herbal essences</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this conditioner out for free! I used it in combination with the intensive treatment and shampoo. I loved the clean, citrusy smell of the products and felt it left my hair clean and soft and gave it lightweight feeling. Overall I am happy with the results from this product!</li>
            <li> I received complimentary bottles of the shampoo, conditioner and the deep conditioning treatment. I love how well the shampoo works and also love the fragrance. The conditioner did not work well for me but the deep conditioning kind was amazing!! I&#x27;ll be buying the shampoo, skipping the regular conditioner and will most definately buy the deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed how silky the conditioner made my hair feel and took away my frizzes.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample to try. I loved the shampoo but was not so much in love with the conditioner. Although it smelt great and my hair feels somewhat  soft? It did nothing much for my hair no deep detox, no deep conditioning And it most definitely does not help untangle long hair. I would say it&#x27;s more like an average conditioner with great smell.</li>
            <li> Used this after shampooing and my hair feels and smells great!</li>
            <li> I got a travel size supply of this from Influnester.com in the mail! it smells so great! the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t work the best with my hair type which is curly. other than that it is a great product and i would recommen!!</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner free to test and review the product and while I did enjoy the scent I was less than thrilled with the results.  I didnt feel that my hair was as easy to comb through as with my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like it so far. I&#x27;ve only used it once, and my hair is so far so good. My hair is really smooth and free of friz so far, waiting to see if my hair becomes oily or not. Can&#x27;t wait to see if these really turn out well. I recieved a small/medium sized product but am pleased with the size. I think I&#x27;ll love to have this and the conditioner for travels.</li>
            <li> Tried this in conjunction with the detoxifying shampoo as I received it as a product free to test and review.  I typically shy away from using too much conditioner, as I feel it makes my hair feel heavy and oily at the end of the day.  The detoxifying conditioners tend to be much easier on my hair, and this one is about the same as any other conditioner I have tried.  The good news is that I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on conditioner to get the results that I am after.  It does smell pretty fantastic and I could still smell it at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I received this Wild Naturals Detoxifying set for testing purposes and I love it. I love the Lemon basil with cassia flower sent. I feel like I am at a spa when I use it. The sent is so refreshing that it makes me feel relaxed. After a long day, I enjoy using this product so I can relax. I have hard water; however it leaves my hair feeling soft. I will be buying all three: the shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Shannon</li>
            <li> *I received this conditioner in an Influenster box for free in exchange for my review*&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed regarding this conditioner was how awesome it smelled.  The smell is not overpowering on your hair all day.  I do not like conditioner that has a very strong scent all day.  The scent was subtle and lovely throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner was very thick and felt nice on my hair.  It also washed out nicely as well and left my hair feeling very soft.  This product did not give my hair much volume - but that was not what it was designed to do, so I didn&#x27;t expect it.&lt;br /&gt;I only wash my hair twice a week, and my hair still feels soft three days after I washed it, which isn&#x27;t something that all conditioners can do.&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly use the rest of my sample bottles, and look for this conditioner when shopping in the future.  :)</li>
            <li> I recently got this product to test and review from influenster. I have to say that the shampoo was really good but I was no happy with the conditioner. It was not very thick and ran right off of my hand. It did not leave my hair feeling very soft like I would expect. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy and use this conditioner on my own.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo - I received it as a trial product through influenster.  The main thing is that it did not make me break out.  I have sensitive skin and am always worried new products will cause breakouts and this did not. I will definitely be adding this to my haircare regimen!! The conditioner left my hair shiny and soft - I have platinum bleached blonde hair so conditioner is important and this did the job.</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner along with shampoo complementary from Influenster and together they made my hair feel and look great! My hair was left feeling so soft and it was not frizzy after blow drying it! I would definitely recommend it to anyone!  &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product was sent to be for review by VoxBox. When I first applied this to my hair it felt super light weight so I assumed that this was a shampoo meant to give body and not moisturize too much. I was so surprised at how intensely it moisturized my hair! I also really love the smell, it&#x27;s a very unisex scent and is not super feminine like many hair products. The smell is light, herbally, and has a hint of basil. It&#x27;s a nice scent for the spring. The smell lingers for a little while but is not strong at all. I enjoyed this conditioner but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it has any kind of &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good i just wished it was so liquidy but it was good it left my hair soft</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  I gave it three stars; very nice product for the price point.  Left hair soft and smells amazing but my hair became very oily by the end of the day, which does not happen with my normal regimen.</li>
            <li> I received a mini version of this conditioner to review and I found using it to be a pleasant experience. I really love the fresh, lemony scent and the fact that the conditioner is pretty lightweight once my hair dries. I have shoulder length, fine hair and this conditioned my hair enough but didn&#x27;t weigh it down. I don&#x27;t think this would be effective for longer hair that tends to get more tangled simply because it is not conditioning enough for more extreme cases.</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner for free as part of the Influenster testing program. I was not as satisfied with the results of this product. It works, but takes a large amount to actually cover your hair, as the products consistency is not thick enough. It does not work like a normal conditioner since it is intended to detoxify your hair rather than weigh it down, but it should still provide some additional moisture since it is a conditioner...</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and am trying to find a cheaper conditioner alternative than my DevaCurl One Condition. I would not recommend this specifically for curly hair types but a standard conditioner for anyone. I use product, gels, oils, creams in my hair and after using the Detoxifying Conditioner with my shampoo my hair felt what I consider squeaky clean. The scent is like an herbal lemon and I love it.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent but once I used it in the shower for the first time the smell was lovely.  It was much softer in the shower than smelling it straight out of the bottle.  As always, herbal essences did an amazing job smoothing out and conditioning my hair!  Love!</li>
            <li> AMMY has recently given me the opportunity to test out&lt;br /&gt;HERBAL ESSENCES [[ASIN:B00OP25LBW Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo]] and [[ASIN:B00OP25Z2C Detoxifying Conditioner]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is a clear liquid with a distinct aroma of grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;Their milky conditioner has a strong lemon scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount of shampoo quickly works into a thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing it out the hair is impressively thicker in volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is instantly swallowed up by the hair, which is&lt;br /&gt;later left tangle-free and easy to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result: clean hair with a slight citrus perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put: HERBAL ESSENCES is very good stuff!</li>
            <li> *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes*&lt;br /&gt;I found this conditioner on it&#x27;s own to be quite runny, which made me very skeptical as to how good of a product it is. The scent is very nice and fresh, but it&#x27;s not a scent for a hair product I would have chosen on my own. In combination with the Intensive Treatment, I found that this did make my hair significantly more manageable, as it is prone to tangles, but also left it limp prior to my typical overnight styling technique of leaving my hair in braids. I imagine if you have thicker hair than I do (mine is quite fine) that you&#x27;ll find this to be much less heavy on your hair. If you aren&#x27;t already using a sulfate-free conditioner, I would definitely suggest using this one, but if you&#x27;re already using one you love, skip it and just spring for the Intensive Treatment.</li>
            <li> I was given an opportunity to test the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo, Conditioner, and Deep Conditioner. I am impressed. The whole line left my hair clean and feeling soft. I found a little of the shampoo goes a long way. Had to use extra with the conditioner. The deep conditioner had a strong smell first going on but after evened out. It does still have a nice smell. I would use it.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this product to try and used it this morning. My hair has been on the dry, frizzy side lately, and I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth and silky my hair feels today after just one use! I also used the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensice treatment and shampoo. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> What you get:&lt;br /&gt;An easy to open bottle of nice smelling conditioner that makes your hair feel smooth but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essences Wild Naturals has created what they call a detoxifying conditioner - this variety with the scent of thai lemon basil essences. Although I wasn&#x27;t aware that my hair was toxic, this product will apparently take care of that in a jiffy. I really can&#x27;t speak to the detoxification aspect because I haven&#x27;t done a chemical analysis of my hair&#x27;s current state, but what I can tell you is that this conditioner makes my hair feel soft and smooth and not greasy or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the fragrance - it&#x27;s light and not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I took a bath in perfume - it&#x27;s pleasing, at the right level for both men and women (I think), and doesn&#x27;t linger excessively during the day. But wow it sure does smell nice in the heat of a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very easy to open - which is something I always look for. The top of the bottle flips open without any difficulty and the product comes out with a gentle tilt and squeeze of the bottle. I&#x27;ve also given it a little shake to get the product down near the opening and it seems to move freely within the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the consistency you&#x27;d expect from conditioner - no real difference there from any other product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When measuring the success of a conditioner my biggest need is that my hair should not feel oily or greasy afterward, it washes out cleanly, and my hair is soft. Herbal Essences gets a solid 4 stars for all of those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product recommends pairing it with the HE Detoxifying Shampoo, which I haven&#x27;t done. I&#x27;ve never really felt the need to match up my brands as long as each product works well individually, which I feel this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For pleasing fragrance, ease of use (and opening), and how it makes my hair feel, I&#x27;ll give this product a solid 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Im not a huge fan of this product. I received a free travel size bottle in a voxbox. The smell is pretty nice but it really doesn&#x27;t live up to other conditioners that I have used. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair silky soft like other products. I probably will not be purchasing this product in the future even tho it is affordable.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of this product to try for free, Not the worst conditioner i have ever tried but not my favorite. my hair didn&#x27;t feel any better than when i use any other conditioner. The smell is pleasant but i probably wouldn&#x27;t reach for this at the store. I look for more natural ingredients and better outcome in my conditioners.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essesnce Wild Naturals Detoxifying  Conditioner was very smooth and smelled great! Thanks to @Influester who provided me with a free sample! Intense soothing smell makes you feel like your scalp is exfoliating!</li>
            <li> Received this in a VoxBox to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine curly hair and I really enjoyed this product. It removed all of the product build up without making my hair dry and gross. Would definitely purchase!</li>
            <li> I recently received this item for free to test and review it. I love the scent of this line. It is so fresh and clean and invigorating. The texture of this product is great! Its light and fluffy and just feeling it you can tell that its going to do a great job moisturizing without completely weighing your hair down. I used this product in conjunction with the detoxifying shampoo and together they are a great combination! This conditioner really helped calm my hair down and made it feel so much healthier. And I could still blow dry and curl it without it feeling to weighted. I really enjoyed this product!</li>
            <li> Conditioner is hard for me to find because my hair tangles so easy. This works great and smells fantastic</li>
            <li> Clean fresh scent and a good product. Not the best for someone with very dry hair but overall a decent conditioner</li>
            <li> I received my Herbal Essence Wild Naturals complimentary from Influenster to review. My hair is dry and brittle and it soaked up this conditioner like a sponge leaving it soft and manageable without weighing my hair down. The smell was fresh and clean, lemon with a hint of ginger, very refreshing. I&#x27;ll be buying this lineup of shampoo conditioner and intense treatment, excellent for damaged hair!!</li>
            <li> Influenster has recently given me the opportunity to test and review Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner. I have to say- this conditioner is not exciting. It smells pleasant- not overwhelming and very up-to-date scents. However- the conditioner left my normally curly hair very limp and lifeless. It didn&#x27;t add anything. I wont be purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product via Influenster for review and I used it in conjunction with the other products in this line. It has the same refreshing smell as the shampoo, and seemed to do a decent job of conditioning, but the product itself just seemed a little &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; as far as conditioners go. Maybe that&#x27;s the detoxifying aspect of it, but it was a touch unsettling in terms of texture. But it did condition my hair without weighting it down and it did have a nice fragrance. I would buy it.</li>
