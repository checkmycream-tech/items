            <li>/&gt;First, I was introduced to BECCA brush by the &#x27;pros&#x27; at Ulta, and I swear these girls know how to make ANY product seem magical like unicorn</li>
            <li>I was looking for a brush that can go from blush/contour/bronzer to safe time in my AM makeup routine.  </li>
            <li>it is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a better makeup brush.  </li>

            <li>The concept of the brush is fabulous, but the SHEDDING is out of control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re held in place using Elmer&#x27;s glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re held in place using Elmer&#x27;s glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t cleaned it yet, because I don&#x27;t have any baby shampoo in the house (can&#x27;t use just anything to clean it)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it all that special</li>
            <li>I love how much coverage the brush provides when applying my powder foundation.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s one of the other great things about this brush</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use any other face brushes which is very nice.</li>
            <li>I washed alot of videos on how exactly to use this brush, the care and maintenance of it, along with what it can do and alot of make up tutorials on YouTube , along with the reviews of the product on there.!</li>
            <li>One of the bristles came off on my face while I was being made up, and I still loved my eco tools, so I wasn&#x27;t ready to fork over the extra money for it</li>
            <li>Bristles are super soft and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I.e. I am right handed, so doing the right side of my face, I struggled with blending more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using it consistently since then.</li>
            <li>this after the first use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of odd.</li>
            <li>Super soft and glides over your skin</li>
            <li>I really do like this brush, i use it every day for foundation and bronzer.</li>
            <li>i always wonder... is this product real?</li>
            <li>and you will know that it is real.</li>
            <li>Just wish it didn&#x27;t shed as much.  </li>
            <li>and the brushes are like brand new again and ready for a powder product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend watching the how to video.</li>
            <li>I also know this brush is perfect for going from wet to dry, and back to wet again in fast succession without clumping or messing up the coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>market this brush as the &#x27;be all end all&#x27; so that you need no other brushes.</li>
            <li>again.you need no other brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t brush hard, I do a light sweep</li>
            <li>First, the bristles did shed, but it seemed to subside some, plus I was wearing makeup less as it was summertime and all melting off in the heat anyway.</li>
            <li>I tried using it in that way, and there are some MAJOR execution flaws, especially, again, for those of use with liquid (or mousse) foundation and then powder to set.</li>

            <li> i&#x27;m having a problem with this brush exfoliating my skin a little too much and making it flaky.</li>
            <li> Have NO idea how it&#x27;s not bare by now</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to set it down in order to extract these stray bristles from your face without having to put the brush on its side, which means you&#x27;re exposing the currently foundation covered bristles to a surface such as a car seat, a bathroom counter, or a makeup vanity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was $50+ dollars down the drain, and I didn&#x27;t realize it until about 4.5 weeks later.</li>
            <li> then it just sinks?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for liquid foundation anymore due to shed issues.  </li>
            <li> It sheds so much to render is totally useless.</li>
            <li> Considering I use the expensive stuff, that was really irritating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> down</li>
            <li> I have cut my morning routine down about 5 mins since purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li> I use down to the core.</li>
            <li> then when using cream foundations, primers, or any other cream product you want put some product on a make up pallet or your hand, then use a sweeping motion from side to side!</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a few weeks and it is still shedding.</li>
            <li> All of which are not appealing to then put on your face, or have foundation on.</li>
            <li> Complete with my disappointment and vow to never trust BECCA brushes</li>
            <li> Complete with my disappointment and vow to never trust BECCA brushes again.</li>
            <li> Every time I have used it, I get at least 3-5 bristles on my face.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed this brush had a tendency to drink my liquid makeup up worse that makeup wedge sponges, and it turned the pale shade of foundation</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst makeup brush ever.  </li>
            <li> It becomes a cakey... thick, nasty mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It becomes a cakey... thick, nasty mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!!!!</li>
            <li> It sheds like crazy, worst of all I had to take time to pick off the bristles off my face, and they were all over.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> But afterwards, the WORST.  </li>
            <li> design of the handle is terrible.</li>
            <li> I like Becca&#x27;s makeup, but this brush is HORRIBLE!!!!</li>
            <li> it is INSANE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really do like this brush, i use it every day for foundation and bronzer. However, now that it&#x27;s getting colder i&#x27;m having a problem with this brush exfoliating my skin a little too much and making it flaky. It&#x27;s kind of odd. And there is definitely shedding, but I haven&#x27;t found it unbearable - maybe 4 hairs on my face each time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t have to use any other face brushes which is very nice. it&#x27;s easy to use. I haven&#x27;t cleaned it yet, because I don&#x27;t have any baby shampoo in the house (can&#x27;t use just anything to clean it) but that&#x27;s one of the other great things about this brush, it doesn&#x27;t need to be cleaned every time you use it and it still doesn&#x27;t mix your products.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all your application needs. Easy to clean and simplifies things, love it for travel!</li>
            <li> I just bought this brush last week.ggfn  I have been using it consistently since then. I washed alot of videos on how exactly to use this brush, the care and maintenance of it, along with what it can do and alot of make up tutorials on YouTube , along with the reviews of the product on there.! Now let me say I love this brush it is absolutely wonderful! it does everything it says it does along with more. Now sometimes when I have purchased things such an makeup on Amazon.... i always wonder... is this product real? Now i have no idea the answer to this but if you go to Ulta or Sephora or the BECCA site you can defiantly pick up this product for 46$-49 and you will know that it is real. I have ha no shedding what so ever. I also know this brush is perfect for going from wet to dry, and back to wet again in fast succession without clumping or messing up the coverage. I can promise you this brush will do everything it says it does. I use estee lauder double wear foundation, Stila concealer, Bare minerals powder, Then i switch with blush brands, and finish with contour, highlight, makeup forever hd  powder. Obviously this is alot of products to try! and it makes my face look flawless. I highly recommend watching the how to video. When using blush, you only use one corner then buff out with the unused side. then when using cream foundations, primers, or any other cream product you want put some product on a make up pallet or your hand, then use a sweeping motion from side to side! not front to back to pick up product. then buff it into your face. the liquid product does not dissipate into brush but it actually stays on your face. then it just sinks? down and the brushes are like brand new again and ready for a powder product. I dont understand some of these reviews. this product is amazing just make sure you watch the videos.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the brush, I just wish the bristles would stay in, I have 1 or 2 on the face after after use. I don&#x27;t brush hard, I do a light sweep</li>
            <li> After my first time using this brush, I must say I am thrilled with it!  The flawless look of foundation, evenly blended over entire face...it virtually makes application mistake proof!  I never used foundation over my entire face, as it looked to &#x27;cakey&#x27;.  This makes for smooth, effortless blending.  A bit of highlighter went on next, then the bronzer, followed by a touch of blush.  I tell you, I am in love with this &#x27;one-stop&#x27; make up brush!  Makes my morning routine quick and easy, with wonderful results!</li>
            <li> This a wonderful brush to use on the daily. I have cut my morning routine down about 5 mins since purchasing this brush. I love how much coverage the brush provides when applying my powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a place to rate it lower than I have or I would!  I think it&#x27;s a great brush--this after the first use.  But afterwards, the WORST.  It sheds so much to render is totally useless.</li>
            <li> Not so perfect.  This brush is fine, but I was expecting something amazing. It&#x27;s a perfectly good brush if you like the shape.  I don&#x27;t find it all that special</li>
            <li> Super soft and glides over your skin</li>
            <li> There is a lot of hair fall out, but I love the brush regardless.</li>
            <li> Great brush for makeup.</li>
            <li> Describing this brush in one word? Shedder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I was introduced to BECCA brush by the &#x27;pros&#x27; at Ulta, and I swear these girls know how to make ANY product seem magical like unicorn tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I wasn&#x27;t going to buy it there, because I wasn&#x27;t sold yet. One of the bristles came off on my face while I was being made up, and I still loved my eco tools, so I wasn&#x27;t ready to fork over the extra money for it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I came to trusty Amazon and bought it after my eco tools became its own mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst. Choice. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was $50+ dollars down the drain, and I didn&#x27;t realize it until about 4.5 weeks later. First, the bristles did shed, but it seemed to subside some, plus I was wearing makeup less as it was summertime and all melting off in the heat anyway. However, I noticed this brush had a tendency to drink my liquid makeup up worse that makeup wedge sponges, and it turned the pale shade of foundation I use down to the core. Considering I use the expensive stuff, that was really irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shedding did not stop. Every time I have used it, I get at least 3-5 bristles on my face. Have NO idea how it&#x27;s not bare by now, I guess it&#x27;s because this is my emergency brush that I only use when I left my makeup bag somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the handle is terrible. There&#x27;s no way to set it down in order to extract these stray bristles from your face without having to put the brush on its side, which means you&#x27;re exposing the currently foundation covered bristles to a surface such as a car seat, a bathroom counter, or a makeup vanity. All of which are not appealing to then put on your face, or have foundation on. Further more, it&#x27;s actually surprisingly difficult to grip when you&#x27;re on the side of your face of your dominant hand. I.e. I am right handed, so doing the right side of my face, I struggled with blending more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They market this brush as the &#x27;be all end all&#x27; so that you need no other brushes. Maybe in my dreams. I tried using it in that way, and there are some MAJOR execution flaws, especially, again, for those of use with liquid (or mousse) foundation and then powder to set. Not to mention powder blushes. It becomes a cakey... thick, nasty mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept is brilliant. The cost? Asinine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are wonderfully soft. I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re held in place using Elmer&#x27;s glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could still send this back? I would. Complete with my disappointment and vow to never trust BECCA brushes again.you need no other brushes. Maybe in my dreams. I tried using it in that way, and there are some MAJOR execution flaws, especially, again, for those of use with liquid (or mousse) foundation and then powder to set. Not to mention powder blushes. It becomes a cakey... thick, nasty mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept is brilliant. The cost? Asinine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are wonderfully soft. I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re held in place using Elmer&#x27;s glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could still send this back? I would.

            <li> I was looking for a brush that can go from blush/contour/bronzer to safe time in my AM makeup routine.  This brush does blend makeup wonderfully, but sheds a lot.  I don&#x27;t use it for liquid foundation anymore due to shed issues.  Great for powder only, still find 1-2 hairs on my face though.  Just wish it didn&#x27;t shed as much.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  It sheds like crazy, worst of all I had to take time to pick off the bristles off my face, and they were all over. my face.  I like Becca&#x27;s makeup, but this brush is HORRIBLE!!!!</li>
            <li> it is just okay.  I would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a better makeup brush.  For foundation, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Bristles are super soft and super easy to use. I also received this at an excellent price and it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst makeup brush ever.  The concept of the brush is fabulous, but the SHEDDING is out of control. For the price of the brush you would think it would keep it&#x27;s bristles. I have had this brush for a few weeks and it is still shedding. I get bristles in my eyelashes, in my hair, all over whatever I&#x27;m wearing- it is INSANE! Do not buy this brush until the fix this. Unbelievable!!!!!</li>
