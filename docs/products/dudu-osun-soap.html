            <li>This is a great soap!  </li>
            <li>I just want to say this soap is wonderful</li>
            <li>For me, Its just the best!</li>
            <li>This is a great soap!</li>
            <li>I love this soap!!!!</li>
            <li>it is, its Dudu time(shower lol)!!!!</li>
            <li>Great combo is this soap with jojoba oil to moisten the skin.  </li>
            <li>The lather is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have problematic skin ( breakouts here and there, discoloration), and although my face is not smooth-as-a-baby&#x27;s-behind it&#x27;s still doing a good job of trying to keep the breakouts at bay.&lt;br /&gt;It is winter here too in sunny California</li>
            <li>I also love that this bar lathers up richly &amp; beautifully.</li>
            <li>After reading so many great reviews of this soap, I took a chance -</li>
            <li>Went through most of my bottle of gold bond lotion!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SOAP!  </li>
            <li>This dudu osun is best for cleaning the skin and keeping your skin in best appearances, clears acne and bumps, but a little drying for my skin, but body lotions do help in this situation.</li>
            <li>I purchased this soap with my own money</li>
            <li>and i believe in being honest with others about products i use.</li>
            <li>and I liked it quite a bit when I started using it.  </li>
            <li>This enhances the cleansing process and makes it more effective.</li>
            <li>For being a natural soap it foams up perfectly well.....</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and I feel quite clean &amp; refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>If you use this soap make sure you have your favorite moisturizer at hand.</li>
            <li>I love the way this soap smells and suds.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise that if you are going to wash your face with it, make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m on a quest to find a magical soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it mostly as a body soap though.</li>
            <li>But, what most people need to understand is HOW to use this soap.  </li>
            <li>I love it and tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li>my skin is so smooth my bf loves it!</li>
            <li>The price is great and others really seem to benefit, so it could work for you.</li>
            <li>It foams pretty good and that is important when using a face brush.  </li>
            <li>but I plan to continue to use this soap since it is so nicely priced and has no ill effect as a body wash.</li>
            <li>husband seems to be having the most success though.</li>
            <li>OMG my stretch marks are visibly disappearing and my wrinkly stomach is smooth</li>
            <li>I purchased this originally for my wife and started to use it just to see how it well it works.  </li>
            <li>feels incredibly clean after use, removes all dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li>Rinses clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>My skin felt really clean and refreshed, but over time, I noticed my skin drying and it started to burn</li>
            <li>smells clean.</li>
            <li>makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>As long as you use a good moisturizer you&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone who uses makeup and wants to make sure that all your makeup is removed and your face is really clean before retiring at night.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very well and makes your skin feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Also, the vendor shipped my item quickly and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>It has a mild, soapy scent.</li>
            <li>I am neutral on this because it did not really work magic, but it was an effective soap for the face.  </li>
            <li>He has large pores and very visible blackheads, predominantly around his nose, first use he said he noticed a better clean.</li>
            <li>It lasts a while, so well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I have used this soap for for about a week and my skin never felt more silky and soft.</li>
            <li>It just cleans very well and feels very fresh.</li>
            <li>and I have bumps from head to toe just on the right side of my body.  </li>
            <li>This soap really gets your skin squeaky clean</li>
            <li>I combine three soaps twice a day, Black and white soap, dudu soap, and papya and coconut soap, Dudu smells the best</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;Finally resorted back to good old Doves.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>definitely plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>Although many people reported that it dries the skin, I didn&#x27;t have the same experience.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see it do anything positive to my skin</li>
            <li>However, it does need its own soap dish due to its unusual appearance.</li>
            <li>It has left my skin soft, smooth, and oil free even in 100 degree humid heat.  </li>
            <li>Be gentle &amp; the soap will be gentle to you!</li>
            <li>I really like that my skin feels so soft and looks really clean after using this soap.  </li>
            <li>When you wash your face/body with this product, right after your top layer (dead skin cells) will crumble right off with some help (exfoliant/washcloth).  </li>
            <li>This product did what every single Macy&#x27;s, Online &amp; infomercial line of products has not been able to do.  </li>
            <li>I have that T-Zone skin type of oily forehead,nose (large pores)and chin but dryer skin on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap every night for a month straight</li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s very drying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve not even made much of a dent in it.</li>
            <li>my face felt really cleansed.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way my skin felt at first, but NOW, I have all of these little bumps clustered everywhere</li>
            <li>at first it makes your skin feel dry, but clean.</li>
            <li>You can feel the difference on your skin after the first try--feels as if it peels away old skin.  </li>
            <li>a decent inexpensive product, I would say try it for yourself.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended Dudu Osun Black Soap to me and at first I was hesitant to try a new product on my face because I tend to break-out and scar easily, but I am now a believer.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Never had a natural soap foam up this well and makes your skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li>(no, I did not start using a new beauty product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>By the way i have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My freckles seem to be fading, old pimple scars are fading, my pores are shrinking, and my over all skin tone is evening out!  </li>
            <li>I do recommend using a dark colored washrag because it will stain light colors.</li>
            <li>I have not found it it to be at all drying or irritating, and I LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li>I have not found it it to be at all drying or irritating, and I LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li>but even though it is black it lathers up off white which is interesting.</li>
            <li>However, it did clear up some of my acne and</li>
            <li>Lasts a pretty long time</li>
            <li>I actually felt very moisturized...</li>
            <li>The only person I would recommend this soap to is someone with overtly oiley skin, who lives in a very humid climate.</li>
            <li>It completely cleared up my skin, evened my skin tone and unclogged &amp; shrunk the appearance of my pores.  </li>
            <li>skin is combination, sensitive and acne-prone.  </li>
            <li>The only reason i have not given this soap five stars is because i havent used this soap for too long to give a full review.</li>
            <li>When I used this soap on my face, my skin felt squeaky clean and tight.</li>
            <li>It also did the same for my 60 year old mother and my 82 year old grandmother (I am 28 with sensitive, combo skin).</li>
            <li>Your skin will be unbelievable smooth.  </li>
            <li>This soap did not damage my skin, so it went back to normal after I stopped using it on my face.</li>
            <li>In the very first uses I had the feeling of dryness but after a few days of using this product that feeling passed.</li>
            <li>But I can live with that as long as it keeps cleansing and making my skin</li>
            <li>This soap smells nice and does clean very well, however, It is miserably drying!</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t know how to believe other than before I started using the soap I had it</li>
            <li>Does not dry my face.</li>
            <li>It also lathers up a little brown at first.</li>
            <li>The Dudu-Osun black soap deeply cleans and really takes care of both skin types without drying out my skin.</li>

            <li> so I really don&#x27;t know how to believe other than before I started using the soap I had it</li>
            <li> Does not dry my face.</li>
            <li> It also lathers up a little brown at first.</li>
            <li> The Dudu-Osun black soap deeply cleans and really takes care of both skin types without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> The soap looks a little funky, and sure does make a mess in our shower (black/brown stream down our wall, if not properly rinsed)</li>
            <li> so prior to this soap, I was being left dry and peeling.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand why it only affected one side of my body though...very strange.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t improve, I&#x27;ll go back to this face wash and see if it has results over the long time.</li>
            <li> When I got a rash from an allergic reaction to my new cat, this soap cleared it up in a few days.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any positive or negative changes in my face.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Wet your hands, lather the soap up in your hands, then wash your body from head to toe with ONLY YOUR HANDS.  </li>
            <li> (It may be a little rough, though, if you have truly sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li> I have dry skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> My skin got incredibly dry after each wash.</li>
            <li> Burn my eyes, dry my skin</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel dry after using it so put on some moisturizer</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a little taken back because I&#x27;ve had that issue for so long</li>
            <li> one drawback is that it leaves a black stain on the sink and you have to constantly rinse through while using the soap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was living in Arizona when i used this and NO WAY. I have dry skin to begin with. This isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all. My skin got incredibly dry after each wash. I didn&#x27;t see it do anything positive to my skin and it made my tub gross at the bottom. I didn&#x27;t finish the bar because my skin couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended Dudu Osun Black Soap to me and at first I was hesitant to try a new product on my face because I tend to break-out and scar easily, but I am now a believer. Not only has the soap worked so well on her skin, but I already see the difference on mine. My skin is clearer and my skin-tone seems to have evened out a bit. It also leaves my skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely plan on buying more. Also, the vendor shipped my item quickly and in a timely manner. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This soap really gets your skin squeaky clean but, it dries it at the same time.  As long as you use a good moisturizer you&#x27;re fine.  Also, I have almost no breakouts with this soap.  It lasts a while, so well worth every penny.  If it weren&#x27;t for the drying of the skin, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for shower, for my face. Although many people reported that it dries the skin, I didn&#x27;t have the same experience. In the very first uses I had the feeling of dryness but after a few days of using this product that feeling passed. It just cleans very well and feels very fresh. My skin is softer.</li>
            <li> I used this soap twice and I have bumps from head to toe just on the right side of my body.  I love the smell and the way my skin felt at first, but NOW, I have all of these little bumps clustered everywhere and they are extremely itchy.  I cannot understand why it only affected one side of my body though...very strange. Sadly I purchased a 6 pack and won&#x27;t be using the soap again.</li>
            <li> When I used this soap on my face, my skin felt squeaky clean and tight. On my body, it cleared some of my skin, but not all. When I got a rash from an allergic reaction to my new cat, this soap cleared it up in a few days. I would definitely recommend this soap to someone else. It has a mild, soapy scent. It does leave brown residue where ever you leave it in the shower. It also lathers up a little brown at first. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you use it on a white sponge or a washcloth.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap!  I have not found it it to be at all drying or irritating, and I LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap every night for a month straight and I haven&#x27;t noticed any positive or negative changes in my face.  Essentially it works just like any bar of regular soap (at least for me).  The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s very drying.  If you use this soap make sure you have your favorite moisturizer at hand.</li>
            <li> Hello everyone!!! I just want to say this soap is wonderful I have used this soap for for about a week and my skin never felt more silky and soft. I was having a few issues with breakouts and this soap has not only stoped my breakouts ,but has lightened my skin complexion. The only reason i have not given this soap five stars is because i havent used this soap for too long to give a full review. However, i will be doing an update on the soap. By the way i have VERY sensitive skin and i have not experienced any burning, redness, or itching. I purchased this soap with my own money and i believe in being honest with others about products i use.</li>
            <li> At least not for me. Burn my eyes, dry my skin and I still broke out. What the freak man?</li>
            <li> My wife loves this soap. Her skin is noticeably smoother and softer since she&#x27;s been using it. She says she will continue to buy it. However, it does need its own soap dish due to its unusual appearance.</li>
            <li> I really like that my skin feels so soft and looks really clean after using this soap.  It foams pretty good and that is important when using a face brush.  It also lasts a long time.  I have had my dudu osun soap for months now and use it every day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback is that it leaves a black stain on the sink and you have to constantly rinse through while using the soap. But I can live with that as long as it keeps cleansing and making my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who uses makeup and wants to make sure that all your makeup is removed and your face is really clean before retiring at night.  Also, if you have a face brush, use it with the soap.  This enhances the cleansing process and makes it more effective.</li>
            <li> This dudu osun is best for cleaning the skin and keeping your skin in best appearances, clears acne and bumps, but a little drying for my skin, but body lotions do help in this situation.</li>
            <li> The product came on time, as promised; Nothing misleading. The scent lasts all day, and all the way down to the center of the bar--good size, too.  You can feel the difference on your skin after the first try--feels as if it peels away old skin.  I would definitely order it again! (It may be a little rough, though, if you have truly sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li> I love the way this soap smells and suds.  Lasts a pretty long time and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I have that T-Zone skin type of oily forehead,nose (large pores)and chin but dryer skin on my cheeks. The Dudu-Osun black soap deeply cleans and really takes care of both skin types without drying out my skin. For me, Its just the best!</li>
            <li> I am neutral on this because it did not really work magic, but it was an effective soap for the face.  It does what you need it to do, but don&#x27;t expect miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may just be me, but it didn&#x27;t work as well as other black soaps</li>
            <li> This is a great soap! I have not found it it to be at all drying or irritating, and I LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li> For being a natural soap it foams up perfectly well.....at first it makes your skin feel dry, but clean. The second time of use  I actually felt very moisturized...Never had a natural soap foam up this well and makes your skin very moisturized. Its a must buy product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and I can already tell a difference with my skin. It&#x27;s so much smoother and softer. I&#x27;d advise that if you are going to wash your face with it, make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards. I personally use shea butter for extra smoothness and radiant skin.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my face. I use it twice a day. I have problematic skin ( breakouts here and there, discoloration), and although my face is not smooth-as-a-baby&#x27;s-behind it&#x27;s still doing a good job of trying to keep the breakouts at bay.&lt;br /&gt;It is winter here too in sunny California so prior to this soap, I was being left dry and peeling. I don&#x27;t have that issue any more.&lt;br /&gt;My husband seems to be having the most success though. He has large pores and very visible blackheads, predominantly around his nose, first use he said he noticed a better clean. I frankly cant tell. They look like the same amount and size before the soap.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect the soap to smell like a basket of roses, but it is not offensive ether. Neutral.&lt;br /&gt;Its a decent inexpensive product, I would say try it for yourself. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m on a quest to find a magical soap.</li>
            <li> Started feeling itchy all over few days after I started using this. It took a while to find the reason. It stopped once I stopped using it. I bought it because I like herbal products. But this one didn&#x27;t suit my skin :(&lt;br /&gt;Finally resorted back to good old Doves.&lt;br /&gt;Good that I ordered only 1 not a pack of 5/10.</li>
            <li> This soap smells nice and does clean very well, however, It is miserably drying! Went through most of my bottle of gold bond lotion! I usually use charcoal soaps, which can be &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;, but a little lotion cures that problem. This stuff is absolutely horrible drying! The only person I would recommend this soap to is someone with overtly oiley skin, who lives in a very humid climate. If that doesn&#x27;t describe you, then do not buy this!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had bad skin since I was a teenager.  I purchased this originally for my wife and started to use it just to see how it well it works.  The soap looks a little funky, and sure does make a mess in our shower (black/brown stream down our wall, if not properly rinsed) but it helps. I&#x27;ve always had those small black heads around my nose that are near impossible to remove but this appears to have helped.  I don&#x27;t see them anymore, I&#x27;m a little taken back because I&#x27;ve had that issue for so long so I really don&#x27;t know how to believe other than before I started using the soap I had it and now... I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face feels incredibly clean after use, removes all dirt and oil.  Great combo is this soap with jojoba oil to moisten the skin.  I&#x27;m not metro-sexual, nor do I care that much about how I look (sorry wife) but all in all I&#x27;m really pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month and I quite like it. I&#x27;ve been using it mostly as a body soap though. The smell is pleasant and I feel quite clean &amp; refreshed after using it. I was a bit afraid that this black soap would ruin my salux wash towels but even though it is black it lathers up off white which is interesting. In the past, I usually used a liquid body wash like Dove or SoftSoap but I feel that those can get quite expensive over time and the bottles usually don&#x27;t last all that long. I&#x27;ve had this soap for about a month, bathing up to twice a day and I&#x27;ve not even made much of a dent in it. I also love that this bar lathers up richly &amp; beautifully. I&#x27;ve only used it about 3-4 times on my face and I noticed I got a small case of milia, which is something that has only happened once before in my life several years. Perhaps my skin was just purging but I feel reluctant to try again but we&#x27;ll see. I haven&#x27;t noticed any vast differences in the skin on my body. The only real problem I have is uneven skin tone but than again it only has been a month but I plan to continue to use this soap since it is so nicely priced and has no ill effect as a body wash.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for a week and I LOVE it!  It has left my skin soft, smooth, and oil free even in 100 degree humid heat.  But, what most people need to understand is HOW to use this soap.  DO NOT use a wash rag, poof, sponge, or any other device. Use ONLY your hands!  Wet your hands, lather the soap up in your hands, then wash your body from head to toe with ONLY YOUR HANDS.  You do not need to scrub! Of course you will get too dry &amp; itchy if you are scrubbing too hard with this soap.  This soap cleanses so well you only need your HANDS.  If you do break out after a couple of days of using this soap, don&#x27;t give up.  I too got a few bumps after a few uses, but they are now clearing up and going away.  I think this maybe due to the soap getting the impurities out of my pores.  I LOVE THIS SOAP!  I only wish I had found it years ago!  My freckles seem to be fading, old pimple scars are fading, my pores are shrinking, and my over all skin tone is evening out!  Just remember DO NOT SCRUB!  Be gentle &amp; the soap will be gentle to you!</li>
            <li> This product did what every single Macy&#x27;s, Online &amp; infomercial line of products has not been able to do.  It completely cleared up my skin, evened my skin tone and unclogged &amp; shrunk the appearance of my pores.  It also did the same for my 60 year old mother and my 82 year old grandmother (I am 28 with sensitive, combo skin). When you wash your face/body with this product, right after your top layer (dead skin cells) will crumble right off with some help (exfoliant/washcloth).  Your skin will feel dry after using it so put on some moisturizer and you&#x27;ll be set.  Your skin will be unbelievable smooth.  The only thing that I did not like was that the expiration date was not visible on this pack but I just purchased a 3 pack and all the dates were visible.  I love it and tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again. The lather is amazing! I do recommend using a dark colored washrag because it will stain light colors. Rinses clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!!!! OMG my stretch marks are visibly disappearing and my wrinkly stomach is smooth its only been a week this is insane!!!! I combine three soaps twice a day, Black and white soap, dudu soap, and papya and coconut soap, Dudu smells the best but omg my skin is so smooth my bf loves it! I&#x27;ve never felt happier in my cocoa brown skin, I&#x27;m latin and the sun has done a toll on me but thanx to dudu my skin is all one complexion now, with the help of the other soaps too. I am buying the 12 pack immediately I will never go without dudu again I thought these stretch marks from childbirth would never fade! Thank you Dudu and oh look at what time it is, its Dudu time(shower lol)!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product for over a month now. It didn&#x27;t help or hurt my skin. It lathers very well and makes your skin feel very clean. However I have cystic acne and was hoping this product would help me. Maybe I need to use it for longer but I washed my face twice everyday for over a month. No improvement but at the same time nothing got worse. I&#x27;ve returned to my chemical face wash from Neutrogena. If I don&#x27;t improve, I&#x27;ll go back to this face wash and see if it has results over the long time.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I wish I could rate this higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is combination, sensitive and acne-prone.  After reading so many great reviews of this soap, I took a chance - I mean, for the price, why not?  I used this for 3-4 months and I liked it quite a bit when I started using it.  My skin felt really clean and refreshed, but over time, I noticed my skin drying and it started to burn (no, I did not start using a new beauty product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave this a 3-star rating due to how my skin reacted.  However, it did clear up some of my acne and my face felt really cleansed.  This soap did not damage my skin, so it went back to normal after I stopped using it on my face. I use it on the rest of my body and I don&#x27;t have the same reaction I did when it was on my face.  Go ahead and try it if your curious. The price is great and others really seem to benefit, so it could work for you.</li>
            <li> hoping it clears up my face. came on time. smells clean. makes my face feel clean. ive only used it for two days. hoping it works like everyone says</li>
