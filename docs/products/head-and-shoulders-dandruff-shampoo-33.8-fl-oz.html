            <li>Although... I don&#x27;t think it makes my hair any smoother or more refreshed.</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of my family for years.  </li>
            <li>The pump top is your friend.</li>
            <li>I have been able to buy.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>So glad we can still find original  &amp;#34;Classic Clean&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li>what I love the most it the easy pump</li>
            <li>After I wash my hair, my hair is very clean.  </li>
            <li>Cleans really well like a good shampoo should, doesn&#x27;t leave a coat of wax on my hair which a lot of the shampoos in this price range do.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and the lather is nice.</li>
            <li>I have been using the original Head and Shoulders for many years and want to stick with it.  </li>
            <li>He likes this product the best than any other he has tried.</li>
            <li>Nothing better than that clean feeling just out of the shower, and this shampoo provides just that for hours after getting out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders is a fine product.</li>
            <li>can I say.&lt;br /&gt;No more dry scalp and my hair feels great....</li>
            <li>Dandruff free for years.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a cheap price on Amazon and was amazed by the size/price.</li>
            <li>This is the original in a nice large package.  </li>
            <li>When I had long hair I would use it because it rinsed out easily, prevented dandruff, kept it looking and feeling nice, smelled amazing, and didn&#x27;t torture the hair.  </li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders keeps my dandruff (and my husband&#x27;s) under control better than any other shampoo, and Amazon has it at a great price.</li>
            <li>I ws pleased that it has a dispenser, first time I kne these were available.</li>
            <li>Now for the Head and Shoulders, I Love the Classic Clean scent, I Love the size of this pump bottle and</li>
            <li>I love the pump dispenser since one pump is exactly what I need for a shampoo.</li>
            <li>Scalp always feels clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Most pump shampoos put out way too much</li>
            <li>Good price for a big bottle.</li>
            <li>Utilizing the pump in this big bottle yields you more than 10% more product per bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, have been using it for a few years.  </li>
            <li>in all, it is a quality product worth recommending.</li>
            <li>Same product at a good price in a VERY convenient pump.</li>
            <li>I am always a fun of Head and Shoulder shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would ordinarily privately seek satisfaction from a seller, but in this case I was fooled, so I feel there is no reason to be courteous to them.</li>
            <li>Cleans up my dandruff right away.</li>
            <li>A good scalp massage with a little bit of it leaves me fresh, itch-free, and dandruff-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They both have oily hair and this classic dandruff shampoo keeps away dandruff as well as making hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>I hope they don&#x27;t mess with the formula and keep it as good as it is for years to come.</li>
            <li>Whether or not you have dandruff, I&#x27;ve been using the classic head and shoulders since I could shampoo my own hair, and I think it&#x27;s the only non-salon ($$$$) shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave any residue in your hair, and thoroughly cleans your scalp of all the yucky build-up.</li>
            <li>The classic shampoo and so far my favorite.</li>
            <li>most of the shampoo are the same.</li>
            <li>thanks alot!</li>
            <li>came exactly as described</li>
            <li>Excellent cost per ounce compared to using the same amount bought in a smaller size bottle from your local department/grocery store.</li>
            <li>It really, really works!</li>
            <li>I use it daily and it works, What more</li>
            <li>We first bought this item at Sams Club.  </li>
            <li>I really like head and shoulders, not a big fan of the 2 in 1 products but love the separates</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos, and we always find ourselve coming back to this classic shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use every day and leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Classic no frills shampoo, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I really like this dispenser.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>when i tried this, it really made my scalp feel so refreshed, and revitalized.</li>
            <li>i havent seen much flakes and dandruff since i used it.</li>
            <li>Pump works very well (unlike some on this size of a bottle).</li>
            <li>really bulky</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care to do business with them</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I have very oily hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>His scalp smells much cleaner too.  </li>
            <li>My skin is still oily, but much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No waste, no excess, just the right amount.</li>
            <li>Over are the days of shampoo residue gluing your standard cap shut, requiring force to unlock, only for it to fly open and propel selenium sulfide into your eyes as your grip slips off the container and your hands instinctively rush to your reddening eyes as you muffle your childlike whimpers so that your roommate won&#x27;t hear as the warm water slowly runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I barely get any lather the first wash and a lot of rich lather the second wash. 2.</li>
            <li>I am not big on writing reviews, but I do try to contribute here and there, because reviews are a tremendous deciding factor for me whether I buy a product or not.</li>
            <li>It is better than other brands I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my half inch long hair silky smooth and easy to brush.</li>
            <li>I really like the pump like that you will not waste shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The pump squirts out the right amount for me with one squirt (I have short hair).  </li>
            <li>Picked this up at a local drug store and didn&#x27;t think too much of it.</li>
            <li>A couple of things I discovered so far: 1.</li>
            <li>This is really the ONLY shampoo I use.  </li>
            <li>After washing it, my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old school</li>
            <li>I believe it removes all the natural oil from the scalp.</li>
            <li>i am currently out of shampoo and reviewing this purchase but too lazy to order more.</li>
            <li>Even if the shampoo water runs along your newly shaved facial hair area.</li>
            <li>at first i thought it was just like any other shampoo, like well its just shampoo.</li>
            <li>Use this shampoo one time and only occasionally after and be flake clear.</li>
            <li>i only use head &amp; shoulder, no other shampoo works for my hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely works, but unlike other shampoo i use, this does not get very bubbly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been the old standby to cure this problem for a long time.</li>
            <li>I barely use soap because this is lathery enough to spread the wealth.</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem to work on me but after a few weeks of use the itching went away which means the scratching.</li>
            <li>Now, with short hair, I still use it because no other product seems to perform as well without being double the cost.  </li>

            <li> Even if the shampoo water runs along your newly shaved facial hair area.</li>
            <li> at first i thought it was just like any other shampoo, like well its just shampoo.</li>
            <li> Use this shampoo one time and only occasionally after and be flake clear.</li>
            <li> i only use head &amp; shoulder, no other shampoo works for my hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely works, but unlike other shampoo i use, this does not get very bubbly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been the old standby to cure this problem for a long time.</li>
            <li> I barely use soap because this is lathery enough to spread the wealth.</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem to work on me but after a few weeks of use the itching went away which means the scratching.</li>
            <li> Now, with short hair, I still use it because no other product seems to perform as well without being double the cost.  </li>
            <li> and/or I am exposed to hard-water, which is what I use when I shower unfortunately, then this really doesn&#x27;t do exactly what I would like it to do.</li>
            <li> My only request would be to even have a larger size to replenish this container when it runs dry.</li>
            <li> This turns out to be a little hard to find in bulk since many warehouse stores stock the 2:1 or other formulas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not be afraid of the pump top.</li>
            <li> The packaging was also defective causing minor product loss, but I have discussed that in Seller Feedback.</li>
            <li> It burns any minor cut area like hell.</li>
            <li> I believe that H&amp;S works to a degree, but when it is dry during the winter months</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that you should never use this shampoo the same day you shave your hair.</li>
            <li> and it annoys me that they are allowed to disguise themselves under other names in the Amazon Marketplace.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to add a little bit of information, I like to let my facial hair grow a little from time to time, but once the hair got of a little length my face would itch, my wife had seen or read somewhere</li>
            <li> and a little costly compared to other brands...</li>
            <li> I picked this up for $7.37 with a clipable P&amp;G coupon; otherwise, for the typical $15+ price, I feel it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> The Price on the 2 of these were less than any where else and works for my husbands dandruff and flakes.</li>
            <li> The pump controls some of that mess.</li>
            <li> fragrance is little like watermelon and cucumber mix....</li>
            <li> Every once in a while everybody gets a few flakes of dandruff.</li>
            <li> I want to know how my hair looks if I did not wash it few days.  </li>
            <li> like that the shampoo is in a pump, bc the shampoo itself is quite messy to use.  </li>
            <li> I used Aveda and other expensive brands but have had simple cases of dandruff for a while.</li>
            <li> No more upside down bottles that drip all over the place!</li>
            <li> No more brushing my shoulders off during meetings.</li>
            <li> NO MORE ITCHING..............</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my expensive stuff in summer (when the flakes are less) but would never hesitate to use or recommend H&amp;S..</li>
            <li> Worst Shampoo ever!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair super DRY and all twisted!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with that,</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible but with black hair; anything is noticeable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this dispenser.  I kept breaking the bottle tops but with this pump design I don&#x27;t foresee that as an issue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for years and have always been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Good product will recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Cleans up my dandruff right away. No more brushing my shoulders off during meetings. Boosts confidence and style. All that in a shampoo? Great value.</li>
            <li> great shampoo, easy on the hair, you are able to use every  day, great smell to it, what I love the most it the easy pump</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD. THANKS A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;REGARDS</li>
            <li> Best deal. Dandruff free for years.</li>
            <li> My husband and son use this shampoo every day.  They both have oily hair and this classic dandruff shampoo keeps away dandruff as well as making hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, have been using it for a few years.  Although every 3rd shampoo-ing I use t-Gel just to change things up.  My wife also likes to use a conditioner after shampoo, but I don&#x27;t bother with that. The price is good on Amazon and it was shipped for free and well protected in transit.  They put some tape over the cover to prevent accidental spilling.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to refill so often. Great!</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND USES HEAD AND SHOULDERS DAILY AND HE HAS BEAUTIFUL GRAY HAIR AND HIS HAIR IS ALWAYS GORGEOUS.  HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHAMPOO IS ALSO GOOD FOR ITCHY SKIN SO YOU CAN BATHE IN IT AND NO MORE ITCHING..............</li>
            <li> does the job, it&#x27;s a shampoo</li>
            <li> Every once in a while everybody gets a few flakes of dandruff. While I don&#x27;t use Head &amp; Shoulders regularly we do have it in the shower for those occasions when we need to use it. If I notice a problem I just use Head &amp; Shoulders for about a week or two and the issue is solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been the old standby to cure this problem for a long time. It is gentle enough to use every day and leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean. I like this product and it works well!</li>
            <li> I really like it.  After I wash my hair, my hair is very clean.  One time  I want to know how my hair looks if I did not wash it few days.  It still look not back.</li>
            <li> Picked this up at a local drug store and didn&#x27;t think too much of it. Cleans really well like a good shampoo should, doesn&#x27;t leave a coat of wax on my hair which a lot of the shampoos in this price range do. A couple of things I discovered so far: 1. If there is enough oil on your hair it won&#x27;t suds up. I barely get any lather the first wash and a lot of rich lather the second wash. 2. A good scalp massage with a little bit of it leaves me fresh, itch-free, and dandruff-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a quality product worth recommending. I hope they don&#x27;t mess with the formula and keep it as good as it is for years to come.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. I ws pleased that it has a dispenser, first time I kne these were available.</li>
            <li> This is really the ONLY shampoo I use.  When I had long hair I would use it because it rinsed out easily, prevented dandruff, kept it looking and feeling nice, smelled amazing, and didn&#x27;t torture the hair.  Now, with short hair, I still use it because no other product seems to perform as well without being double the cost.  Nothing better than that clean feeling just out of the shower, and this shampoo provides just that for hours after getting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massive pump bottle is convenient and seems to last forever.  Awesome for those days that you need to knock out an 8 minute shower...</li>
            <li> Classic no frills shampoo, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I don&#x27;t have a dandruff issue but I&#x27;ve never had flakes while using this. Scalp always feels clean afterwards. Pump style is ideal for ease of use and getting the most out of the product.</li>
            <li> at first i thought it was just like any other shampoo, like well its just shampoo. most of the shampoo are the same. well, kinda. when i tried this, it really made my scalp feel so refreshed, and revitalized. i havent seen much flakes and dandruff since i used it. thanks alot!</li>
            <li> Whether or not you have dandruff, I&#x27;ve been using the classic head and shoulders since I could shampoo my own hair, and I think it&#x27;s the only non-salon ($$$$) shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave any residue in your hair, and thoroughly cleans your scalp of all the yucky build-up. I love it, and I&#x27;ll be buying this until they stop making it!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than my grocery store. I really like the pump like that you will not waste shampoo.  Package is really big !</li>
            <li> i am currently out of shampoo and reviewing this purchase but too lazy to order more. Its the best shampoo. It makes my half inch long hair silky smooth and easy to brush. No dandruff ever with this shampoo. It also works good for armpits and stuff. I barely use soap because this is lathery enough to spread the wealth.</li>
            <li> came exactly as described</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders keeps my dandruff (and my husband&#x27;s) under control better than any other shampoo, and Amazon has it at a great price. I love this pump bottle, too. Great deal for a quality product.</li>
            <li> Headline says it all. Pump works very well (unlike some on this size of a bottle). Excellent cost per ounce compared to using the same amount bought in a smaller size bottle from your local department/grocery store.</li>
            <li> Great price. Walmart quit handling this size and it also cost more there.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. Although... I don&#x27;t think it makes my hair any smoother or more refreshed.</li>
            <li> Utilizing the pump in this big bottle yields you more than 10% more product per bottle.  No more upside down bottles that drip all over the place!</li>
            <li> Awesome price for product I have loved for years. Works well for my dandruff and hair looks good. I personally prefer the non 2-in-1 versions.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite of my family for years.  So glad we can still find original  &amp;#34;Classic Clean&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li> My husband refuses to use anything else.  It does a very good job of controlling his dandruff.</li>
            <li> Works for me. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> i only use head &amp; shoulder, no other shampoo works for my hair. After washing it, my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> Same product at a good price in a VERY convenient pump. I plan on keeping the pump and refilling it depending on what is cheaper...</li>
            <li> Definitely works, but unlike other shampoo i use, this does not get very bubbly. Nothing wrong with that, but i like to play around with the bubbles sometimes, just kidding.&lt;br /&gt;Removes dandruff like it says, use 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I am not big on writing reviews, but I do try to contribute here and there, because reviews are a tremendous deciding factor for me whether I buy a product or not. Thank you to all of you who submit honest heart felt reviews. Now for the Head and Shoulders, I Love the Classic Clean scent, I Love the size of this pump bottle and the price I ordered it at was wonderful. I also wanted to add a little bit of information, I like to let my facial hair grow a little from time to time, but once the hair got of a little length my face would itch, my wife had seen or read somewhere that is actually face dander, and the article said to shampoo your face when shampooing your hair, it actually works my face has not itched since. I know it sounds simple, but who would of thought? Hope this helps someone. I also encourage everyone to submit a review from time to time. Great product..</li>
            <li> works with or without dandruff</li>
            <li> I am always a fun of Head and Shoulder shampoo. We&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos, and we always find ourselve coming back to this classic shampoo. Smells good and works well.</li>
            <li> the pump option provided is really good....fragrance is little like watermelon and cucumber mix....hair become shinny after use so no need of conditioner..really bulky so cannot lift the bottle by one hand while taking shower....and a little costly compared to other brands...</li>
            <li> My wife keeps coming home with the Head and Shoulders flavor of the week.  Some of them even seem to have BenGay or something in them.  I have been using the original Head and Shoulders for many years and want to stick with it.  This is the original in a nice large package.  The pump squirts out the right amount for me with one squirt (I have short hair).  Most pump shampoos put out way too much and I feel like I am wasting it.  Regular purchaser here.</li>
            <li> Awsome buy with subscribe and save and coupon, fits in the shower on a wall mounted corner basket out of the way.</li>
            <li> I use to shun these store bought shampoos. I used Aveda and other expensive brands but have had simple cases of dandruff for a while. It wasn&#x27;t horrible but with black hair; anything is noticeable. I bought this for a cheap price on Amazon and was amazed by the size/price. The smell is fresh and the lather is nice. At first it didn&#x27;t seem to work on me but after a few weeks of use the itching went away which means the scratching. That leaves your scalp time to HEAL. I do have occasional flakes but for me this shampoo works. The price is great as well. I&#x27;ll stick to my expensive stuff in summer (when the flakes are less) but would never hesitate to use or recommend H&amp;S.. it&#x27;s old school but that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Goes along with the conditioner.  I really like head and shoulders, not a big fan of the 2 in 1 products but love the separates</li>
            <li> Over are the days of shampoo residue gluing your standard cap shut, requiring force to unlock, only for it to fly open and propel selenium sulfide into your eyes as your grip slips off the container and your hands instinctively rush to your reddening eyes as you muffle your childlike whimpers so that your roommate won&#x27;t hear as the warm water slowly runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not be afraid of the pump top. The pump top is your friend. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is da bomb! It cleared up my occasional flakes in just one shampoo. I only have &#x27;druff in the winter time. Use this shampoo one time and only occasionally after and be flake clear. It really, really works! Why don&#x27;t you get some?</li>
            <li> I picked this up for $7.37 with a clipable P&amp;G coupon; otherwise, for the typical $15+ price, I feel it is not worth it. I still prefer products like Selsun Blue over Head and Shoulders. I believe that H&amp;S works to a degree, but when it is dry during the winter months and/or I am exposed to hard-water, which is what I use when I shower unfortunately, then this really doesn&#x27;t do exactly what I would like it to do. The smell is nice and clean...not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Worst Shampoo ever!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair super DRY and all twisted!! I believe it removes all the natural oil from the scalp. I lose a lot of hair whenever I use this shampoo!!! I&#x27;ll never buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> The classic shampoo and so far my favorite. It is better than other brands I have tried so far. But it is just my personal experience.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it daily and it works, What more can I say.&lt;br /&gt;No more dry scalp and my hair feels great....</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders is a fine product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I have no idea whether I still have dandruff; I keep using it because I like the (relative) lack of scent and how it cleans my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad stuff. The product page says GR8MART is the seller. In my Orders List it says Tradecozone, but the actual shipper was Sam&#x27;s Club. I really don&#x27;t care to do business with them and it annoys me that they are allowed to disguise themselves under other names in the Amazon Marketplace. The packaging was also defective causing minor product loss, but I have discussed that in Seller Feedback. I would ordinarily privately seek satisfaction from a seller, but in this case I was fooled, so I feel there is no reason to be courteous to them.</li>
            <li> Excellent it&#x27;s good shampoo</li>
            <li> We first bought this item at Sams Club.  The pump idea is great.  Easier then regular bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the largest bottle of Head and Shoulders I have been able to buy.  On Amazon it is also the cheapest oz. for oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for only 4 stars is because there is no refill option.  I have written H&amp;S, if the start offering a larger refill bottle I will increase to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> H&amp;S is the only dandruff shampoo I use. It always works, and this container makes dispensing very easy. I have very thick hair and this works wonders</li>
            <li> I try many brand shampoo,and campare them,Head and shoulders give best feel and clean dandruff.I&#x27;ll keep useing head &amp; shoulder shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped timely, it came just as described, and the price was amazing. What more could I ask for?!?!</li>
            <li> my family likes this shampoo and it was a nice size lasted a while and good price would buy again</li>
            <li> Good price for a big bottle. It&#x27;s head &amp; shoulders, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to?</li>
            <li> This turns out to be a little hard to find in bulk since many warehouse stores stock the 2:1 or other formulas. For those of you who want the real, original Head and Shoulders, this is it. I love the pump dispenser since one pump is exactly what I need for a shampoo. No waste, no excess, just the right amount. My only request would be to even have a larger size to replenish this container when it runs dry.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to work well. The only negative thing is that you should never use this shampoo the same day you shave your hair. It burns any minor cut area like hell. Even if the shampoo water runs along your newly shaved facial hair area. The burn will make a grown man cry. But I should have known that, it has zinc (For wound healing)</li>
            <li> The Price on the 2 of these were less than any where else and works for my husbands dandruff and flakes. He likes this product the best than any other he has tried.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I have very oily hair and skin.  My son and I both use it as  a face wash, shampoo and back and chest  wash.  He&#x27;s noticing that it helps with controlling acne.  His scalp smells much cleaner too.  I&#x27;ve noticed that I can go an extra day without washing my hair.  My skin is still oily, but much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like that the shampoo is in a pump, bc the shampoo itself is quite messy to use.  The pump controls some of that mess.</li>
