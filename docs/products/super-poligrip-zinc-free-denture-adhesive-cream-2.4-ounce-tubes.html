            <li>However, he likes it because it&#x27;s still better than the others.</li>
            <li>much more hold than Fixodent.  </li>
            <li>Selleck is one of my favorite actors.  </li>

            <li>I wish they still had zinc in this product because it held better.</li>
            <li>It has been my experience with Denture Adhesives, that this one works better than the &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Much better than Fixodent.</li>
            <li>Holds all day and zinc free!</li>
            <li>I use this product on a regular basis and it has always worked best for me.</li>
            <li>Does not go 24 hours as advertised, goes from 10 to 18 hours at most. .</li>
            <li>this is for all  my shopping on amazon love it -  </li>
            <li>one stop  better then slced bread----------------</li>
            <li>As a denture wearer, I have used many a &#x27;gripping&#x27; product to keep my teeth in place.  </li>
            <li>this has a lot better adhesive</li>
            <li>Have been pleased before.  </li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Works OK, but wears off quicker than Fixodent.</li>
            <li>I got more of this one for cheaper price.</li>
            <li>What more could one ask for?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 10 yrs...</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get any better</li>
            <li>I have an Amazon subscription to save money and make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>Costing more all the time.</li>
            <li>i have used this for years and getting it at a better price is even better.</li>
            <li>I use my Poligrip Free every day, and can eat any kind of foods, etc.</li>
            <li>i love it ty for product Poligirp its much much better than others :)</li>
            <li>In my opinion better than Fixodent.</li>
            <li>Great product, much needed, customers are abused by the &amp;#34;legal&amp;#34; system.</li>
            <li>Excellent product will, definitely order again</li>
            <li>She keeps coming back to Super Poligrip as the one adhesive that holds the best for the longest period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers an excellent way to get one of the better prices for this product and if you have prime (like we do), shipping is free.</li>
            <li>and the hold is pretty good..</li>
            <li>The Poligrip Strips are the best even they give you a strange taste and smell and</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t buy this in New Zealand - great product</li>
            <li>Says it works best, but says if it were pink, it would match his gums.&lt;br /&gt;That makes sense.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I am glad that so many people have had such a great experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Love Poligrip Free, though.</li>
            <li>Rack up yet another rip off by class action trial lawyers and favored retailers in the distribution system.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything from powders to other pastes, and this Poligrip is the best I can find.  </li>
            <li>An easy adjustment to make after applying it a couple of times.</li>
            <li>It holds strong.</li>
            <li>WORKS FINE.</li>
            <li>Super Poligrip would not have been able to do that.</li>
            <li>Have Used super poligrip for many years.  </li>
            <li>He prefers this \\&quot;super\\&quot; zinc free, free type.</li>
            <li>Poligrip Free has no taste or odor</li>
            <li>I think this product would fit my needs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even the zinc free variety.</li>
            <li>works great and the bulk pack will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>Great price, compared to the stores locally!!</li>
            <li>A couple of times I haven&#x27;t been able to remove my dentures at night it still has good holding power the next morning.</li>
            <li>Very handy to order from amazon in a larger quantity than depend on tube by tube purchases.</li>
            <li>Very economical to purchase from Amazon---</li>
            <li>particular kind.  </li>
            <li>If you want a really good adhesive you most need to bought the poligrip cream blue ultra fresh.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Super Poligrip Zinc Free Denture Adhesive Cream,</li>
            <li>B001G7QSXO Super Poligrip Zinc Free Denture Adhesive Cream, 2.4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will look for true 24 hours hold.</li>
            <li>Great price cheaper than, the other stores</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and intact.  </li>
            <li>first, it worked great as long as I did not eat anything.</li>
            <li>Super Poligrip keeps my dectures in place.</li>
            <li>and it was available at a reasonable price &amp;#34;THEN&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li>If I loose too many more teeth, I&#x27;ll be trying it out too.</li>
            <li>this is good and not to buy the cheap one I bought from Walmart a few years ago.</li>
            <li>happy with this product which keeps my dentures firmly in place all day.  </li>
            <li>Far better than Fixodent in application, holding, keeping food from between bridge and gum, and ease of cleanup.</li>
            <li>Not so good as expected</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, it rarely works, but that is probably because my liner is wearing out.</li>
            <li>I will be going back to fixodent free which appears to be a much better product.</li>
            <li>use it all the time, tried other brands and did not hold as good as Poligrip.</li>
            <li>What can I say, if you need it, you need it and this one does not contain zinc and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>it has just the right grip.</li>
            <li>Am I reading you right?  </li>
            <li>The price is right, and the story is a good old fashioned western.</li>
            <li>With this baby you can take bites with pure confidence!</li>
            <li>Hard to find in stores ,works great</li>
            <li>THE FIRST FOUR DID NOT COUNT.</li>
            <li>I then tried it again after the manufacturer suggested hot water, ice water and mouth wash.</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>CONSISTENTLY EXCELLANT</li>
            <li>I have a complete upper plate and eating would be very challenging without it.</li>
            <li>It really holds!</li>
            <li>So much easier buying it n bulk!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used poligrip.</li>
            <li>Having dentures relined is quite pricey (in our present economy) but Poligrip is more than an acceptable option.</li>
            <li>Glad the product is back,</li>
            <li>It last longer than most gels/creams.  </li>
            <li>Even when you are eating something hot it still holds up.</li>
            <li>Price is more than double the prices in every grocery and drug store in town (Redding, CA).  </li>
            <li>I have tried many denture adhesives and this one is the only one that really lasts all day.</li>
            <li>does not work as good as poligrip has worked in the past.</li>
            <li>I buy this all the time for my mother, especially like that it is Zinc Free and feel safe because she uses it all day long.  </li>
            <li>Yep, the chewing of peanuts loosens things up better than my trying to pry them loose with my</li>
            <li>for the upper one works just fine.</li>
            <li>I have tried the other brands and this is the best long lasting paste/cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It holds really well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li>Use sparingly, because it really holds.</li>
            <li>and it is very costly</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why Zinc is so promoted as NOT being in it since zinc is important to the male.</li>
            <li>But thanks for the fast delivery</li>
            <li>this product are very god</li>
            <li>Is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product now for almost a year its not as grimy as the other brand I had tried and it holds better.</li>
            <li>keep looking if you want an average product or better.</li>
            <li>Even though there is no expiration date on this item, if it is older than 8 months it is considered to be no longer useable.</li>
            <li>Price is comparable to the price in local stores, but love  the convenience of having several on hand.</li>
            <li>Would highly recomment</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s the most reliable so far, having tried 2 other brands.</li>
            <li>Great gag to lay on the counter if ya want to ditch those blind dates..</li>
            <li>I think the mailman had something heavy on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I know once I&#x27;ve applied Poligrip, I can be assured they&#x27;ll hold long and true</li>
            <li>Beats retail and other box store prices with no tax and free delivery.  </li>
            <li>I live in an earthquake zone and it occurred to me that I didn&#x27;t have any spare adhesive on hand if supplies were ever cut off after a disaster.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last all day as hot drinks,soda and even water weaken its&#x27; grip.</li>
            <li>We have tried other products but went back to Poligrip, and are pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>By having it sent automatically at certain intervals, I don&#x27;t have to make extra shopping trips because my husband didn&#x27;t tell me he was almost out.</li>
            <li>it is a very good product lasts 24 hours in your mouth and doesn&#x27;t taste bad i recomend to anybody who need it</li>
            <li>If you want your dentures in place then you don&#x27;t buy any other product - you buy Super Poligrip and wrangle that denture into submission.</li>
            <li>The only way to buy Poligrip when you use it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>and they told me it was 14 months old and suggested that I should not try to use it.</li>
            <li>It is no longer soft as it should be.</li>
            <li>bought for 97 yr old mom.</li>
            <li>But they have zero inventory at the moment (9/29/14) because of recall over zinc class action suits.  </li>
            <li>I have had full dentures for years, and my gum ridge is worn down so that realignment is not practical.  </li>
            <li>Except for one small detail:  all poligrip here was already zinc free.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Poligrip&#x27;s new adhesive, and found it has had an improvement added to it since I used it last.  </li>
            <li>MAJOR RIP OFF.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;they should find a better solution for the high price you have to pay, they are very,very expenisve, way to expensive.</li>
            <li>The opening of the tube is a little bigger than on the Fixodent, so if not careful, it squeezes out a little more cream than needed.</li>
            <li>&quot; \\&quot;zinc free\\&quot; Poligrip leaves absolutely \\&quot;no\\&quot; nasty metal taste and gives all day security with that comfortable custom fit like when my dentures were new.</li>

            <li> Yes, I&#x27;ll recomended this product to any one that use dentures, it&#x27;s very safe and without any taste of zinc.</li>

            <li> : This is a nice product i like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my brother and he liked it.</li>
            <li> fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Amazons price is as good or better than I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews before I bought the Zinc Free Poligrip, and am glad that I tried it!!</li>
            <li> I love buying in this quantity as price is better than any grocery or drugstore around here!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> My husband has used almost everything and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> works very fine</li>
            <li> i did not hear any complaints from her and her smile looks nice!    </li>
            <li> Sticks good incorrect tubes sent &amp;#34;Mini&amp;#34; travel tubes sent and I ordered/paid for full size tubes</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, very pleased with it and love the fact that it is Zinc Free.  </li>
            <li> However, he likes it because it&#x27;s still better than the others.</li>
            <li> much more hold than Fixodent.  </li>
            <li> Selleck is one of my favorite actors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at the top of my list at the moment for&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the price and convenience of shopping for it</li>
            <li> - I like it better than any of the others I have tried...</li>
            <li> I wish they still had zinc in this product because it held better.</li>
            <li> It has been my experience with Denture Adhesives, that this one works better than the &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Much better than Fixodent.</li>
            <li> Holds all day and zinc free!</li>
            <li> I use this product on a regular basis and it has always worked best for me.</li>
            <li> Does not go 24 hours as advertised, goes from 10 to 18 hours at most. .</li>
            <li> this is for all  my shopping on amazon love it -  </li>
            <li> one stop  better then slced bread----------------</li>
            <li> As a denture wearer, I have used many a &#x27;gripping&#x27; product to keep my teeth in place.  </li>
            <li> this has a lot better adhesive</li>
            <li> Have been pleased before.  </li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but wears off quicker than Fixodent.</li>
            <li> I got more of this one for cheaper price.</li>
            <li> What more could one ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 10 yrs...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get any better</li>
            <li> I have an Amazon subscription to save money and make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Costing more all the time.</li>
            <li> i have used this for years and getting it at a better price is even better.</li>
            <li> I use my Poligrip Free every day, and can eat any kind of foods, etc.</li>
            <li> i love it ty for product Poligirp its much much better than others :)</li>
            <li> In my opinion better than Fixodent.</li>
            <li> Great product, much needed, customers are abused by the &amp;#34;legal&amp;#34; system.</li>
            <li> Excellent product will, definitely order again</li>
            <li> She keeps coming back to Super Poligrip as the one adhesive that holds the best for the longest period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers an excellent way to get one of the better prices for this product and if you have prime (like we do), shipping is free.</li>
            <li> and the hold is pretty good..</li>
            <li> The Poligrip Strips are the best even they give you a strange taste and smell and</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy this in New Zealand - great product</li>
            <li> Says it works best, but says if it were pink, it would match his gums.&lt;br /&gt;That makes sense.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, I am glad that so many people have had such a great experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Love Poligrip Free, though.</li>
            <li> Rack up yet another rip off by class action trial lawyers and favored retailers in the distribution system.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything from powders to other pastes, and this Poligrip is the best I can find.  </li>
            <li> An easy adjustment to make after applying it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> It holds strong.</li>
            <li> WORKS FINE.</li>
            <li> Super Poligrip would not have been able to do that.</li>
            <li> Have Used super poligrip for many years.  </li>
            <li> He prefers this \\&quot;super\\&quot; zinc free, free type.</li>
            <li> Poligrip Free has no taste or odor</li>
            <li> I think this product would fit my needs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even the zinc free variety.</li>
            <li> works great and the bulk pack will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Great price, compared to the stores locally!!</li>
            <li> A couple of times I haven&#x27;t been able to remove my dentures at night it still has good holding power the next morning.</li>
            <li> Very handy to order from amazon in a larger quantity than depend on tube by tube purchases.</li>
            <li> Very economical to purchase from Amazon---</li>
            <li> particular kind.  </li>
            <li> If you want a really good adhesive you most need to bought the poligrip cream blue ultra fresh.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Super Poligrip Zinc Free Denture Adhesive Cream,</li>
            <li> B001G7QSXO Super Poligrip Zinc Free Denture Adhesive Cream, 2.4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will look for true 24 hours hold.</li>
            <li> Great price cheaper than, the other stores</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and intact.  </li>
            <li> first, it worked great as long as I did not eat anything.</li>
            <li> Super Poligrip keeps my dectures in place.</li>
            <li> and it was available at a reasonable price &amp;#34;THEN&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li> If I loose too many more teeth, I&#x27;ll be trying it out too.</li>
            <li> this is good and not to buy the cheap one I bought from Walmart a few years ago.</li>
            <li> happy with this product which keeps my dentures firmly in place all day.  </li>
            <li> Far better than Fixodent in application, holding, keeping food from between bridge and gum, and ease of cleanup.</li>
            <li> Not so good as expected</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, it rarely works, but that is probably because my liner is wearing out.</li>
            <li> I will be going back to fixodent free which appears to be a much better product.</li>
            <li> use it all the time, tried other brands and did not hold as good as Poligrip.</li>
            <li> What can I say, if you need it, you need it and this one does not contain zinc and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> it has just the right grip.</li>
            <li> Am I reading you right?  </li>
            <li> The price is right, and the story is a good old fashioned western.</li>
            <li> With this baby you can take bites with pure confidence!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores ,works great</li>
            <li> THE FIRST FOUR DID NOT COUNT.</li>
            <li> I then tried it again after the manufacturer suggested hot water, ice water and mouth wash.</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> CONSISTENTLY EXCELLANT</li>
            <li> I have a complete upper plate and eating would be very challenging without it.</li>
            <li> It really holds!</li>
            <li> So much easier buying it n bulk!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used poligrip.</li>
            <li> Having dentures relined is quite pricey (in our present economy) but Poligrip is more than an acceptable option.</li>
            <li> Glad the product is back,</li>
            <li> It last longer than most gels/creams.  </li>
            <li> Even when you are eating something hot it still holds up.</li>
            <li> Price is more than double the prices in every grocery and drug store in town (Redding, CA).  </li>
            <li> I have tried many denture adhesives and this one is the only one that really lasts all day.</li>
            <li> does not work as good as poligrip has worked in the past.</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time for my mother, especially like that it is Zinc Free and feel safe because she uses it all day long.  </li>
            <li> Yep, the chewing of peanuts loosens things up better than my trying to pry them loose with my</li>
            <li> for the upper one works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other brands and this is the best long lasting paste/cream.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It holds really well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li> Use sparingly, because it really holds.</li>
            <li> and it is very costly</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why Zinc is so promoted as NOT being in it since zinc is important to the male.</li>
            <li> But thanks for the fast delivery</li>
            <li> this product are very god</li>
            <li> Is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for almost a year its not as grimy as the other brand I had tried and it holds better.</li>
            <li> keep looking if you want an average product or better.</li>
            <li> Even though there is no expiration date on this item, if it is older than 8 months it is considered to be no longer useable.</li>
            <li> Price is comparable to the price in local stores, but love  the convenience of having several on hand.</li>
            <li> Would highly recomment</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s the most reliable so far, having tried 2 other brands.</li>
            <li> Great gag to lay on the counter if ya want to ditch those blind dates..</li>
            <li> I think the mailman had something heavy on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I know once I&#x27;ve applied Poligrip, I can be assured they&#x27;ll hold long and true</li>
            <li> Beats retail and other box store prices with no tax and free delivery.  </li>
            <li> I live in an earthquake zone and it occurred to me that I didn&#x27;t have any spare adhesive on hand if supplies were ever cut off after a disaster.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day as hot drinks,soda and even water weaken its&#x27; grip.</li>
            <li> We have tried other products but went back to Poligrip, and are pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> By having it sent automatically at certain intervals, I don&#x27;t have to make extra shopping trips because my husband didn&#x27;t tell me he was almost out.</li>
            <li> it is a very good product lasts 24 hours in your mouth and doesn&#x27;t taste bad i recomend to anybody who need it</li>
            <li> If you want your dentures in place then you don&#x27;t buy any other product - you buy Super Poligrip and wrangle that denture into submission.</li>
            <li> The only way to buy Poligrip when you use it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> and they told me it was 14 months old and suggested that I should not try to use it.</li>
            <li> It is no longer soft as it should be.</li>
            <li> bought for 97 yr old mom.</li>
            <li> But they have zero inventory at the moment (9/29/14) because of recall over zinc class action suits.  </li>
            <li> I have had full dentures for years, and my gum ridge is worn down so that realignment is not practical.  </li>
            <li> Except for one small detail:  all poligrip here was already zinc free.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Poligrip&#x27;s new adhesive, and found it has had an improvement added to it since I used it last.  </li>
            <li> MAJOR RIP OFF.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they should find a better solution for the high price you have to pay, they are very,very expenisve, way to expensive.</li>
            <li> The opening of the tube is a little bigger than on the Fixodent, so if not careful, it squeezes out a little more cream than needed.</li>
            <li> &quot; \\&quot;zinc free\\&quot; Poligrip leaves absolutely \\&quot;no\\&quot; nasty metal taste and gives all day security with that comfortable custom fit like when my dentures were new.</li>
            <li> Though I recently got a new upper denture and need less of this product.  </li>
            <li> Stays far longer and smoother than any other brand.</li>
            <li> but, does not last as long.</li>
            <li> for price it is far below the typical drugstore pricing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dentures only a few years, but after losing a considerable amount of weight my dentures no longer had that \\&quot;custom fit.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Thus far, the dentures are tight.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Food does not get trapped inside with this product and holding time is considerable.  </li>
            <li> I continually go back to using this although I have tried all other creams, adhesive pads, etc.</li>
            <li> I shop it for my mother because she is very long and ned it every day</li>
            <li> Having dentures is NOT fun, but necessary.  </li>
            <li> I am not able to get this product in the stores near me.</li>
            <li> It took half an hour to remove all the glue from my gums which left them bleeding.</li>
            <li> Last order seems somewhat discolored, very thick and perhaps old.  </li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s cheaper than the pink also.</li>
            <li> What does someone say about an denture adhesive other than it works and has no zinc.</li>
            <li> My dentures, yes uppers and lowers, stay in all day with absolutely no problems!</li>
            <li> me, Poligrip holds stronger, longer than the other one.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Have had issues with other Poligrip that didn&#x27;t hold all day.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands, no luck.</li>
            <li> Holds very firmly, but it holds so tight that for a new denture wearer it is hard to remove dentures.</li>
            <li> He uses a small amount and gets long all day control.</li>
            <li> some want u to spit yer teeth out and go down on them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even less than Wal-Mart&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who usually uses the pink box.but</li>
            <li> I ordered online for a friend because all the stores in our little town are always sold out of this one</li>
            <li> it is just very hard to get out of the tube and does not properly hold the dentures.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve followed carefully the instructions but even so the product haven&#x27;t show a satisfactory gluing power (at least the units sent to us).</li>
            <li> works well and has a firm hold</li>
            <li> I used Fixodent Comfort for quite a few years but decided to change to Polident, since it does not contain any Zinc.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get off my denture for cleaning but what the heck, life is not perfect right?  </li>
            <li> Mom would use none other!!!  </li>
            <li> bought this for my mother who is not able to get to a store.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied this time at all.</li>
            <li> Do not bill me for no more polident or bill me for anymore</li>
            <li> It Works Not sure I got a bargain</li>
            <li> Not sure about the quality as I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The side effects from zinc are very bad and when I found out this one was zinc free, I was sold.  </li>
            <li> Not runny or thin like other brands.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS AT LEAST THE FITH TIME I HAVE HAD TO REVIEW THIS, GUESS</li>
            <li> hopefully the state taxes being implimented will keep the amazon purchase of  this product less expensive than the stores.</li>
            <li> less expensive from amazon, too.</li>
            <li> The hold is not good at all.</li>
            <li> No more loosey goosey dentures that will make for an uncomfortable meal.</li>
            <li> not great but</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t let food get in behind dentures.</li>
            <li> Got tired of looking for it in the store and they would be out of stock.</li>
            <li> Painful cracked heels are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> The poor guy who said it didn&#x27;t stick well, must be alkaline or something!  </li>
            <li> the worst part is how to open them, its making you angry and upsets you every day, they never hold on the lower denture, as soon as you eat a bite</li>
            <li> sorry I couldn&#x27;t rate it lower.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> In the beginning Poligrip was made with a zinc base and left a horrible taste in ones mouth.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Works great! The best is it is zinc free.</li>
            <li> Far better than Fixodent in application, holding, keeping food from between bridge and gum, and ease of cleanup.</li>
            <li> What can I say, if you need it, you need it and this one does not contain zinc and the price is right.  By having it sent automatically at certain intervals, I don&#x27;t have to make extra shopping trips because my husband didn&#x27;t tell me he was almost out.</li>
            <li> bought this for my mother who is not able to get to a store.  decided she needed a stockpile.  she&#x27;s happy with her \\&quot;stash\\&quot; of poligrip.</li>
            <li> We order this item on Subscribe/Save, which makes it cheaper than purchasing locally, no shipping costs, plus then it&#x27;s stocked in our home as well. My husband uses this item. He says it&#x27;s the most reliable so far, having tried 2 other brands. He prefers this \\&quot;super\\&quot; zinc free, free type. The only drawback to him is the fact that before the end of the day, it \\&quot;gives out\\&quot;, which the company attributes to \\&quot;ill-fitting\\&quot; dentures.....a point that&#x27;s indeed moot.  However, he likes it because it&#x27;s still better than the others.</li>
            <li> This is all my husband uses and can&#x27;t find it in the stores anywhere.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve followed carefully the instructions but even so the product haven&#x27;t show a satisfactory gluing power (at least the units sent to us).</li>
            <li> much more hold than Fixodent.  Can&#x27;t ever find it in the stores.  THe Polident is always sold out.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product!!!!</li>
            <li> I like Poligrip because there is no taste. and the hold is pretty good..not great but enough hold for a couple of days!</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;ll recomended this product to any one that use dentures, it&#x27;s very safe and without any taste of zinc.</li>
            <li> What does someone say about an denture adhesive other than it works and has no zinc.</li>
            <li> Keeps my dentures in place for days if I want it to.  Not runny or thin like other brands.  Poligrip Free has no taste or odor so it does not intefere with enjoyment of foods.  I can eat anything I want.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews before I bought the Zinc Free Poligrip, and am glad that I tried it!! The poor guy who said it didn&#x27;t stick well, must be alkaline or something!  My dentures, yes uppers and lowers, stay in all day with absolutely no problems! I&#x27;ve used two of my four tubes, and will re-order when I start the last tube.  I am a very Happy Camper with Zinc Free Poligrip!!</li>
            <li> Arrive on time. Great product</li>
            <li> a good product at a good price. I just got dentures and this product makes it possible for me to eat. I like the ability to order in bulk.</li>
            <li> Selleck is one of my favorite actors.  The price is right, and the story is a good old fashioned western.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my husband. He uses a small amount and gets long all day control.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AT LEAST THE FITH TIME I HAVE HAD TO REVIEW THIS, GUESS THE FIRST FOUR DID NOT COUNT. VERY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Great product. Has no taste with a great hold</li>
            <li> I decided to try Poligrip&#x27;s new adhesive, and found it has had an improvement added to it since I used it last.  I was pleasantly&lt;br /&gt;surprised and I do not encounter a problem replacing it in case I let myself run out.  It&#x27;s at the top of my list at the moment for&lt;br /&gt;this purpose.</li>
            <li> I would just like to know ware my poligrip is for sept I am supposed to get it everymonth on the 4 of each month and did not get it for sept</li>
            <li> Have always used Poligrip since I got dentures -- and it is the best product for me.  Love the price and convenience of shopping for it onl ne.  I&#x27;ll do it this way from now on</li>
            <li> very effective for holding dentures in place without any taste in mouth&lt;br /&gt;and for price it is far below the typical drugstore pricing</li>
            <li> I have found this to be the best paste for dentures. I have used it for years and am now glad to get it at Amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li> This one works the best for me.  Though I recently got a new upper denture and need less of this product.  It is difficult to get off my denture for cleaning but what the heck, life is not perfect right?  Arrived quickly and intact.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product. It is all he will use so it does a good job for him. Holds all day.</li>
            <li> I put it to the test. It&#x27;s the best.  It holds strong. No taste to it white in color. Try it you&#x27;ll like it. I would recommend it for your dentures. And the sellar.</li>
            <li> Zinc free, holds beautifully.</li>
            <li> This product works fairly good.Doesn&#x27;t last all day as hot drinks,soda and even water weaken its&#x27; grip.Price is about the same as the big box retailer so I will buy there in the future.I didn&#x27;t like the ordering button as it is set by default for&amp;#34;automatic reordering&amp;#34;,so be very sure you change it to &amp;#34;one time&amp;#34; unless you want to keep getting it.(This is an underhanded trick some online merchants use,which reflects on their credibility in my opinion)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time. It holds really well. A couple of times I haven&#x27;t been able to remove my dentures at night it still has good holding power the next morning. I like the fact that the product does not contain zinc.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other brands and this is the best long lasting paste/cream.</li>
            <li> bought this for my mother in law. she had to have this item only. was sold as advertised and shipped promptly.  i did not hear any complaints from her and her smile looks nice!    UPDATE 01-16-15:  she never had me replace this product and so it must not be to her liking.  keep looking if you want an average product or better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - I like it better than any of the others I have tried...</li>
            <li> Husband likes this product.  Says it works best, but says if it were pink, it would match his gums.&lt;br /&gt;That makes sense.  Why not?  Good for denture wearers.</li>
            <li> I wish they still had zinc in this product because it held better. I understand why they took it out but it&#x27;s just not the same product I used for years.</li>
            <li> Not so good as expected</li>
            <li> it is a very good product lasts 24 hours in your mouth and doesn&#x27;t taste bad i recomend to anybody who need it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li> Having dentures is NOT fun, but necessary.  Food does not get trapped inside with this product and holding time is considerable.  I love buying in this quantity as price is better than any grocery or drugstore around here!</li>
            <li> It has been my experience with Denture Adhesives, that this one works better than the &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34; one.&lt;br /&gt;For me, Poligrip holds stronger, longer than the other one.&lt;br /&gt;Also clean-up is easier with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and it works kinda.... she has to repeat applications during the day to hold the lower denture... for the upper one works just fine.</li>
            <li> No taste which is great. Also keeps your denture in place for days</li>
            <li> The only way to buy Poligrip when you use it as much as I do. Buy in bulk with a 4pkg deal.</li>
            <li> I think this product would fit my needs I have bought this Denture Adhesive Cream because I read the recommendation of others amazon buyers</li>
            <li> Good deal, good quality, and aid in its function of protecting and supporting the teeth, two in one, and very good product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it worked great as long as I did not eat anything. Drinking water was borderline okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it rarely works, but that is probably because my liner is wearing out. Today, I tried an Equate brand and am eating an avocado to see how it fares. Thus far, the dentures are tight. Super Poligrip would not have been able to do that. As soon as the saliva began flowing, it would loosen on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I am glad that so many people have had such a great experience with this product. Perhaps only people with &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; gums have a problem, especially those of us whose jaw decayed in parts before the tooth got pulled.</li>
            <li> I continually go back to using this although I have tried all other creams, adhesive pads, etc. I prefer this cream because of overall features in bonding, cleaning, removing and lasting power.</li>
            <li> good product for uppers</li>
            <li> Only one that works for me</li>
            <li> My wife has dentures and has tried a number of different brands of denture adhesive. She keeps coming back to Super Poligrip as the one adhesive that holds the best for the longest period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers an excellent way to get one of the better prices for this product and if you have prime (like we do), shipping is free.</li>
            <li> I used this twice. It took half an hour to remove all the glue from my gums which left them bleeding. I then tried it again after the manufacturer suggested hot water, ice water and mouth wash. Same thing.  Never ever again!</li>
            <li> Works for me and lasts for 24 to 48 hours. Even forget that I have it still after a couple of days. Will order next time.</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time for my mother, especially like that it is Zinc Free and feel safe because she uses it all day long.  It does the job and is a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Much better than Fixodent. Only adhesive I use. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Even though there is no expiration date on this item, if it is older than 8 months it is considered to be no longer useable. I called Polygrip and gave them the number on the package and they told me it was 14 months old and suggested that I should not try to use it. There is no health concern it is just very hard to get out of the tube and does not properly hold the dentures. It is no longer soft as it should be.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for people with dentures, thank you</li>
            <li> Great product!  Holds all day and zinc free!</li>
            <li> I use this product on a regular basis and it has always worked best for me. Having it delivered on a regular basis is such a plus. Packaging is great and I recommend the product and the auto delivery to anyone who uses this like myself on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> We shouldn&#x27;t need to worry about poisoning ourselves wearing dentures. Poligrip does the job, with no zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can you want?!</li>
            <li> it has just the right grip. I add the poligrip powder for a longer hold and in combination it holds through 2 meals.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be the best for holding in my dentures.  The package arrived slighly squashed and the lids of the boxes were open because of it.  I think the mailman had something heavy on top of it.  Love Poligrip Free, though.</li>
            <li> Does not go 24 hours as advertised, goes from 10 to 18 hours at most. . Otherwise good value, but will not buy this again. Will look for true 24 hours hold.</li>
            <li> this is for all  my shopping on amazon love it -  one stop  better then slced bread----------------</li>
            <li> As a denture wearer, I have used many a &#x27;gripping&#x27; product to keep my teeth in place.  I know once I&#x27;ve applied Poligrip, I can be assured they&#x27;ll hold long and true no matter what I eat.</li>
            <li> Great price cheaper than, the other stores</li>
            <li> My mom just loved it!</li>
            <li> Sticks good incorrect tubes sent &amp;#34;Mini&amp;#34; travel tubes sent and I ordered/paid for full size tubes</li>
            <li> My nana says it works great and she lovers the price!</li>
            <li> good stuff without the zinc</li>
            <li> If you want a really good adhesive you most need to bought the poligrip cream blue ultra fresh. this has a lot better adhesive</li>
            <li> Great product and I like this automatic shipping</li>
            <li> it is what it is and does what it is suppose to do.  hopefully the state taxes being implimented will keep the amazon purchase of  this product less expensive than the stores.</li>
            <li> Have been pleased before.  Last order seems somewhat discolored, very thick and perhaps old.  Not satisfied this time at all.</li>
            <li> works well and has a firm hold</li>
            <li> Super Poligrip Zinc Free Denture Adhesive Cream, 2.4-Ounce Tubes: This is a nice product i like it. works very fine</li>
            <li> great ptoduct! I;m waiting for implants, in the meantime, this is a great alternarive!  It works really well! Love It!! TS.</li>
            <li> Great gag to lay on the counter if ya want to ditch those blind dates..some run..some want u to spit yer teeth out and go down on them</li>
            <li> Been using it for about ten years now. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> arrived FIVE hours ahead of scheduled ((big smiles))</li>
            <li> I purchased this for 19.32 back in July and now the price has doubled for the subscribe n save</li>
            <li> CONSISTENTLY EXCELLANT</li>
            <li> use it all the time, tried other brands and did not hold as good as Poligrip.</li>
            <li> This product works well.  Use sparingly, because it really holds.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for years.  It makes wearing dentures comfortable/secure and ensure food does not get underneath. Would highly recomment</li>
            <li> gracias la mama de mi amigo esta muy contenta</li>
            <li> Works OK, but wears off quicker than Fixodent.</li>
            <li> MOM USES THIS.  AND IT IS A GREAT PRICE, more for stock.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use poligrip and ordered it because the prices in the store continue to rise and we like to keep enough on hand so we don&#x27;t run out can&#x27;nt eat without it!</li>
            <li> The Poligrip Strips are the best even they give you a strange taste and smell and the worst part is how to open them, its making you angry and upsets you every day, they never hold on the lower denture, as soon as you eat a bite the holding part is over,&lt;br /&gt;they should find a better solution for the high price you have to pay, they are very,very expenisve, way to expensive.</li>
            <li> Am I reading you right?  $240 dollars for a $4 item (x&#x27;s 4 pack) yeah good luck&lt;br /&gt;Just sorry I couldn&#x27;t rate it lower. Oh maybe that&#x27;s for 60 pcs. That would be the correct amount.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy this in New Zealand - great product</li>
            <li> When I just about out.</li>
            <li> I have the subscription deal that permits me to adjust the deliveries or cancel it altogether. This is a quality product with a savings and it gets delivered to my door! It&#x27;s even the zinc free variety. I live in an earthquake zone and it occurred to me that I didn&#x27;t have any spare adhesive on hand if supplies were ever cut off after a disaster. I have a complete upper plate and eating would be very challenging without it. I checked the label and it appears that the adhesive only has a shelf life after it&#x27;s been opened.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who usually uses the pink box.but I got more of this one for cheaper price.I personally think he uses a lot and it is very costly but I found this the best out there.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product since my husband got his dentures.  We have tried other products but went back to Poligrip, and are pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Do not bill me for no more polident or bill me for anymore</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand and have been using it for years to keep my bridge in. It really holds!</li>
            <li> Would not use anything else, she says.</li>
            <li> I have tried many denture adhesives and this one is the only one that really lasts all day.I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Super Poligrip keeps my dectures in place. Have not spit them out in public yet. What more could one ask for?</li>
            <li> Price is comparable to the price in local stores, but love  the convenience of having several on hand.</li>
            <li> purchased for my mom...works great and the bulk pack will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Been using for years. Stays far longer and smoother than any other brand. Don&#x27;t know why Zinc is so promoted as NOT being in it since zinc is important to the male.</li>
            <li> Worked as described. It&#x27;s a gift for my brother and he liked it. He said, &amp;#34; this is good and not to buy the cheap one I bought from Walmart a few years ago.</li>
            <li> GOTTA HAVE IT. WORKS FINE.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over two years before putting on socks and before bedtime. Painful cracked heels are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 10 yrs...Great product!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get any better</li>
            <li> Seems like the product is expired. Doesn&#x27;t hold as well as the product purchased in the store.&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase this agin.</li>
            <li> does not hold all day</li>
            <li> So much easier buying it n bulk!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used poligrip. I am not impressed. The hold is not good at all. I will be going back to fixodent free which appears to be a much better product.</li>
            <li> Very good. Recommend for others</li>
            <li> I ordered online for a friend because all the stores in our little town are always sold out of this one particular kind.  Makes me think this must be the best one to use.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my mom and she loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It Works Not sure I got a bargain but that is on me. Seller met all his obligations with no issues.</li>
            <li> Excellent product will do my annual purchase recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the best product out of all the ones on the market.  Holds all day with confidence</li>
            <li> Mom would use none other!!!  States leaves &amp;#34;no taste&amp;#34; in her mouth to mask food taste; also is her definite preference for strongest hold. Great price, compared to the stores locally!!</li>
            <li> I have had full dentures for years, and my gum ridge is worn down so that realignment is not practical.  I have tried everything from powders to other pastes, and this Poligrip is the best I can find.  I have an Amazon subscription to save money and make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this because he likes the price. Not sure about the quality as I don&#x27;t use it. But thanks for the fast delivery</li>
            <li> My loved ones won&#x27;t use anything else. If you want your dentures in place then you don&#x27;t buy any other product - you buy Super Poligrip and wrangle that denture into submission. No more loosey goosey dentures that will make for an uncomfortable meal. With this baby you can take bites with pure confidence!</li>
            <li> does not work as good as poligrip has worked in the past. still does the job but, does not last as long. Costing more all the time.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, very pleased with it and love the fact that it is Zinc Free.  Good price on a good product</li>
            <li> I tried the pink stuff Poligrip offers, and this stuff works just as well.  For the price it&#x27;s cheaper than the pink also.</li>
            <li> this product are very god I shop it for my mother because she is very long and ned it every day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dentures only a few years, but after losing a considerable amount of weight my dentures no longer had that \\&quot;custom fit.\\&quot; Having dentures relined is quite pricey (in our present economy) but Poligrip is more than an acceptable option. In the beginning Poligrip was made with a zinc base and left a horrible taste in ones mouth. The \\&quot;new\\&quot; \\&quot;zinc free\\&quot; Poligrip leaves absolutely \\&quot;no\\&quot; nasty metal taste and gives all day security with that comfortable custom fit like when my dentures were new. As a matter of fact, sometimes the only way I can loosen my dentures for nightly cleaning is, I have to eat some peanuts. Yep, the chewing of peanuts loosens things up better than my trying to pry them loose with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Amazons price is as good or better than I&#x27;ve found anywhere. It&#x27;s even less than Wal-Mart&#x27;s price. Since finding this product on Amazon.com I&#x27;m going to make Amazon.com my source for buying Poligrip.</li>
            <li> bought for 97 yr old mom. she says this brand and type is best she&#x27;s ever used. less expensive from amazon, too.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be the best adhesive I can find and I have tried them all.  Try it</li>
            <li> I and my wife use it daily,it adheres  denture very good for eating.I like it. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Product works good and tastes good.  holds dentures in place all day. i have used this for years and getting it at a better price is even better.</li>
            <li> Is the real thing. Great price.</li>
            <li> Have Used super poligrip for many years.  Always works great.  Very handy to order from amazon in a larger quantity than depend on tube by tube purchases.</li>
            <li> Have had issues with other Poligrip that didn&#x27;t hold all day. I tried other brands, no luck. After starting to use this, I do not have to worry about my dentures loosening and gums being tender</li>
            <li> I like it because it works and has no zinc.  The side effects from zinc are very bad and when I found out this one was zinc free, I was sold.  Packaging and prompt delivery was great.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I pay for 4 tubes her what I would pay at store for 2 tubes what a savings</li>
            <li> I use my Poligrip Free every day, and can eat any kind of foods, etc. It has no taste or odor, and works wonderfully&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for almost a year its not as grimy as the other brand I had tried and it holds better.</li>
            <li> I am not able to get this product in the stores near me. It has no zinc and is safer. Works Great !</li>
            <li> This has no zinc and is flavorless nd does a good job keeping teeth in place.No taste so one doesn&#x27;t know it is there. Very good.</li>
            <li> This is the only glue I use as it keeps your teeth in your mouth. Plus it has no taste. Also it comes auto delivery every couple of months so I never run out.</li>
            <li> Glad the product is back,</li>
            <li> Holds very firmly, but it holds so tight that for a new denture wearer it is hard to remove dentures. It does its job.</li>
            <li> My husband has used almost everything and this is by far the best.  It last longer than most gels/creams.  Even when you are eating something hot it still holds up.</li>
            <li> no complain. amazon the best.</li>
            <li> that is  great i love it ty for product Poligirp its much much better than others :)</li>
            <li> ..Works fantastically well!!! Corn on the cob, here I come!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. In my opinion better than Fixodent.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores ,works great</li>
            <li> MAJOR RIP OFF.  Price is more than double the prices in every grocery and drug store in town (Redding, CA).  But they have zero inventory at the moment (9/29/14) because of recall over zinc class action suits.  Except for one small detail:  all poligrip here was already zinc free.  Rack up yet another rip off by class action trial lawyers and favored retailers in the distribution system.  Great product, much needed, customers are abused by the &amp;#34;legal&amp;#34; system.</li>
            <li> Good product at the time ... and it was available at a reasonable price &amp;#34;THEN&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li> As good as advertised</li>
            <li> Excellent product will, definitely order again</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001G7QSXO Super Poligrip Zinc Free Denture Adhesive Cream, 2.4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product which keeps my dentures firmly in place all day.  Very economical to purchase from Amazon---Beats retail and other box store prices with no tax and free delivery.  I have also tried Fixodent and find Poligrip to be better---no harmful zinc and superior grip</li>
            <li> My wife will only use this brand. If I loose too many more teeth, I&#x27;ll be trying it out too.</li>
            <li> It last all day sometimes two. Doesn&#x27;t let food get in behind dentures.</li>
            <li> I used Fixodent Comfort for quite a few years but decided to change to Polident, since it does not contain any Zinc. So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It is also colorless and holds up great throughout the day. The opening of the tube is a little bigger than on the Fixodent, so if not careful, it squeezes out a little more cream than needed. An easy adjustment to make after applying it a couple of times. The price is also excellent on Amazon. Happy I decided t buy it!</li>
            <li> Got tired of looking for it in the store and they would be out of stock.</li>
