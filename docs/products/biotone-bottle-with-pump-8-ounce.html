            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>

            <li>Works very well.</li>

            <li>I really like these massage bottles.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenses way too much liquid with each pump.</li>
            <li>The pump is high quality as well.  </li>
            <li>This bottle arrived and was a little bigger than I expected but fits perfectly into a standard holster.</li>
            <li>I like that it is translucent - much easier to see how much oil is left in the bottle between sessions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple product, just an empty bottle with a pump on top that fits massage belts.</li>
            <li>I like the other lotion bottles better that came from the same company</li>
            <li>I meter the oil into my hands first so if its not the same amount ever time it pumps no problem.</li>
            <li>They pump too much volume in each pump, so you have too much lotion, so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leak, it pumps easily, no wasted product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy having several different bottles for different oils and modalities.</li>
            <li>it is slightly opaque, which I feel helps stop the oil or lotion going rancid so quickly.</li>
            <li>The amount of oil or lotion that comes out is a lot, and that can either be good or bad depending on how much you want to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this with water so far, but you can hear air escaping around the pump area, so not a very tight seal.</li>
            <li>It looks professional, white pump with translucent plastic.</li>
            <li>i actually like the product exactly what i wanted, but i would have expected it to be cheaper considering its just a plastic bottle.</li>

            <li> I am a massage therapist and I ordered this because I needed bottles for cheap and quick. Works very well. I have been using my bottles since March 2013 and it is now May 2013. No clogging or anything. One bottle I have oil and the other lotion no problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle so that I could avoid spills by being able to open and close the top part of the bottle that allows you to pump the oil out.  Well, every time I closed the pump it was really difficult to open it back up again.  I must have closed it too tightly the last time because it absolutely will not open.  I don&#x27;t know if the one I bought was just a bad one, or if they are all like this.  I actually took my facewash bottle out of the shower, cleaned it out, and now use that as a pump bottle and it works much better than this one.  I would not recommend this if you are looking for a good quality bottle.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good quality, standard lotion/oil bottle</li>
            <li> nice to have lotion on the go</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  A good product! I like that it is translucent - much easier to see how much oil is left in the bottle between sessions.</li>
            <li> It meets the basic need of a massage oil bottle, in that it holds and dispenses oil and fits in my holster belt. It looks professional, white pump with translucent plastic. It arrived in a plastic bag, looking clean and sanitary. However, I prefer a bottle that lets me adjust the amount of oil I dispense. Even with a small tap, this oil bottle spits out a lot of oil, and it does come out rather forcefully. I also think it leaks a little bit, when I&#x27;m transporting it I carry it in a plastic bag, and there always seems to be a little oil inside the bag afterward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple product, just an empty bottle with a pump on top that fits massage belts. But this is very well-made and I appreciate the quality and value.  The listing says it&#x27;s \\&quot;...designed specifically to work with creams and lotions,\\&quot; but FYI, I am finding that it is great for massage oil as well. It hasn&#x27;t leaked and has a good seal. Perfect amount of tension/resistance when pushing down the pump, in my opinion. I&#x27;d recommend this product by made by Body Linen. Packaged well, protected from damage effectively. Arrived so clean and new-looking (they are new), in plastic bag. I almost felt like it was silly that I cleaned the two bottles I bought before use (a habit) because these things looked sterilized and perfect already.  Nothing to complain about, and happy to find this item and have it work so flawlessly.  [[ASIN:B001CE31XQ Massage Bottle - White 8 oz with pump]]</li>
            <li> The amount of oil or lotion that comes out is a lot, and that can either be good or bad depending on how much you want to use. I like the other lotion bottles better that came from the same company, they didn&#x27;t have to be unscrewed. The unscrewing takes a lot of energy and time.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality. I am a massage therapist and got this for my oil. The pump did not last long.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.  Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> The bottles were all I had hoped for. Worked perfectly. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Does the job ..perfect. Should have bought more than one though!</li>
            <li> Thanks!! I&#x27;ll always come here for more! ----Thirteen more words required-how lame!! I don&#x27;t want to review anything anymore! ;)</li>
            <li> Fit the bill big time!  Needed a quality pump and this is NOT flimsy at all.  In fact, while I am doing massage I can easily pump with no problem.</li>
            <li> This bottle pumps really well.  I can see the amount of oil that is left in it.  The pump is hard to close by twisting the neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this with water so far, but you can hear air escaping around the pump area, so not a very tight seal. I will update when I have tried with lotion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to store my homemade facial cleanser in...I use the OCM (oil cleansing method) and this bottle is perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t leak, it pumps easily, no wasted product.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and you cant beat the price.Awesome bottle for my massages with my holster!</li>
            <li> I use it to put massage oil and mix essential oils.  The pump works great.  What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I really like these massage bottles. They are a perfect fit for any therapist that likes to use a wide variety of lotions/oils/gels.</li>
            <li> best pump bottle found in this size</li>
            <li> I figured what could be wrong with a pump?  Nothing hi-tech here.  But pump sticks.  Poor quality.</li>
            <li> I use this bottle for massage oil in my business. I like to have the oil heated for clients however, when this is placed in the warmer, the oil leaks from the pumps spout. I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> i actually like the product exactly what i wanted, but i would have expected it to be cheaper considering its just a plastic bottle. i mean i could go out but a product and use the bottle for cheaper than buying this empty bottle lol</li>
            <li> The pump dispenses way too much liquid with each pump. I&#x27;m a massage therapist so I was using this for oil and it squirted oil all over my hand and the floor each time I used it. I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> been using these bottles for several years with massage oil. I meter the oil into my hands first so if its not the same amount ever time it pumps no problem. a good product for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I do not like the pumps that, to lock them you have to press them down, squirting out oil/lotion and then turn them to screw down and lock. I like the ones with the sliding lock mechanism on the pump shaft.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, works well.</li>
            <li> ...it&#x27;s sturdy and holds up to heat.  I purchased this bottle to use in a massage oil warmer.  ( The bottle fit perfectly!). When choosing this bottle, I was concerned that the plastic and seams would not hold up to the heat of the oil warmer.  That has not been the case.  Even when exposed to the highest setting of the warmer, the plastic does not soften.  The pump is high quality as well.  I have used this bottle with both oils and lotions and have not been dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> This bottle arrived and was a little bigger than I expected but fits perfectly into a standard holster. It pumps well - I find others don&#x27;t - and it is slightly opaque, which I feel helps stop the oil or lotion going rancid so quickly. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having several different bottles for different oils and modalities.</li>
            <li> Bottle functions well.  Pumps right amount of lotion each time.</li>
            <li> These are sold at a cheap price, but surprisingly work better than the bottles I buy from a local massage store.  The pump is great, the top doesnt pop off or anything.</li>
            <li> Bottles look fine and I will make them work. They pump too much volume in each pump, so you have too much lotion, so you have to be careful.</li>
