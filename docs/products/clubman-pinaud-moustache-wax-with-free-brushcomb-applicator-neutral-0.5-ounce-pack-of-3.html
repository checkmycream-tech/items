            <li>Works great on Mustache, Beard and Eyebrows!</li>
            <li>Still the best option I have found for a mustache wax.</li>
            <li>Since Walgreens no longer carries it, this is the best way to get it.</li>
            <li>It works great!  </li>
            <li>After researching on the I internet I decided Clubman&#x27;s was my best bet.</li>
            <li>Another review I read suggested Clubman is the best.</li>
            <li>I believe this is the best wax on the market.</li>

            <li>It is very good.</li>
            <li>Very easy to order and inexpensive !!</li>
            <li>The smell is probably best described as a musky type of cologne, with a pleasant soapiness to it.</li>
            <li>This is the best for taming a &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; moustache and making it look good.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for the &amp;#34;unusual&amp;#34; grooming.  </li>

            <li>always a great product and</li>
            <li>, I am extremely happy to have this product in my possession, as it satisfies all my needs for control of the moustache.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>The seller did a great job too.</li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>He curls his moustache every morning using the product and it works great.</li>
            <li>and I was happy to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>A Great price on a great moustacke wax</li>
            <li>Like the title says this is a great product, but not for everybody.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes great handlebar.</li>
            <li>Great price, works as advertised</li>
            <li>Goes in nicely, and the comb does a great job as well!</li>
            <li>Some days it works great, others it doesn&#x27;t cooperate at all.</li>
            <li>i might say best used warm [ throw it in the water you are shaving in ]</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It holds great when you apply a great amount.</li>
            <li>Great aroma as well</li>
            <li>, lemons were a great touch.</li>
            <li>, it works great.</li>
            <li>I happily used it for a number of months.</li>
            <li>Firehouse Wacky Tacky Mustache Wax is SO MUCH BETTER!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the most convenient to apply, but maybe not the best holding.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, firms up especially nice in cooler drier climates.</li>
            <li>Works great for my handsome gent!</li>
            <li>This product should be a continuation of those good choices.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, yes I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>It hold all day, and it smells good too</li>
            <li>It does a good job holding my mustache</li>
            <li>Shipping in good time.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and you owe it to your mustache to give it a try.</li>
            <li>a good note</li>
            <li>Still just as good as it was then</li>
            <li>this one is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Good product works well</li>
            <li>I just ordered some Firehouse Moustache Wax, which is supposed to be some really good stuff.</li>
            <li>holds and smells good</li>
            <li>* Smells good</li>
            <li>great very light  pleasent scent.</li>
            <li>Best &#x27;stache wax I&#x27;ve found yet - holds its shape, easy to apply, easy to wash out, pleasant</li>
            <li>Just make sure you drink your beer thru a straw!  </li>
            <li>If you like Earl Gray Tea, you will love this!  </li>
            <li>The best way to use it is to heat the tube by either putting it in hot water or with a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This wax is great to easily shape and style your mustache.  </li>
            <li>It is very quick drying and has a great hold.</li>
            <li>If not the best price certainly the easiest order.</li>
            <li>The comb is a nice addition as well.</li>
            <li>you can use some beeswax on your peaks to keep them nice and perky if this stuff isn&#x27;t holding it together.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job of maintaining the rest of the stache in the meantime though.</li>
            <li>Check out Movember.com for details on turning ur mustache into a charitable advertisement for men&#x27;s health.  </li>
            <li>My husband was thrilled with my purchase for him.</li>
            <li>Nice sizing and packaging.</li>
            <li>Easly removed with warm water or soap and water.</li>
            <li>Thickens and gives you the ability to style nicely, however beware, you will get dandruff from the product as it dries.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone needing this kind of product.</li>
            <li>Goes on well trains a moustache nicely</li>
            <li>clubman moustache wax works very well, the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>thanks for a great wax and great service.</li>
            <li>nice holding wax for the handlebars</li>
            <li>Stern&#x27;s, Brother&#x27;s Love, and Dr. Dittmar are all good</li>
            <li>A great choice for anyone, who needs to take care of unruly moustache or needs to apply special form to them.</li>
            <li>That makes it very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>it very easy to work in.  </li>
            <li>It holds for hours and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Despite that it had a pleasant aroma and was a good first wax to try.</li>
            <li>It applies just fine, the smell is neutral, and it feels good, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the hold</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to get these this way.</li>
            <li>but I was extremely surprised to find 3 tubes (I guess I didn&#x27;t read the product description or now my luck has been extended now that I have an awesome mustache)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works great, takes bit of practice to get the application amount right</li>
            <li>Creamy consistency makes for easy application, no sacrifice on hold!</li>
            <li>Well first, it didn&#x27;t smell all that great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda manly smelling, my wife approves of it, so I&#x27;m cool.</li>
            <li>Very cheap for the amount of wax your given.</li>
            <li>I love the mustache comb.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes in a pack of three.</li>
            <li>It seems to work ok</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product, it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I now don&#x27;t have to eat his mustache when we make out :) he loves it as do</li>
            <li>The wax keeps some of the more stubborn hair in line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27; have been using this wax for many years.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and it works just the way its described.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a challenge to keep it from going rogue, but I do admit this does a better job than Conk.</li>
            <li>It holds okay,</li>
            <li>Not horrible, BUT NOT what I want under my nose all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of giving it a sincere shot, it&#x27;s not working for me, though I realize there are many satisfied</li>
            <li>It is simply the best.</li>
            <li>If you do mus it up just fix it no need to aply more wax and cleans up with water</li>
            <li>My husband has used Pinaud Moustache Wax for many, many years and he loves it.</li>
            <li>It looks like you might have gotten an inordinate amount of some exotic condiment in your mustache.</li>
            <li>That will have much more hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Outstanding mustache wax and shipping was timely</li>
            <li>its kinda ok I guess...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d probably work great if you stayed indoors all the time, and held really still as not to break the slightest sweat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I now have three of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clubman pinaud is a top-notch wax for that facial hirsute control :)</li>
            <li>great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>And since my hair is mostly grey/white</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used Clubman for over 30 years and have found it much better than the many others i have tried,</li>
            <li>Even Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm worked before I found something better.</li>
            <li>It lasts forever at the amount I&#x27;m using it, though I did buy more to have some in my overnight kit for travel.  </li>
            <li>Pinaud holds much better.</li>
            <li>I use this as eyebrow shaping wax and it works much better than a wax pencil.</li>
            <li>Rated 5 stars as aroma in neutral, and hold almost as all as Firehouse.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a cute brush, but you&#x27;re worth the hand-polished faux-tortiseshell ones here on good ol&#x27; A.</li>
            <li>that said, however, for the price, it&#x27;s not a terrible product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve mostly returned to heaver, non-water-based wax, preferring to put the time into softening and application so i can rely on an all-day hold...</li>
            <li>Glad to find Pinaud again.</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li>My husband has had a handlebar mustache for many years and this is his preferred mustache wax.  </li>
            <li>I received the mustache wax, I have to say that I was extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>My husband used to love this.</li>
            <li>But now he uses Firehouse wax: wacky tacky.</li>
            <li>He says that is way better.</li>
            <li>though perhaps I should do this more often), so its lack-of-hold-when-wet was unproblematic.</li>
            <li>For the people that this product works for I am envious, but from my experience it is more misses then hits</li>
            <li>You can spend $30 on moustache wax but it won&#x27;t work any better than this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, and the hold is medium.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with product and quality.</li>
            <li>Pros: Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>This wax seams to work best when applied to completely dry whiskers.</li>
            <li>As a lifelong practitioner of pogonotrophy (well, since puberty at any rate) my credentials are top-notch.</li>
            <li>My dream of looking like I belong on a whisky bottle is soon becoming</li>
            <li>I have tried other moustache waxes and this is the best for a handle</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands but this is the best wax out there.</li>
            <li>I can easily carry a set with me for touch ups.</li>
            <li>Then I found I could get it thru AMAZON easily.</li>
            <li>Moustache is neat &amp; clean, glad I made this purchase, wax is easy to apply and remains on the moustache all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply b/c</li>
            <li>hope not its easy to apply and remove</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Smells yummy and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It seems to cooperate best in cool, dry weather.</li>
            <li>The cream itself smells fine and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>my moustace is a bit moist, which is fine since this wax is water soluable.  </li>
            <li>For a simpler stache it would be fine</li>
            <li>First, the product serves its mysterious purpose: fashionably sculpting a delightful mustache.</li>
            <li>, this stuff is fine, with the added perk of being easier to work with than a genuine wax.</li>
            <li>The little brush/comb is a perfect applicator, and I also use it when I trim.</li>
            <li>and it worked fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have the white mustache and this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>No problem with the scent, which was a light citrus odor.</li>
            <li>It would have been more useful if it came with a wick.</li>
            <li>My husband has gray mixed in his moustache and the Clubman tames them greatly.  </li>
            <li>buy it for my Dad and he has a fantastic handlebar moustache and this is his product of</li>
            <li>and now he&#x27;s happy that he got his handlebars back!</li>
            <li>This wax is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and pleasing.</li>
            <li>I use a tacky wax if I want to curl my mustache, but this this one is great for regular use.</li>
            <li>After a recommendation, I decided to pick one to try, and I&#x27;m happy enough with this</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x27;Lightly scented&#x27; it is not.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided since November to grow a mighty homeless beard.  </li>
            <li>this white &#x27;neutral&#x27; color worked great.</li>
            <li>good rule of thumb here is, if it squeezes out of a tube, it&#x27;s too soft to do the job.</li>
            <li>The helpful guide is okay, would have appreciated more information.  </li>
            <li>Easy to get in the ol&#x27; &#x27;stache, comes with a comb/applicator which is way better than applying with your fingers for consistent application, Holds the handlebar and the twist</li>
            <li>Yes, my eyebrows - more specifically, my right one.</li>
            <li>The best at keeping my husbsnd&#x27;s 14 inch mustache tame.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy handlebar wax.  </li>
            <li>The main issue I&#x27;m having is that my handlebar curls won&#x27;t stay in place longer than 2 or 3 hours if it&#x27;s a warm day.</li>
            <li>I was able to find it here at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product- Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This is the economical way to purchase-3 packs!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>At first I doubted my need for wax, since I don&#x27;t have a grand moustache with flamboyant tips.  </li>
            <li>THAT THE ORIGINAL CLUBMAN PINAUD MOUSTACHE WAX DID.</li>
            <li>In the morning I will run hot water over the tube to make the wax more pliable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>You aren&#x27;t left with a greasy feel and it has a pleasant &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34; aroma.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this to twirl the corners of my &#x27;stache upwards, based on the many positive reviews seen here.</li>
            <li>for side sleepers that need some help keeping those eyebrows going the right direction - this stuff is really stiff but works great!</li>
            <li>Clubman Pinaud Moustace Wax is great but just be careful with water contact.</li>
            <li>If you are man enough to need some stache wax, then you are already making some good life choices.</li>
            <li>For as clumpy and white as this stuff is it should be like glue, but it has no staying power, get your mustache looking good, walk away from the mirror</li>
            <li>Lately the formula changed, making it creamier and easier to work into my mustache, allowing me to form the best handlebars.</li>
            <li>: Women I don&#x27;t know approach me to tell me how much they love the beard.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting ready to order some more.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell about it.</li>
            <li>It does wash out easy, which can be a problem in hot humid climates, or if you are eating a rack of ribs.</li>
            <li>Creamy, easy to use, L have been using this wax for over 30 years since I first started a handlebar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that what works best is to start with a very small amount, work it in with your fingers, then apply additional wax.</li>
            <li>this is like putting super glue on your stach.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work better than the actual lanolin/beeswax/mineral oil based products, as they are more like Vaseline than they are wax.</li>
            <li>For me, this sets too quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, the more you apply to the stache the more it turns white.</li>
            <li>As usual a very good product.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy this wax again, very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>This product never fails to impress, it&#x27;s cheap on Amazon and works fantastically.</li>
            <li>No unpleasant odor</li>
            <li>, it works well when dry, smells nice and is easy to apply and re-apply.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell of citrus when wet, and it dries quickly and invisibly.  </li>
            <li>If I use too much it can look like I have beard dandruff, but it combs out easily in that case.</li>
            <li>I curl my tips in large crescents and quite finely held together and Clubman does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried SEVERAL brands, and this stuff works better than any of it!</li>
            <li>Maybe my moustache is kevlar or something, but this just won&#x27;t make it curl to a handlebar of any sort until there&#x27;s more than enough that even the neutral wax is easily vislble.</li>
            <li>If a proper handlebar with a lovely fine point and perhaps a curl is your goal, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>My moustache is filled with white  hairs, the wax does a good job of blending to a natural look.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a few weeks now, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had far better results when ditching the comb.</li>
            <li>Smells nice like apple, but its white and doesn&#x27;t keep shape</li>
            <li>Our eyebrows now lay nicely and we only use the wax as needed.  </li>
            <li>Good price not what I expected</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think they are worth the price.</li>
            <li>It also works great to tame the unruly whiskers I call a beard.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, the free brush/comb basically disintegrated (all the teeth broke loose - I think some of the ingredients in the wax attack the plastic - so be sure you clean it every time you use it).  </li>
            <li>I hasve been using for twenty five years; havn&#x27;t found any other wax as good.</li>
            <li>I use it right after showering, so</li>
            <li>He would not look right with his mustache.</li>
            <li>It does wanted it needs to do to insure that my handlebar mustache stays curled in the right direction</li>
            <li>The neutral is just right, but, again cannot find this in stores.</li>
            <li>It smoothed right in and it doesn&#x27;t look waxy or discolored and no one can tell I had to use mustache wax on it.</li>
            <li>With my latest order, the screw on cap snapped in half, so I can&#x27;t put the top on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is good for a one night costume party use or a play, but there are far better waxes for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get a better wax.</li>
            <li>Not great, but very, very good.</li>
            <li>Tried many others - Have not yet found an equal!</li>
            <li>This is my first mustache wax...</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims it will do.</li>
            <li>You might need to re apply more wax later on the day since the wax does wear out.</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>I tried another brand first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was the first &#x27;wax&#x27; product I purchased for my moustache and the one that I have come back to as the most reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this type of product.  </li>
            <li>Then you can comb out your mustache and it will still hold it&#x27;s shape pretty well (if that&#x27;s how you want to wear it).</li>
            <li>I meant to buy neutral my first time</li>
            <li>I have about 6 now haha), I always have a replacement!</li>
            <li>This is the only wax I&#x27;ve tried that holds for anything more than an hour in hot weather.</li>
            <li>WHEN I FIRST STARTED USING THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Always consistent.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to get a solid hold then you need to apply more, but the problem there is begins to get flakey and turn your mustache the color of the cream.</li>
            <li>I now use honest Amish, which has a weak hold but better packaging and over all product in my opinion</li>
            <li>Even when you think you are done, if the light hits your face the right way, the white residue immediately becomes visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to grow out my mustache, and the only moustache wax I could find locally was a generic that wasn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
            <li>but like I said, you pretty much just wear it around the house.</li>
            <li>B008EQ9VJ8 Oster Metal Flea Comb]] works really well to style my whiskers when I first put the wax in</li>
            <li>After much deliberation on what to try for my first foray into waxing my mustache, I decided to try this product.  </li>
            <li>I imagine that had a lot to do with it, and if I had been willing to spend a bit more, there are other brands that claim to hold better in such conditions.  </li>
            <li>small issue is the tube, which is more fragile than I would like; easily ripped or punctured, and then squirts out wax from the rip or hole when the tube is squeezed to get product out of the normal top.</li>
            <li>And , if you wish, it washes out easy enough.  </li>
            <li>Just wanted to twirl the ends, which are long enough to retain a hold if I give them a good twist even without wax.</li>
            <li>in the heat, try some of those almost pure beeswax compounds.</li>
            <li>The comb however is junky and the teeth bend to be unusable after a couple of uses (full disclosure: I wax my entire beard so those come of uses is way more than only a moustache, which it was designed for).</li>
            <li>it washes out easily and leaves my mustache looking and feeling more natural than the heavy bee&#x27;s wax option.</li>
            <li>Nice little comb included.</li>
            <li>It does not hold form as much as I would have thought.  </li>
            <li>This wax changed all that, and was very reliable.</li>
            <li>I whole heartily recommend Pinaud Clubman Moustache Wax.</li>
            <li>I would have continued using it much longer</li>
            <li>I must say , I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really wish they would sell those seperate in a bulk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll do a bang-up job of repulsing members of the opposite gender!</li>
            <li>Plus I really like the lemony-citrus smell (which isn&#x27;t really noticeable after about 10-15 minutes).  </li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li>the plus side, it works really well.</li>
            <li>I was looking for real mustache</li>
            <li>I suspect I would need a MUCH longer mustache for it to do anything with my wiry hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of Pinaud Moustache Wax.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need the applicator for this use.</li>
            <li>Use it very sparingly and it will train your mustache and not get in the way.</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>really???</li>
            <li>Also maybe I am using too much</li>
            <li>The Clubman is much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I am still quite comfortable giving this product 5/5 stars.</li>
            <li>I have been using Clubman for a long time and have no hesitation in strongly recommending it to the mustache men.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the real expensive ones that come in a tiny can - this is much better - and for the price - an incredible deal!</li>
            <li>It works better than any of the other four products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m frugal, no need to pay more for other waxes, when this does the trick.</li>
            <li>It seems to work for me better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and keep coming back to the Original.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look for any other brand any more.</li>
            <li>There must be a better product for someone like me with super thick hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice and soft, but it&#x27;s white and stays white.</li>
            <li>Have use it for a long time and it does the job very well !!!</li>
            <li>If it is applied and combed through your wet moustache grooming is easy.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff every day, as well as a curling iron, it&#x27;s great, odor less and color less, recommended highly!</li>
            <li>It needs better consistency, and a slightly stronger hold.</li>
            <li>Goes straight out parallel to the ground, I rarely have had to readjust it.</li>
            <li>It is white, and looks like dandruff if you do not spend more than several minutes massaging and applying it into the hair.</li>
            <li>Decent price for a 3-tube purchase plus convenient way to purchase from your home via the internet.</li>
            <li>THE MAIN INGREDIENT WAS BEES WAX.</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT MAIN INGREDIENT IS WATER</li>
            <li>A blow dryer on high plus wax can really help to fix natural whisker faults.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff for bad hair I have found.</li>
            <li>Great I got 3 of these useless waxes.</li>
            <li>Safe to use while operating heavy machinery.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that it could hold a bit better, but I live in Tennessee where it gets quite hot and humid in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Cool and dry and this product sins.</li>
            <li>I was using Captain Conk up until I tried this brand and, while this is marginally stronger for shaping your facial hair, you have to be more careful blending it in because it can clump and look like a booger.</li>
            <li>I would very much reccommend this product to anyone wishing to groom their mustache and wanting it to hold its shape for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>, it blends in easy and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with different waxes and treatments for the moustache, as a first purchase though</li>
            <li>The addition of a second coat of higher quality (non creme) wax often does the trick.</li>
            <li>I finally decided that I really didn&#x27;t need to spend the time n effort to wax the stach!</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s humid and hot outside, you can forget it.</li>
            <li>This is the first actual Moustache Wax I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Stays in all day and comes out easily with a little soap and water.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super white and does not dry clear.</li>
            <li>Thankfully Amazon directly carries a 3 pack, cuts down on the shipping/handling versus when it is charged individually, no matter how many tubes you buy.  </li>
            <li>At times it can be difficult to find in stores, so being able to easily order it through Amazon is terrific.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that as far as mustache wax goes, this is terribly weak sauce</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t found any strong clear, non alcohol gel that can tame my eyebrows and keep them in place.</li>
            <li>lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to using Clubman is to make sure that there is a little bit combed evenly through your moustache--and especially combed through the tips (if that&#x27;s what you are going for).</li>
            <li>I purchase this item for my boyfriend, he likes it far better than the hard waxes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gross really.</li>
            <li>As near as I can tell, it is scented with bergamot oil (which gives earl gray tea its distinctive smell.)</li>
            <li>so next time I&#x27;ll get the brown and it doesn&#x27;t hold up to humidity/water very well.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ve ever lost my brush (I haven&#x27;t so far...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely misleading to label it neutral color.</li>
            <li>and when I was using this on my sideburns decided to give it a go on my eyebrow - wow</li>
            <li>I keep a tube in my pocket and it keeps the wax soft.</li>
            <li>people with thicker, straighter facial hair beeswax may be the better option--but if you need something that will tame course, curly and unruly moustache</li>
            <li>The wax seems to be water soluble (washes out easily), so adding a bit of water usually gets rid of any residue for me.  </li>
            <li>but after a short while that cream hardens clear and holds the whole day through--I have never had to reapply from normal daily running-about.</li>
            <li>Introduce any heat or humidity, and the hour or so of wear deteriorates to minutes; certainly not a tacky our right hold.</li>
            <li>Better yet, it requires a very small amount.  </li>
            <li>It was a tin full of much too hard wax.</li>
            <li>do rather enjoy the mustache comb however, but I imagine one can acquire a similar mustache comb elsewhere for far less money and without the excess baggage of sub-par mustache wax.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>highly recommend moustache wax above all others</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging is simple, a tube, and an applicator(which is a real nice addition), but a lack of instructions is a little frustrating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal, because I already have some white hairs, and it makes me look as if I have a few more.</li>
            <li>It had several good reviews and is from a company that is as old as the hills, so I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li>I use a little more brown in the winter, not much bleaching by the sun.</li>
            <li>If that were the only problem I could live with it, but read on...</li>
            <li>I tried light applications, moderate applications, and heavy applications, all with the dandruff look.</li>
            <li>However, a little dab on your finger tip smoothed on will do the trick for smooth brows without having to do anything else all day long</li>
            <li>It works generally well.  </li>
            <li>But it fits in your pocket, and is soft enough to apply and reapply without plucking the whiskers from your lip.</li>
            <li>The natural wax works well with my white moustache and beard.  </li>
            <li>I found this wax much easier to use than the harder varieties that come in glass jars.</li>
            <li>You can also blow dry on low to dry the wax quickly once you put it in.</li>
            <li>As for me, I&#x27;ll be looking for a firmer wax in the near future.</li>
            <li>so not fault really just for additional information for someone that is curious)</li>
            <li>The Clubman wax never gets very thick and can be applied without being warmed up (something I have had to do with other waxes), and it normally can be worked into the hair effectively (though if you are not very very careful your hair will have white flecks in it -- if you are gray-bearded</li>
            <li>I would find loss of hold within the first 2 hours of the day, with the ends of the &#x27;stache drooping down.</li>
            <li>I am a new moustache tender, having only been growing mine since earlier this year.</li>
            <li>As other products in the days of yore have claimed, &#x27;a dab&#x27;ll do ya,&#x27; and that certainly applies to Clubman.</li>
            <li>but my wife mentioned in passing it I did not loose the &amp;#34;handle bar&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Applying too much at first makes a mess.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold as strongly as other waxes I have used, but for everyday use, it is fine.  </li>
            <li>For those who still have dark hair, I suggest you petition Pinaud to make the brown and black available again.</li>
            <li>The pinaud uses a carrier which allows the wax to be applied like a cream, but quickly gives the hold like a very stiff wax.</li>
            <li>You do have to be careful to keep the little comb clean if you use it or it will look as if you have dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Worked great, then lost my stache to chemo. :-(</li>
            <li>traditional real-beeswax tin waxes are what I would most like to use, the thickness, coarseness of the hair, and curliness of my facial hair makes them frustrating to use.</li>
            <li>Very thick and strong smelling.  </li>
            <li>and I get little white bits in my moustache which looks pretty gross.</li>
            <li>scent is pleasant, but is cloying and far too heavy for anything that sits under your nose all day.&lt;br /&gt;After several attempts, I&#x27;ve found that I just can&#x27;t wear it for more than half an hour without developing a sickening headache that aspirin just won&#x27;t touch.</li>
            <li>What a great idea to make something that will be right under your nose ALL DAY LONG smell completely awful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not tried any other mustache waxes, so I have limited experience, but I didn&#x27;t really find a reason to switch because this does an adequate job getting some of those unruly hairs at least going in somewhat the same direction.  </li>
            <li>After a few uses it cracks at the top, and causes the was to get hard when it extrudes from the tube.</li>
            <li>I am an active person, and live in an area that gets lots of rain.  </li>

            <li> Best bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li> Works great on Mustache, Beard and Eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Still the best option I have found for a mustache wax.</li>
            <li> Since Walgreens no longer carries it, this is the best way to get it.</li>
            <li> It works great!  </li>
            <li> After researching on the I internet I decided Clubman&#x27;s was my best bet.</li>
            <li> Another review I read suggested Clubman is the best.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best wax on the market.</li>

            <li> Very easy to order and inexpensive !!</li>
            <li> The smell is probably best described as a musky type of cologne, with a pleasant soapiness to it.</li>
            <li> This is the best for taming a &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; moustache and making it look good.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for the &amp;#34;unusual&amp;#34; grooming.  </li>

            <li> Great price, works as advertised</li>
            <li> Goes in nicely, and the comb does a great job as well!</li>
            <li> Some days it works great, others it doesn&#x27;t cooperate at all.</li>
            <li> i might say best used warm [ throw it in the water you are shaving in ]</li>

            <li> Firehouse Wacky Tacky Mustache Wax is SO MUCH BETTER!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the most convenient to apply, but maybe not the best holding.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, firms up especially nice in cooler drier climates.</li>
            <li> Works great for my handsome gent!</li>
            <li> This product should be a continuation of those good choices.</li>

            <li> Shipping in good time.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and you owe it to your mustache to give it a try.</li>
            <li> a good note</li>
            <li> Still just as good as it was then</li>
            <li> this one is a good choice.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Good product works well</li>
            <li> I just ordered some Firehouse Moustache Wax, which is supposed to be some really good stuff.</li>
            <li> holds and smells good</li>

            <li> Just make sure you drink your beer thru a straw!  </li>
            <li> If you like Earl Gray Tea, you will love this!  </li>
            <li> The best way to use it is to heat the tube by either putting it in hot water or with a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This wax is great to easily shape and style your mustache.  </li>
            <li> It is very quick drying and has a great hold.</li>
            <li> If not the best price certainly the easiest order.</li>
            <li> The comb is a nice addition as well.</li>
            <li> you can use some beeswax on your peaks to keep them nice and perky if this stuff isn&#x27;t holding it together.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job of maintaining the rest of the stache in the meantime though.</li>

            <li> My husband was thrilled with my purchase for him.</li>
            <li> Nice sizing and packaging.</li>
            <li> Easly removed with warm water or soap and water.</li>
            <li> Thickens and gives you the ability to style nicely, however beware, you will get dandruff from the product as it dries.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone needing this kind of product.</li>
            <li> Goes on well trains a moustache nicely</li>
            <li> clubman moustache wax works very well, the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> thanks for a great wax and great service.</li>
            <li> nice holding wax for the handlebars</li>
            <li> Stern&#x27;s, Brother&#x27;s Love, and Dr. Dittmar are all good</li>
            <li> A great choice for anyone, who needs to take care of unruly moustache or needs to apply special form to them.</li>
            <li> That makes it very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> it very easy to work in.  </li>
            <li> It holds for hours and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Despite that it had a pleasant aroma and was a good first wax to try.</li>
            <li> It applies just fine, the smell is neutral, and it feels good, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the hold</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to get these this way.</li>
            <li> but I was extremely surprised to find 3 tubes (I guess I didn&#x27;t read the product description or now my luck has been extended now that I have an awesome mustache)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works great, takes bit of practice to get the application amount right</li>
            <li> Creamy consistency makes for easy application, no sacrifice on hold!</li>
            <li> Well first, it didn&#x27;t smell all that great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda manly smelling, my wife approves of it, so I&#x27;m cool.</li>
            <li> Very cheap for the amount of wax your given.</li>
            <li> I love the mustache comb.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes in a pack of three.</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product, it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I now don&#x27;t have to eat his mustache when we make out :) he loves it as do</li>
            <li> The wax keeps some of the more stubborn hair in line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; have been using this wax for many years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and it works just the way its described.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a challenge to keep it from going rogue, but I do admit this does a better job than Conk.</li>
            <li> It holds okay,</li>
            <li> Not horrible, BUT NOT what I want under my nose all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of giving it a sincere shot, it&#x27;s not working for me, though I realize there are many satisfied</li>
            <li> It is simply the best.</li>
            <li> If you do mus it up just fix it no need to aply more wax and cleans up with water</li>
            <li> My husband has used Pinaud Moustache Wax for many, many years and he loves it.</li>
            <li> It looks like you might have gotten an inordinate amount of some exotic condiment in your mustache.</li>
            <li> That will have much more hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Outstanding mustache wax and shipping was timely</li>
            <li> its kinda ok I guess...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d probably work great if you stayed indoors all the time, and held really still as not to break the slightest sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I now have three of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clubman pinaud is a top-notch wax for that facial hirsute control :)</li>
            <li> great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> And since my hair is mostly grey/white</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used Clubman for over 30 years and have found it much better than the many others i have tried,</li>
            <li> Even Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm worked before I found something better.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever at the amount I&#x27;m using it, though I did buy more to have some in my overnight kit for travel.  </li>
            <li> Pinaud holds much better.</li>
            <li> I use this as eyebrow shaping wax and it works much better than a wax pencil.</li>
            <li> Rated 5 stars as aroma in neutral, and hold almost as all as Firehouse.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a cute brush, but you&#x27;re worth the hand-polished faux-tortiseshell ones here on good ol&#x27; A.</li>
            <li> that said, however, for the price, it&#x27;s not a terrible product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve mostly returned to heaver, non-water-based wax, preferring to put the time into softening and application so i can rely on an all-day hold...</li>
            <li> Glad to find Pinaud again.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li> My husband has had a handlebar mustache for many years and this is his preferred mustache wax.  </li>
            <li> I received the mustache wax, I have to say that I was extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li> My husband used to love this.</li>
            <li> But now he uses Firehouse wax: wacky tacky.</li>
            <li> He says that is way better.</li>
            <li> though perhaps I should do this more often), so its lack-of-hold-when-wet was unproblematic.</li>
            <li> For the people that this product works for I am envious, but from my experience it is more misses then hits</li>
            <li> You can spend $30 on moustache wax but it won&#x27;t work any better than this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, and the hold is medium.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with product and quality.</li>
            <li> Pros: Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> This wax seams to work best when applied to completely dry whiskers.</li>
            <li> As a lifelong practitioner of pogonotrophy (well, since puberty at any rate) my credentials are top-notch.</li>
            <li> My dream of looking like I belong on a whisky bottle is soon becoming</li>
            <li> I have tried other moustache waxes and this is the best for a handle</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but this is the best wax out there.</li>
            <li> I can easily carry a set with me for touch ups.</li>
            <li> Then I found I could get it thru AMAZON easily.</li>
            <li> Moustache is neat &amp; clean, glad I made this purchase, wax is easy to apply and remains on the moustache all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply b/c</li>
            <li> hope not its easy to apply and remove</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It seems to cooperate best in cool, dry weather.</li>
            <li> The cream itself smells fine and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> my moustace is a bit moist, which is fine since this wax is water soluable.  </li>
            <li> For a simpler stache it would be fine</li>
            <li> First, the product serves its mysterious purpose: fashionably sculpting a delightful mustache.</li>
            <li> , this stuff is fine, with the added perk of being easier to work with than a genuine wax.</li>
            <li> The little brush/comb is a perfect applicator, and I also use it when I trim.</li>
            <li> and it worked fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have the white mustache and this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li> No problem with the scent, which was a light citrus odor.</li>
            <li> It would have been more useful if it came with a wick.</li>
            <li> My husband has gray mixed in his moustache and the Clubman tames them greatly.  </li>
            <li> buy it for my Dad and he has a fantastic handlebar moustache and this is his product of</li>
            <li> and now he&#x27;s happy that he got his handlebars back!</li>
            <li> This wax is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and pleasing.</li>
            <li> I use a tacky wax if I want to curl my mustache, but this this one is great for regular use.</li>
            <li> After a recommendation, I decided to pick one to try, and I&#x27;m happy enough with this</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;Lightly scented&#x27; it is not.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided since November to grow a mighty homeless beard.  </li>
            <li> this white &#x27;neutral&#x27; color worked great.</li>
            <li> good rule of thumb here is, if it squeezes out of a tube, it&#x27;s too soft to do the job.</li>
            <li> The helpful guide is okay, would have appreciated more information.  </li>
            <li> Easy to get in the ol&#x27; &#x27;stache, comes with a comb/applicator which is way better than applying with your fingers for consistent application, Holds the handlebar and the twist</li>
            <li> Yes, my eyebrows - more specifically, my right one.</li>
            <li> The best at keeping my husbsnd&#x27;s 14 inch mustache tame.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy handlebar wax.  </li>
            <li> The main issue I&#x27;m having is that my handlebar curls won&#x27;t stay in place longer than 2 or 3 hours if it&#x27;s a warm day.</li>
            <li> I was able to find it here at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product- Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the economical way to purchase-3 packs!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> At first I doubted my need for wax, since I don&#x27;t have a grand moustache with flamboyant tips.  </li>
            <li> THAT THE ORIGINAL CLUBMAN PINAUD MOUSTACHE WAX DID.</li>
            <li> In the morning I will run hot water over the tube to make the wax more pliable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t left with a greasy feel and it has a pleasant &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34; aroma.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this to twirl the corners of my &#x27;stache upwards, based on the many positive reviews seen here.</li>
            <li> for side sleepers that need some help keeping those eyebrows going the right direction - this stuff is really stiff but works great!</li>
            <li> Clubman Pinaud Moustace Wax is great but just be careful with water contact.</li>
            <li> If you are man enough to need some stache wax, then you are already making some good life choices.</li>
            <li> For as clumpy and white as this stuff is it should be like glue, but it has no staying power, get your mustache looking good, walk away from the mirror</li>
            <li> Lately the formula changed, making it creamier and easier to work into my mustache, allowing me to form the best handlebars.</li>
            <li> : Women I don&#x27;t know approach me to tell me how much they love the beard.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting ready to order some more.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell about it.</li>
            <li> It does wash out easy, which can be a problem in hot humid climates, or if you are eating a rack of ribs.</li>
            <li> Creamy, easy to use, L have been using this wax for over 30 years since I first started a handlebar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that what works best is to start with a very small amount, work it in with your fingers, then apply additional wax.</li>
            <li> this is like putting super glue on your stach.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work better than the actual lanolin/beeswax/mineral oil based products, as they are more like Vaseline than they are wax.</li>
            <li> For me, this sets too quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, the more you apply to the stache the more it turns white.</li>
            <li> As usual a very good product.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy this wax again, very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> This product never fails to impress, it&#x27;s cheap on Amazon and works fantastically.</li>
            <li> No unpleasant odor</li>
            <li> , it works well when dry, smells nice and is easy to apply and re-apply.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell of citrus when wet, and it dries quickly and invisibly.  </li>
            <li> If I use too much it can look like I have beard dandruff, but it combs out easily in that case.</li>
            <li> I curl my tips in large crescents and quite finely held together and Clubman does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried SEVERAL brands, and this stuff works better than any of it!</li>
            <li> Maybe my moustache is kevlar or something, but this just won&#x27;t make it curl to a handlebar of any sort until there&#x27;s more than enough that even the neutral wax is easily vislble.</li>
            <li> If a proper handlebar with a lovely fine point and perhaps a curl is your goal, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> My moustache is filled with white  hairs, the wax does a good job of blending to a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks now, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had far better results when ditching the comb.</li>
            <li> Smells nice like apple, but its white and doesn&#x27;t keep shape</li>
            <li> Our eyebrows now lay nicely and we only use the wax as needed.  </li>
            <li> Good price not what I expected</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> It also works great to tame the unruly whiskers I call a beard.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, the free brush/comb basically disintegrated (all the teeth broke loose - I think some of the ingredients in the wax attack the plastic - so be sure you clean it every time you use it).  </li>
            <li> I hasve been using for twenty five years; havn&#x27;t found any other wax as good.</li>
            <li> I use it right after showering, so</li>
            <li> He would not look right with his mustache.</li>
            <li> It does wanted it needs to do to insure that my handlebar mustache stays curled in the right direction</li>
            <li> The neutral is just right, but, again cannot find this in stores.</li>
            <li> It smoothed right in and it doesn&#x27;t look waxy or discolored and no one can tell I had to use mustache wax on it.</li>
            <li> With my latest order, the screw on cap snapped in half, so I can&#x27;t put the top on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is good for a one night costume party use or a play, but there are far better waxes for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get a better wax.</li>
            <li> Not great, but very, very good.</li>
            <li> Tried many others - Have not yet found an equal!</li>
            <li> This is my first mustache wax...</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims it will do.</li>
            <li> You might need to re apply more wax later on the day since the wax does wear out.</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> I tried another brand first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was the first &#x27;wax&#x27; product I purchased for my moustache and the one that I have come back to as the most reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this type of product.  </li>
            <li> Then you can comb out your mustache and it will still hold it&#x27;s shape pretty well (if that&#x27;s how you want to wear it).</li>
            <li> I meant to buy neutral my first time</li>
            <li> I have about 6 now haha), I always have a replacement!</li>
            <li> This is the only wax I&#x27;ve tried that holds for anything more than an hour in hot weather.</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST STARTED USING THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Always consistent.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to get a solid hold then you need to apply more, but the problem there is begins to get flakey and turn your mustache the color of the cream.</li>
            <li> I now use honest Amish, which has a weak hold but better packaging and over all product in my opinion</li>
            <li> Even when you think you are done, if the light hits your face the right way, the white residue immediately becomes visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to grow out my mustache, and the only moustache wax I could find locally was a generic that wasn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
            <li> but like I said, you pretty much just wear it around the house.</li>
            <li> B008EQ9VJ8 Oster Metal Flea Comb]] works really well to style my whiskers when I first put the wax in</li>
            <li> After much deliberation on what to try for my first foray into waxing my mustache, I decided to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I imagine that had a lot to do with it, and if I had been willing to spend a bit more, there are other brands that claim to hold better in such conditions.  </li>
            <li> small issue is the tube, which is more fragile than I would like; easily ripped or punctured, and then squirts out wax from the rip or hole when the tube is squeezed to get product out of the normal top.</li>
            <li> And , if you wish, it washes out easy enough.  </li>
            <li> Just wanted to twirl the ends, which are long enough to retain a hold if I give them a good twist even without wax.</li>
            <li> in the heat, try some of those almost pure beeswax compounds.</li>
            <li> The comb however is junky and the teeth bend to be unusable after a couple of uses (full disclosure: I wax my entire beard so those come of uses is way more than only a moustache, which it was designed for).</li>
            <li> it washes out easily and leaves my mustache looking and feeling more natural than the heavy bee&#x27;s wax option.</li>
            <li> Nice little comb included.</li>
            <li> It does not hold form as much as I would have thought.  </li>
            <li> This wax changed all that, and was very reliable.</li>
            <li> I whole heartily recommend Pinaud Clubman Moustache Wax.</li>
            <li> I would have continued using it much longer</li>
            <li> I must say , I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really wish they would sell those seperate in a bulk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll do a bang-up job of repulsing members of the opposite gender!</li>
            <li> Plus I really like the lemony-citrus smell (which isn&#x27;t really noticeable after about 10-15 minutes).  </li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li> the plus side, it works really well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for real mustache</li>
            <li> I suspect I would need a MUCH longer mustache for it to do anything with my wiry hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of Pinaud Moustache Wax.</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need the applicator for this use.</li>
            <li> Use it very sparingly and it will train your mustache and not get in the way.</li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> really???</li>
            <li> Also maybe I am using too much</li>
            <li> The Clubman is much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I am still quite comfortable giving this product 5/5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clubman for a long time and have no hesitation in strongly recommending it to the mustache men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the real expensive ones that come in a tiny can - this is much better - and for the price - an incredible deal!</li>
            <li> It works better than any of the other four products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frugal, no need to pay more for other waxes, when this does the trick.</li>
            <li> It seems to work for me better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and keep coming back to the Original.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look for any other brand any more.</li>
            <li> There must be a better product for someone like me with super thick hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice and soft, but it&#x27;s white and stays white.</li>
            <li> Have use it for a long time and it does the job very well !!!</li>
            <li> If it is applied and combed through your wet moustache grooming is easy.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every day, as well as a curling iron, it&#x27;s great, odor less and color less, recommended highly!</li>
            <li> It needs better consistency, and a slightly stronger hold.</li>
            <li> Goes straight out parallel to the ground, I rarely have had to readjust it.</li>
            <li> It is white, and looks like dandruff if you do not spend more than several minutes massaging and applying it into the hair.</li>
            <li> Decent price for a 3-tube purchase plus convenient way to purchase from your home via the internet.</li>
            <li> THE MAIN INGREDIENT WAS BEES WAX.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT MAIN INGREDIENT IS WATER</li>
            <li> A blow dryer on high plus wax can really help to fix natural whisker faults.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for bad hair I have found.</li>
            <li> Great I got 3 of these useless waxes.</li>
            <li> Safe to use while operating heavy machinery.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it could hold a bit better, but I live in Tennessee where it gets quite hot and humid in the summer.  </li>
            <li> Cool and dry and this product sins.</li>
            <li> I was using Captain Conk up until I tried this brand and, while this is marginally stronger for shaping your facial hair, you have to be more careful blending it in because it can clump and look like a booger.</li>
            <li> I would very much reccommend this product to anyone wishing to groom their mustache and wanting it to hold its shape for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> , it blends in easy and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with different waxes and treatments for the moustache, as a first purchase though</li>
            <li> The addition of a second coat of higher quality (non creme) wax often does the trick.</li>
            <li> I finally decided that I really didn&#x27;t need to spend the time n effort to wax the stach!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s humid and hot outside, you can forget it.</li>
            <li> This is the first actual Moustache Wax I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Stays in all day and comes out easily with a little soap and water.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super white and does not dry clear.</li>
            <li> Thankfully Amazon directly carries a 3 pack, cuts down on the shipping/handling versus when it is charged individually, no matter how many tubes you buy.  </li>
            <li> At times it can be difficult to find in stores, so being able to easily order it through Amazon is terrific.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that as far as mustache wax goes, this is terribly weak sauce</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t found any strong clear, non alcohol gel that can tame my eyebrows and keep them in place.</li>
            <li> lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to using Clubman is to make sure that there is a little bit combed evenly through your moustache--and especially combed through the tips (if that&#x27;s what you are going for).</li>
            <li> I purchase this item for my boyfriend, he likes it far better than the hard waxes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gross really.</li>
            <li> As near as I can tell, it is scented with bergamot oil (which gives earl gray tea its distinctive smell.)</li>
            <li> so next time I&#x27;ll get the brown and it doesn&#x27;t hold up to humidity/water very well.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve ever lost my brush (I haven&#x27;t so far...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely misleading to label it neutral color.</li>
            <li> and when I was using this on my sideburns decided to give it a go on my eyebrow - wow</li>
            <li> I keep a tube in my pocket and it keeps the wax soft.</li>
            <li> people with thicker, straighter facial hair beeswax may be the better option--but if you need something that will tame course, curly and unruly moustache</li>
            <li> The wax seems to be water soluble (washes out easily), so adding a bit of water usually gets rid of any residue for me.  </li>
            <li> but after a short while that cream hardens clear and holds the whole day through--I have never had to reapply from normal daily running-about.</li>
            <li> Introduce any heat or humidity, and the hour or so of wear deteriorates to minutes; certainly not a tacky our right hold.</li>
            <li> Better yet, it requires a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> It was a tin full of much too hard wax.</li>
            <li> do rather enjoy the mustache comb however, but I imagine one can acquire a similar mustache comb elsewhere for far less money and without the excess baggage of sub-par mustache wax.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> highly recommend moustache wax above all others</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging is simple, a tube, and an applicator(which is a real nice addition), but a lack of instructions is a little frustrating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal, because I already have some white hairs, and it makes me look as if I have a few more.</li>
            <li> It had several good reviews and is from a company that is as old as the hills, so I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I use a little more brown in the winter, not much bleaching by the sun.</li>
            <li> If that were the only problem I could live with it, but read on...</li>
            <li> I tried light applications, moderate applications, and heavy applications, all with the dandruff look.</li>
            <li> However, a little dab on your finger tip smoothed on will do the trick for smooth brows without having to do anything else all day long</li>
            <li> It works generally well.  </li>
            <li> But it fits in your pocket, and is soft enough to apply and reapply without plucking the whiskers from your lip.</li>
            <li> The natural wax works well with my white moustache and beard.  </li>
            <li> I found this wax much easier to use than the harder varieties that come in glass jars.</li>
            <li> You can also blow dry on low to dry the wax quickly once you put it in.</li>
            <li> As for me, I&#x27;ll be looking for a firmer wax in the near future.</li>
            <li> so not fault really just for additional information for someone that is curious)</li>
            <li> The Clubman wax never gets very thick and can be applied without being warmed up (something I have had to do with other waxes), and it normally can be worked into the hair effectively (though if you are not very very careful your hair will have white flecks in it -- if you are gray-bearded</li>
            <li> I would find loss of hold within the first 2 hours of the day, with the ends of the &#x27;stache drooping down.</li>
            <li> I am a new moustache tender, having only been growing mine since earlier this year.</li>
            <li> As other products in the days of yore have claimed, &#x27;a dab&#x27;ll do ya,&#x27; and that certainly applies to Clubman.</li>
            <li> but my wife mentioned in passing it I did not loose the &amp;#34;handle bar&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Applying too much at first makes a mess.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold as strongly as other waxes I have used, but for everyday use, it is fine.  </li>
            <li> For those who still have dark hair, I suggest you petition Pinaud to make the brown and black available again.</li>
            <li> The pinaud uses a carrier which allows the wax to be applied like a cream, but quickly gives the hold like a very stiff wax.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful to keep the little comb clean if you use it or it will look as if you have dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Worked great, then lost my stache to chemo. :-(</li>
            <li> traditional real-beeswax tin waxes are what I would most like to use, the thickness, coarseness of the hair, and curliness of my facial hair makes them frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> Very thick and strong smelling.  </li>
            <li> and I get little white bits in my moustache which looks pretty gross.</li>
            <li> scent is pleasant, but is cloying and far too heavy for anything that sits under your nose all day.&lt;br /&gt;After several attempts, I&#x27;ve found that I just can&#x27;t wear it for more than half an hour without developing a sickening headache that aspirin just won&#x27;t touch.</li>
            <li> What a great idea to make something that will be right under your nose ALL DAY LONG smell completely awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried any other mustache waxes, so I have limited experience, but I didn&#x27;t really find a reason to switch because this does an adequate job getting some of those unruly hairs at least going in somewhat the same direction.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses it cracks at the top, and causes the was to get hard when it extrudes from the tube.</li>
            <li> I am an active person, and live in an area that gets lots of rain.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any mess, and smells decent.</li>
            <li> have fairly stiff facial hair and this wax did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> As other have indicated it washes out easily with water and a very small amount of soap.</li>
            <li> Put a small amount on your first finget put half on the first finger of your other hand rub your fingers and thumb together then apply to moustache.</li>
            <li> I have found most real-wax products to be tedious and difficult to work through (often requiring a heat source) and even then the hold is quite pliable and the shape of my curls can be easily</li>
            <li> The major problem is that it is not very water resistant.</li>
            <li> Hard to explain exactly.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it three stars is that the hold was inadequate for me and didn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I have a small &amp;#34;Handle-bar&amp;#34; mustache and this works very well to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I recently grew my beard rather long and decided to go for a handle bar mustache.  </li>
            <li> It also took a while to get used to the fragrance they use--reminded me of Earl Grey tea (which I only started liking because of Captain Picard</li>
            <li> I use only a tiny amount, since all I&#x27;m really looking for is for it to lie down and not curl or look messy.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the the residue build up when using too much.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been making plastic screw lids for how long?</li>
            <li> product was not what I expected when I bought it, with it being a white cream rather than a wax</li>
            <li> A tube lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft, nor too firm and</li>
            <li> If your &#x27;stache is thick and bushy like mine, you&#x27;d be better served to drink with a straw, because if you get this stuff the least bit wet, IT LETS GO!&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I had long ago stopped cutting the hair on my head and thought this would be more symmetrical).</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s straight up soap.  </li>
            <li> rarely walk in the rain, or drink sloppily, or cry (</li>
            <li> This worked fine for me when my hair was dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> I have tried other waxes before, and felt I constantly had to rewax and touch up my mustache.</li>
            <li> ;, I have seen this with another product, and only once with Clubman, I think it is due to being in clumps, not melted-in, so to speak.  </li>
            <li> If however, your goal is to look like the sort of homicidal lunatic who keeps a collection of mummified monkey thumbs in your credenza, this is just the thing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a barber shop, which is the only other place that I can find this wax to buy.</li>
            <li> I have used other products, as well, and this is the standard by which I return.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not exactly a \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; color, it&#x27;s white.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that this is the brand of &#x27;Evil &#x27;Stache Wax&#x27; used by luminaries such as Snidely Whiplash and bad-guys from the 1920&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the last 20+ years</li>
            <li> Once styled and dry I can drink coffee and tea all day without straining it through whiskers.</li>
            <li> : VERY obvious in dark hair</li>
            <li> It will rope it and make it beg all day with only slight reapplication.</li>
            <li> you have shorter facial hair and you want to tone down its intrinsic fuzziness, and you don&#x27;t often get wet</li>
            <li> If you have longer facial hair like a handlebar mustache, look elsewhere, because it does not provide a tight hold and is not water resistant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that there is a little white color to it.</li>
            <li> The included comb isn&#x27;t bad, but the longer, wider metal comb is better.</li>
            <li> Holds great and doesn&#x27;t smell too awful.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up, don&#x27;t get it wet.  </li>
            <li> They are harder to wash out, but they stand the test of a draft beer at the bar.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Careful drinking from a glass as it may disolve what gets wet.</li>
            <li> Be careful when drinking because this stuff runs off your lip like a lemming from a cliff when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Do not get the wax wet</li>
            <li> NOW FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON</li>
            <li> This product works with minimal hassle and cost.</li>
            <li> All the other waxes that I have tried either loose their hold ever a days use, or do not really hold.</li>
            <li> only, it is too stiff to use during the day.</li>
            <li> This product holds really tight for a long time.</li>
            <li> My mustache is not especially unique, not too small or too big.</li>
            <li> Believing it was something I was doing, I was extra careful not to wet my upper lip or wipe it after food, drinking coffee, etc, but no, that wax just has poor hold.</li>
            <li> I have used Clubman Mustache wax by Pinaud for sixty years and have found no reason to switch to any other brand.</li>
            <li> I considered trying some of the other brands carried by Amazon, but then I think: \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> This wax, on the other hand, squeezes onto a brush supplied with the wax and works well.</li>
            <li> In reading the other reviews, I see a lot of product loyalty</li>
            <li> but I will also try some other creams.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s tried other brands, but they don&#x27;t even come close to working as well as Pinaud&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this product gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I tried some other products without successs.</li>
            <li> Works well to tame unruly moustache hair, and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it goes rock hard in seconds, and can last 2 days even with my crappy hair.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t gross or hard, and you won&#x27;t look like a guy in a moustache competition (unless you want to I guess).  </li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s stach is different and the hairs tend to be hard to train.</li>
            <li> The little comb that comes with it is pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> We tried hair gel with no success.  </li>
            <li> Mine last at least six weeks each.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is finding it.</li>
            <li> It is a water based product and will destroy your style if it gets wet.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, the brush that comes with it is worthless...</li>
            <li> It goes on wet and dries in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but it is not easy to get out of such a small opening in the tube.</li>
            <li> 45 years I wanted it to lay down</li>
            <li> I want it to without matting it down.</li>
            <li> His moustache is a bit unruly (think Andy Rooney eyebrow) and this product takes care of that without making it look slicked down.</li>
            <li> I can now stroll down the street with confidence, kicking pigeons and scaring children without a care.</li>
            <li> and I never lived that one down.</li>
            <li> Once the hair is dry it will be a little stiff.</li>
            <li> Lack of smell means it won&#x27;t clash with other manly products!</li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;ll just use neutral for the &#x27;stashe, A few times when I could not find the Clubman, I daddled with other waxes.</li>
            <li> So I decided this year to start waxing my mustache, and after reading other reviews on blogs and Amazon, I purchased Clubman Pinaud Mustache Wax, and after using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> My moustache is waxed about 1 and half to 2 inches from the corner of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have overcome this by applying to slightly damp moustache.  </li>
            <li> Eating is also much less mustache flavored than it would be otherwise.</li>
            <li> and I got black on accident.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT WANTING TO GIVE LESS AND INCREASE PROFIT</li>
            <li> I have black hair but</li>
            <li> The hold is decent but not great!</li>
            <li> The neutral lightens my dark brown beard a little.</li>
            <li> This was the first &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; I used when I decided to stop cutting the hair on my face</li>
            <li> small drawback is that it is not really neutral.</li>
            <li> The product does tend to dry up and get hard to dispense toward the end.  </li>
            <li> applied to the mustache, this stuff just clumps up and merely makes the hairs a bit stiff without holding the hairs together in any particular way.</li>
            <li> The little brush/comb is a plus.</li>
            <li> Clumpy white and weak.</li>
            <li> The brown holds a little stiffer, quicker.</li>
            <li> Little kids look at it and ask if those are toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t do a thing with my hair and the other waxes just don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I put a little on in the morning before leaving for work and it holds all day.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, I didn&#x27;t find the comb helpful.</li>
            <li> The wax has to be worked with your fingers a little bit before applying so as not to visible clumps of wax in your stache.</li>
            <li> subject of applicability is the only reason I might suggest trying Brother&#x27;s Loveif you can get over the cost, approximately $11 for a 15ml tube.</li>
            <li> However, I find that when I am performing outside in the heat or cold this wax just isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> If it gets wet, it loses effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with my mustache until I found this wax.</li>
            <li> It sets up firmly to hold my moustache firmly in place.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gone limp.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, hold up all day.  </li>
            <li> you need to do is purchase the variety that comes in a round tin.</li>
            <li> but I needed hold without looking like it was heavily waxed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want something that&#x27;s beeswax based for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My sister and I both have problems with a few stray eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few mustache waxes that don&#x27;t leave flakes in my mustache.  </li>
            <li> If you think it goes on too thick, wet the comb and it blends well.</li>
            <li> You may want to wait a few minutes before styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and applicator is small and inferior</li>
            <li> The black worked well, but it darkened my beard up a lot!</li>
            <li> Clubman wax is my go to wax when I need to tame my moustache for the everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy unless you want a smelly stiff moustache that does not hold the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cream paste, that begins to get tacky and stiff after it&#x27;s exposed to air.  </li>
            <li> If you ARE looking for pointy tips, don&#x27;t rely on my review, but if all you&#x27;re looking for is to tame your &#x27;stache (or eyebrows)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to apply this product without it leaving white flaky pieces in your moustache, especially if the hair is darker.</li>
            <li> Not cool!</li>
            <li> I have really thick black hair.</li>
            <li> really, the product isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Usually holds in place for three days even when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I have been mixing 2 neutral to 1 brown to make a lighter brown color for past 20 years.</li>
            <li> I trim the points at least every week and the rest everyday.</li>
            <li> The combo brush/comb is a bit small but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Second, without the brush or 3+ weeks of upper-lip hair growth, the product would fail its purpose.</li>
            <li> and they get it, usually apologizing then asking for my pardon/ forgiveness/ blessing.</li>
            <li> Squeeze a small amount onto your finger and work it into your moustache.  </li>
            <li> IMHO, the brush is pointless.</li>
            <li> In fact, others usually went in the garbage after one try.</li>
            <li> A little bit will do, and it has subtle berry scent, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> That is if you can resist the intense urge to wash this awful smelling gunk off of your upper lip.</li>
            <li> pls hard to find over here in Hawaii. .</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> I hold my head high at evil scientist conventions knowing the my handlebar moustache will hold all day long.</li>
            <li> I am growing a &amp;#34;Stash&amp;#34; to be a Villan in a Melodrama.</li>
            <li> Maybe burning plastic with a hint of stale cologne from a wet shirt?</li>
            <li> and I also noticed at least one disgruntled user.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon to the rescue!  </li>
            <li> I have tried others, but they are not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> Especially heavy machinery.</li>
            <li> worse.</li>
            <li> you will be none the worse, but I have not earned my gray hairs yet).</li>
            <li> I tried real hard to like this stuff, but whenever the humidity picked up or if I ventured out for a brisk walk/bike ride/</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to control my beard and just left it feeling gunky and cruddy.  </li>
            <li> If you are a sloppy drinker and do not carry a straw, or if you have to walk through the rain, Clubman wax will make you very sad (tears will also negatively impact Clubman wax, so don&#x27;t get too sad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unable to hold handlebars up.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clubman Pinaud Moustache Wax since quite some time however it had become difficult to find it in Italy</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just using it wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have felt evil for quite some time, but with Clubman Pinaud Moustache Wax holding my Handlebar Moustache in place, I feel confident about having an evil moustache.</li>
            <li> The applicator is useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately against its&#x27; competition, not that well.</li>
            <li> It really stinks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> People that don&#x27;t know me see the handlebar mustache and think I&#x27;m a dirty hipster instead of a BEARDED VIKING GOD.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I tried cutting the hair that shot out</li>
            <li> Drys powdery and leaves a dirty looking stash.</li>
            <li> Has a bad odor.</li>
            <li> Seriously disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate the neutral color, it looks like you have mustache dandruff</li>
            <li> I tried it on my eyebrows and was terribly disappointed expecting it to be neutral!</li>
            <li> The wax spends the day flaking off onto my shirt, which looks terrible.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product</li>
            <li> Crap!</li>
            <li> Granted, it does hold your mustache in place, but the dandruff makes your face look terrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a disgusting smell to it.</li>
            <li> Packaging is awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tried many others - Have not yet found an equal!</li>
            <li> I purchase this item for my boyfriend, he likes it far better than the hard waxes.</li>
            <li> I love the mustache comb.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes in a pack of three. Now my grandpa can twist that mustache with ease! Excellent product.</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok but it is not easy to get out of such a small opening in the tube.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product, it works as advertised. The little brush/comb is a plus. I can easily carry a set with me for touch ups. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> The wax left an unattractive residue on my husband&#x27;s beard.  It also took using a lot of it to actually make a difference. Despite that it had a pleasant aroma and was a good first wax to try.</li>
            <li> Used this product for almost 50 years.  If not the best price certainly the easiest order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the real expensive ones that come in a tiny can - this is much better - and for the price - an incredible deal!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy handlebar wax.  Just a heads up, don&#x27;t get it wet.  If it gets wet, it loses effectiveness.</li>
            <li> If you are man enough to need some stache wax, then you are already making some good life choices. This product should be a continuation of those good choices. It goes on easy, firms up especially nice in cooler drier climates. It does wash out easy, which can be a problem in hot humid climates, or if you are eating a rack of ribs. But it fits in your pocket, and is soft enough to apply and reapply without plucking the whiskers from your lip. The comb is a nice addition as well. Take pride in your stache, use this wax.   Tip- you can use some beeswax on your peaks to keep them nice and perky if this stuff isn&#x27;t holding it together. It does a nice job of maintaining the rest of the stache in the meantime though.</li>
            <li> This is great! Very easy to order and inexpensive !!</li>
            <li> Works great for my handsome gent! I now don&#x27;t have to eat his mustache when we make out :) he loves it as do I</li>
            <li> This is my first mustache wax... It does not hold form as much as I would have thought.  But I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it for his handle bars mustache hehe....pls hard to find over here in Hawaii. .</li>
            <li> Seriously disappointed. I bought two colors, the caps split on both of them without my torquing the lids closed too far in my opinion.  They&#x27;ve been making plastic screw lids for how long? The wax spends the day flaking off onto my shirt, which looks terrible.  I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have tried other waxes before, and felt I constantly had to rewax and touch up my mustache. This wax changed all that, and was very reliable. Great for Movember!!! Made for extra donations towards the charity. Check out Movember.com for details on turning ur mustache into a charitable advertisement for men&#x27;s health.  Will definitely buy this wax again, very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I have tried other moustache waxes and this is the best for a handle bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend moustache wax above all others</li>
            <li> The natural wax works well with my white moustache and beard.  The wax keeps some of the more stubborn hair in line. Never leave home with out it.</li>
            <li> Has a bad odor. It really stinks</li>
            <li> Best mustage wax ever, using for over 40 years</li>
            <li> I had trouble with my mustache until I found this wax. Then I found I could get it thru AMAZON easily. It sets up firmly to hold my moustache firmly in place. Fisrt 45 years I wanted it to lay down then I decided to curl the corners up. It works better than any of the other four products I have tried. Usually holds in place for three days even when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> Clumpy white and weak. For as clumpy and white as this stuff is it should be like glue, but it has no staying power, get your mustache looking good, walk away from the mirror and it&#x27;s gone limp.</li>
            <li> I have used Clubman Mustache wax by Pinaud for sixty years and have found no reason to switch to any other brand.</li>
            <li> I whole heartily recommend Pinaud Clubman Moustache Wax. I have been using since since 1976. Back in the day it was Brown only. The brown holds a little stiffer, quicker. The neutral takes longer to stiffen up. I have been mixing 2 neutral to 1 brown to make a lighter brown color for past 20 years. My moustache is filled with white  hairs, the wax does a good job of blending to a natural look. I use a little more brown in the winter, not much bleaching by the sun. If the hair on my head changes color I suppose I&#x27;ll just use neutral for the &#x27;stashe, A few times when I could not find the Clubman, I daddled with other waxes. NONE COMPARED TO THE Pinaud Clubman Wax. My last Drugstore claimed they could not get it anymore. In desperation I checked Amazon. Thankfully Amazon directly carries a 3 pack, cuts down on the shipping/handling versus when it is charged individually, no matter how many tubes you buy.  My moustache is waxed about 1 and half to 2 inches from the corner of my mouth. I trim the points at least every week and the rest everyday. Goes straight out parallel to the ground, I rarely have had to readjust it. Little kids look at it and ask if those are toothpicks. Stays in all day and comes out easily with a little soap and water. I considered trying some of the other brands carried by Amazon, but then I think: \\&quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, why break it?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would very much reccommend this product to anyone wishing to groom their mustache and wanting it to hold its shape for the entire day.  I recently grew my beard rather long and decided to go for a handle bar mustache.  I used the product for about two weeks and it worked fantastic. I would have continued using it much longer but my wife mentioned in passing it I did not loose the &amp;#34;handle bar&amp;#34; part of my mustache they would never find my body...Great product though!!!</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find.My husband was thrilled with my purchase for him.He loves this wax to control his moustache.A wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; have been using this wax for many years. I have tried others, but they are not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped immediately without any problems. I have used this product for many years and it works just the way its described.</li>
            <li> I was using Captain Conk up until I tried this brand and, while this is marginally stronger for shaping your facial hair, you have to be more careful blending it in because it can clump and look like a booger. I have very coarse facial hair and it&#x27;s a challenge to keep it from going rogue, but I do admit this does a better job than Conk. It also took a while to get used to the fragrance they use--reminded me of Earl Grey tea (which I only started liking because of Captain Picard so don&#x27;t judge me)--but it took me a while to realize someone wasn&#x27;t drinking tea around me when it was on.</li>
            <li> this is like putting super glue on your stach.  Horrible product</li>
            <li> Great stuff for the &amp;#34;unusual&amp;#34; grooming.  I have the white mustache and this stuff works great.  But, I do have a problem with the (screw-on) cap.  After a few uses it cracks at the top, and causes the was to get hard when it extrudes from the tube.</li>
            <li> The best that I have tried.  Works well to tame unruly moustache hair, and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims it will do.</li>
            <li> blah. and smells like lemon blah. does the trick for the ol&#x27; stache</li>
            <li> I have had a moustace for years, but only recently took the plunge, and went for  handlebar.  I must say , I really like this product. I found it in a local store and the price has dropped to around $5.00.  Now about the wax.  I use it right after showering, so my moustace is a bit moist, which is fine since this wax is water soluable.  But it dries well enough, and it keeps things in place.  I have read others complaints about a &amp;#34;dandruff look&amp;#34;, I have seen this with another product, and only once with Clubman, I think it is due to being in clumps, not melted-in, so to speak.  I have overcome this by applying to slightly damp moustache.  I keep some in my car, at work etc.  And , if you wish, it washes out easy enough.  Cheers.</li>
            <li> Smells lemony and makes dat stache look like you know how to wheel and deal. Safe to use while operating heavy machinery. Especially heavy machinery.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s white. Could leave &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; if not applied properly. Just brush it through with care. And repeat if necessary after hardening. Works well with my Scandinavian semi-blonde mustache. Recommended if you have lighter hair color!  Added 2.7.2015: Didn&#x27;t actually hold at all as I predicted. Unable to hold handlebars up.</li>
            <li> Moustache is neat &amp; clean, glad I made this purchase, wax is easy to apply and remains on the moustache all day.</li>
            <li> This wax is great to easily shape and style your mustache.  Just make sure you drink your beer thru a straw!  It is a water based product and will destroy your style if it gets wet.  I recommend that you get a beeswax based product.  They are harder to wash out, but they stand the test of a draft beer at the bar.</li>
            <li> I found this wax much easier to use than the harder varieties that come in glass jars. It&#x27;s also easier to wash off fingers and combs. No problem with the scent, which was a light citrus odor. The only reason I give it three stars is that the hold was inadequate for me and didn&#x27;t seem to last very long. For now, I&#x27;ll have to stick with the traditional wax.</li>
            <li> Clubman Pinaud Moustace Wax is great but just be careful with water contact. You might need to re apply more wax later on the day since the wax does wear out. The big winner though has to be the brush that comes with it. I really wish they would sell those seperate in a bulk.</li>
            <li> Crap! Don&#x27;t buy unless you want a smelly stiff moustache that does not hold the hair.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. Like anything else, you get what you pay for. I bought the neutral color, but it&#x27;s anything but. It&#x27;s easy to apply b/c it&#x27;s nice and soft, but it&#x27;s white and stays white. Your mustache will be all frosty with dandruff-looking pieces of this stuff. It&#x27;s gross really. I put it on before bed to train the hairs until I found something I could wear outside the house haha! It holds okay, but like I said, you pretty much just wear it around the house.</li>
            <li> works great, takes bit of practice to get the application amount right</li>
            <li> great husband loves it</li>
            <li> Been using it for over 40 years and nothing else commpres to it.  Holds well, washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it, do so now!  I have tried SEVERAL brands, and this stuff works better than any of it!</li>
            <li> Where to start.... Well first, it didn&#x27;t smell all that great. Not horrible, BUT NOT what I want under my nose all day. If that were the only problem I could live with it, but read on... Hold? What hold? It did nothing to style my handlebar mustache. Then there is the fact that the white goop didn&#x27;t blend in so it looked like a bird took a dump on my upper lip! On top of that, the brush that comes with it is worthless...just smeared the goop around. Total waste of money. Firehouse Wacky Tacky Mustache Wax is SO MUCH BETTER!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently begun to let my mustache grow, necessitating the use of a mustache wax to aide in training it. I tried another brand first. It was a tin full of much too hard wax. It would have been more useful if it came with a wick. This wax, on the other hand, squeezes onto a brush supplied with the wax and works well. I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to twirl the corners of my &#x27;stache upwards, based on the many positive reviews seen here. After 3 weeks of giving it a sincere shot, it&#x27;s not working for me, though I realize there are many satisfied customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Applicator brush is convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Odorless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pack of 3 from some seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Color is definitely not neutral. It is white, and looks like dandruff if you do not spend more than several minutes massaging and applying it into the hair. Even when you think you are done, if the light hits your face the right way, the white residue immediately becomes visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Disappointing hold. My mustache is not especially unique, not too small or too big. Just wanted to twirl the ends, which are long enough to retain a hold if I give them a good twist even without wax. I would find loss of hold within the first 2 hours of the day, with the ends of the &#x27;stache drooping down. Believing it was something I was doing, I was extra careful not to wet my upper lip or wipe it after food, drinking coffee, etc, but no, that wax just has poor hold. Applying increased quantities did not help either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Feels somewhat sticky should it touch any part of the skin on your face, for the rest of the day. Obviously, it&#x27;s a wax and should be sticky, but there are similar products that do not &amp;#34;feel &amp;#34; sticky once applied.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clubman Pinaud Moustache Wax since quite some time however it had become difficult to find it in Italy so I ordered through Amazon: always a great product and I saved too.</li>
            <li> If you like Earl Gray Tea, you will love this!  As near as I can tell, it is scented with bergamot oil (which gives earl gray tea its distinctive smell.)</li>
            <li> I am a new moustache tender, having only been growing mine since earlier this year. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with different waxes and treatments for the moustache, as a first purchase though, I am extremely happy to have this product in my possession, as it satisfies all my needs for control of the moustache. The smell is probably best described as a musky type of cologne, with a pleasant soapiness to it. Very good stuff.</li>
            <li> It is simply the best. I have been using Clubman for a long time and have no hesitation in strongly recommending it to the mustache men.</li>
            <li> Works quite well.  Good stuff, yes I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best for taming a &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; moustache and making it look good.</li>
            <li> Best &#x27;stache wax I&#x27;ve found yet - holds its shape, easy to apply, easy to wash out, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;One small issue is the tube, which is more fragile than I would like; easily ripped or punctured, and then squirts out wax from the rip or hole when the tube is squeezed to get product out of the normal top.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this daily for his handle bar moustache.  Great product.  My husband has gray mixed in his moustache and the Clubman tames them greatly.  The seller did a great job too.</li>
            <li> Great product- Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> He has been using this for over 30 years and then some I think. He would not look right with his mustache.</li>
            <li> I am growing a &amp;#34;Stash&amp;#34; to be a Villan in a Melodrama. This Clubnam Pinaud Moustache Wax is perfect for training my Stash to have that &amp;#34;evil&amp;#34; look. I put the tube in a small bowl of hot water for two minutes. That makes it very easy to work with. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Jack Roberts</li>
            <li> works great keeps mustach hair in place without being sticky. If you do mus it up just fix it no need to aply more wax and cleans up with water doesn&#x27;t leave a resadue on your hands.</li>
            <li> Best. This is the economical way to purchase-3 packs!</li>
            <li> I had a CVS store nearby that was carrying this product and then they stopped.Then they started ordering 5 at a time for me and then they said they couldn&#x27;t do that any longer...and I am like WOOP WOOP bet Amazon has some!&lt;br /&gt;I buy it for my Dad and he has a fantastic handlebar moustache and this is his product of choice.&lt;br /&gt;GREAST product, price and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;May God bless</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has used this for years, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally, so I ordered this up for him (i.e. he&#x27;s not a computer person) and now he&#x27;s happy that he got his handlebars back!</li>
            <li> I understand Clubman may be discontinuing this product? hope not its easy to apply and remove</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for bad hair I have found. I usually can&#x27;t do a thing with my hair and the other waxes just don&#x27;t work at all. this stuff is my only choice. Watch out for clumping, and it sticks to everything so keep to neutral. Other than that, it goes rock hard in seconds, and can last 2 days even with my crappy hair.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 40 years.  It&#x27;s not been changed because it works great!</li>
            <li> My husband has used Pinaud Moustache Wax for many, many years and he loves it. He curls his moustache every morning using the product and it works great. He always gets compliments on his moustache!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, hold up all day.  Best bang for the buck.  I&#x27;m frugal, no need to pay more for other waxes, when this does the trick.</li>
            <li> This wax is fantastic. It is very quick drying and has a great hold. It is water soluble, so I carry it in my pocket now that it&#x27;s getting warmer. One bit of advice - don&#x27;t bother with the comb, just use your fingers to apply the wax. I&#x27;ve had far better results when ditching the comb.</li>
            <li> Works great on Mustache, Beard and Eyebrows! Nice sizing and packaging. I had used up a tube that I had used for years and I was happy to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As a lifelong practitioner of pogonotrophy (well, since puberty at any rate) my credentials are top-notch. I can honestly say that as far as mustache wax goes, this is terribly weak sauce I&#x27;m afraid. I was utterly underwhelmed by its professed efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;I do rather enjoy the mustache comb however, but I imagine one can acquire a similar mustache comb elsewhere for far less money and without the excess baggage of sub-par mustache wax.&lt;br /&gt;When applied to the mustache, this stuff just clumps up and merely makes the hairs a bit stiff without holding the hairs together in any particular way. It looks like you might have gotten an inordinate amount of some exotic condiment in your mustache. If a proper handlebar with a lovely fine point and perhaps a curl is your goal, this is not the product for you. If however, your goal is to look like the sort of homicidal lunatic who keeps a collection of mummified monkey thumbs in your credenza, this is just the thing! It&#x27;ll do a bang-up job of repulsing members of the opposite gender! (Same gender too I&#x27;ll wager!)&lt;br /&gt;What you need to do is purchase the variety that comes in a round tin. That will have much more hold.&lt;br /&gt;A good rule of thumb here is, if it squeezes out of a tube, it&#x27;s too soft to do the job. Perhaps you might have some luck polishing the bannister &amp; newel post with it.</li>
            <li> A Great price on a great moustacke wax I hasve been using for twenty five years; havn&#x27;t found any other wax as good.Put a small amount on your first finget put half on the first finger of your other hand rub your fingers and thumb together then apply to moustache. Starts stiffing in about 10 seconds or so and you can style you moustache as you like. Easly removed with warm water or soap and water. Careful drinking from a glass as it may disolve what gets wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and like the product.  I&#x27;ve not tried any other mustache waxes, so I have limited experience, but I didn&#x27;t really find a reason to switch because this does an adequate job getting some of those unruly hairs at least going in somewhat the same direction.  Plus I really like the lemony-citrus smell (which isn&#x27;t really noticeable after about 10-15 minutes).  The product does tend to dry up and get hard to dispense toward the end.  The first time I used this, the free brush/comb basically disintegrated (all the teeth broke loose - I think some of the ingredients in the wax attack the plastic - so be sure you clean it every time you use it).  With my latest order, the screw on cap snapped in half, so I can&#x27;t put the top on.  Not cool!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only way to go for handlebars. It hold all day, and it smells good too</li>
            <li> Outstanding mustache wax and shipping was timely</li>
            <li> Like the title says this is a great product, but not for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the first &#x27;wax&#x27; product I purchased for my moustache and the one that I have come back to as the most reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While traditional real-beeswax tin waxes are what I would most like to use, the thickness, coarseness of the hair, and curliness of my facial hair makes them frustrating to use. I have found most real-wax products to be tedious and difficult to work through (often requiring a heat source) and even then the hold is quite pliable and the shape of my curls can be easily lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to using Clubman is to make sure that there is a little bit combed evenly through your moustache--and especially combed through the tips (if that&#x27;s what you are going for). As other products in the days of yore have claimed, &#x27;a dab&#x27;ll do ya,&#x27; and that certainly applies to Clubman. One tube has lasted me about 6 months of almost daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was not what I expected when I bought it, with it being a white cream rather than a wax but after a short while that cream hardens clear and holds the whole day through--I have never had to reapply from normal daily running-about. I curl my tips in large crescents and quite finely held together and Clubman does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people with thicker, straighter facial hair beeswax may be the better option--but if you need something that will tame course, curly and unruly moustache hairs Clubman gets my vote.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this type of product.  The helpful guide is okay, would have appreciated more information.  The applicator gets gunky and needs cleaning after each use.  It does a good job holding my mustache but I notice that after time it starts to flake off... the front of my shirt looks like I have facial dandruff.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Dad and his curled up ends he likes to do with his mustache.  He loves it and it works, nuff said.</li>
            <li> Creamy, easy to use, L have been using this wax for over 30 years since I first started a handlebar.</li>
            <li> its kinda ok I guess...I feel like I have some kinda of white sticky substance on my face...so if youre in to that then buy it...but it works</li>
            <li> I am an active person, and live in an area that gets lots of rain.  I tried real hard to like this stuff, but whenever the humidity picked up or if I ventured out for a brisk walk/bike ride/whatever, it would lose all of its hold.  I think this stuff is like a dove bar that&#x27;s been soaking in a soap box, mixed with the teeniest, tiniest amount of wax.  I mean, it&#x27;s straight up soap.  And it smells like ick.  I tried to freshen el stacho up two or three times a day, but I just ended up with a schnauzer that hung raggedly over my lips.  It&#x27;d probably work great if you stayed indoors all the time, and held really still as not to break the slightest sweat.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the hold I was looking for. Discolored my mustache as well. For a simpler stache it would be fine but I needed hold without looking like it was heavily waxed.</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to get these this way. I don&#x27;t use a barber shop, which is the only other place that I can find this wax to buy. And, to buy it there is almost three times more expensive than this site. Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li> VEEEEERRRRY stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good for a one night costume party use or a play, but there are far better waxes for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want something that&#x27;s beeswax based for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Makes it look like you have mustache-dandruff. I tried light applications, moderate applications, and heavy applications, all with the dandruff look. Granted, it does hold your mustache in place, but the dandruff makes your face look terrible.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years. It does the job. I will buy it again when needed.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a disgusting smell to it. Hard to explain exactly. Maybe burning plastic with a hint of stale cologne from a wet shirt? That&#x27;s all I can think of when I smell it. What a great idea to make something that will be right under your nose ALL DAY LONG smell completely awful. Genius. I&#x27;m so glad that I now have three of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it works really well. That is if you can resist the intense urge to wash this awful smelling gunk off of your upper lip.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wax what can i say.</li>
            <li> Shipping in good time. Didn&#x27;t realize I was buying a life time supply, 3 tubes 3 comb/brushes .Works great very light  pleasent scent. Makes great handlebar.</li>
            <li> Decent price for a 3-tube purchase plus convenient way to purchase from your home via the internet. Clubman pinaud is a top-notch wax for that facial hirsute control :)</li>
            <li> I have used Clubman moustache wax for years. It seems to work for me better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. If it is applied and combed through your wet moustache grooming is easy. Once the hair is dry it will be a little stiff. If it&#x27;s not just like you want it the style can be adjusted. It keeps my mustache looking like I want it to without matting it down.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clubman Moustache wax for 30 + years now. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and keep coming back to the Original. My local stores do not stock this product any longer which is why you are reading this review...</li>
            <li> Thickens and gives you the ability to style nicely, however beware, you will get dandruff from the product as it dries.</li>
            <li> Great I got 3 of these useless waxes. I was looking for real mustache wax,&lt;br /&gt;because hair gels and waxes I tried didn&#x27;t work as I hoped. This works&lt;br /&gt;even worse. Smells nice like apple, but its white and doesn&#x27;t keep shape&lt;br /&gt;good at all.</li>
            <li> Worked great, then lost my stache to chemo. :-(</li>
            <li> I use it for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> All the other waxes that I have tried either loose their hold ever a days use, or do not really hold. This product holds really tight for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every day, as well as a curling iron, it&#x27;s great, odor less and color less, recommended highly!</li>
            <li> Helps keeps up the ends</li>
            <li> Great price, works as advertised</li>
            <li> Still the best option I have found for a mustache wax. Since Walgreens no longer carries it, this is the best way to get it. I like that it washes out easily and leaves my mustache looking and feeling more natural than the heavy bee&#x27;s wax option. And since my hair is mostly grey/white I don&#x27;t mind that there is a little white color to it. For those who still have dark hair, I suggest you petition Pinaud to make the brown and black available again. This worked fine for me when my hair was dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this.  His moustache is a bit unruly (think Andy Rooney eyebrow) and this product takes care of that without making it look slicked down.</li>
            <li> This is only for the mustache that needs taming. And this will do it. It will rope it and make it beg all day with only slight reapplication.</li>
            <li> My sister and I both have problems with a few stray eyebrow hairs.  The problem was driving us nuts.  We tried hair gel with no success.  Then she thought of mustache wax.  I ordered the Clubman Pinaud.  It works great!  Better yet, it requires a very small amount.  The three tubes will last us for several years.  Our eyebrows now lay nicely and we only use the wax as needed.  The wax doesn&#x27;t show, so it can be used at any time.</li>
            <li> I recently let my mustache grow out and I wanted to style it with curly tips and a pointed beard. After researching on the I internet I decided Clubman&#x27;s was my best bet. I was not disappointed. I use this wax every morning and it tames my mustache well. Even though I often sleep on it and wake with a mustache disaster. Once styled and dry I can drink coffee and tea all day without straining it through whiskers. Eating is also much less mustache flavored than it would be otherwise. I discovered the [[ASIN:B008EQ9VJ8 Oster Metal Flea Comb]] works really well to style my whiskers when I first put the wax in (No, I never used it on the cat). The included comb isn&#x27;t bad, but the longer, wider metal comb is better. This wax seams to work best when applied to completely dry whiskers. A blow dryer on high plus wax can really help to fix natural whisker faults. You can also blow dry on low to dry the wax quickly once you put it in. Then you can comb out your mustache and it will still hold it&#x27;s shape pretty well (if that&#x27;s how you want to wear it). I meant to buy neutral my first time and I got black on accident. The black worked well, but it darkened my beard up a lot! The neutral lightens my dark brown beard a little. If I use too much it can look like I have beard dandruff, but it combs out easily in that case. It also works great to tame the unruly whiskers I call a beard. A tube lasts a surprisingly long time. Mine last at least six weeks each. The smell is light and pleasing. As other have indicated it washes out easily with water and a very small amount of soap. This is a good product and you owe it to your mustache to give it a try.</li>
            <li> for side sleepers that need some help keeping those eyebrows going the right direction - this stuff is really stiff but works great! I use it at nite only, it is too stiff to use during the day.</li>
            <li> Pros: Pretty good stuff. Easy to get in the ol&#x27; &#x27;stache, comes with a comb/applicator which is way better than applying with your fingers for consistent application, Holds the handlebar and the twist well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: VERY obvious in dark hair so next time I&#x27;ll get the brown and it doesn&#x27;t hold up to humidity/water very well. Be careful when drinking because this stuff runs off your lip like a lemming from a cliff when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost twenty years.  I have used other products, as well, and this is the standard by which I return.  Lately the formula changed, making it creamier and easier to work into my mustache, allowing me to form the best handlebars.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used Clubman for over 30 years and have found it much better than the many others i have tried,</li>
            <li> used daily problems obtaining locally</li>
            <li> This product never fails to impress, it&#x27;s cheap on Amazon and works fantastically. 3 pack deal, what a steal. If I&#x27;ve ever lost my brush (I haven&#x27;t so far...I have about 6 now haha), I always have a replacement!</li>
            <li> Very thick and strong smelling.  I don&#x27;t like the smell at all - too medicinal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly stiff facial hair and this wax did absolutely nothing.  I suspect I would need a MUCH longer mustache for it to do anything with my wiry hair.</li>
            <li> It works generally well.  It&#x27;s a cream paste, that begins to get tacky and stiff after it&#x27;s exposed to air.  If your &#x27;stache is thick and bushy like mine, you&#x27;d be better served to drink with a straw, because if you get this stuff the least bit wet, IT LETS GO!&lt;br /&gt;On a good note, it works well when dry, smells nice and is easy to apply and re-apply.  It seems to work better than the actual lanolin/beeswax/mineral oil based products, as they are more like Vaseline than they are wax.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few mustache waxes that don&#x27;t leave flakes in my mustache.  It doesn&#x27;t hold as strongly as other waxes I have used, but for everyday use, it is fine.  I use a tacky wax if I want to curl my mustache, but this this one is great for regular use.</li>
            <li> This is the same ole stuff my Grandfather used on his mustache 65 yrs ago. Still just as good as it was then</li>
            <li> It does wanted it needs to do to insure that my handlebar mustache stays curled in the right direction</li>
            <li> Clubman wax is my go to wax when I need to tame my moustache for the everyday. However, I find that when I am performing outside in the heat or cold this wax just isn&#x27;t enough. The addition of a second coat of higher quality (non creme) wax often does the trick. Even Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm worked before I found something better.</li>
            <li> The wax is very good. Goes on easily. Not a bad smell about it. The combo brush/comb is a bit small but gets the job done. I would, and will, buy this product again when needed. I recommend it to anyone needing this kind of product. Not great, but very, very good.</li>
            <li> My husband used this and it never worked on his facial hair. He even used a blow dryer after to see if it would help stiffen up.... No go!</li>
            <li> Good price not what I expected</li>
            <li> I had never used mustache wax before buying this product. It works quite well , and trains my mustache so I don&#x27;t need to use every day</li>
            <li> At first I doubted my need for wax, since I don&#x27;t have a grand moustache with flamboyant tips.  After a recommendation, I decided to pick one to try, and I&#x27;m happy enough with this I don&#x27;t see a reason to try anything else.  It has a pleasant smell of citrus when wet, and it dries quickly and invisibly.  I use only a tiny amount, since all I&#x27;m really looking for is for it to lie down and not curl or look messy.  If the idea of wax has put you off, realize that you probably already use a hair product, this one is just built for different hair.  It isn&#x27;t gross or hard, and you won&#x27;t look like a guy in a moustache competition (unless you want to I guess).  If you ARE looking for pointy tips, don&#x27;t rely on my review, but if all you&#x27;re looking for is to tame your &#x27;stache (or eyebrows) this one is a good choice.  It lasts forever at the amount I&#x27;m using it, though I did buy more to have some in my overnight kit for travel.  The little brush/comb is a perfect applicator, and I also use it when I trim.</li>
            <li> Goes in nicely, and the comb does a great job as well! Holds great and doesn&#x27;t smell too awful. I actually enjoy it. People complaining about the color are complaining about a different product. This one is the neutral color (comes out white, goes in invisibly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with this in the future.</li>
            <li> Ever since growing out my handlebar, I&#x27;ve been trying different waxes. I always come back to the Pinaud. My facial hair is wiry and unruly. This is the only wax I&#x27;ve tried that holds for anything more than an hour in hot weather. In reading the other reviews, I see a lot of product loyalty and I also noticed at least one disgruntled user. The pinaud uses a carrier which allows the wax to be applied like a cream, but quickly gives the hold like a very stiff wax. Yes, occasionally, if you don&#x27;t get it worked in well it will leave some white residue. The wax seems to be water soluble (washes out easily), so adding a bit of water usually gets rid of any residue for me.  To the reviewer who thought the Pinaud wax wanes (get it???) in the heat, try some of those almost pure beeswax compounds. Pinaud holds much better.</li>
            <li> I have a small &amp;#34;Handle-bar&amp;#34; mustache and this works very well to keep it in place. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. (Holly&#x27;s husband)</li>
            <li> Does the job, but can leave residue.  Packaging is awful.  Tube cracks and label ink rubs off.  I now use honest Amish, which has a weak hold but better packaging and over all product in my opinion</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of Pinaud Moustache Wax. It does the job for me. Service was very good.</li>
            <li> Goes on well trains a moustache nicely</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years. My only complaint is finding it. I finally found it at Amason.</li>
            <li> I use this as eyebrow shaping wax and it works much better than a wax pencil. You do have to be careful to keep the little comb clean if you use it or it will look as if you have dandruff.  However, a little dab on your finger tip smoothed on will do the trick for smooth brows without having to do anything else all day long and you really don&#x27;t need the applicator for this use.</li>
            <li> Keeps the handlebar in place. I buy them 6 at a time so you should make it in a giant economy size!</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just using it wrong.  It didn&#x27;t seem to control my beard and just left it feeling gunky and cruddy.  I&#x27;ll try it again sometime since I have it.  But I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you see my review I tried and use 3 products; this as well as Firehouse and Fathers. This is the most convenient to apply, but maybe not the best holding. Rated 5 stars as aroma in neutral, and hold almost as all as Firehouse.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a cute brush, but you&#x27;re worth the hand-polished faux-tortiseshell ones here on good ol&#x27; A.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was sent three tubes of mustache wax. It is very good. A little bit will do, and it has subtle berry scent, but not overpowering. I will use this from now on.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and in good condition. I have used it for a few weeks now, and it works great. Another review I read suggested Clubman is the best. They are correct. I have no reason to try another brand. No unpleasant odor, it blends in easy and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best wax on the market. Use it very sparingly and it will train your mustache and not get in the way.</li>
            <li> Good product works well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work! I finally decided that I really didn&#x27;t need to spend the time n effort to wax the stach!</li>
            <li> My familymember likes your wax</li>
            <li> This product frustrates me. Some days it works great, others it doesn&#x27;t cooperate at all. I&#x27;ve tried various ways of applying it, and every time I think I&#x27;ve figured it out, that method doesn&#x27;t work the next time I try it. It seems to cooperate best in cool, dry weather. If it&#x27;s humid and hot outside, you can forget it. The main issue I&#x27;m having is that my handlebar curls won&#x27;t stay in place longer than 2 or 3 hours if it&#x27;s a warm day. Also, it&#x27;s not exactly a \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; color, it&#x27;s white. It&#x27;s very difficult to apply this product without it leaving white flaky pieces in your moustache, especially if the hair is darker. I just ordered some Firehouse Moustache Wax, which is supposed to be some really good stuff. So, I&#x27;ll give that a try. This product didn&#x27;t satisfy me at all.</li>
            <li> When I grow out my moustache, this is what I use. It&#x27;s good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda manly smelling, my wife approves of it, so I&#x27;m cool.</li>
            <li> The best at keeping my husbsnd&#x27;s 14 inch mustache tame.</li>
            <li> First, the product serves its mysterious purpose: fashionably sculpting a delightful mustache. Second, without the brush or 3+ weeks of upper-lip hair growth, the product would fail its purpose. You see, the nuetral color, when combes through the whiskers, becomes grity. If you don&#x27;t brush the product vigorously through the follicles, it looks like you have stache dandruff, says my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, however, for the price, it&#x27;s not a terrible product. It needs better consistency, and a slightly stronger hold.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that I can find locally, and the only one that has a comb. Which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;My issue is that it doesn&#x27;t hold all that well. Maybe my moustache is kevlar or something, but this just won&#x27;t make it curl to a handlebar of any sort until there&#x27;s more than enough that even the neutral wax is easily vislble. Even then, I have the choice to twist it and end up with a frayed paintbrush for an end or letting the curl split.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Lightly scented&#x27; it is not. In my case, the floral (lavender?) scent is pleasant, but is cloying and far too heavy for anything that sits under your nose all day.&lt;br /&gt;After several attempts, I&#x27;ve found that I just can&#x27;t wear it for more than half an hour without developing a sickening headache that aspirin just won&#x27;t touch.</li>
            <li> Smells like lemons when applying. Do not get the wax wet or it will make it melt and it will undo your mustache.</li>
            <li> holds and smells good i might say best used warm [ throw it in the water you are shaving in ]</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve mostly returned to heaver, non-water-based wax, preferring to put the time into softening and application so i can rely on an all-day hold...</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  Just a tiny bit on your finger, rub it against another finger to make it spreadable and your moustache and beard will look like you just stepped out of a barber shop.  Buy it, it works.</li>
            <li> Recently began curling mustache for handbar mustache which he sported years ago.  Glad to find Pinaud again. Aan excellent product.</li>
            <li> I hate the neutral color, it looks like you have mustache dandruff</li>
            <li> Have use it for a long time and it does the job very well !!!&lt;br /&gt;  Jesse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  PS  I know what I want and Amazon has what I want.&lt;br /&gt;  This includes all the items below.</li>
            <li> I have felt evil for quite some time, but with Clubman Pinaud Moustache Wax holding my Handlebar Moustache in place, I feel confident about having an evil moustache. I can now stroll down the street with confidence, kicking pigeons and scaring children without a care. I hold my head high at evil scientist conventions knowing the my handlebar moustache will hold all day long. I am pretty sure that this is the brand of &#x27;Evil &#x27;Stache Wax&#x27; used by luminaries such as Snidely Whiplash and bad-guys from the 1920&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works great. Came fast. The applicator is useless.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS AS I HAVE HAD A MOUSTACHE SINCE 1971. WHEN I FIRST STARTED USING THE PRODUCT THE MAIN INGREDIENT WAS BEES WAX. NOW FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON EXCEPT WANTING TO GIVE LESS AND INCREASE PROFIT THE PRODUCT MAIN INGREDIENT IS WATER AND IT IS NOT DOING THE JOB THAT THE ORIGINAL CLUBMAN PINAUD MOUSTACHE WAX DID. I HAVE NOW BEGAN SEARCHING FOR A REPLACEMENT PRODUCT THAT WILL DO THE JOB THAT I WANT IT TO DO, MAINTAIN MY MOUSTACHE PROPERLY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided since November to grow a mighty homeless beard.  Here we are 5 months later and I need something to keep my mustache out of my mouth when I&#x27;m eating.  Enter mustache wax!  I put a little on in the morning before leaving for work and it holds all day.  Smell is very pleasant.  My dream of looking like I belong on a whisky bottle is soon becoming a reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Women I don&#x27;t know approach me to tell me how much they love the beard.  Possibly want to have intercourse with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Girlfriend not ecstatic about the above.  People that don&#x27;t know me see the handlebar mustache and think I&#x27;m a dirty hipster instead of a BEARDED VIKING GOD.  Then they notice I&#x27;m not wearing women&#x27;s jeans and they get it, usually apologizing then asking for my pardon/ forgiveness/ blessing.</li>
            <li> Neutral.....really??? It&#x27;s WHITE! Why doesn&#x27;t it say WHITE?? It&#x27;s completely misleading to label it neutral color. I tried it on my eyebrows and was terribly disappointed expecting it to be neutral! I can&#x27;t take it back because the beauty shop I got it in doesn&#x27;t take returns and the salesperson recommended it. I still haven&#x27;t found any strong clear, non alcohol gel that can tame my eyebrows and keep them in place.</li>
            <li> As usual a very good product.  Always consistent.</li>
            <li> For me, this sets too quickly.  Also maybe I am using too much but it&#x27;s flakey and I get little white bits in my moustache which looks pretty gross.</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s moustache under control finally. Well packaged and lots of wax for the price. Nice little comb included. Got here in time.</li>
            <li> Works like it should. Great price!</li>
            <li> Of course, I am growing out my mustache and at the point where I needed some styling cream. The cream itself smells fine and is easy to apply. The hold is decent but not great! (I have handlebars). If you are trying to get a solid hold then you need to apply more, but the problem there is begins to get flakey and turn your mustache the color of the cream. So, I would probably buy it again but I will also try some other creams. Everybody&#x27;s stach is different and the hairs tend to be hard to train. So, the best advise is give it a try.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re blonde, or grey-blonde, the blonde moustache wax looks yellow.  The neutral is just right, but, again cannot find this in stores.</li>
            <li> So I decided this year to start waxing my mustache, and after reading other reviews on blogs and Amazon, I purchased Clubman Pinaud Mustache Wax, and after using it for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s not the wax for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is simple, a tube, and an applicator(which is a real nice addition), but a lack of instructions is a little frustrating. Thankfully, Google exists. After learning how to wax properly, I&#x27;ve discovered that Clubman simply doesn&#x27;t have the hold I need. It applies just fine, the smell is neutral, and it feels good, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the hold I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So really, the product isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just not for me. If you&#x27;re starting out waxing, try this product to get the hang of it. As for me, I&#x27;ll be looking for a firmer wax in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and meets and exceeds all my expectations.  Best wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li> clubman moustache wax works very well, the best I have ever tried.I will buy this product from now on. thanks for a great wax and great service.</li>
            <li> My husband has had a handlebar mustache for many years and this is his preferred mustache wax.  He&#x27;s tried other brands, but they don&#x27;t even come close to working as well as Pinaud&#x27;s.  At times it can be difficult to find in stores, so being able to easily order it through Amazon is terrific.</li>
            <li> I have really thick black hair. It holds great when you apply a great amount. However, the more you apply to the stache the more it turns white. There must be a better product for someone like me with super thick hair. Other than that, this product gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This moustache wax brand has been around for a hundred years.  A lot of handlebar moustache aficionados don&#x27;t like it, but I do.  The best way to use it is to heat the tube by either putting it in hot water or with a hair dryer.  This makes the wax softer and easier to apply.  The little comb that comes with it is pretty useless.  Squeeze a small amount onto your finger and work it into your moustache.  Then comb it through with a regular comb or a Kent moustache comb.  Finish molding your moustache with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Held the facial hair in place without the feeling of stickyness. Great aroma as well, lemons were a great touch.</li>
            <li> I decided to grow out my mustache, and the only moustache wax I could find locally was a generic that wasn&#x27;t very good.  The Clubman is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try something with a bit more hold some day, but from what I&#x27;ve heard those are difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> Primo stuff for a &#x27;stache.</li>
            <li> After much deliberation on what to try for my first foray into waxing my mustache, I decided to try this product.  It had several good reviews and is from a company that is as old as the hills, so I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  I tried to find the product locally, but it was nowhere to be found.  As usual, Amazon to the rescue!  I was able to find it here at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I received the mustache wax, I have to say that I was extremely pleased.  It&#x27;s not too soft, nor too firm and it very easy to work in.  You aren&#x27;t left with a greasy feel and it has a pleasant &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34; aroma.  The only down side is that it could hold a bit better, but I live in Tennessee where it gets quite hot and humid in the summer.  I imagine that had a lot to do with it, and if I had been willing to spend a bit more, there are other brands that claim to hold better in such conditions.  Overall, I am still quite comfortable giving this product 5/5 stars.</li>
            <li> I use this on my sideburns and my eyebrows. Yes, my eyebrows - more specifically, my right one. ha - I don&#x27;t have bushy eyebrows but there is this one section where the hairs jut out making me look like I have a horn or an antler growing out of my eyebrow! It&#x27;s been driving me nuts and when I was using this on my sideburns decided to give it a go on my eyebrow - wow, it works great. I have black hair but this white &#x27;neutral&#x27; color worked great. It smoothed right in and it doesn&#x27;t look waxy or discolored and no one can tell I had to use mustache wax on it. Yes, I tried cutting the hair that shot out but then it looked like Jason from those Halloween movies had a go at my eyebrow and I never lived that one down.</li>
            <li> I needed some mustache wax and I needed just 1 tube but I was extremely surprised to find 3 tubes (I guess I didn&#x27;t read the product description or now my luck has been extended now that I have an awesome mustache)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Lasts Long&lt;br /&gt;* Smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t bond as well in heat (because it&#x27;s beeswax so not fault really just for additional information for someone that is curious)</li>
            <li> This makes me look like I have dandruff in my moustache.  It doesn&#x27;t do too well on controlling the hair.</li>
            <li> As another poster indicates, it&#x27;s all about the weather conditions. Cool and dry and this product sins. Goes on easily. Introduce any heat or humidity, and the hour or so of wear deteriorates to minutes; certainly not a tacky our right hold. The comb however is junky and the teeth bend to be unusable after a couple of uses (full disclosure: I wax my entire beard so those come of uses is way more than only a moustache, which it was designed for). I keep it in the bathroom for rush mornings and does the job. Unfortunately against its&#x27; competition, not that well. It doesn&#x27;t leave any mess, and smells decent.</li>
            <li> My husband used to love this. But now he uses Firehouse wax: wacky tacky. He says that is way better.</li>
            <li> This product works with minimal hassle and cost.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but this is the best wax out there. I like using neutral as it does not smear.</li>
            <li> IMHO, the brush is pointless. The wax goes on well. I&#x27;ve learned that what works best is to start with a very small amount, work it in with your fingers, then apply additional wax. Applying too much at first makes a mess.</li>
            <li> This was the first &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; I used when I decided to stop cutting the hair on my face (I had long ago stopped cutting the hair on my head and thought this would be more symmetrical). The Clubman wax never gets very thick and can be applied without being warmed up (something I have had to do with other waxes), and it normally can be worked into the hair effectively (though if you are not very very careful your hair will have white flecks in it -- if you are gray-bearded you will be none the worse, but I have not earned my gray hairs yet). The major problem is that it is not very water resistant. If you are a sloppy drinker and do not carry a straw, or if you have to walk through the rain, Clubman wax will make you very sad (tears will also negatively impact Clubman wax, so don&#x27;t get too sad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely walk in the rain, or drink sloppily, or cry (though perhaps I should do this more often), so its lack-of-hold-when-wet was unproblematic. What ultimately made me switch to Firehouse Wax from Clubman was length -- as my mustache became a handlebar the Clubman could not hold it in place. I started with a handlebar, which lasted maybe an hour before it fluffed up and became...a bit ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have shorter facial hair and you want to tone down its intrinsic fuzziness, and you don&#x27;t often get wet, this stuff is fine, with the added perk of being easier to work with than a genuine wax. I happily used it for a number of months. If you have longer facial hair like a handlebar mustache, look elsewhere, because it does not provide a tight hold and is not water resistant.</li>
            <li> For the people that this product works for I am envious, but from my experience it is more misses then hits</li>
            <li> nice holding wax for the handlebars</li>
            <li> You can spend $30 on moustache wax but it won&#x27;t work any better than this product. Stern&#x27;s, Brother&#x27;s Love, and Dr. Dittmar are all good but I don&#x27;t think they are worth the price. If you think it goes on too thick, wet the comb and it blends well. I keep a tube in my pocket and it keeps the wax soft.In the morning I will run hot water over the tube to make the wax more pliable.&lt;br /&gt;The subject of applicability is the only reason I might suggest trying Brother&#x27;s Loveif you can get over the cost, approximately $11 for a 15ml tube.</li>
            <li> It goes on wet and dries in a few minutes. You may want to wait a few minutes before styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small drawback is that it is not really neutral. Some of the white shows, even after styling. Occasional combing throughout the day eventually makes the white go away. It&#x27;s not a big deal, because I already have some white hairs, and it makes me look as if I have a few more.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and applicator is small and inferior</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get a better wax. This stuff is super white and does not dry clear. Drys powdery and leaves a dirty looking stash. The smell is ok, and the hold is medium. It does work I just won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with product and quality.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this all the time and Amazon is the only place we can find it!</li>
            <li> This is the first actual Moustache Wax I&#x27;ve used. I tried some other products without successs. It takes a little getting used to, I didn&#x27;t find the comb helpful. The wax has to be worked with your fingers a little bit before applying so as not to visible clumps of wax in your stache. I ordered 3 tubes about 6 months ago and I&#x27;m getting ready to order some more.</li>
            <li> Creamy consistency makes for easy application, no sacrifice on hold! Lack of smell means it won&#x27;t clash with other manly products!</li>
            <li> Very cheap for the amount of wax your given. I recommend this to anyone needing mustache wax. It holds for hours and is very easy to apply. My only complaint would be the the residue build up when using too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the last 20+ years but this is the one I always come back to. In fact, others usually went in the garbage after one try. I don&#x27;t look for any other brand any more.</li>
            <li> A great choice for anyone, who needs to take care of unruly moustache or needs to apply special form to them. Smells yummy and is easy to apply. Best choice for money!</li>
