            <li>It was huge and once putting it on it broke!</li>
            <li>I think it has more to do with the way the cuff is positioned though.</li>

            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t fit on my ear!</li>

            <li>This item came as suggested but it is really easy to break</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay on easily.</li>
            <li>It was a beutiful earring but it isnt easy to put on</li>
            <li>I love this product, very fashionable and its nice to wear around while im out.</li>
            <li>but once my daughter figured it out she was very pleased with it thanks</li>
            <li>the earring came quickly which pleased us</li>
            <li>I recognize this was a cheap item</li>
            <li>but otherwise I enjoy the earring itself.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit my ear</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fit it on my ear.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit; It is supposed to hook onto the side of your ear, but I can&#x27;t get the clamp around the cartilage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This earring doesn&#x27;t fit all ear types and isn&#x27;t that adjustable.  </li>
            <li>The craftsmanship is wonderful, and I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a special little trinket.</li>
            <li>it is cool but dose not stay on ear</li>
            <li>Looks cool, if you could get it on...</li>
            <li>I loved it even more once it showed up, but I&#x27;ve been having some trouble trying to put it on correctly...</li>
            <li>but i did use super glue.</li>
            <li>and it is very pretty</li>
            <li>Well when I first got it I was excited.</li>
            <li>doesnt fit the ear very well</li>
            <li>Even for one dollar it wasn&#x27;t worth it to buy.</li>
            <li>The shipping on this item was much quicker than expected and that was great.  </li>
            <li>clasp was not put on right which in itself is a downfall.</li>
            <li>Now I am stuck with an earring that cannot be used because it doesn&#x27;t stay in the right place without the loop.</li>
            <li>and i really like it!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly the way it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>Very disappointment because I really love dragons and thought this was perfect.  </li>
            <li>This item is pretty large.</li>
            <li>Badddddd it came broken.upset.mad.was really looking forward to wearing it</li>
            <li>It ended up staying on her ear most of a day walking around, with minimal readjusting.</li>
            <li>i really like it, i got what i was expecting, it was just like you see it on the amazon pictures</li>
            <li>People really was amazed by this earring</li>
            <li>It was what I expected, a fun piece, but it is cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>I think I have normal sized ears!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I bought a second one that came free with this other snake earring.  </li>
            <li>its more as cosplay instead of everyday wear</li>
            <li>and I have normal sized ears</li>
            <li>and i have normal size ears.</li>
            <li>The price was right but the actual cuff did not seem to be soldered on in the correct place.  </li>
            <li>Although my sister (Who is 16) loves the item and has taken all the other Dragon-Earring items I purchased for myself since she can fit it onto her</li>
            <li>but it is a little sharp good price.</li>
            <li>otherwise it&#x27;s a fun little item for a younger crowd, and it does look fantastic.</li>
            <li>They are made really really cheap, and not worth the two dollars, and what ever cents</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay maybe for a small ear, my daughter wears it to play..</li>
            <li>Looks pretty cool, but broke the second time wearing it due to metal fatigue on the part you clamp to your ear.</li>
            <li>The item itself was ok, the dragon is pretty but the cuff to put it on your ear is quite flimsy and easily broken.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Halloween costume, and the clasp is not very strong and will more than likely break soon.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my ear, and broke when I tried to bend it a little to stay up.</li>
            <li>the price is awesome only thing bad</li>
            <li>Do not waste the money on shipping this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having trouble getting it to fit my ear.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks so far.</li>
            <li>I seriously just love this.</li>
            <li>Then I tried it on and I realize, it barely fits me</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people who like dragons, and I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these as well, and once I bought them, it seemed like a lot of people wanted them, and so I had to buy a whole lot of these and the other dragon design earring like this.</li>

            <li> Really ugly and fit poorly, had to do some twisting and it still doesnt fit right</li>
            <li> Really cheap and really uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It pretty little piece, but hurt the ear and is hard to get it on.</li>
            <li> Dragon is heavy, difficult to put on, and falls off easily.  </li>
            <li> I think it did end up being irritating after a certain amount of time, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to wear randomly for the fun of it, but I have issues keeping it on my ear.</li>

            <li> The clasp was flimsy and it broke in half as I was trying to get it on.</li>
            <li> When I tried to adjust the actual cuff, it broke the second I tried to open the cuff a little wider &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> they also did not fit my ears</li>
            <li> Does not fit avg size ears</li>
            <li> Would not fit on her ear.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> icn think of is the trouble of puttin it on</li>
            <li> It came missing one piece (the small loop close to the tail).</li>
            <li> unfortunately it broke almost instantly.</li>
            <li> It was really small for like a child&#x27;s ear</li>
            <li> not only that they thought it was really expensive</li>
            <li> but it took forever to arrive and when it did it was broken in half while still in the package.</li>
            <li> Hard to get on and could use another hook.</li>
            <li> it was too late to return it</li>
            <li> Apparently it is broken, but I coud not find the missing piece inside the package.</li>
            <li> My ear starts forming in a right angle and its just horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought one as a gift and didn&#x27;t give it to them because it was broken inside the wrapper.  </li>
            <li> , i am not happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt me or hasn&#x27;t broken on me</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a friend and was wary of the reviews.</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very disappointed that it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> so I am very disappointed in this service.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product, very fashionable and its nice to wear around while im out. Only think is the clasp at the bottom is about to break and ive only worn it 3 times, and the arm of the dragon cuts my ear.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. I love cuff earring anything unique and stands out. This does that. I have gotten several comments on it already.</li>
            <li> It is cute and cheap, so you get what you pay for. It irritates my ear so I dont wear it but it does look good when I do put it on.</li>
            <li> it is cool but dose not stay on ear</li>
            <li> Badddddd it came broken.upset.mad.was really looking forward to wearing it but I guess I will never get the chance too and I would never buy this item again</li>
            <li> doesnt fit the ear very well</li>
            <li> Really ugly and fit poorly, had to do some twisting and it still doesnt fit right and my ear hurts.</li>
            <li> The earring will not stay put, it keeps falling off and the bottom cuff broke off, both of the earrings i bought.  I bought one as a gift and didn&#x27;t give it to them because it was broken inside the wrapper.  Very disappointment because I really love dragons and thought this was perfect.  But it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> the earring came quickly which pleased us and it is very pretty, it took some playtime to figure out how to put on but once my daughter figured it out she was very pleased with it thanks</li>
            <li> I just got mine&#x27;s through the mail...and well I looked at the lower cuff is not same as in the photo they have displayed... they also did not fit my ears</li>
            <li> It first of all it is way to small, when i put it on it broke, i am not happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> The cuff can&#x27;t support the weight of the dragon. I think it has more to do with the way the cuff is positioned though. My daughter was very disappointed that it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> even though i wait a lot of time, the earing material is very nice, the model us well done and i really like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a friend and was wary of the reviews. It ended up staying on her ear most of a day walking around, with minimal readjusting. I think it did end up being irritating after a certain amount of time, but that is to be expected. It looked AWESOME and she has average sized ears and we made it work.</li>
            <li> Cute, fun, going to make a great stocking stuffer for the kids!  Excited to see what they think on Christmas day!</li>
            <li> I recognize this was a cheap item but it took forever to arrive and when it did it was broken in half while still in the package. Lame. Do not waste the money on shipping this item.</li>

            <li> Well when I first got it I was excited. Then I tried it on and I realize, it barely fits me -_-. My ear starts forming in a right angle and its just horrible. I think I have normal sized ears!</li>
            <li> They are made really really cheap, and not worth the two dollars, and what ever cents it cost me for the two I purchased. One was broke in the mail before I even got it. WILL NOT BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> It pretty little piece, but hurt the ear and is hard to get it on. reason why I gave it 3 our 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very cute piece of jewelry unfortunately it broke almost instantly. It didn&#x27;t fit my ear and I tried to make it work for me but it didn&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t fit it on my ear. Not well constructed. Even for one dollar it wasn&#x27;t worth it to buy.</li>

            <li> Dragon is heavy, difficult to put on, and falls off easily.  More appropriate size for a man than a woman.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t  stay on. the dragon keeps falling off of my ear.&lt;br /&gt;i want a refund. i cant even wear it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to wear randomly for the fun of it, but I have issues keeping it on my ear. Although my sister (Who is 16) loves the item and has taken all the other Dragon-Earring items I purchased for myself since she can fit it onto her ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why it doesn&#x27;t fit; It is supposed to hook onto the side of your ear, but I can&#x27;t get the clamp around the cartilage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But otherwise it&#x27;s a fun little item for a younger crowd, and it does look fantastic. The craftsmanship is wonderful, and I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a special little trinket.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay maybe for a small ear, my daughter wears it to play..its more as cosplay instead of everyday wear</li>
            <li> This item is pretty large. Does not fit avg size ears</li>
            <li> The earring was kinda rough c a by wear it for lo g before it starts to bother my ear</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter.  The price was right but the actual cuff did not seem to be soldered on in the correct place.  Would not fit on her ear.  We will try to solder the cuff where it should be. Looks cool, if you could get it on...</li>
            <li> I ordered the dragon for a reason and not the snake. No pierced ear so I am very disappointed in this service. 10/10 would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty cool, but broke the second time wearing it due to metal fatigue on the part you clamp to your ear.</li>
            <li> This is great! I love it! Yay!...... Are all the things I wish I could say, but I never got it! I ordered it like over a month or two ago and still haven&#x27;t gotten or anything. It says it shipped but... /:</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Halloween costume, and the clasp is not very strong and will more than likely break soon.  I&#x27;ve been having trouble getting it to fit my ear.</li>
            <li> I loved it even more once it showed up, but I&#x27;ve been having some trouble trying to put it on correctly...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but didn&#x27;t fit my ear. It&#x27;s made for petite ears.</li>
            <li> Hard to get on and could use another hook. Doesn&#x27;t stay on easily.</li>
            <li> excellent care and products at the expected time as well as the just boxes to package size</li>
            <li> The ear cuff is so cute! Looks exactly the way it does in the picture. It was in good quality &amp; was here a whole month ahead of time! It took only a couple of days to get here. It doesn&#x27;t hurt me or hasn&#x27;t broken on me &amp; I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks so far.</li>
            <li> like it but it is a little sharp good price. It only hurt after wearing it for about two hours</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a friend. It was really small for like a child&#x27;s ear and then it broke after she tried to use it. The product is not made well at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my ear, and broke when I tried to bend it a little to stay up. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It came missing one piece (the small loop close to the tail). Apparently it is broken, but I coud not find the missing piece inside the package. As it took me some time to get the earring (it was mailed to a friend&#x27;s house) I missed the timeline to have it replaced or to get a refund. Now I am stuck with an earring that cannot be used because it doesn&#x27;t stay in the right place without the loop.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this item was much quicker than expected and that was great.  The item itself was ok, the dragon is pretty but the cuff to put it on your ear is quite flimsy and easily broken.</li>
            <li> People really was amazed by this earring n i loved the attention...not only that they thought it was really expensive lol bt the price is awesome only thing bad icn think of is the trouble of puttin it on</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t fit on my ear! I was very excited about it and I have normal sized ears but I couldn&#x27;t get it on! The clasp was flimsy and it broke in half as I was trying to get it on.</li>
            <li> I seriously just love this. I was at work and everyone litterally stopped me to ask me where i got it so hopefully you will be getting more buys!!!! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my graduation. i went to go put it on and it snapped into 2 pieces. it was too late to return it but i did use super glue. will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It was a beutiful earring but it isnt easy to put on and i have normal size ears. It fits in all the wrong place but for the price i guess its ok.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I bought a second one that came free with this other snake earring.  When I tried to adjust the actual cuff, it broke the second I tried to open the cuff a little wider &#x3D;( Really cheap and really uncomfortable.  This earring doesn&#x27;t fit all ear types and isn&#x27;t that adjustable.  Really fragile.</li>
            <li> I liked this in the picture but when I received it. It was huge and once putting it on it broke! I understand it was a cheap buy but would loved to have it for more than a day.</li>
