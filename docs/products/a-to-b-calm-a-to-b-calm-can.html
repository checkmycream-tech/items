            <li>Great calcium supplement.  </li>
            <li>great recommendation from acupuncturist, Scot Pietz in Boise, ID.</li>

            <li>My family has been using this for decades, and I&#x27;m thrilled to see it available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>My Neuro recommended this product, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>They work very well too but not as great as this one specifically \\&quot;A-B\\</li>
            <li>but it was a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I want to try it just to make my body feel better but not go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>but much better than before using the product mentioned.</li>
            <li>Relieves muscle spasms quickly and effectively for me.</li>
            <li>I felt myself drift off as I sipped a warm cup of this CALM.  </li>
            <li>A to B Calm is the best - it helps us sleep, gets rid of muscle cramps and headaches, and helps us focus more the next day.</li>
            <li>I am more comfortable and sleep much more soundly.</li>
            <li>Has a very mild flavor (doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit) and also mixes well with orange juice or peppermint tea.</li>

            <li>Works great for Restless Legs Syndrome, especially after you have tried everything else.</li>

            <li>Great way to take calcium and magnesium - definitely helps with leg cramps and muscle twitches.</li>
            <li>I had only gotten 3.5 hours of sleep but it was great sleep.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;About 20 years ago I discovered A to B Calm Insant Calcium Magnesium Drink Powder for night cramps and and drink it mostly every day.</li>
            <li>A-B Calm has been more help than them all.  </li>
            <li>I felt good enough to work on a sewing project all day!  </li>
            <li>I decided to take the A-B Calm again so that I could get good sleep and try to recover in only 3.5 hours.  </li>
            <li>40 minutes after taking this drink I felt the Calm, Warmth flowing into my muscles.</li>
            <li>I order A to B Calm for others, I cannot get reimburse  for my money without the receipts.  </li>
            <li>I used you because they were out of A to B Calm.</li>
            <li>&quot; CALM.  </li>
            <li>We use A-to-B Calm to prevent muscle cramps.  </li>
            <li>delivery was super fast!</li>
            <li>What I like to do is take it at night, right before bed, and mix it with some dandelion root tea which supports the liver and helps with detox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; Yea, right.</li>
            <li>I recommend this producdt very much for people who experience leg pain and cramps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking this regularly for more than 10 years for muscle cramps or soreness and for stress.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, and the larger can</li>
            <li>You must use hot water to dissolve it, then ice cubes can be added.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon even though it cost a pretty penney.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tasting and least offensive of any instant cal mag.  </li>
            <li>Dissolves fast.</li>
            <li>Really helps with evening restlessness.  </li>
            <li>I was in so much body pain.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast it worked for me.  </li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t know why anyone would discount it at all.  </li>
            <li>It can be used straight or with tea.</li>
            <li>Still do not sleep real well</li>
            <li>It helps me sleep without medication, It tastes much better than other powdered magnesium and it is truly unflavored unlike others that claim to be.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend dissolving in half a cup of hot water and then either adding cool water or ice cubes to make up the rest.</li>
            <li>However, I will have to try and find a new supplier.  </li>
            <li>I woke up and felt just like new.  </li>
            <li>It goes down fine once it is room temperature.</li>
            <li>We tried a similar product once and it contained a large amount of magnesium -- like milk of magnesia.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was about four or five years old when it began abd continued thrughout my child hood up to now.</li>
            <li>I order it frequently from Amazon.</li>
            <li>All of the reviewers agree that it works exactly as it claims and for the first time, I know that there are no fake reviews about at least one product!  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products called CALM that are Calcium Magnesium drinks.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it at five stars is because it requires a tiny bit of inconvenience to boil water first.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t taste it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Please ask for fast shipping because it did take a long time to get to the Midwest.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Pain in my calves, feet and shins have interruped my sleep with intense pain as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>A to B Calm is one of those supplements that hands down I cannot do without.  </li>
            <li>I just add it to boiling water and drink it with no other enhancements.</li>
            <li>I eat fairly well with veggies, chicken or fish made into \\&quot;simple but norishment</li>

            <li> Excellent for calming muscle spasms. Relieves muscle spasms quickly and effectively for me. It tastes horrible while hot. I recommend dissolving in half a cup of hot water and then either adding cool water or ice cubes to make up the rest. It goes down fine once it is room temperature.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tasting and least offensive of any instant cal mag.  Just add hot water and no smell, no partial dissolving, so bad taste.  I&#x27;ve been taking this regularly for more than 10 years for muscle cramps or soreness and for stress.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough, and the price on Amazon is way below retail (if you can even find it).&lt;br /&gt;And delivery was super fast!</li>
            <li> Just thought I would suggest that you can put this in veg caps and ingest it that way if you don&#x27;t wanna drink it...</li>
            <li> Works great for Restless Legs Syndrome, especially after you have tried everything else. I have very active spasms with my RLS and this calms the down almost immediately.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A to B Calm is one of those supplements that hands down I cannot do without.  I notice the difference when I don&#x27;t take it!  This supplement totally helps you get into a restful and relaxing sleep at night.  It also helps for post-exercise muscle recovery.  When I bump up my running I always use this to help me stave off the usual aches and pains that accompany a 50+ plus year old runner!  It&#x27;s virtually tasteless when you add it to hot water, give it a stir and drink down.  What I like to do is take it at night, right before bed, and mix it with some dandelion root tea which supports the liver and helps with detox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Mother in law liked it as a gift</li>
            <li> I was experiencing very bad whole body cramps after my thyroidectomy where a couple of my para thyroids were also removed. Docs could not figure out what was going on as blood work was just fine. I tried 7 other products without relief. A friend recommended this. 40 minutes after taking this drink I felt the Calm, Warmth flowing into my muscles. I have not had any pain in 12 days now. I dissolve it in 1/2 cup of boiling water, then add the mixture to OJ Or Cranberry Juice with ice. I can&#x27;t taste it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Please ask for fast shipping because it did take a long time to get to the Midwest.&lt;br /&gt;Good Health to You!&lt;br /&gt;Jo</li>
            <li> TEN STARS!  This product is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> My family has been using this for decades, and I&#x27;m thrilled to see it available through Amazon. This formula addresses tension in the deep muscles along the leg (and other) bones and lets me finally relax! It doesn&#x27;t make me sleepy, but when I do go to bed I am more comfortable and sleep much more soundly. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Great calcium supplement.  A bonus is that it aids sleep in the evening.  I just add it to boiling water and drink it with no other enhancements.</li>
            <li> Love the product, and the larger can</li>
            <li> Used this to combat night leg cramps. Works well as long as I limit sweets before bed. If I don&#x27;t I wake up with a cramp and have to eat a banana for relief.</li>
            <li> This is the best source for calcium amd magnesium. Dissolves fast. Helps you sleep and relaxes muscles, which then helps the pain go away.</li>
            <li> I have used A to B Calm for years, of course I love it.  However, I will have to try and find a new supplier.  You do not send receipts.  I order A to B Calm for others, I cannot get reimburse  for my money without the receipts.  I don&#x27;t understand every body send a receipts with your orders accept you.  Your prices are higher than suppliers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I used you because they were out of A to B Calm.</li>
            <li> My Neuro recommended this product, and I absolutely love it. Have ordered the 16oz cans each time, and drink it warm before bed each night. Has a very mild flavor (doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit) and also mixes well with orange juice or peppermint tea. Great way to take calcium and magnesium - definitely helps with leg cramps and muscle twitches.</li>
            <li> Wonderful,Yet expensive.</li>
            <li> It helps me sleep without medication, It tastes much better than other powdered magnesium and it is truly unflavored unlike others that claim to be.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working quite well!</li>
            <li> Have not found any product to beat it to avoid night time  cramps or restless legs.</li>
            <li> Really helps with evening restlessness.  I wassceptical. Do not take herbal remidies, etc.  great recommendation from acupuncturist, Scot Pietz in Boise, ID.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products called CALM that are Calcium Magnesium drinks.  They work very well too but not as great as this one specifically \\&quot;A-B\\&quot; CALM.  I don&#x27;t even know what that means.  I don&#x27;t care.  I was in so much body pain.  I didn&#x27;t know why I was aching all over.  I ached all day but thought it was going away, so I went out to eat with friends.  I became miserable after an hour.  I hurt all over and then I caught a chill.  I feel like I tensed up every muscle in my body shivering at this restaurant and then at a club to hear my friend sing.  I took this to relax my muscles after shivering all night.  I took nothing else because all-over-body-ache was my only problem.  I felt myself drift off as I sipped a warm cup of this CALM.  I felt the tension and the chills leave me and I slept through the night.  I woke up and felt just like new.  I always have back pain every day but it was a lot better.  I felt good enough to work on a sewing project all day!  I felt so good that I accidentally stayed up all night sewing on my project til 6:30 am!  I decided to take the A-B Calm again so that I could get good sleep and try to recover in only 3.5 hours.  I woke up refreshed at 11am.  I had only gotten 3.5 hours of sleep but it was great sleep.  I believe in this one.  I can&#x27;t believe how fast it worked for me.  All of the reviewers agree that it works exactly as it claims and for the first time, I know that there are no fake reviews about at least one product!  It&#x27;s not supposed to knock you out like a drug so I really don&#x27;t know why anyone would discount it at all.  It has no taste and ZERO side effects.  I want to try it just to make my body feel better but not go to sleep.  I will update and let you know if I feel too tired to function throughout the day after sipping.  I think we should all buy this for Grandma and Grandpa...seriously.</li>
            <li> It has seemed to help me with seemingly constant dehydration. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it at five stars is because it requires a tiny bit of inconvenience to boil water first. Since I take it only at bedtime, it&#x27;s not a major issue unless I&#x27;m traveling. I am thankful for this product.</li>
            <li> We use A-to-B Calm to prevent muscle cramps.  We tried a similar product once and it contained a large amount of magnesium -- like milk of magnesia. It can be taken any time, but we take it before bedtime. You must use hot water to dissolve it, then ice cubes can be added.  It can be used straight or with tea.</li>
            <li> Deep and excrusing pain in my shins, feet and calves has plagued me all my life long. I was born in 1936 and to this day the pain continues. \\&quot;Growing pains that she will outgrow.\\&quot; Yea, right. Pain in my calves, feet and shins have interruped my sleep with intense pain as long as I can remember. My mother would get up in the middle of the night and massage my legs while I cried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about four or five years old when it began abd continued thrughout my child hood up to now. I was born in 1936 and the pains are still with me.I am thin.I eat fairly well with veggies, chicken or fish made into \\&quot;simple but norishment repasts\\&quot; quoted by my Aunt Frances from the silly novels and penny dreadfulls read while in her teens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 20 years ago I discovered A to B Calm Insant Calcium Magnesium Drink Powder for night cramps and and drink it mostly every day. Nasty tastening stuff but it works to lessen my pain and at time it goes away. I recommend this producdt very much for people who experience leg pain and cramps. I order it frequently from Amazon. I used to have a hard time locating it in healthfood stores. Thank you Amazon even though it cost a pretty penney.</li>
            <li> My mom (age 93) suffers from restless leg snydrome. A friend suggested she try this a couple of year ago. and she has been using it for a while. It appears to help her.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t slept well for years and have tried numerous thing including prescriptions.  Was not able to get any satisfaction from any of them.  A-B Calm has been more help than them all.  Still do not sleep real well but much better than before using the product mentioned.</li>
            <li> A to B Calm is the best - it helps us sleep, gets rid of muscle cramps and headaches, and helps us focus more the next day.</li>
