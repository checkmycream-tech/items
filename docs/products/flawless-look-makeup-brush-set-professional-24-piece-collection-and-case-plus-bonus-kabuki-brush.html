            <li>Work amazingly</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice holding case that rolls up and ties.</li>
            <li>i liked how it came with like</li>
            <li>I own a couple Sigma brushes and these compare to their quality and density.</li>
            <li>They pick up makeup well and apply quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I am glad that pick this set,and also love quality of these brushes and also great price...</li>
            <li>very good item i would order again when the time is right.</li>
            <li>The eye brushes are phenomenal and I can&#x27;t wait to use the face brushes to perfect my contouring skills ;)</li>
            <li>The travel case alone was great as it was easy to carry and had a spot for every brush so now matter where you were going you would be able to take the kit with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I CLEANED THEM BEFORE USING THEM WITH PARIAN SPIRIT (A PROFESSIONAL BRUSH CLEANER AND AN AWESOME PRODUCT I RECOMMEND).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d easily pay $400 for this set!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone, beginner or pro because of the fantastic price and superb  quality!</li>
            <li>BUT MOST OF THE MAKEUP STAYS IN THE BRUSHES</li>
            <li>and now I have to look for more brushes.</li>
            <li>I am glad i invested in them and will recommend them to anyone who is looking for brushes.</li>
            <li>My daughter will love it.</li>
            <li>Brushes are fabulous!</li>
            <li>and they were fantastic!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure sure for the price</li>
            <li>In fact, there are so many</li>
            <li>I chose this because it is the cheapest and most quality</li>
            <li>Plus you get so many different brushes and a beautiful carrying case!</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret buying this set! :)</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m satisfied greatly.</li>
            <li>The packing was perfect and it got to me in great no perfect shape, and in plenty of time for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>: They are super soft, don&#x27;t shed and are just the right size :D</li>
            <li>but I am going to try some more sophisticated looks because now I have the right tools.</li>
            <li>I use less foundation, achieve flawless &amp;#34;my skin but better&amp;#34; looks with it, and don&#x27;t get ANY streaking from the brush after applying.  </li>
            <li>i dont use all of them but the ones i do use such as foundation brush &amp; blush brush are great</li>
            <li>I especially appreciated the price that you pay considering what you get and the quality of each and every brush.</li>
            <li>I insisted my best friend pick out a few for herself, too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I should also note that immediately after my purchase, I received an email thanking me for my purchase and outlining directions on how to clean them.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for some good brushes.</li>
            <li>The personal email was a great touch and showed how much the sellers care about their customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get super fancy with my makeup</li>
            <li>Plus, the brushes were delivered quickly and the customer service and follow up has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>and she was amazed at how many high quality brushes come with this set.</li>
            <li>They do not shed, are very soft and so many choices.</li>
            <li>Great price for the amount of brushes you get and very soft, but MULTIPLE</li>
            <li>Received them a day earlier than expected, and they were in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>Love these brushes--super soft and plenty to choose from.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am genuinely looking forward to using these brushes for my makeup, and they surpass the many other large brush packs available on amazon!</li>
            <li>The brushes are all very soft, and don&#x27;t lose their hair which is nice, but the set is far from perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I told her the price for my readers her mouth simply dropped open, as she mentioned that this was a great deal.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY recommend because you get a lot of high quality brushes for so cheap :3</li>
            <li>Also all of the brushes are soft and better priced than pretty much anything that you&#x27;ll find at stores like Ulta, Sephora, and even Walmart.</li>
            <li>I actually received my item before the date described, of which I was pleased about.</li>
            <li>I love them and I look forward to purchasing from Sheer again.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>THE SPONGE FROM THE SPONGE BRUSH CAME RIGHT OUT WHEN I DIPPED IT INTO THE BRUSH CLEANER AND ALSO WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Very soft and good application.&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow brush I love as well.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge tip brush, the lash/brow comb, and the mascara brush are very poorly made</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>AND THEY WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE.</li>
            <li>TO KNOW WHICH BRUSH IS USED FOR WHAT WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The one eye brush I really liked-the precision liner</li>
            <li>and it is a product I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, very awesome&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li>The only thing I really liked about this product were the smaller brushes and the case to carry them.</li>
            <li>There is no shedding, the brushes are super soft and they are comparable to any high priced brush that I have used before...</li>
            <li>Theyre dense and very comparable to high end brushes</li>
            <li>have two main issues with this set:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>These are high end brushes like MAC or Sigma.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed (unlike some high end brushes I&#x27;ve gotten) and don&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
            <li>Very soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li>They are strong and soft, and the little hairs don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>So soft and hold the make-up the brushes.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t anticipate them lasting very long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Soft, professional finish for your makeup</li>
            <li>However, something I&#x27;ve noticed is that there are really no fluffy brushes in the set.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sheer Cosmetics!!</li>
            <li>They pick up product really well and the kabuki brush is amazing (a little small though, about the size of a dime).</li>
            <li>I just got these today, so I can say zilch about their lifespan, but my first impression of these brushes is that they are very soft and extremely</li>
            <li>regards to the smell, the bag smells like a new pool toy, but that&#x27;s just what that material smells like, so no big.</li>
            <li>My only complain is that three of the brushes fell off the base, but honestly, I&#x27;ll take three brushes that need to be glue-gunned for having 24 amazing brushes at such a low price any day!</li>
            <li>None of the brushes are loose and soft enough to create even the simplest of smokey eyes without a very steady hand.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 16 yr old daughter for Christamas as it was one of the only things she wanted</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve lasted now for about 3 months and we&#x27;ve had no problems, no loose hairs, no nothing.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit after trying lots of other brushes and doing way too much research.</li>
            <li>When I bought this set I was hoping I would have all the brushes I need to do everyday makeup, but unfortunately not.</li>

            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The one eye brush I really liked-the precision liner</li>
            <li> and it is a product I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , very awesome&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> The only thing I really liked about this product were the smaller brushes and the case to carry them.</li>
            <li> There is no shedding, the brushes are super soft and they are comparable to any high priced brush that I have used before...</li>
            <li> Theyre dense and very comparable to high end brushes</li>
            <li> have two main issues with this set:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These are high end brushes like MAC or Sigma.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed (unlike some high end brushes I&#x27;ve gotten) and don&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> Very soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li> They are strong and soft, and the little hairs don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> So soft and hold the make-up the brushes.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t anticipate them lasting very long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Soft, professional finish for your makeup</li>
            <li> However, something I&#x27;ve noticed is that there are really no fluffy brushes in the set.</li>
            <li> Thanks Sheer Cosmetics!!</li>
            <li> They pick up product really well and the kabuki brush is amazing (a little small though, about the size of a dime).</li>
            <li> I just got these today, so I can say zilch about their lifespan, but my first impression of these brushes is that they are very soft and extremely</li>
            <li> regards to the smell, the bag smells like a new pool toy, but that&#x27;s just what that material smells like, so no big.</li>
            <li> My only complain is that three of the brushes fell off the base, but honestly, I&#x27;ll take three brushes that need to be glue-gunned for having 24 amazing brushes at such a low price any day!</li>
            <li> None of the brushes are loose and soft enough to create even the simplest of smokey eyes without a very steady hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 yr old daughter for Christamas as it was one of the only things she wanted</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve lasted now for about 3 months and we&#x27;ve had no problems, no loose hairs, no nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit after trying lots of other brushes and doing way too much research.</li>
            <li> When I bought this set I was hoping I would have all the brushes I need to do everyday makeup, but unfortunately not.</li>
            <li> would say this set is worth purchasing for the price, but you will need to supplement it with a few other brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought a blending crease brush and a small soft bristle brush from Sephora to make up for the lack of something similar in this set, and now I barely use the shadow brushes that came in this set.</li>
            <li> There is no clear determination from the powder brush or the blush brush as they both appear to be the same size</li>
            <li> Very soft and fluffy brushes!</li>
            <li> There are also a few repeat brushes in the pack and the liner brushes are a little too thick to create fine lines with a gel</li>
            <li> every single brush you would need.</li>
            <li> The bristles are packed so tight that you can only use them for precision application.</li>
            <li> THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LABELING OR ANYTHING</li>
            <li> None of them shed and now I have a wide variety of eyeshadow brushes to use for</li>
            <li> In my experience with brushes in the past, I have found that you usually get what you pay for and if you want high quality, you&#x27;ll need to shell out a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> The large fan brush feels a little thin in the hairs.</li>
            <li> I used to use either your typical paddle brush or duo fiber brush</li>
            <li> All of the eyeshadow brushes are too stiff.</li>
            <li> :-/  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with the powder brush and my large fan brush.</li>
            <li> approximetly nd they hardly ever shed.</li>
            <li> - THE BIG BRUSHES SHED HORRIBLY!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this deal.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought this product and they were all great so I bought this. Great price for the amount of brushes you get and very soft, but MULTIPLE problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: - PICKS UP MAKEUP VERY WELL BUT MOST OF THE MAKEUP STAYS IN THE BRUSHES&lt;br /&gt;  - THE BIG BRUSHES SHED HORRIBLY! 3 DAYS AFTER RECEIVING THEM AND USING THEM, ALL THE HAIR OF 3 OF THE BIG BRUSHES CAME OUT AND THEY WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE. SO UPSET ABOUT THAT.&lt;br /&gt;  - 1ST DAY I GOT THEM I CLEANED THEM BEFORE USING THEM WITH PARIAN SPIRIT (A PROFESSIONAL BRUSH CLEANER AND AN AWESOME PRODUCT I RECOMMEND). THE SPONGE FROM THE SPONGE BRUSH CAME RIGHT OUT WHEN I DIPPED IT INTO THE BRUSH CLEANER AND ALSO WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE.&lt;br /&gt;  - **** THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LABELING OR ANYTHING TO KNOW WHICH BRUSH IS USED FOR WHAT WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER buy this again and now I have to look for more brushes. The only thing I really liked about this product were the smaller brushes and the case to carry them.</li>
            <li> This was a great collection of makeup brushes. While my wife does not use a lot of makeup, I gave her this and she was amazed at how many high quality brushes come with this set. When I told her the price for my readers her mouth simply dropped open, as she mentioned that this was a great deal. She also said that the brushes themselves were of great quality and would work well for all types of makeup users. The travel case alone was great as it was easy to carry and had a spot for every brush so now matter where you were going you would be able to take the kit with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 yr old daughter for Christamas as it was one of the only things she wanted and she loved it!!  Great Quality!!</li>
            <li> I actually received my item before the date described, of which I was pleased about. The brushes are absolutely perfect! They are strong and soft, and the little hairs don&#x27;t fall out. I love them and I look forward to purchasing from Sheer again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with the powder brush and my large fan brush. The powder brush I received is not quite as full/fluffy as it appeared to be in the picture. There is no clear determination from the powder brush or the blush brush as they both appear to be the same size :-/  Maybe they sent me two blush brushes... who knows.  The large fan brush feels a little thin in the hairs. Its not a dense as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> 5 out of 5:  \\&quot;I received my make-up brushes 2 days ago and tried several already. They are beautiful!!! So soft and hold the make-up the brushes. There are 24 brushes and you get the case too. All this at a GREAT price, what a deal! I Highly recommend this product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter who is a TV Meteorologist! She love it! It comes in a nice holding case that rolls up and ties.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. Work amazingly and they don&#x27;t shed. I am glad i invested in them and will recommend them to anyone who is looking for brushes.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing brushes !!! I think theyre really good quality ive had them for 6 monthes approximetly nd they hardly ever shed. Theyre dense and very comparable to high end brushes</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazingly great deal! Wonderful brushes and a great company, They even  send emails with tips on how on how to use them!</li>
            <li> When I bought this set I was hoping I would have all the brushes I need to do everyday makeup, but unfortunately not. The brushes are all very soft, and don&#x27;t lose their hair which is nice, but the set is far from perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I have two main issues with this set:&lt;br /&gt;1. All of the eyeshadow brushes are too stiff. It&#x27;s not the hair itself, but the way the brush is made. The bristles are packed so tight that you can only use them for precision application. THERE IS NO BLENDING BRUSH. None of the brushes are loose and soft enough to create even the simplest of smokey eyes without a very steady hand. I bought a blending crease brush and a small soft bristle brush from Sephora to make up for the lack of something similar in this set, and now I barely use the shadow brushes that came in this set. Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;2. The one eye brush I really liked-the precision liner brush- splayed after 2 uses. I&#x27;ve tried fixing it, to no avail. So I will have to purchase another liner brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;The face brushes are great. Very soft and good application.&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow brush I love as well.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge tip brush, the lash/brow comb, and the mascara brush are very poorly made and I don&#x27;t anticipate them lasting very long.&lt;br /&gt;I would say this set is worth purchasing for the price, but you will need to supplement it with a few other brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, they are extremely good quality for the price!  I would recommend this particular set to anyone looking for a good set of brushes without spending a fortune on them.., and the bonus brush is perfect for applying liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Very soft and no shedding. I will update my review once I wash the brushes. So far I&#x27;m satisfied greatly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these, my daughter does in her line of work.  It looks like it will be the perfect gift for Christmas.  The packing was perfect and it got to me in great no perfect shape, and in plenty of time for Christmas.  This is a gift that will keep on giving.  My daughter will love it.</li>
            <li> Brushes are fabulous! They do not shed, are very soft and so many choices. I would buy them again, hope they last~</li>
            <li> Got these for the wife. She says they are the best brushes she&#x27;s ever had! They&#x27;ve lasted now for about 3 months and we&#x27;ve had no problems, no loose hairs, no nothing. Great product.</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter for Christmas and she LOVED them.  Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for some good brushes.</li>
            <li> very good item i would order again when the time is right. brishes are real good. i dont use all of them but the ones i do use such as foundation brush &amp; blush brush are great</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase, I love my brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Received them a day earlier than expected, and they were in perfect condition! Already used them once and they were fantastic! Very soft and fluffy brushes! Love them!</li>
            <li> Great brushes and No shedding</li>
            <li> Soft, professional finish for your makeup and it is a product I highly recommend! Excellent value for the money, you will use for many years!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really great. I wasn&#x27;t sure sure for the price but they are honestly excellent. I love them!</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today and they are awesome c: They are super soft, don&#x27;t shed and are just the right size :D i liked how it came with like every single brush you would need. DEFINITELY recommend because you get a lot of high quality brushes for so cheap :3</li>
            <li> I just got these today, so I can say zilch about their lifespan, but my first impression of these brushes is that they are very soft and extremely lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied my makeup using these brushes to give them a test run. They pick up product really well and the kabuki brush is amazing (a little small though, about the size of a dime). However, something I&#x27;ve noticed is that there are really no fluffy brushes in the set. The crease brush is shorter and denser than what I&#x27;m used to, and there aren&#x27;t any blending brushes in the pack. There are also a few repeat brushes in the pack and the liner brushes are a little too thick to create fine lines with a gel liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the smell, the bag smells like a new pool toy, but that&#x27;s just what that material smells like, so no big. The brushes also smell like that, but you literally have to push your nose into the powder brushes to get any hint of the smell. Again, that&#x27;s probably because they&#x27;ve been sealed in that pool toy material since their production. Just wash them and you&#x27;re good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that immediately after my purchase, I received an email thanking me for my purchase and outlining directions on how to clean them. The personal email was a great touch and showed how much the sellers care about their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am genuinely looking forward to using these brushes for my makeup, and they surpass the many other large brush packs available on amazon!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes--super soft and plenty to choose from. In fact, there are so many I insisted my best friend pick out a few for herself, too! :) I appreciate the email that describes how to best use and clean the brushes. Thanks! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need to buy another makeup brush again.</li>
            <li> I chose this because it is the cheapest and most quality&lt;br /&gt;Very, very awesome&lt;br /&gt;Recommend everyone purchase&lt;br /&gt;Have advised my friends to use it and I&#x27;ve admired him</li>
            <li> I bought this kit after trying lots of other brushes and doing way too much research. Let me just say, this is a really good set. I especially appreciated the price that you pay considering what you get and the quality of each and every brush. Plus you get so many different brushes and a beautiful carrying case! I don&#x27;t get super fancy with my makeup but I am going to try some more sophisticated looks because now I have the right tools. Also all of the brushes are soft and better priced than pretty much anything that you&#x27;ll find at stores like Ulta, Sephora, and even Walmart. (I have tested all of their brushes at one time or another) These are high end brushes like MAC or Sigma.  They are NOT at all like the low quality brushes from E.L.F. I own a couple Sigma brushes and these compare to their quality and density. They pick up makeup well and apply quite nicely. The eye brushes are phenomenal and I can&#x27;t wait to use the face brushes to perfect my contouring skills ;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this deal. Plus, the brushes were delivered quickly and the customer service and follow up has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try them out. You won&#x27;t regret buying this set! :)</li>
            <li> Best brush set that I have ever brought.</li>
            <li> Best investment I&#x27;ve made in makeup brushes. None of them shed and now I have a wide variety of eyeshadow brushes to use for all different looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing price for the amount and quality of brushes. They came earlier than I thought and I am really happy with the quality of the product, they are really soft and the case is perfect for storing the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy about my purchase! I recommend buying this kit to anybody looking for good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> SO happy with my purchase! The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed (unlike some high end brushes I&#x27;ve gotten) and don&#x27;t irritate my skin! Yes, they do smell at first, but if you wash them once with Clearasil face wash, they smell great! The brushes are perfect and functioning! My only complain is that three of the brushes fell off the base, but honestly, I&#x27;ll take three brushes that need to be glue-gunned for having 24 amazing brushes at such a low price any day! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase! Honestly the softest and best brushes I have! Don&#x27;t let the price fool you- I&#x27;d easily pay $400 for this set!</li>
            <li> In my experience with brushes in the past, I have found that you usually get what you pay for and if you want high quality, you&#x27;ll need to shell out a lot of money.  Boy was I wrong! I ordered the &amp;#34;Flawless Look Makeup Brush Set&amp;#34; and I am very impressed!  The quality of the brushes blows me away for the price.  There is no shedding, the brushes are super soft and they are comparable to any high priced brush that I have used before...in fact, they are better! This is especially true with the eye brushes.  the foundation brush is the BEST brush that I have ever used for applying liquid and cream foundation!  I used to use either your typical paddle brush or duo fiber brush but now I am sold on Sheer Cosmetics.  I use less foundation, achieve flawless &amp;#34;my skin but better&amp;#34; looks with it, and don&#x27;t get ANY streaking from the brush after applying.  I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing 2 more as gifts because these are so nice!  I HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone, beginner or pro because of the fantastic price and superb  quality! Thanks Sheer Cosmetics!!</li>
            <li> I am glad that pick this set,and also love quality of these brushes and also great price... This set is great quality!!</li>
