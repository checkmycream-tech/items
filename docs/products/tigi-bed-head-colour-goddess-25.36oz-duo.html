            <li>For colored hair this is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I think it smells awesome!!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is lackluster at best and the conditioner just feels like a blob of slime spreading on my head.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo/conditioner for colored hair.</li>
            <li>how delicious it smells!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome product though, if used sparingly.</li>

            <li>I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo/conditioner set!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I returned the Colour Goddess and bought Fashionista instead, which worked much better for my blondes highlights.</li>
            <li>Smells like vanilla cupcake :-)</li>
            <li>love the smell and th end result on my hair which is course and frizzy</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have a color guarding shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking at a couple more months of Bor-ing hair.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>My hairstylist has used this on my hair &amp; I love the smell &amp; the way my hair feels after.</li>
            <li>He charged more for it at his salon than Amazon</li>
            <li>I have gone through many shampoos and conditioners (specifically ones for color-treated hair) and this Bed Head has to be my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Even better is that I can still smell that delicious cake batter smell in my hair hours later.  </li>
            <li>Even better than THAT is the fact that these products are sulfate-free, which is a MUST when you have color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this shampoo and conditionar.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo and conditioner combination.</li>

            <li>Mmmmm yum :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li>I really like this product - it is perfect for curly hair and keeps your curls nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Bed Head is so fun, I love this line!</li>
            <li>I was able to return with free return shipping and reordered.</li>
            <li>I tried out this shampoo on my medium length naturally curly colored hair - it works great.  </li>
            <li>Great  price super fast  delivery</li>
            <li>Just used this stuff for the first time and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li>I get a deep-clean with the shampoo and the conditioner makes my hair feel like silk, plus it&#x27;s easy to run a comb through it afterward.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, just started using this product so far so good.</li>
            <li>Your hair feels incredibly soft &amp; smooth, &amp; smells amazing!</li>
            <li>(My hair is fine and curly.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using it because the bottles are huge</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better, more meaningful relationships with Herbal Essences, and for far cheaper dates, as well!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>And it makes my hair feel smooth.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel fantastic..</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, but I love how it healthy it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple time and it works great,  </li>
            <li>Extremely soft and with good body.</li>
            <li>I like the smell better on other products but item is great for colored hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks Tigi!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny and rich looking.</li>
            <li>smells so clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my color-treated hair (blue, purple, teal) and I come out of the shower smelling like a fresh cinnamon roll.</li>
            <li>WOW, love it!</li>
            <li>Leaves no residue, leaves my hair soft and the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Has been my absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li>You want sweet good enough to eat hair, here is your product!</li>
            <li>Product is good, size of bottles too big for normal bath tub areas!!!</li>
            <li>First of all this stuff smells like a vanilla candle that you want to eat!  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>All I can say is, Wow, my hair is noticeably smoother and more under control.</li>
            <li>Honestly I would avoid this and just get regular shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li>love the smell and makes your hair feel so soft</li>
            <li>Except make it super oily and not so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Makes the red in my black hair so bright!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle shampoo</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>someone who has tried a lot of color-safe products, I would definitely choose this one over comparables from Sexy Hair, Redken, and Paul Mitchell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent $75 a bottle on Pureology Nano and didn&#x27;t love it as much as this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have used Tigi/Bedhead products before, and I must say, it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>However I think it is my duty to tell you that this smells absolutely overbearingly like butterscotch.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to find something that I really like that is made for colored hair and my hairdresser suggested this.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and shiny and my color fresh.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only budget friendly option, also the only one with a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>There is oil in the formula, &amp; using it more often makes your hair too flat &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>the other hand, my wife and minions love these products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over like 3 months it will be more of a strawberry blonde, but this shampoo and conditioner really hold the red colour in well.</li>
            <li>I used to love Bed Head products years ago and finally decided to bite the bullet, spend the money and go back to them.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair very soft!  </li>
            <li>The second time around was a success.</li>
            <li>I love wearing black tops and ruffling my hair without a worry about dandruff or greasy hair!</li>
            <li>Love it my hair is kinda frizzy and a little naturally curly.</li>
            <li>And my hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell after my hair is dried..</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t fade as fast as when I use regular shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and manageable too.  </li>
            <li>Leaves her hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>After just 2 uses, my blonde highlights turned very brassy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS: my hair is dyed red, which for those that don&#x27;t know, is one of the hardest colors to keep vibrant and this stuff actually does keep it vibrant.</li>
            <li>I have medium-fine dirty blonde hair, and finally found a stylist willing to try a more natural looking copper-red on me.</li>
            <li>so, not really what I&#x27;d consider color safe at least not for red hair color.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and they all made my hair heavy and sometimes feeling not that clean.</li>

            <li> Makes the red in my black hair so bright!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gentle shampoo</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> someone who has tried a lot of color-safe products, I would definitely choose this one over comparables from Sexy Hair, Redken, and Paul Mitchell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $75 a bottle on Pureology Nano and didn&#x27;t love it as much as this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have used Tigi/Bedhead products before, and I must say, it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> However I think it is my duty to tell you that this smells absolutely overbearingly like butterscotch.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to find something that I really like that is made for colored hair and my hairdresser suggested this.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and shiny and my color fresh.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only budget friendly option, also the only one with a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> There is oil in the formula, &amp; using it more often makes your hair too flat &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> the other hand, my wife and minions love these products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over like 3 months it will be more of a strawberry blonde, but this shampoo and conditioner really hold the red colour in well.</li>
            <li> I used to love Bed Head products years ago and finally decided to bite the bullet, spend the money and go back to them.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair very soft!  </li>
            <li> The second time around was a success.</li>
            <li> I love wearing black tops and ruffling my hair without a worry about dandruff or greasy hair!</li>
            <li> Love it my hair is kinda frizzy and a little naturally curly.</li>
            <li> And my hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell after my hair is dried..</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t fade as fast as when I use regular shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and manageable too.  </li>
            <li> Leaves her hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> After just 2 uses, my blonde highlights turned very brassy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS: my hair is dyed red, which for those that don&#x27;t know, is one of the hardest colors to keep vibrant and this stuff actually does keep it vibrant.</li>
            <li> I have medium-fine dirty blonde hair, and finally found a stylist willing to try a more natural looking copper-red on me.</li>
            <li> so, not really what I&#x27;d consider color safe at least not for red hair color.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and they all made my hair heavy and sometimes feeling not that clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling refreshed and revitalized &amp; super silky; HOWEVER - it stripped the color out of my hair at least to half of its shade, as well as my daughter&#x27;s highlights -</li>
            <li> Smells like Unicorn farts (cupcakes and rainbows) and doesn&#x27;t dry out or fade my color.</li>
            <li> It did help keep my color from fading but made my hair feel extra greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and it is hard to  find a shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t break me out, so</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair type feeling very soft, too (my hair is typically very dry and always has broken ends, so the oily comment some ppl make actually works to my advantage I guess).</li>
            <li> I, personally, am losing my hair, so this is of little interest to me.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I only use the shampoo every few days but condition every day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like other bed head products.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint was that yhe shampoo bottle unlocked and the shampoo had leaked out upon delivery.</li>
            <li> I have dark, color treated, hair and my over the counter product just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I received my package, it was not packaged very well and the shampoo bottle had leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not meant for thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair either.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I switched from Paul Mitchell and will never go back to ordinary shampoos!</li>
            <li> &gt; The bottles are huge so unless I just get sick of them and toss &#x27;em</li>
            <li> However, this price is less than half what they charge at the salons around here.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve switched my little girl (a ChiWeenie) to Pet Head products.</li>
            <li> My hair looked dried out and lifeless.</li>
            <li> and I have less hair in my shower drain!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thick and course - this product makes my hair feel softer and it looks shinier.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> and I hate throwing things away, but if you&#x27;re smell sensitive, stay away.</li>
            <li> You will become addicted, that&#x27;s why you need the largest bottles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong if you buy this set.</li>
            <li> Some people talked about how bad it smells.</li>
            <li> Man, how disappointed am I?  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to decide between oily hair or washed out color because I never feel guilty washing my hair anymore!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because I waited some time for this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it my hair is kinda frizzy and a little naturally curly.</li>
            <li> For colored hair this is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  The color doesn&#x27;t fade as fast as when I use regular shampoo/conditioner.  My hair is so soft and manageable too.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I, personally, am losing my hair, so this is of little interest to me. However, this price is less than half what they charge at the salons around here. Score!&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my wife and minions love these products.&lt;br /&gt;The minions like the their hair smelling like chocolate--yes, that&#x27;s what this does. Go figure.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Keeps my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Enticing vanilla aroma. Leaves my hair feeling so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it does a nice job on hair n smells so clean</li>
            <li> Smells soo good! And my hair is so soft!  Switched from Paul Mitchell never going back!</li>
            <li> Wifey loves this shampoo conditioner combo. Leaves her hair soft and manageable. She does say that it makes her want to eat her own hair though</li>
            <li> Smells kinda funky but works well</li>
            <li> While this may be a good product for brunettes, I would not recommend it for blondes.  After just 2 uses, my blonde highlights turned very brassy.  I returned the Colour Goddess and bought Fashionista instead, which worked much better for my blondes highlights.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Amazing  smell. Great quality</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! My color lasts. My hair is soft.  Smells like vanilla cupcake :-)</li>
            <li> love the smell and th end result on my hair which is course and frizzy</li>
            <li> i have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner set for color hair that doesn&#x27;t weigh done my hair and let me tell u this is not a paid review.. This is literally the most amazing set I&#x27;ve ever used. It even smells like freaking cake batter it&#x27;s amazing buy it u will not regret! I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so happy have it delivered ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and it is hard to  find a shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t break me out, so I took a big chance with this.  I have used Tigi/Bedhead products before, and I must say, it works really well.  I think if anything it has soothed my sensitive scalp, and it smells WONDERFUL!!  I am so glad to have a color guarding shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
            <li> Just used this stuff for the first time and I&#x27;m in love! Some people talked about how bad it smells. I think it smells awesome!! Like cupcakes, YUM!! Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is naturally thick and course - this product makes my hair feel softer and it looks shinier. Also, both shampoo and conditioner smell like moist vanilla butterscotch carmel cake.</li>
            <li> Enjoying this shampoo quite a bit, I have (fake) fiery red hair and I&#x27;ve tried multiple shampoos to keep the color and this is the only budget friendly option, also the only one with a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and is great on my hair</li>
            <li> Made my head itch, when it came in the mail it had leaked all over as well.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, Wow, my hair is noticeably smoother and more under control. I am very happy with my purchase so far!</li>
            <li> Only thing I use now was recommended by my hairdresser and I love the smell!!</li>
            <li> I used to love Bed Head products years ago and finally decided to bite the bullet, spend the money and go back to them.  Man, how disappointed am I?  First off I feel like this does nothing for my hair.  Except make it super oily and not so pretty.  The shampoo is lackluster at best and the conditioner just feels like a blob of slime spreading on my head.  I&#x27;ve had better, more meaningful relationships with Herbal Essences, and for far cheaper dates, as well!&lt;br /&gt; The bottles are huge so unless I just get sick of them and toss &#x27;em I&#x27;m looking at a couple more months of Bor-ing hair.  Honestly I would avoid this and just get regular shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li> Great product...my only complaint was that yhe shampoo bottle unlocked and the shampoo had leaked out upon delivery.</li>
            <li> Great  price super fast  delivery</li>
            <li> Looooove the smell, like cake batter. And it makes my hair feel smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner for colored hair. Wash after wash, my hair looks the same as the day I got it colored. I no longer have to decide between oily hair or washed out color because I never feel guilty washing my hair anymore!! I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with a product. I would 100% recommend this to anyone with colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: my hair is dyed red, which for those that don&#x27;t know, is one of the hardest colors to keep vibrant and this stuff actually does keep it vibrant.</li>
            <li> You want sweet good enough to eat hair, here is your product!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! My hair is always left shiny and manageable. Plus, the duo smells amazing. The shampoo smells like vanilla cupcakes and the conditioner smells like cinnamon rolls. :)</li>
            <li> Works well and the color seems to stay in my hair well.  However I think it is my duty to tell you that this smells absolutely overbearingly like butterscotch.  My hair smells like butterscotch; the bathroom smells like butterscotch; my clothes smell like butterscotch.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it because the bottles are huge and I hate throwing things away, but if you&#x27;re smell sensitive, stay away.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo/conditioner set! It&#x27;s like putting Carmel pudding in my hair! I switched from Paul Mitchell and will never go back to ordinary shampoos! I tried every name brand from Sauve to Paul Mitchell and would break out on my scalp! Eww! These, however, have changed my life! I love wearing black tops and ruffling my hair without a worry about dandruff or greasy hair! I get complements everywhere I go about how beautiful my looks and how delicious it smells!&lt;br /&gt;Buy these! You won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;Bed Head also makes Pet Head and I&#x27;ve switched my little girl (a ChiWeenie) to Pet Head products. Love the results!</li>
            <li> Love it! Your hair feels incredibly soft &amp; smooth, &amp; smells amazing! I would recommend only using a couple times a week though, &amp; use a different shampoo/conditioner in between. There is oil in the formula, &amp; using it more often makes your hair too flat &amp; soft. It&#x27;s an awesome product though, if used sparingly.</li>
            <li> I will never use another shampoo and conditioner - they work great and smell great!</li>
            <li> Good timing for receiving product and great feel to hair with use. Extremely soft and with good body. Wood recommend</li>
            <li> Love the smell, just started using this product so far so good. I have thick curly hair and I dye it a lot. I&#x27;ve washed my hair twice and my curls are nice will ck back later.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo and conditioner. I switched to this from Matrix. WOW, love it!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist has used this on my hair &amp; I love the smell &amp; the way my hair feels after. He charged more for it at his salon than Amazon so I ordered it from here. However, I bought the shampoo/conditioner duo but received 2 conditioners. Very disappointed because I waited some time for this. I was able to return with free return shipping and reordered. The second time around was a success.</li>
            <li> This is THE shampoo and conditioner set!  I have gone through many shampoos and conditioners (specifically ones for color-treated hair) and this Bed Head has to be my favorite.  I&#x27;ve spent $75 a bottle on Pureology Nano and didn&#x27;t love it as much as this stuff.  It smells AMAZING (like cake batter) and it works even better.  I get a deep-clean with the shampoo and the conditioner makes my hair feel like silk, plus it&#x27;s easy to run a comb through it afterward.  Even better is that I can still smell that delicious cake batter smell in my hair hours later.  Even better than THAT is the fact that these products are sulfate-free, which is a MUST when you have color-treated hair.  My hair color still looks great even after a week of using these products.  You won&#x27;t go wrong if you buy this set.</li>
            <li> Is good, but not the best of TIGI&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! I have been trying to find something that I really like that is made for colored hair and my hairdresser suggested this. I have tried other brands and they all made my hair heavy and sometimes feeling not that clean. This makes my hair feel fantastic..I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell after my hair is dried..</li>
            <li> I tried out this shampoo on my medium length naturally curly colored hair - it works great.  The smell reminds me a french vanilla cappuccino - not at all like the candy smell you&#x27;re use to with Bed Head products.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this shampoo and conditionar. It keeps my hair soft and shiny and my color fresh.  Plus it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for fine hair.</li>
            <li> love this stuff!!! Smells like Unicorn farts (cupcakes and rainbows) and doesn&#x27;t dry out or fade my color. I only use the shampoo every few days but condition every day. Colour Goddess is the best I have yet to find. Thanks Tigi!!!</li>
            <li> love the smell and makes your hair feel so soft</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! My hair is soft without feeling oily. It doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair either.&lt;br /&gt;- Megan</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this! It&#x27;s a very gentle shampoo but after awhile I feel like there&#x27;s some build up on my hair. (My hair is fine and curly.) I just use something else for a day or two and come back to this.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, leaves my hair soft. ine of Bed Heads best</li>
            <li> Used it for my red hair that I dyed using herbs. Makes the red in my black hair so bright!!!!</li>
            <li> Buy this solely for the incredibly maple candy, or maybe it&#x27;s butterscotch? aroma!  Its soooo good! You will become addicted, that&#x27;s why you need the largest bottles.  Its a moisture-rich shampoo and conditioner.  Bed Head is so fun, I love this line!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling refreshed and revitalized &amp; super silky; HOWEVER - it stripped the color out of my hair at least to half of its shade, as well as my daughter&#x27;s highlights - so, not really what I&#x27;d consider color safe at least not for red hair color.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner combination. Love the way it leaves my hair smelling and feeling.</li>
            <li> Product is good, size of bottles too big for normal bath tub areas!!!</li>
            <li> I only recently started using this product and I can&#x27;t say enough about it. I have dark, color treated, hair and my over the counter product just didn&#x27;t cut it. My hair looked dried out and lifeless. When I started using Colour Goddess, my hair was reborn. It&#x27;s shiny and rich looking. I have body back and I have less hair in my shower drain! Plus, it smells so yummy you want to eat it! You won&#x27;t regret this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it is perfect for curly hair and keeps your curls nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Love the butterscotch candy smell.  Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s great for my color-treated hair (blue, purple, teal) and I come out of the shower smelling like a fresh cinnamon roll. Yum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who has tried a lot of color-safe products, I would definitely choose this one over comparables from Sexy Hair, Redken, and Paul Mitchell.  Tigi is a great brand and while the Bed Head line can be hit or miss, this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> It did help keep my color from fading but made my hair feel extra greasy and weighed down. Maybe it&#x27;s not meant for thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. Not only does it smell amazing, but I love how it healthy it makes my hair feel. Unfortunately, when I received my package, it was not packaged very well and the shampoo bottle had leaked everywhere. Other than that I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> First of all this stuff smells like a vanilla candle that you want to eat!  I have only used it a couple time and it works great,  makes my hair very soft!  Arrived on time and packaged great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like other bed head products.  I like the smell better on other products but item is great for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Hair looks good. This set smells like caramel.</li>
            <li> Has been my absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner for my hair. Leaves no residue, leaves my hair soft and the scent is amazing. I love this.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for keeping my red hair dye in! I have medium-fine dirty blonde hair, and finally found a stylist willing to try a more natural looking copper-red on me. She did amazing and I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months now. Over like 3 months it will be more of a strawberry blonde, but this shampoo and conditioner really hold the red colour in well. I wash my hair with it about 3 times a week. I&#x27;m very satisfied! Leaves my hair type feeling very soft, too (my hair is typically very dry and always has broken ends, so the oily comment some ppl make actually works to my advantage I guess). I also really love the smell! Kind of vanilla/brown sugar like.... Mmmmm yum :)</li>
