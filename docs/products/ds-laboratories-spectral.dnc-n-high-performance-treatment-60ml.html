    <ol>
            <li>JOY.</li>
            <li>I hope its not the spectral as I had really good results with it over rogaine.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Good customer service.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>She Love Product!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an amazing hair</li>
            <li>One have to be patient while using these kind of products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I notified the supplier and they kindly refunded my purchase - top marks to them.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product - I never got great results from the growth stimulating shampoo alone.</li>
            <li>To my opinion, this is currently one of the best drugs against baldness.</li>
            <li>For the most part the product has made an improvement.</li>
            <li>I would characterize my hair loss as a receding hairline mostly in the widows peak areas on both sides.</li>
            <li>I did notice additional thinning from using it but it didn&#x27;t get any better with the continued use.</li>
            <li>Take this with a grain of salt because as I can&#x27;t be sure that something else caused this</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use the product but know others that have</li>
            <li>This one and Lipogaine are my favorite.</li>
            <li>If I had stuck it out longer, I might have seen more growth, but I didn&#x27;t like the side effects.</li>
            <li>Hoping it will continue to regrow more hair....</li>
            <li>Pretty good product if you want to spend the money.</li>
            <li>most important tip I have is to make sure you shake the bottle, every time you use it!&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>good real.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This way my hair is residue free</li>
            <li>I also use it on my eyelashes and they look fantastic.</li>
            <li>Need to use twice daily for optimum results.</li>
            <li>was noticing some good results when all of a sudden I was developing scabs on the crown of my scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the combination did contribute, but I didn&#x27;t get real results until I focused on the Lipogaine usage twice</li>
            <li>I went through 3 full</li>
            <li>Not too cool.</li>
            <li>Granted, I haven&#x27;t had much of a problem with balding, but I noticed the hairline around my temples getting a bit more \\&quot;aged.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that if I used as directed, I would have a much more noticeable growth than I currently do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I started shedding more than normal and my scalp became itchy at times.</li>
            <li>Easy to use too much</li>
            <li>all these positive reviews are most likely friends and family of the people that make the stuff :)</li>
            <li>so Im going to give one more try to this and just use spectral on its own.. but need to let a few days pass</li>

            <li>reality is it did absolutely nothing to regrow any hair or help my perceived thinning.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it drip down my face on more than one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But most recent purchase it started causing skin to go red and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a healthy woman with no other health issues other than getting a bit</li>
            <li>but I noticed my teeth became very sensitive during the months I used this product.</li>
            <li>How far in the way of new growth has yet to be determined.</li>
            <li>the scabs went away and my scalp was clear again..</li>
            <li>my hair loss is just a natural effect of aging.</li>

            <li>may be from an old batch or something.</li>
            <li>: This makes your existing hair all plastic-y as if you put old school hair gel on.</li>
            <li>When I got it together to use this product 2x day as instructed it really did bring back enough hair, including a small widow&#x27;s peak to make me feel better about things.</li>
            <li>and I am starting to see some new growth in this area.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve actually started seeing new hair growth.</li>

            <li> Seems to have slowed down my hair loss and promoted new growth.</li>
            <li> I applied lipogaine twice daily and around the end of the second month of that I noticed little hairs coming back.  </li>

            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I stopped using it and now a few months later that my hair has gotten back to where it was before I started using it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> still hoping that the product works the same as the previous one i bought.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money unless you feel like you want melted vasolene running down your face or your hair feeling like you put bacon grease in it.  </li>
            <li> So I assumed due to the Spectral and Nutri-ox I was drying my scalp out...</li>
            <li> I only had a small bald spot from stress</li>
            <li> I previously used Rogaine from 1995 to 2004 and it worked</li>
            <li> see if it could restore my hair&#x27;s previous fullness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And within less than two months (though the box said it would take three)</li>
            <li> Tried many different products and this one was the worst waste of money ever.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a lot of little hairs thickening and growing that weren&#x27;t noticeable or even there before.</li>
            <li> There was no styling my hair with this stuff in it, even a little.</li>
            <li> and I lost a little hair in the beginning.</li>
            <li> So my hair did thin back out again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually way worse off than before I started use of Spectral DNC</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, the hair looked thicker around the temples.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasts about a month, give or take a few days.</li>
            <li> Just need a small amount when applying.</li>
            <li> and I got lazy and didnt feel like doing the routine applications..</li>
            <li> It does not have any greasy residue, which is common in Minoxidil treatments.</li>
            <li> The hair loss at the front of my scalp made me feel really old and ugly.  </li>
            <li> Not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this was a bad batch - I thought?&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Need to use twice daily for optimum results. Just need a small amount when applying. Easy to use too much</li>
            <li> Ive used Spectral DNC in the past with great results. I actually kept a video diary.. documenting my bi monthly progress and I was amazed to see I regained alot of my hair. I ended up stopping the treatments as it got costly and I got lazy and didnt feel like doing the routine applications.. So my hair did thin back out again. Recently with in the last few months I decided to pick this back up again. I was using this in combination with :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash hair with Revita Shampoo- leave on for 5 mins per instructions&lt;br /&gt;2) Nutri- OX Step 3 Leave in treatment for thinning hair&lt;br /&gt;3) Hair Max laser comb- 3 X&#x27;s a week;  15 min interval treatments&lt;br /&gt;4) Spectral DNC at night 10 sprays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was noticing some good results when all of a sudden I was developing scabs on the crown of my scalp. So I assumed due to the Spectral and Nutri-ox I was drying my scalp out... so nightly after my application of Spectral would dry I would then apply a liberal amount of Emu oil to moisturize my scalp.. to no avail the scabs still stayed. I then ceased my regimen of the above steps for about 3-4 days.. the scabs went away and my scalp was clear again.. Then last night I applied 10 sprays of spectral and revita shampoo and by morning the scabs were back. The only thing I can think of is maybe Revita and Spectral or even the nutriox are some how conflicting.. so Im going to give one more try to this and just use spectral on its own.. but need to let a few days pass so my scalp will heal. I will post an update.. I hope its not the spectral as I had really good results with it over rogaine.</li>
            <li> One have to be patient while using these kind of products. Overall this product does need time to work properly that is about three months. Good luck</li>
            <li> Used this product before and had no problems with it. But most recent purchase it started causing skin to go red and then flake - had to discontinue its use. Perhaps this was a bad batch - I thought?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I notified the supplier and they kindly refunded my purchase - top marks to them.</li>
            <li> My last order I was sent the DNC-N and was told the DNC was discontinued and this took its place.  I should have sent it back but had none of the DNC left.  It&#x27;s heavy and I don&#x27;t like it at all.  Ordered DNC, again, and waiting to see if what I get is what I ordered this time.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend the DNC-N and will not use it again.</li>
            <li> Spectral DNC has helped me to stop hair loss. To my opinion, this is currently one of the best drugs against baldness. I use it for the second year and am going to continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months now and I have noticed a lot of little hairs thickening and growing that weren&#x27;t noticeable or even there before. I&#x27;m sure that if I used as directed, I would have a much more noticeable growth than I currently do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product apparently does NOT come with the dropper that the picture suggests it comes with. So, don&#x27;t get your hopes up for that.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: The product description did indicate additional hair loss for about 2 weeks... went through an entire bottle (5 weeks)and the shedding has not stopped!!! I&#x27;m actually way worse off than before I started use of Spectral DNC</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a year or so and it does not work for me. I previously used Rogaine from 1995 to 2004 and it worked but when they stopped selling the spray I stopped using it. This DS stuff works as a hairspray for me. It keeps my hair in place and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> After having used this product diligently twice a day for over a month, I can see absolutely&lt;br /&gt;NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL. In fact, I think my hair is actually thinner where I&#x27;ve been using&lt;br /&gt;it than it was before. I think they are calling this stuff&lt;br /&gt;hair loss treatment in that if you want hair loss, treat your hair with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t spray very well either. It drips all over your scalp and I&#x27;ve had&lt;br /&gt;it drip down my face on more than one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a healthy woman with no other health issues other than getting a bit older.&lt;br /&gt;So my hair loss is just a natural effect of aging. I thought I could try this out&lt;br /&gt;to see if it could restore my hair&#x27;s previous fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t see one iota of difference. I may as well have been spraying water on my head.</li>
            <li> For the most part the product has made an improvement. How far in the way of new growth has yet to be determined.</li>
            <li> Have used for years! It has helped tremendously with my thinning hair and helps me achieve keeping what i have left &amp; more.</li>
            <li> Tried many different products and this one was the worst waste of money ever.  It&#x27;s basically like putting liquid lard on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got headaches from the Rogaine liquid minoxidil and the Up and Up brand liquid minoxidil but wasn&#x27;t getting results from them or the foam.  The only that that worked for me in the front and back was the Lipogaine which didn&#x27;t give me headaches.  I didn&#x27;t see results for 3 months while using a combination, until around month 3 I buckled down and got more serious.  I applied lipogaine twice daily and around the end of the second month of that I noticed little hairs coming back.  I kept it up and had my barber stop using the teethed scissors in front so I could track things.  I&#x27;m sure the combination did contribute, but I didn&#x27;t get real results until I focused on the Lipogaine usage twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to this product.  Complete waste of money unless you feel like you want melted vasolene running down your face or your hair feeling like you put bacon grease in it.  There was no styling my hair with this stuff in it, even a little.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I have sensitive skin and it just made my head break out. Not pleasant. I guess I will just keep my head shaved. Been working so far. :)</li>
            <li> WOW MY HAIR IS BACK! I only had a small bald spot from stress and I started using this product along side with the shampoo and conditioner DS labs sell. My hair is back and so is my confidence.</li>
            <li> Been using for about year. good real. Hair is thicker and where there was once none , now there is some. JOY.</li>
            <li> I would characterize my hair loss as a receding hairline mostly in the widows peak areas on both sides. I felt like it was also starting to thin in general across the entire top of my scalp so I decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product religiously morning and night for over 3 months also in combination with the shampoo and conditioner of the same brand they recommend. I went through 3 full bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality is it did absolutely nothing to regrow any hair or help my perceived thinning. In fact the label mentions that you may see additional thinning when first starting use but says make sure to keep going. I did notice additional thinning from using it but it didn&#x27;t get any better with the continued use. It wasn&#x27;t until I stopped using it and now a few months later that my hair has gotten back to where it was before I started using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did also notice a possible side effect that isn&#x27;t listed in the documentation. Take this with a grain of salt because as I can&#x27;t be sure that something else caused this but I noticed my teeth became very sensitive during the months I used this product. It continued the entire time I used it and has since subsided after I stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this helps in your decision to buy or not. I feel like all these positive reviews are most likely friends and family of the people that make the stuff :)</li>
            <li> Ugly Beauty was a great company to deal with.  Good customer service. Would use them again. I wasn&#x27;t able to use the product but know others that have and it&#x27;s an amazing hair re-growth product and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I thought it had a dropper as well, but it did not. may be from an old batch or something. I had the product before, with the dropper, thought it was the same one. still hoping that the product works the same as the previous one i bought. too early to tell yet, i think it is the same ingredients, but the wording is also different on the packaging, which I did not realize before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 different hair regrowth treatments. This one and Lipogaine are my favorite. I saw hair regrowth after about 2 months of using this product. It does not have any greasy residue, which is common in Minoxidil treatments. I would recommend this product and Lipogaine. Stay away from generic brands. They work, but have greasy application.</li>
            <li> It says 10 sprays twice a day. Meaning 2 ml/day. Meaning this will only last you 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;They really need to reduce the price for this, or at least sell it in bulk for much less.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1: This makes your existing hair all plastic-y as if you put old school hair gel on. Not too cool.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try for almost two months. I do think I saw some increased growth, especially around my hair line. However, I started shedding more than normal and my scalp became itchy at times. If I had stuck it out longer, I might have seen more growth, but I didn&#x27;t like the side effects.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the pump because it gets all over my hair if I do. I use a soaked Q-tip and part one row at a time, rubbing the Q-tip on my scalp. This way my hair is residue free and I don&#x27;t have to worry about how my hair looks in public. I took about 4 weeks to work and I lost a little hair in the beginning. I also use it on my eyelashes and they look fantastic.</li>
            <li> seems to be working..started using it in January and this is my second container.  Hoping it will continue to regrow more hair....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two months and just started on my third bottle.  I have a receding hairline and I am starting to see some new growth in this area. I will update as I continue use.</li>
            <li> Some people have said that the formula has changed, but I don&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;The most important tip I have is to make sure you shake the bottle, every time you use it!&lt;br /&gt;Use the shampoo and the conditioner also.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product - I never got great results from the growth stimulating shampoo alone. Granted, I haven&#x27;t had much of a problem with balding, but I noticed the hairline around my temples getting a bit more \\&quot;aged.\\&quot; Within a few weeks, the hair looked thicker around the temples.  And within less than two months (though the box said it would take three), I&#x27;ve actually started seeing new hair growth. I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects and I do the recommended 10 sprays twice a day. Pretty good product if you want to spend the money. The bottle lasts about a month, give or take a few days.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using for over year for hair loss..Hair has grown in where it was thinned. She Love Product!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Seems to have slowed down my hair loss and promoted new growth. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 58 year old female.  The hair loss at the front of my scalp made me feel really old and ugly.  When I got it together to use this product 2x day as instructed it really did bring back enough hair, including a small widow&#x27;s peak to make me feel better about things.</li>
