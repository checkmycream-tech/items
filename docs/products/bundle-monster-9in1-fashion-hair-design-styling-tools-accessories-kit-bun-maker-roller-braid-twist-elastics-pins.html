            <li>They work really great for making buns.</li>
            <li>I have not tried all the accessories yet, but it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find all the these hair accessories for one price.</li>
            <li>This bundle was amazing!  </li>
            <li>Has some great items, but good lord don&#x27;t rely on the pamphlet for a guide on what to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to put my hair in a perfect circle, ever!</li>
            <li>I feel there is good value here for the money, however, the &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; they include are a joke.  </li>
            <li>Good assortment for the price,</li>
            <li>Good but no directions in kit</li>
            <li>The cylindrical plastic case that everything comes in does not make a good storage container.</li>
            <li>The price is fair if you intend on using everything.</li>
            <li>All the items were of good quality.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal for what you get.  </li>
            <li>This was a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, thank you.</li>
            <li>This is a great set to use for dance hair or just cute hair at home.  </li>
            <li>We love the hair ties or rubberbands, because they aren&#x27;t rubber and don&#x27;t snap or break!</li>
            <li>This is a great kit to use to make a lot of easy styles.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping awesome product!</li>
            <li>It was nice to just get it all together.</li>
            <li>Nice kit.  </li>
            <li>but hey, my granddaughter liked it</li>
            <li>The bun makers were really the best part of the kit</li>
            <li>on doing your own research on how to use these items.</li>
            <li>Also handy instructions on inside</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to find your own instructions (as those that come with are minuscule), but I have no complaints about the styling tools within.</li>
            <li>It is nice to not rely the go-to ponytail style every day.</li>
            <li>She is one who loves to practice hair on her friends and creating her own styles.</li>
            <li>I liked the ponytail holders.</li>
            <li>I liked the variety of items included in the kit.</li>
            <li>I use most of the things that come in the kit and love them!</li>
            <li>We have so much fun using all the great hair tools and accessories.</li>
            <li>Not too pricy and easy to use!</li>
            <li>It took me ages to figure out how to use most of the items, and some of them didn&#x27;t even work as they supposed to.</li>
            <li>Still wish it came with more.</li>
            <li>Love all the tools, I&#x27;m using this bundle to design the bride/bridesmaids hair for the wedding.</li>
            <li>Lots of interesting components.  </li>
            <li>Wish it&#x27;s directions better</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m guessing they would work better with longer hair.</li>
            <li>Have had this for over a year and am buying another because my daughter and I have lost too many of the Bobby pins and hair ties.</li>
            <li>However I was able to struggle through the instructions</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>found this fantastic bundle!</li>
            <li>At most I have used one hairpin with it.</li>
            <li>But I am guessing I can find those on YouTube when I become sufficiently motivated:)</li>
            <li>First try with the bun roller, and I had my first ever perfect bun.</li>
            <li>The instructions are written by a non-native speaker: for example to explain how to use the Magic Hair Twist Styling Braid Tool Care Clip:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>They do seem to be of good quality, and worth the amount paid, but I would have been better off just buying the items that I will use.</li>
            <li>Most stores sell the items in this bundle at $4 each (not including the bobby pins and pony tails)</li>
            <li>I love the bun makers and pads.</li>
            <li>I like the hair design styling tools and the bundle but wish I would have receive more instructions and styling tips</li>
            <li>Over all ok</li>
            <li>I have no idea how to use most of them.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for different way to do with my long hair and this was the perfect item for the perfect price.</li>
            <li>I found that I could buy some of the individual components more cheaply, but then I wasn&#x27;t sure which would work best for me.</li>
            <li>You do need long hair to get the best deal out of this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about it!</li>
            <li>Great for an 11yr old who is experimenting with her hair!</li>
            <li>i still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use some of the products--and for gadgets, it really helps to have good instructions.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t count on the directions to be easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow and use.</li>
            <li>to use or easy to learn to use if you watch YouTube videos&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you already know how to use these tools you&#x27;d probably be fine.</li>
            <li>The different bun sizes are great and so are the twisty bobby pins to keep the hair in place.  </li>
            <li>Step-by-Step Tutorials for 82 Fabulous Hairstyles by Christina Butcher.</li>
            <li>It also has some great ideas for different updos!</li>
            <li>Cheap hair trinkets</li>
            <li>but I bought this kit primarily for the donut bun makers and the pins</li>
            <li>It was $8, but I think it&#x27;s worth it to get a more sturdy product.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right, so I watched many tutorials on youtube.</li>
            <li>I have been growing out my hair for the last year and thought this would be the perfect thing to try out new hair styles.</li>
            <li>or I was already familiar with.</li>
            <li>Especially the Korean version one--I found this to be super-fast to put up and effective!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, excited to use them all.</li>
            <li>My niece wanted those bun socks for Christmas, but I found her a lot more excited with this whole kit!  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a hair girl and was excited for this kit.</li>
            <li>so far we have tried all of the accessories but have not been able to recreate most of hair styles.</li>
            <li>It has pretty much every piece to do your own hair in an updo.  </li>
            <li>Lots of items in the box for a young girl to learn to do her own hair.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use several of the tools, but overall the product was great for figuring out what tools I liked.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>Instruciones super pequenas</li>
            <li>Most of the bun making tools were for making a larger bun than I would ever want, but the smallest sponge hair plate worked great for making a smaller bun.</li>
            <li>This is a super fun bundle or hair styling accessories.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed keeping my long hair while being able to pull it up in a neat and fashionable way this summer.</li>
            <li>it being really straight and fine</li>
            <li>They are great products, but I am giving it a 3 star because it was missing some pieces when I got it.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>On time and as described.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful.</li>
            <li>The items came quickly and were exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>The wraps work good too, but I do not know how to use some of the other pieces.</li>
            <li>It seems a general problem of these kind of products, not with this one in particular.</li>
            <li>She likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>We were excited to try out the new tools</li>
            <li>Only thing I would have preferred is better instructions on how to use all the enclosed hair accessories.</li>
            <li>I think the only thing I would like to have is more info on how to use, maybe some video tutorials.</li>
            <li>Most of the pictures are either too blurry, or are simple line drawings that I cannot understand what they are trying to show.&lt;br /&gt;Plan</li>
            <li>I wish the instructions were a little more detailed.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that they can pretty much match your hair color</li>
            <li>This way, for just a little more money, I knew if a bun option was going to work with my hair, it would be in this kit!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been fun trying new things.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with a tiny folded sheet with description of the items &amp; a quick easy how-to guide using 1 or 2 of the items.</li>
            <li>The hair donuts, hair ties, bobby pinds are obviously all easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Directions are tiny, but you can easily Google how to use each item.</li>
            <li>This is the main reason why I purchased this kit in the first place.</li>
            <li>I will have to go on you tube to see if I can find some real live people to show how to use some of these products.</li>
            <li>it had everything that i needed and a lot more fun stuff to play with, of course a lot of the pieces can be easily misplaced</li>
            <li>it was too much for these items to hold it.</li>
            <li>had I really needed them.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price for all the items that you get.</li>
            <li>Everything in this bundle was of greater quality than I expected!</li>
            <li>This is a fun, I have long hair (almost to my waist) and am having fun playing with new bun hair styles.</li>
            <li>I think the donut ones also work though I believe are better suited for slightly shorter hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i liked all the gadgets that i could try, but the instructions for how to use them were really hard to read.</li>
            <li>Great selection, difficult directions.</li>
            <li>so if you need them its worth it unless you can find them at your local store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fun learning how to use the different tools that come in this set</li>
            <li>This bundle has everything I need to find new ways to dress up my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have a grouping of all these different products that I&#x27;ve been wanting to try, but the quality is poor.</li>
            <li>I use the elastic bands the most often because they fit snugly without pulling my hair back too tightly and they aren&#x27;t so loose they fall out.</li>
            <li>I got interested in these various kinds of bun devices online and thru my research</li>
            <li>I only got the kit today, and I used the bun roller first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to making more hair styles instead of just two hair styles like in the past.</li>
            <li>Plus a few of these items bought individually are about a third of this total cost so the price is great.</li>
            <li>They pins are too large - go ahead and just buy the regular 98 cent bobby pins from Walmart.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have fine hair down to my waist, and I was mainly either wearing it down, or in a pony tail.</li>
            <li>I only notice the hair pieces if I am really looking for them or don&#x27;t cover them completely (like with the volume bases).</li>
            <li>Got this for our 12 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>Then I had no trouble seeing the pictures.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 3 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Good quality and value for product, but I was sent the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The directions are small and I&#x27;ll printed, I felt that most of the items were relatively self explanatory</li>
            <li>The items in this kit are high quality, with the only downside being the spirals pins.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the hair bands &amp; tight bobby pins and can&#x27;t find a product like them anywhere!!!</li>
            <li>This little bundle gave me new options with instructions;).</li>
            <li>You can barely even see the pictures or the text!  </li>
            <li>I fixed this by putting a thick dab of clear nail polish on the tips, and when they dried, they looked the ends on the better ones.</li>
            <li>Just plain fun for creating various up-dos!</li>
            <li>I have only been able to use a few pieces so far because the instructions are a bit hard to understand.</li>
            <li>I will agree that the diagrams &amp; instruction are quite small, and could use a little more instruction on how to use some of the products, but I know that I can look them up on you tube as well.</li>

            <li> I have been growing out my hair for the last year and thought this would be the perfect thing to try out new hair styles.</li>
            <li> or I was already familiar with.</li>
            <li> Especially the Korean version one--I found this to be super-fast to put up and effective!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, excited to use them all.</li>
            <li> My niece wanted those bun socks for Christmas, but I found her a lot more excited with this whole kit!  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a hair girl and was excited for this kit.</li>
            <li> so far we have tried all of the accessories but have not been able to recreate most of hair styles.</li>
            <li> It has pretty much every piece to do your own hair in an updo.  </li>
            <li> Lots of items in the box for a young girl to learn to do her own hair.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use several of the tools, but overall the product was great for figuring out what tools I liked.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Instruciones super pequenas</li>
            <li> Most of the bun making tools were for making a larger bun than I would ever want, but the smallest sponge hair plate worked great for making a smaller bun.</li>
            <li> This is a super fun bundle or hair styling accessories.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed keeping my long hair while being able to pull it up in a neat and fashionable way this summer.</li>
            <li> it being really straight and fine</li>
            <li> They are great products, but I am giving it a 3 star because it was missing some pieces when I got it.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> On time and as described.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful.</li>
            <li> The items came quickly and were exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> The wraps work good too, but I do not know how to use some of the other pieces.</li>
            <li> It seems a general problem of these kind of products, not with this one in particular.</li>
            <li> She likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> We were excited to try out the new tools</li>
            <li> Only thing I would have preferred is better instructions on how to use all the enclosed hair accessories.</li>
            <li> I think the only thing I would like to have is more info on how to use, maybe some video tutorials.</li>
            <li> Most of the pictures are either too blurry, or are simple line drawings that I cannot understand what they are trying to show.&lt;br /&gt;Plan</li>
            <li> I wish the instructions were a little more detailed.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that they can pretty much match your hair color</li>
            <li> This way, for just a little more money, I knew if a bun option was going to work with my hair, it would be in this kit!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been fun trying new things.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with a tiny folded sheet with description of the items &amp; a quick easy how-to guide using 1 or 2 of the items.</li>
            <li> The hair donuts, hair ties, bobby pinds are obviously all easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Directions are tiny, but you can easily Google how to use each item.</li>
            <li> This is the main reason why I purchased this kit in the first place.</li>
            <li> I will have to go on you tube to see if I can find some real live people to show how to use some of these products.</li>
            <li> it had everything that i needed and a lot more fun stuff to play with, of course a lot of the pieces can be easily misplaced</li>
            <li> it was too much for these items to hold it.</li>
            <li> had I really needed them.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price for all the items that you get.</li>
            <li> Everything in this bundle was of greater quality than I expected!</li>
            <li> This is a fun, I have long hair (almost to my waist) and am having fun playing with new bun hair styles.</li>
            <li> I think the donut ones also work though I believe are better suited for slightly shorter hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i liked all the gadgets that i could try, but the instructions for how to use them were really hard to read.</li>
            <li> Great selection, difficult directions.</li>
            <li> so if you need them its worth it unless you can find them at your local store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fun learning how to use the different tools that come in this set</li>
            <li> This bundle has everything I need to find new ways to dress up my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have a grouping of all these different products that I&#x27;ve been wanting to try, but the quality is poor.</li>
            <li> I use the elastic bands the most often because they fit snugly without pulling my hair back too tightly and they aren&#x27;t so loose they fall out.</li>
            <li> I got interested in these various kinds of bun devices online and thru my research</li>
            <li> I only got the kit today, and I used the bun roller first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to making more hair styles instead of just two hair styles like in the past.</li>
            <li> Plus a few of these items bought individually are about a third of this total cost so the price is great.</li>
            <li> They pins are too large - go ahead and just buy the regular 98 cent bobby pins from Walmart.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have fine hair down to my waist, and I was mainly either wearing it down, or in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> I only notice the hair pieces if I am really looking for them or don&#x27;t cover them completely (like with the volume bases).</li>
            <li> Got this for our 12 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> Then I had no trouble seeing the pictures.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 3 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Good quality and value for product, but I was sent the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The directions are small and I&#x27;ll printed, I felt that most of the items were relatively self explanatory</li>
            <li> The items in this kit are high quality, with the only downside being the spirals pins.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the hair bands &amp; tight bobby pins and can&#x27;t find a product like them anywhere!!!</li>
            <li> This little bundle gave me new options with instructions;).</li>
            <li> You can barely even see the pictures or the text!  </li>
            <li> I fixed this by putting a thick dab of clear nail polish on the tips, and when they dried, they looked the ends on the better ones.</li>
            <li> Just plain fun for creating various up-dos!</li>
            <li> I have only been able to use a few pieces so far because the instructions are a bit hard to understand.</li>
            <li> I will agree that the diagrams &amp; instruction are quite small, and could use a little more instruction on how to use some of the products, but I know that I can look them up on you tube as well.</li>
            <li> I still found myself very confused trying to use many of the products.</li>
            <li> The kit had many things in it however the directions were very poor.  </li>
            <li> It may take some practice and learning on a few of the items but isn&#x27;t that the whole point of buying it, to get variety with long hair instead of the same pony tail or throw up bun day after day.  </li>
            <li> I really underestimated the impact of that in the past.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t needed to use the largest bun maker on my girls because they don&#x27;t have long enough hair for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li> Generally, I would buy black hair bands or pins because those are &#x27;standard&#x27;, but this kit comes with everything already optimized for your hair</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because if I try really hard I can actually make a decent bun with the foam bun maker.</li>
            <li> My hair is not long enough for half these things</li>
            <li> This is a must have for long hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this hair kit for those who have medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> I expected to be really easy, but it is too complicated for me.</li>
            <li> After opening the flimsy plastic package and seeing the other pieces I decided right away that they were worthless to me and I began to have buyers&#x27; remorse for getting the entire package instead of just ordering each piece that I was interested in individually.</li>
            <li> My very long hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair--midway down my back--and generally have difficulty getting it up in an orderly fashion due to</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and had every single item!</li>
            <li> The pictures on the instructions are clear but very small.  </li>
            <li> Both sets had multiple items missing out of the packaging, and the quality of what was left was not very good.</li>
            <li> They are about 3/4 the size of the Goody ones and are somewhat sharp.</li>
            <li> When I received this I realized it was for black hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see anything in the description that indicated it was for black hair, but then again I could have just missed it.  </li>
            <li> I have butt length hair and by the time I had my hair rolled half way up</li>
            <li> to use the black color with my reddish brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have Brown hair, but half my kit was black.</li>
            <li> But I guess that stuff can be hidden.</li>
            <li> Mediocre quality but decent variety.</li>
            <li> Gave everything else to my daughter who has long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> She use it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> and me being impatient.</li>
            <li> You can use it for everyday as well.  </li>
            <li> few bobby pins came with the set</li>
            <li> This images are so badly printed that you can&#x27;t really see them.</li>
            <li> The direction are so small, both pictures and print that they are of no use to me.</li>
            <li> Until my hair grows longer I&#x27;m not really enjoying this bunddle.</li>
            <li> The instructions are soooo small need a magnifier to use them.</li>
            <li> But unless I google I&#x27;m not sure how some work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the topsy tail tool broke the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> This was disappointing since it was one of the pieces I wanted to use frequently.</li>
            <li> I have used very few products out of it, but here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not very talented in styling it;(.</li>
            <li> Everything is so hard to use.</li>
            <li> It makes it hard to read the instructions for each item.</li>
            <li> Some of the tools are confusing to learn how to use</li>
            <li> Wish the instruction sheet wasn&#x27;t so small!  </li>
            <li> Unlike other people I had to use 3 hair pins for my hair, because my hair can be difficult.</li>
            <li> The pictures were very small and the instructions were confusing and unclear.  </li>
            <li> I mean this in both price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Poor quality pins.</li>
            <li> but since I have medium length, thin hair it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> not happy about this purchase..</li>
            <li> The paint is sloppily applied to the pins and  tore my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very thin hair and have a very hard time covering the bun.</li>
            <li> Really poor illustrations!</li>
            <li> I get bored with my hair</li>
            <li> Came with VERY POOR instructions.</li>
            <li> still hasnt shipped.. makes for a very annoyed lady......................</li>
            <li> annoyed, annoying and frustrating</li>
            <li> Came as advertised but the quality is POOR &amp; instructions are impossible to read.....</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> But the instructions are terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I received this I realized it was for black hair.  I have auburn hair so would have selected brunette if given the option.  I didn&#x27;t see anything in the description that indicated it was for black hair, but then again I could have just missed it.  With that being said, I like the assortment of hair toys.  The different bun sizes are great and so are the twisty bobby pins to keep the hair in place.  I would recommend, just pay attention to the selected color.</li>
            <li> Everything is so hard to use. It took me ages to figure out how to use most of the items, and some of them didn&#x27;t even work as they supposed to. I thought that maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right, so I watched many tutorials on youtube.It seems a general problem of these kind of products, not with this one in particular. I gave it 3 stars because if I try really hard I can actually make a decent bun with the foam bun maker. I expected to be really easy, but it is too complicated for me.</li>
            <li> I have ordered a couple of these kits even though I only use the bun sock, hair bands, and bobby pins.  I absolutely LOVE the hair bands &amp; tight bobby pins and can&#x27;t find a product like them anywhere!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for our 12 year old granddaughter.  She likes it very much.  Lots of items in the box for a young girl to learn to do her own hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping awesome product!</li>
            <li> Has some great items, but good lord don&#x27;t rely on the pamphlet for a guide on what to do. Best bet is youtube.</li>
            <li> Everything was as described &amp; even though another reviewer mentioned there aren&#x27;t any directions I was surprised with a tiny folded sheet with description of the items &amp; a quick easy how-to guide using 1 or 2 of the items. Still wish it came with more. It does make hair management quicker &amp; easier though!</li>
            <li> You do need long hair to get the best deal out of this.  If you do, this is an incredible buy.  I&#x27;ve bought just one of the bun doughnuts for $4 at Wal-mart.  It may take some practice and learning on a few of the items but isn&#x27;t that the whole point of buying it, to get variety with long hair instead of the same pony tail or throw up bun day after day.  This is a must have for long hair.</li>
            <li> Love all the tools, I&#x27;m using this bundle to design the bride/bridesmaids hair for the wedding.</li>
            <li> The tools I can use work great. Just wish some of the items like the buns came in an even say smaller size.  I&#x27;ve got very thin hair and have a very hard time covering the bun.</li>
            <li> Great selection, difficult directions. It didn&#x27;t explained how to use all the items, I had to research it on line.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price. Would tell others to pass</li>
            <li> Just plain fun for creating various up-dos! My favorites included are the donut bun makers. I bought another as a gift. Both arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner. Very pleased, thank you. You can find video tutorials for all of the styles via YouTube.</li>
            <li> I feel there is good value here for the money, however, the &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; they include are a joke.  You can barely even see the pictures or the text!  But you can watch a lot of hair tutorials on YouTube on how to use these items.</li>
            <li> On time and as described.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit to use to make a lot of easy styles. The pictures on the instructions are clear but very small.  I found a way around this by looking on the picture here of the instructions and, putting the cursor over it to enlarge the images. Then I had no trouble seeing the pictures.  The items in this kit are high quality, with the only downside being the spirals pins. They are about 3/4 the size of the Goody ones and are somewhat sharp. I fixed this by putting a thick dab of clear nail polish on the tips, and when they dried, they looked the ends on the better ones. There are no problem with the bobby pins and the u-shaped hair pins. I also order this book at the same time as the kit: Braids, Buns, and Twists!: Step-by-Step Tutorials for 82 Fabulous Hairstyles by Christina Butcher. It also has some great ideas for different updos!</li>
            <li> This is a super fun bundle or hair styling accessories. It&#x27;s been fun trying new things. Don&#x27;t count on the directions to be easy to follow. This images are so badly printed that you can&#x27;t really see them.</li>
            <li> The direction are so small, both pictures and print that they are of no use to me.</li>
            <li> Lots of interesting components.  Wish it&#x27;s directions better explained how to use them all and create a variety of hairstyles.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for the price.  I had bought a sock bun and it alone cost me $10.  I get a ton of use from this kit.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal. Lots of things I didn&#x27;t want to buy separately. It was nice to just get it all together.</li>
            <li> Came with VERY POOR instructions. I have butt length hair and by the time I had my hair rolled half way up it was too much for these items to hold it. Maybe if you have shoulder length it might work.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 3 year old daughter. We have so much fun using all the great hair tools and accessories.</li>
            <li> Poor quality pins. The paint is sloppily applied to the pins and  tore my hair. It&#x27;s great to have a grouping of all these different products that I&#x27;ve been wanting to try, but the quality is poor.</li>
            <li> I use the sock buns all the time! The wraps work good too, but I do not know how to use some of the other pieces.</li>
            <li> Nice kit.  Only thing I would have preferred is better instructions on how to use all the enclosed hair accessories.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the ones she knows how to use. Would be perfect if it came with directions but it did not.</li>
            <li> I got this accessories kit for my daughter, she LOVES it! She use it almost everyday.  I think I will order on for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working my way through this kit.  The hair donuts, hair ties, bobby pinds are obviously all easy to use.  I wish the instructions were a little more detailed.  I still found myself very confused trying to use many of the products.</li>
            <li> Good assortment for the price, but since I have medium length, thin hair it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I can use the twist-in things but that is it. Gave everything else to my daughter who has long, thick hair. In that respect it wasn&#x27;t a total loss in the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is great it had everything that i needed and a lot more fun stuff to play with, of course a lot of the pieces can be easily misplaced so be careful if your buying this for young kids.</li>
            <li> Really poor illustrations! I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use several pieces of this bunddle. I do like the bun makers and the spiral pins. My hair is shoulder leangth so I&#x27;m guessing they would work better with longer hair. Until my hair grows longer I&#x27;m not really enjoying this bunddle. They make you think it&#x27;s gonna do miracles in your hair, but no it doesn&#x27;t have a lot to it.</li>
            <li> Good but no directions in kit</li>
            <li> Everything in this bundle was of greater quality than I expected! We love the hair ties or rubberbands, because they aren&#x27;t rubber and don&#x27;t snap or break! Have had this for over a year and am buying another because my daughter and I have lost too many of the Bobby pins and hair ties. The bun makers look and work great. The directions are small and I&#x27;ll printed, I felt that most of the items were relatively self explanatory or I was already familiar with. However I was able to struggle through the instructions had I really needed them.</li>
            <li> The only items of this kit I use are the plate bun ring makers, the volume hair bases, and the elastic hair bands. I have red hair and bought the brown set. I only notice the hair pieces if I am really looking for them or don&#x27;t cover them completely (like with the volume bases). I use the elastic bands the most often because they fit snugly without pulling my hair back too tightly and they aren&#x27;t so loose they fall out. They work really great for making buns. They pins are too large - go ahead and just buy the regular 98 cent bobby pins from Walmart. After opening the flimsy plastic package and seeing the other pieces I decided right away that they were worthless to me and I began to have buyers&#x27; remorse for getting the entire package instead of just ordering each piece that I was interested in individually. The cylindrical plastic case that everything comes in does not make a good storage container. I gave away all of the pieces that I don&#x27;t use. The price is fair if you intend on using everything.</li>
            <li> Instruciones super pequenas</li>
            <li> Cheap hair trinkets but hey, my granddaughter liked it so I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I was looking for different way to do with my long hair and this was the perfect item for the perfect price. It comes with a variety of different ways to style your hair and it saves me time. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality and value for product, but I was sent the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to use the black color with my reddish brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have been growing out my hair for the last year and thought this would be the perfect thing to try out new hair styles. My hair is not long enough for half these things but I will use them as I figure them out and my hair gets longer. Plus a few of these items bought individually are about a third of this total cost so the price is great. All the items were of good quality. I recommend this hair kit for those who have medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> not happy about this purchase.. ordered on the 6th.. still hasnt shipped.. makes for a very annoyed lady......................annoyed, annoying and frustrating</li>
            <li> Mediocre quality but decent variety.</li>
            <li> Wish the instruction sheet wasn&#x27;t so small!  It makes it hard to read the instructions for each item.</li>
            <li> so far we have tried all of the accessories but have not been able to recreate most of hair styles. The bun makers were really the best part of the kit so if you need them its worth it unless you can find them at your local store</li>
            <li> I have really long hair--midway down my back--and generally have difficulty getting it up in an orderly fashion due to it being really straight and fine (ie, slippery!) and me being impatient. I got interested in these various kinds of bun devices online and thru my research found this fantastic bundle! I have used very few products out of it, but here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The bun holders work! Especially the Korean version one--I found this to be super-fast to put up and effective! At most I have used one hairpin with it. I think the donut ones also work though I believe are better suited for slightly shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Everything is your hair color! I really underestimated the impact of that in the past. Generally, I would buy black hair bands or pins because those are &#x27;standard&#x27;, but this kit comes with everything already optimized for your hair color!&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to have every bun making option that exists!!! This is the main reason why I purchased this kit in the first place. I found that I could buy some of the individual components more cheaply, but then I wasn&#x27;t sure which would work best for me. This way, for just a little more money, I knew if a bun option was going to work with my hair, it would be in this kit! (And, again, all the pieces match my hair color!)&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a booklet with diagrams/explanations on how to use each item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I think the only thing I would like to have is more info on how to use, maybe some video tutorials. But I am guessing I can find those on YouTube when I become sufficiently motivated:)</li>
            <li> I have had a wonderful time with this product and. My very long hair.</li>
            <li> The instructions are soooo small need a magnifier to use them. Otherwise, excited to use them all.</li>
            <li> The items came quickly and were exactly as pictured. Some of the tools are confusing to learn how to use but I bought this kit primarily for the donut bun makers and the pins and I couldn&#x27;t have bought just that by itself cheaper anywhere else online. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Directions are tiny, but you can easily Google how to use each item.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have fine hair down to my waist, and I was mainly either wearing it down, or in a pony tail. I only got the kit today, and I used the bun roller first. I&#x27;ve never been able to put my hair in a perfect circle, ever! First try with the bun roller, and I had my first ever perfect bun. You really can&#x27;t beat the price for all the items that you get. Unlike other people I had to use 3 hair pins for my hair, because my hair can be difficult. I like the fact that they can pretty much match your hair color so the items blend in with your hair color. I will agree that the diagrams &amp; instruction are quite small, and could use a little more instruction on how to use some of the products, but I know that I can look them up on you tube as well. I&#x27;m looking forward to making more hair styles instead of just two hair styles like in the past. I&#x27;m excited about it!</li>
            <li> The instructions are written by a non-native speaker: for example to explain how to use the Magic Hair Twist Styling Braid Tool Care Clip:&lt;br /&gt;1. put braid into curler and then roll up you hairs.&lt;br /&gt;2. roll up your braid, until all of the hair be on the twist curler clamp.&lt;br /&gt;3. hook the two hooks, then finished.&lt;br /&gt;Some, not all of the items have illustrations to show how to use them. Most of the pictures are either too blurry, or are simple line drawings that I cannot understand what they are trying to show.&lt;br /&gt;Plan on doing your own research on how to use these items. They do seem to be of good quality, and worth the amount paid, but I would have been better off just buying the items that I will use.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for what you get.  Most stores sell the items in this bundle at $4 each (not including the bobby pins and pony tails) so if you do the math, you save a lot of money.  I have not tried all the accessories yet, but it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal for the price. Mine was missing the bobby pins but that wasn&#x27;t really why I bought it. I love the bun makers and pads. Also handy instructions on inside</li>
            <li> I like the hair design styling tools and the bundle but wish I would have receive more instructions and styling tips</li>
            <li> This is a fun, I have long hair (almost to my waist) and am having fun playing with new bun hair styles.</li>
            <li> They are great products, but I am giving it a 3 star because it was missing some pieces when I got it.</li>
            <li> This bundle was amazing!  It has pretty much every piece to do your own hair in an updo.  You can use it for everyday as well.  Purchased for a Marine Corps Ball and it did not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost two years! I use most of the things that come in the kit and love them! Not too pricy and easy to use!</li>
            <li> My niece wanted those bun socks for Christmas, but I found her a lot more excited with this whole kit!  Great for an 11yr old who is experimenting with her hair!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a hair girl and was excited for this kit. But unless I google I&#x27;m not sure how some work. I have Brown hair, but half my kit was black. But I guess that stuff can be hidden. Over all ok</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and had every single item! Have not tried all the tools but the bun makers are perfect!</li>
            <li> But the instructions are terrible. The writing and pictures are microscope so I recommend you tube if you need an idea of how to use any of these</li>
            <li> Everything works well.  You&#x27;ll have to find your own instructions (as those that come with are minuscule), but I have no complaints about the styling tools within.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter.  We were excited to try out the new tools but we couldn&#x27;t read the instructions.  The pictures were very small and the instructions were confusing and unclear.  If you already know how to use these tools you&#x27;d probably be fine.</li>
            <li> This bundle has everything I need to find new ways to dress up my hair.  I appreciate having a variety of accessories all-in-one.  It is nice to not rely the go-to ponytail style every day.</li>
            <li> My daughter opened this for her birthday and has been trying out the pieces ever since.  She is one who loves to practice hair on her friends and creating her own styles.</li>
            <li> I mean this in both price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;But I liked the ponytail holders.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised but the quality is POOR &amp; instructions are impossible to read.....</li>
            <li> I get bored with my hair but I&#x27;m not very talented in styling it;(. This little bundle gave me new options with instructions;). Easy to follow and use.</li>
            <li> I liked the variety of items included in the kit. Most of the bun making tools were for making a larger bun than I would ever want, but the smallest sponge hair plate worked great for making a smaller bun. Unfortunately the topsy tail tool broke the second time I used it. This was disappointing since it was one of the pieces I wanted to use frequently. I just ordered a Conair topsy tail tool to replace it. It was $8, but I think it&#x27;s worth it to get a more sturdy product. I won&#x27;t use several of the tools, but overall the product was great for figuring out what tools I liked.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase.  I ordered 2 sets, different colors.  Both sets had multiple items missing out of the packaging, and the quality of what was left was not very good.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find all the these hair accessories for one price. I have only been able to use a few pieces so far because the instructions are a bit hard to understand. I will have to go on you tube to see if I can find some real live people to show how to use some of these products.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed keeping my long hair while being able to pull it up in a neat and fashionable way this summer.</li>
            <li> This is a great set to use for dance hair or just cute hair at home.  I&#x27;ve had fun learning how to use the different tools that come in this set and I&#x27;ve watched YouTube videos to do that.  I haven&#x27;t needed to use the largest bun maker on my girls because they don&#x27;t have long enough hair for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;several different tools to make different hairstyles&lt;br /&gt;endless number of hairstyles can be made with this set&lt;br /&gt;affordable&lt;br /&gt;easy to use or easy to learn to use if you watch YouTube videos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;very few bobby pins came with the set but that&#x27;s not a big deal</li>
            <li> i liked all the gadgets that i could try, but the instructions for how to use them were really hard to read. i still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use some of the products--and for gadgets, it really helps to have good instructions.</li>
            <li> The kit had many things in it however the directions were very poor.  I have no idea how to use most of them.  I even took then to a salon and know one knew what they were.</li>
