            <li>but I had to scrub it three times before I felt safe using it on my face.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to ordering many more from sigma.</li>
            <li>High quality at great prices.</li>
            <li>super soft ... perfect size for contour ...</li>
            <li>It does the job, feels amazing, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Perfect for contouring, picks up the right amount of product and gives a professional finish.</li>
            <li>First of all Sigma is a very good brand with inexpesive items that are very well made.</li>
            <li>Soft brush that feels great in your hand.</li>
            <li>my order arrived a lot quicker than expected, which is always an awesome surprise.</li>
            <li>The brush is great for contouring and highlighting (though not as soft as I wanted)</li>
            <li>They do have really nice and fun brushes.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sigma purchase and I LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li>makes contour really easy.</li>
            <li>Hairs don&#x27;t come off easy.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect, small enough for accurate placement and feels so great on the skin!</li>
            <li>Oooh and super affordable!</li>
            <li>Good quality and very soft.  </li>
            <li>They are so soft, best quality I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>Brush came nicely packaged and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It is such a great contour brush.</li>
            <li>It felt cheap for being sigma.</li>
            <li>Takes time to buff the contour color out, great brush overall!</li>
            <li>Love my brush, so worth it</li>
            <li>I do not use this brush for contouring, I actually use it to apply my liquid foundation and it works great.</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase more Sigma pencils, they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Brush does a good job of blending and creating that soft glow.</li>
            <li>Makes contouring cheeks super easy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up a lot of color, which is good for applying contour lightly but it does take a little more work to get a more defined look</li>
            <li>The brush is very dense and makes blending very easy.  </li>
            <li>Because it is a smaller more precise brush using powder contour on the face is distributed so nicely.</li>
            <li>The Small Contour F05 is perfect for contouring the lower cheek, hairline, and jaw.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t stay in it&#x27;s original shape, it fluffs out and stays that way, hence the four, rather than five stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>The bristles are smooth, soft, gentle, yet they pick up the perfect amount of product each and every time I use it, The application is blended and appears so natural looking on the face.</li>
            <li>If you want a good contour brush, especially for the hollows of your cheeks</li>
            <li>It has an even application of the product and the final result is totally gorgeous</li>
            <li>Definitely makes contouring easy and blends out the products nicely.</li>
            <li>This brush is dense enough to it&#x27;s job but soft and cushy on the skin and mine, even after repeated use and cleaning has not shed.</li>
            <li>I love all sigma brushes &amp; I&#x27;m glad I had ordered this brush finally.</li>
            <li>makes the countering step very easy and looks natural.</li>
            <li>they are soft and its very easy to blend in the products.</li>
            <li>Im overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thankfully this brush was the exact size I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>I love all my sigma brushes and have a large portion of their whole collection.</li>
            <li>I love how dense the brush is and how soft the bristles are.</li>
            <li>I was looking to purchase MAC brushes, but thought I&#x27;d check on Amazon to see if there were any other brands (that are just as good) for a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of thickness.</li>
            <li>It gives my face just the right amount of foundation without overdoing it..</li>
            <li>This brush is such great quality, the bristles are soft and the handle is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The coating on the handle chip very easily for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles easy to handle and does the job.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, brushes so soft!!!</li>
            <li>This brush is ideal for contour small areas of you face as well your cheekbones!!</li>
            <li>I have used many different expensive brushes, these are the best quality Iv&#x27;e found.</li>
            <li>I like my contour brushes a bit larger and more dense.</li>
            <li>Whenever I need to contour, this brush is the first one I pick up.</li>
            <li>it places products exactly where i need them to go</li>
            <li>It is a good brush, not as fluffy as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a handy brush that one should have for their personal or freelancing kit, definately worth the money!</li>
            <li>It is very comparable to the \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; brushes.</li>
            <li>the best part about this brush is that it is less than half the price of a MAC brush.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something small and precise that can get in the hollows of my cheek better.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft.  </li>
            <li>Having the right brush makes my makeup routine go quickly and gives me proper application of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a real Techniques contour brush to apply contour.  </li>
            <li>Gives you a very defined contour.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Bellus F05 over this to any one who wants to save money and not give up quality.</li>
            <li>Soft, picks up the right amount of products, and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>( the other ones i have are ok...</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this brush and figured it would be the perfect brush for me to get since its small and round</li>
            <li>I had my eye on this brush for a while and had used the MAC brush similar and found this brush to be such a better brush.</li>
            <li>I love paying $19 vs $35; I can buy an entire different brush with the cost difference!</li>
            <li>this brush is a main staple for me</li>
            <li>Decently priced</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush esp for those that are just beginning contour.</li>
            <li>I recommend the Sigma F05 to anyone wanting to add a high quality makeup brush to their beauty tool collection.</li>
            <li>and I had high expectations</li>
            <li>and it meant my high expectations.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this contour brush to anyone looking for quality.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Price was a bit to high</li>
            <li>It is firm, dense, and only slightly domed, which makes it perfect for buffing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and dense!!</li>
            <li>It is soft on the skin and blends very well.</li>
            <li>So if you are reading this and are iffy about ordering this brush, it is not only affordable but SO worth it.</li>
            <li>The brush did not come in the normal package that it should have.</li>
            <li>New everyday face brush :)</li>
            <li>I was hoping it was a bit more stiff, it is on the softer side...</li>
            <li>Just tried my new F05</li>
            <li>I have a few brushes, which I use for countoring, by far this is my favorite  and my go to brush.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft.</li>
            <li>Holds onto powder well and is very soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and lives up to the quality of Sigma.</li>
            <li>Giving me the very natural airbrush finish.</li>
            <li>the bristles are very soft..</li>
            <li>BECAUSE  every time I clean it the water turns to very dark gray more to black  </li>
            <li>The only reason for the 4 star review is because this the first \\&quot;contour\\&quot; brush I&#x27;ve purchased, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>this brush is soft &amp; works wonders for contouring!</li>
            <li>first and last sigma brush i will ever buy .</li>
            <li>would HIGHLY recommend this brush if you are just starting out with contouring, because it doesn&#x27;t collect large amounts of product and then deposit that product on your skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually contour my face very often, but when I do I use this brush.</li>
            <li>and i was pleasantly surprised this brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>This brush is very comparable to the MAC 109 and even better in my opinion, not only because its affordable, but because the Mac brush tends to shed a lot and loses its softness over time..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough, and offers good buffing and contouring, but the black coating on the handle chipped after a few washes.</li>
            <li>This brush had made contouring much better, getting into the hallows of my cheeks rather than using my angled brush since I have such a small face.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to work for contouring yet &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; and fluffy enough to beautifully apply blush.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new brand of brushes look no further!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not stiff enough, even when u pinch it together which U shouldn&#x27;t have to do.</li>
            <li>I have all 3 of their eye shadow palettes dare, bare and flare.</li>
            <li>I hope to purchase their brushes sets in the near future.</li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t feel it stood out from really any other contouring brush.</li>

            <li> i love this brush</li>
            <li> but I had to scrub it three times before I felt safe using it on my face.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to ordering many more from sigma.</li>
            <li> High quality at great prices.</li>
            <li> super soft ... perfect size for contour ...</li>
            <li> It does the job, feels amazing, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect for contouring, picks up the right amount of product and gives a professional finish.</li>
            <li> First of all Sigma is a very good brand with inexpesive items that are very well made.</li>
            <li> Soft brush that feels great in your hand.</li>
            <li> my order arrived a lot quicker than expected, which is always an awesome surprise.</li>
            <li> The brush is great for contouring and highlighting (though not as soft as I wanted)</li>
            <li> They do have really nice and fun brushes.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma purchase and I LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li> makes contour really easy.</li>
            <li> Hairs don&#x27;t come off easy.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect, small enough for accurate placement and feels so great on the skin!</li>
            <li> Oooh and super affordable!</li>
            <li> Good quality and very soft.  </li>
            <li> They are so soft, best quality I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> Brush came nicely packaged and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It is such a great contour brush.</li>
            <li> It felt cheap for being sigma.</li>
            <li> Takes time to buff the contour color out, great brush overall!</li>
            <li> Love my brush, so worth it</li>
            <li> I do not use this brush for contouring, I actually use it to apply my liquid foundation and it works great.</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase more Sigma pencils, they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Brush does a good job of blending and creating that soft glow.</li>
            <li> Makes contouring cheeks super easy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up a lot of color, which is good for applying contour lightly but it does take a little more work to get a more defined look</li>
            <li> The brush is very dense and makes blending very easy.  </li>
            <li> Because it is a smaller more precise brush using powder contour on the face is distributed so nicely.</li>
            <li> The Small Contour F05 is perfect for contouring the lower cheek, hairline, and jaw.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stay in it&#x27;s original shape, it fluffs out and stays that way, hence the four, rather than five stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> The bristles are smooth, soft, gentle, yet they pick up the perfect amount of product each and every time I use it, The application is blended and appears so natural looking on the face.</li>
            <li> If you want a good contour brush, especially for the hollows of your cheeks</li>
            <li> It has an even application of the product and the final result is totally gorgeous</li>
            <li> Definitely makes contouring easy and blends out the products nicely.</li>
            <li> This brush is dense enough to it&#x27;s job but soft and cushy on the skin and mine, even after repeated use and cleaning has not shed.</li>
            <li> I love all sigma brushes &amp; I&#x27;m glad I had ordered this brush finally.</li>
            <li> makes the countering step very easy and looks natural.</li>
            <li> they are soft and its very easy to blend in the products.</li>
            <li> Im overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thankfully this brush was the exact size I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> I love all my sigma brushes and have a large portion of their whole collection.</li>
            <li> I love how dense the brush is and how soft the bristles are.</li>
            <li> I was looking to purchase MAC brushes, but thought I&#x27;d check on Amazon to see if there were any other brands (that are just as good) for a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of thickness.</li>
            <li> It gives my face just the right amount of foundation without overdoing it..</li>
            <li> This brush is such great quality, the bristles are soft and the handle is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The coating on the handle chip very easily for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles easy to handle and does the job.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, brushes so soft!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is ideal for contour small areas of you face as well your cheekbones!!</li>
            <li> I have used many different expensive brushes, these are the best quality Iv&#x27;e found.</li>
            <li> I like my contour brushes a bit larger and more dense.</li>
            <li> Whenever I need to contour, this brush is the first one I pick up.</li>
            <li> it places products exactly where i need them to go</li>
            <li> It is a good brush, not as fluffy as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a handy brush that one should have for their personal or freelancing kit, definately worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is very comparable to the \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; brushes.</li>
            <li> the best part about this brush is that it is less than half the price of a MAC brush.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something small and precise that can get in the hollows of my cheek better.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft.  </li>
            <li> Having the right brush makes my makeup routine go quickly and gives me proper application of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a real Techniques contour brush to apply contour.  </li>
            <li> Gives you a very defined contour.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Bellus F05 over this to any one who wants to save money and not give up quality.</li>
            <li> Soft, picks up the right amount of products, and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> ( the other ones i have are ok...</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this brush and figured it would be the perfect brush for me to get since its small and round</li>
            <li> I had my eye on this brush for a while and had used the MAC brush similar and found this brush to be such a better brush.</li>
            <li> I love paying $19 vs $35; I can buy an entire different brush with the cost difference!</li>
            <li> this brush is a main staple for me</li>
            <li> Decently priced</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush esp for those that are just beginning contour.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Sigma F05 to anyone wanting to add a high quality makeup brush to their beauty tool collection.</li>
            <li> and I had high expectations</li>
            <li> and it meant my high expectations.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this contour brush to anyone looking for quality.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Price was a bit to high</li>
            <li> It is firm, dense, and only slightly domed, which makes it perfect for buffing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and dense!!</li>
            <li> It is soft on the skin and blends very well.</li>
            <li> So if you are reading this and are iffy about ordering this brush, it is not only affordable but SO worth it.</li>
            <li> The brush did not come in the normal package that it should have.</li>
            <li> New everyday face brush :)</li>
            <li> I was hoping it was a bit more stiff, it is on the softer side...</li>
            <li> Just tried my new F05</li>
            <li> I have a few brushes, which I use for countoring, by far this is my favorite  and my go to brush.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft.</li>
            <li> Holds onto powder well and is very soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft and lives up to the quality of Sigma.</li>
            <li> Giving me the very natural airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> the bristles are very soft..</li>
            <li> BECAUSE  every time I clean it the water turns to very dark gray more to black  </li>
            <li> The only reason for the 4 star review is because this the first \\&quot;contour\\&quot; brush I&#x27;ve purchased, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> this brush is soft &amp; works wonders for contouring!</li>
            <li> first and last sigma brush i will ever buy .</li>
            <li> would HIGHLY recommend this brush if you are just starting out with contouring, because it doesn&#x27;t collect large amounts of product and then deposit that product on your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually contour my face very often, but when I do I use this brush.</li>
            <li> and i was pleasantly surprised this brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> This brush is very comparable to the MAC 109 and even better in my opinion, not only because its affordable, but because the Mac brush tends to shed a lot and loses its softness over time..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough, and offers good buffing and contouring, but the black coating on the handle chipped after a few washes.</li>
            <li> This brush had made contouring much better, getting into the hallows of my cheeks rather than using my angled brush since I have such a small face.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to work for contouring yet &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; and fluffy enough to beautifully apply blush.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new brand of brushes look no further!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not stiff enough, even when u pinch it together which U shouldn&#x27;t have to do.</li>
            <li> I have all 3 of their eye shadow palettes dare, bare and flare.</li>
            <li> I hope to purchase their brushes sets in the near future.</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t feel it stood out from really any other contouring brush.</li>
            <li> This brush actually allows you to gently work product into your contour areas and applys only a small amount to the deepest segment of the contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More updates: This brush also sheds like crazy and it never stops doing so.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, it&#x27;s  bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> the handle is long but not tooo long</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t so bad either, when you compare this to other high end brushes which are priced well outside of normal, decent brush pricing range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in my other rating for the larger Sigma brush:  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this brush is that it isn&#x27;t as fluffy as I thought it was, but its really not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to apply the color in the specific area where you want it.</li>
            <li> considering I found the same brush by Bellus on amazon for much less.</li>
            <li> For awhile I have been using a regular fluffy blush brush to contour my face</li>
            <li> so I do need some precision, yet a subtle look to make things look natural.</li>
            <li> I just make due.</li>
            <li> It is just small enough to contour the cheeks, jaw line and the nose.</li>
            <li> I have other brand name brushes and the quality of this brush is comparable.</li>
            <li> I do find myself using it occasionally for powder blush, but it&#x27;s definitely not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It never stops bleeding dark blue dye when washing it ( and heavily! )</li>
            <li> I use a dark creme concealor on my cheeks and then use the brush to blend it all it.</li>
            <li> only when I&#x27;m serious abiut contouring my face.</li>
            <li> Seems as though they all shed quite a bit, to the point you have to pick the black hairs off your face.  </li>
            <li> Sigma never let&#x27;s me down!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use as an everyday for contouring brush.</li>
            <li> Have not had any bristles fall out - and i&#x27;ve washed the brush a few times.</li>
            <li> which is weird to my so am afraid to wash it more</li>
            <li> Meh...this brush, for me, is not ideal for countouring... too small, and the bristles aren&#x27;t tightly packed enough.</li>
            <li> I do realize that this is called the Small Contour brush</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the new ones they sent me did the same thing :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine and use at least the foundation brushes 5 days a week.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a small contour brush for the longest time!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very very small.</li>
            <li> brush was bad quality and defective , it sheds like crazy and the handle is loose .</li>
            <li> Looks like very poor quality coating/handle.</li>
            <li> , which is very disturbing to me.</li>
            <li> then it will shred like crazy like my F35 :(</li>
            <li> I just took the brush out of the holder and the thing chipped sooo badly!</li>
            <li> This is awful for contouring!</li>
            <li> This seller is awful.</li>
            <li> It was in a plastic bag, and when I took it out, there was a nasty sticky residue on the handle of the brush.</li>

            <li> Just tried my new F05 and I love it! So far I have tried using it for both contouring and blush, both worked great! The size is perfect, small enough for accurate placement and feels so great on the skin! Will be buying more! :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush. It&#x27;s great quality and its 100% real! Works great for contouring :) A must buy!</li>
            <li> Wow this brush is awesome. It is very comparable to the \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; brushes.This brush is the perfect size for contouring and applying blush. I am super happy with my purchase and will continue to buy from Sigma!Brushes are really the foundation in makeup application, if your brushes aren&#x27;t good your makeup wont look as good as you want it to.Buy this brush, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, and it&#x27;s definitively a must. makes the countering step very easy and looks natural. Love Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually contour my face very often, but when I do I use this brush. I love all my sigma brushes and have a large portion of their whole collection. I&#x27;ve had mine and use at least the foundation brushes 5 days a week. I&#x27;ve had them for going on 3 years and they don&#x27;t shed, stain, split, or leave streaks on my face. You cannot buy a better brush.</li>
            <li> Thankfully this brush was the exact size I was hoping for! It&#x27;s perfect for contouring the sides of my nose, and cheekbones. Larger brushes tend to spread the product all over the place - making my face look muddy, but this brush is brilliant!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! It doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up a lot of color, which is good for applying contour lightly but it does take a little more work to get a more defined look</li>
            <li> Great for contouring and blush</li>
            <li> The only brush I use to contour and apply targeted bronzer. Perfect size!</li>
            <li> I love it. It is very soft. Also i like the gift that it was coming with the order ^^.</li>
            <li> Great brush, soft and great application!</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a small contour brush for the longest time! For awhile I have been using a regular fluffy blush brush to contour my face but I wanted something small and precise that can get in the hollows of my cheek better. I stumbled upon this brush and figured it would be the perfect brush for me to get since its small and round like I ideally wanted. I love this brush for contouring my face, it does exactly what I want and gives me the best blended look for contour. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this brush is that it isn&#x27;t as fluffy as I thought it was, but its really not that big of a deal. If you want a good contour brush, especially for the hollows of your cheeks this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> This is awful for contouring! It&#x27;s not stiff enough, even when u pinch it together which U shouldn&#x27;t have to do. And it&#x27;s very very small. I just use it to set my concealer under my eyes with powder &amp; wherever else I&#x27;ve highlited(chin,nose,forehead.)So it&#x27;s handy for that, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it. I just make due.</li>
            <li> This brush is such great quality, the bristles are soft and the handle is very sturdy. Amazing for bronzer but also blush. Sigma definitely has the best brushes on the market, way better and cheaper than mac!</li>
            <li> Really nice brush.  Holds onto powder well and is very soft.  Can&#x27;t give it 5 stars until I&#x27;ve used it for while.</li>
            <li> I use a real Techniques contour brush to apply contour.  Then I use this brush to blend out the edges so that your contour doesnt scream out &amp;#34;CONTOURRRR!&amp;#34;.  Does an awesome job!</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are the best. They don&#x27;t shed and work great, very good quality. I have used many different expensive brushes, these are the best quality Iv&#x27;e found.</li>
            <li> I got this brush because of a review on youtube and i was pleasantly surprised this brush is so soft. Perfect for contouring, picks up the right amount of product and gives a professional finish. Brush came nicely packaged and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this brush. Elf brushes are much more softer than Sigma.</li>
            <li> I was looking for contouring brush and this is a great option.  The brush is very dense and makes blending very easy.  Good quality and very soft.  A great brush for contouring!</li>
            <li> This brush is great for traveling. I use it for buffing out my cream to powder makeup,concealer,and powders/blushes. I own three!I love it.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, it&#x27;s  bit smaller than I expected. But it still works great! I use a dark creme concealor on my cheeks and then use the brush to blend it all it. Works good for me :) I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> This brush works great to get the perfect contour! I love the size of this brush, it makes it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a holy grail brush for contouring. It is just small enough to contour the cheeks, jaw line and the nose.One of the softness ever! A must have for anyone doing makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is such a great contour brush. Because it is a smaller more precise brush using powder contour on the face is distributed so nicely. I had my eye on this brush for a while and had used the MAC brush similar and found this brush to be such a better brush. I love Sigma. I would highly recommend this brush esp for those that are just beginning contour. Get it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for contouring. I use it to apply my bronzer.  Picks up just enough product without overdoing it. Really nice.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. First of all Sigma is a very good brand with inexpesive items that are very well made. This brush i use it for a couple things I can countour the hollows of my cheekbones and I also use it on the apples of my cheecks for blush. Im sure it can be used to apple powder or bronzer all over but which ever way you ise it they are soft and its very easy to blend in the products. Oh yeah and i havent had any of my brushes shed, as longs as you wash them and take care of them they shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Used this for contouring with matte bronzer. It works ok. It felt cheap for being sigma. I&#x27;ll keep using it but I just don&#x27;t feel it stood out from really any other contouring brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough, and offers good buffing and contouring, but the black coating on the handle chipped after a few washes.</li>
            <li> I have a few brushes, which I use for countoring, by far this is my favorite  and my go to brush.  I recommend this to anyone looking for this type of brush.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for contouring! Extremely soft and picks up product perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s shape after you wash either. a must have!</li>
            <li> I do realize that this is called the Small Contour brush but I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was! I like my contour brushes a bit larger and more dense. But it&#x27;s still a good brush. I use it for highlighting my cheekbones instead. This wasn&#x27;t a must-have brush in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for contouring.  Buffs everything out very nicely. I use this or Nars ITA brush for same purpose</li>
            <li> I like this brush because it does the same job as the MAC109. I love paying $19 vs $35; I can buy an entire different brush with the cost difference!</li>
            <li> Awesome, now I can make perfect contours! Can be used even with creams or powder products, another amazing product from sigma!</li>
            <li> Great brush.. Airbrush effect... Love it</li>
            <li> I like this brush but don&#x27;t use it too often....only when I&#x27;m serious abiut contouring my face. Works well for that though. Feels amazing on the skin.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are the best brushes. They are so soft, best quality I&#x27;ve seen so far. Love.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. Soft, picks up the right amount of products, and doesn&#x27;t shed. Also fairly priced.</li>
            <li> I like it for blush more than contouring , it might be good for blinding contour but not for contouring because of thE  brush shape in my opinion ...... IGAVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE  every time I clean it the water turns to very dark gray more to black  which is weird to my so am afraid to wash it more then it will shred like crazy like my F35 :(</li>
            <li> The size of the brush is perfect for contouring and it doesn&#x27;t shed. The only reason for the 4 star review is because this the first \\&quot;contour\\&quot; brush I&#x27;ve purchased, so I have nothing to compare it to. I have other brand name brushes and the quality of this brush is comparable. I will be purchasing more of this brand.</li>
            <li> Sigma Brushes are high quality makeup brushes and are recommended by the best beauty bloggers.  The Small Contour F05 is perfect for contouring the lower cheek, hairline, and jaw.  Having the right brush makes my makeup routine go quickly and gives me proper application of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I was able to get this brush through Amazon.  Purchase was easy-price was good-delivery was on time.  I recommend the Sigma F05 to anyone wanting to add a high quality makeup brush to their beauty tool collection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and dense!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific brush. It is small enough to work for contouring yet &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; and fluffy enough to beautifully apply blush. This brush is dense enough to it&#x27;s job but soft and cushy on the skin and mine, even after repeated use and cleaning has not shed. It won&#x27;t stay in it&#x27;s original shape, it fluffs out and stays that way, hence the four, rather than five stars.</li>
            <li> It is a good brush, not as fluffy as I thought it would be.  Gives you a very defined contour.</li>
            <li> Love my sigma brushes! I was wanting a good contour brush and bought this from recommendation.  Sigma never let&#x27;s me down!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use as an everyday for contouring brush. It is soft on the skin and blends very well.</li>
            <li> my daughters love it, what can I say</li>
            <li> This brush is great, soft bristles and perfect for contouring.</li>
            <li> Works well to apply hd powder. The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! super soft ... perfect size for contour ...sturdy handle will continue to purchase these brushes. amazing quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> Love the sigma brushes! They are great quality for a great price! If you are looking for a new brand of brushes look no further!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neatly packaged. The bristles are soft and it does a very good job on contouring my cheeks and even good for blushers. Im overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excellent contour brush! I&#x27;ve had several and this one is the best by far. The price isn&#x27;t so bad either, when you compare this to other high end brushes which are priced well outside of normal, decent brush pricing range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend this brush if you are just starting out with contouring, because it doesn&#x27;t collect large amounts of product and then deposit that product on your skin. This brush actually allows you to gently work product into your contour areas and applys only a small amount to the deepest segment of the contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this one is a MUST for everyone&#x27;s collection!</li>
            <li> Love this brush for my contouring! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! It&#x27;s really soft and it&#x27;s the perfect size for your contour. I watched videos on youtube about this brush and I had high expectations and it meant my high expectations. The only thing that I didnt like about this brush is that it sheds.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. The size is perfect for contouring. I love how dense the brush is and how soft the bristles are. Definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have almost all of the sigma face brushes.  Seems as though they all shed quite a bit, to the point you have to pick the black hairs off your face.  I contacted Sigma about this thinking maybe I had defective brushes and they promptly replaced them no questions asked.  Unfortunately the new ones they sent me did the same thing :(</li>
            <li> Makes contouring cheeks super easy.  This is the perfect size to contour easily.  I love Sigma brushes.  High quality at great prices.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this contour brush to anyone looking for quality. The bristles are smooth, soft, gentle, yet they pick up the perfect amount of product each and every time I use it, The application is blended and appears so natural looking on the face. I do not have very prominent cheek bones so I do need some precision, yet a subtle look to make things look natural. This brush does just that. So if you are reading this and are iffy about ordering this brush, it is not only affordable but SO worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for contouring. Whenever I need to contour, this brush is the first one I pick up. It makes contouring look so natural and flawless. It&#x27;s great for highlighting, too. It&#x27;s small enough to apply the color in the specific area where you want it. But that&#x27;s not all this brush does. It is also great for blush, powder, cream and liquid foundation. It is firm, dense, and only slightly domed, which makes it perfect for buffing.  Update: Had to take some stars off. The coating on the handle chip very easily for no apparent reason. I just took the brush out of the holder and the thing chipped sooo badly! The coating just crumbled under the touch of my fingers. And i just bought it 3 months ago!!! Don&#x27;t know if this is the case with all the brushes, will they all end up like this? ( the other ones i have are ok... for now ), or i&#x27;m just &amp;#34;lucky&amp;#34; like that. Maybe it&#x27;s defective. Whatever it is, i don&#x27;t like it. Looks like very poor quality coating/handle. This happened to anybody else as well?  More updates: This brush also sheds like crazy and it never stops doing so. I was hoping it would stop after a while, but it never did. Same goes for bleeding dye. It never stops bleeding dark blue dye when washing it ( and heavily! ), which is very disturbing to me.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Came quickly, brushes so soft!!! IN LOVEEEE!!!! Totally would recommend to a friend!!!! :) Do not hesitate to buy!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! It&#x27; fits perfectly in the hollows of the cheeks to give a nice chiselled effect. It blends the product so nicely and the quality is amazing. No shedding at all. I&#x27;m very pleased with my order and plan on ordering more Sigma brushes. My order came very quickly too so that was nice.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It is great for contouring and lasts forever! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great contouring brush!</li>
            <li> I orderd this brush and I totally Love it , it&#x27;s my favorite brush for contouring either with a bronzer or with a blush .</li>
            <li> Takes time to buff the contour color out, great brush overall!</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in my other rating for the larger Sigma brush:  The brush feels amazing against my skin!  I was looking to purchase MAC brushes, but thought I&#x27;d check on Amazon to see if there were any other brands (that are just as good) for a cheaper price.  I found this one, and thought this was a very good buy.  It does the job, feels amazing, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma purchase and I LOVE this brush! It&#x27;s perfect for contouring, just the right size! It also blends beautifully.</li>
            <li> Meh...this brush, for me, is not ideal for countouring... too small, and the bristles aren&#x27;t tightly packed enough. I do find myself using it occasionally for powder blush, but it&#x27;s definitely not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Definitely makes contouring easy and blends out the products nicely. Have not had any bristles fall out - and i&#x27;ve washed the brush a few times. Definitely a go-to brush for me! Very soft and lives up to the quality of Sigma.</li>
            <li> Love my brush, so worth it</li>
            <li> This brush is ideal for contour small areas of you face as well your cheekbones!! It has an even application of the product and the final result is totally gorgeous</li>
            <li> Love my sigma brushes ....... I read post after post when I was shopping around for brushes and I&#x27;m glad I took the advice of many and tried the sigma brand ...... I&#x27;m very satisfied with my sigma brushes! Perfect size for chiseling out the perfect cheekbone and contour....they are very well made brushes with perfect structured handles.</li>
            <li> Great Service and Fast shipping. I have always wanted to tried sigma brushes. I have watched many video reviews on Youtube about their brushes. I have all 3 of their eye shadow palettes dare, bare and flare. Very good products of quality. I finally gave in and ordered the contour brush to try. I am very satisfied with the brush. It does the job well and feels really good on my skin. I hope to purchase their brushes sets in the near future. They do have really nice and fun brushes.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for contouring or blush, I like the short bristles, and its the perfect shape for it. I was hoping it was a bit more stiff, it is on the softer side...otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I love this contour brush. It feels the same as if it was a MAC brush, and the best part about this brush is that it is less than half the price of a MAC brush. This is a MUST HAVE brush.</li>
            <li> I lovvvve sigma brushes. They are so soft and blend the products perfectly for a flawless look. They are a dupe for MAC brushes. You will not regret buying any sigma brushes :)</li>
            <li> I love all sigma brushes &amp; I&#x27;m glad I had ordered this brush finally. This brush had made contouring much better, getting into the hallows of my cheeks rather than using my angled brush since I have such a small face. Great purchase!! :)</li>
            <li> i love this, it is amazing. makes contour really easy. nice and defined contours, helps with blending it out. it is amazing, sigma brushes are always top quality. this brush is a main staple for me</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It has just the right amount of thickness. I do not use this brush for contouring, I actually use it to apply my liquid foundation and it works great. It gives my face just the right amount of foundation without overdoing it.. Giving me the very natural airbrush finish. It reminds me of M.A.C. Cosmetics Brush #109 except without the M.A.C. price.</li>
            <li> i bought this one for my wife and she definitely loves it. she is a make up artist and always been bragging with this brand. quality is really awesome! highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Well what can i say about this brush.. it&#x27;s perfect for what its&#x27; purpose is, contouring.. I find myself using it for blush and highlighting also.. the bristles are very soft.. the handle is long but not tooo long so it&#x27;s perfect to handle. This brush is very comparable to the MAC 109 and even better in my opinion, not only because its affordable, but because the Mac brush tends to shed a lot and loses its softness over time.. Overall I think this is a handy brush that one should have for their personal or freelancing kit, definately worth the money! :) Oooh and super affordable! Can&#x27;t beat that :D</li>
            <li> Soft bristles easy to handle and does the job. Hairs don&#x27;t come off easy. I&#x27;ve actually washed this brushed twice and noticed no hair falling. Decently priced</li>
            <li> Love it, with that all I&#x27;m saying that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, good quality like all of my Sigma brushes are. Soft brush that feels great in your hand. Great for contouring/highlighting. New everyday face brush :)</li>
            <li> I use this bush for contouring my face. It picks up my bronzer with one sweep and the application is even. It fits perfectly under my cheekbones for a chiseled look. It works the same as the MAC 109 brush and is a lot cheaper!!</li>
            <li> i love this brush it places products exactly where i need them to go</li>
            <li> my order arrived a lot quicker than expected, which is always an awesome surprise. this brush is soft &amp; works wonders for contouring! it is my daily go to brush for contouring.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to contour my face, works really nicely.  I use my brown mineral eye shadow or bronzer and brush this on my cheekbones, hairline, and sides of my nose.  Brush does a good job of blending and creating that soft glow.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! The bristles are super soft.  It is the perfect brush for contouring. I am going to purchase more Sigma pencils, they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> excellent product, recommend their use without problems sending or transaction</li>
            <li> The quality of this brush is great. This seller is awful. The brush did not come in the normal package that it should have. It was in a plastic bag, and when I took it out, there was a nasty sticky residue on the handle of the brush. Do not buy this item from this seller, find somewhere else. The brush is great for contouring and highlighting (though not as soft as I wanted) but I had to scrub it three times before I felt safe using it on my face.</li>
            <li> brush was bad quality and defective , it sheds like crazy and the handle is loose . first and last sigma brush i will ever buy .</li>
            <li> I love this brush for contouring my cheeks and face! The shape of this brush fits perfectly into the hallows of my cheeks making it easy to apply my bronzer. This is a must have brush for my every day make up routine.</li>
            <li> Does what I needed it to do when I learn the technique. Great brush... I am looking forward to ordering many more from sigma.</li>
            <li> Love this brush to contour works amazing and with no effort at all.</li>
            <li> quality of this brush was great and application even. Price was a bit to high considering I found the same brush by Bellus on amazon for much less. I would recommend the Bellus F05 over this to any one who wants to save money and not give up quality.</li>
