            <li>I love this set of brushes and I have started using them and they are as good as my Baremineral Brushes that I paid big bugs for,, so I say peeps buy these and save some your cash for something else you really want..  </li>
            <li>Brushes arent as full as i had hoped</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great starter kit for brushes.</li>
            <li>and I threw out ALL of my old brushes which were 100 times better than these.  </li>
            <li>I love them there so soft</li>
            <li>these brushes are soft the quality is amazing highly recommend these brushes to every one thank you</li>

            <li>PRETTY BRUSHES</li>
            <li>Came exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very similar to the BH Cosmetics ones, the only thing is the quality control isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>Love them its such a comlete set and a very ship alternative.....</li>
            <li>The brush roll is nice, though a little on the floppy side.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for such a cheap price ...</li>

            <li>what better gift than pink makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>They smell funny but feel so soft</li>
            <li>The item was shipped quickly but several brushes broke when I was testing the product.</li>
            <li>Slight chemical scent when first taken out of packaging but fine after exposed to air.</li>
            <li>the only thing to watch out for is that the white stains easily when you use them with darker colors ...</li>
            <li>AND MOST ARE TOO STIFF.</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>These are really soft! ...</li>
            <li>Picks up color and is soft.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 12 yr old daughters.  </li>
            <li>I love the pink, but the kit is not worth buying..</li>
            <li>They are soft enough but the handles are longer than I would like.  </li>

            <li> PRETTY BRUSHES BUT THEY DONT REALLY HOLD ANY PRODUCT AND MOST ARE TOO STIFF. WOULD BE GOOD FOR A TEEN OR CHILD TO PLAY WITH BUT NOT FOR ACTUAL MUA USE</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are so soft!</li>
            <li> these brushes are soft the quality is amazing highly recommend these brushes to every one thank you</li>
            <li> Nice set! Haven&#x27;t got to use them yet, but looking forward to it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT INVEST YOUR MONEY on this product.  I bought these brushes based on the reviews and I threw out ALL of my old brushes which were 100 times better than these.  Not even 2 weeks after using these brushes the top part of the brush stared to just come out.  It happened to 4 of my brushes. Very cheap quality.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Every brush I could possibly want.  They are soft enough but the handles are longer than I would like.  No complaints with anything else.  Good value.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves these</li>
            <li> Not bad... specially for the price. They do smell strong. A chemical smell... I wash my brushes regularly, so I&#x27;m sure once I do, the smell will go away. I did have one shed immediately...so I am a little concerned. Other than that it is a great starter kit for brushes. Picks up color and is soft.</li>

            <li> Disappointed. They are a bunch of brushes that we never use. All of them are flat and useless. I love the pink, but the kit is not worth buying..</li>
            <li> gift item, loved by recipient, and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Yes you get a lot of brushes, however, it is just multiples of the same brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into the makeup world so this works great for a starter</li>
            <li> I love them there so soft</li>
            <li> Very good blending and nice soft feel, but the brushes break within days of receiving them.</li>

            <li> Love It !!! Brush Don&#x27;t Shed And Easy To Clean</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for a gift. My friend LOVES pink &amp; she&#x27;s just getting into wearing makeup.....what better gift than pink makeup brushes. She was absolutely thrilled with them. So glad I bought them. They arrived carefully packaged &amp; sooner than I had expected. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great set of makeup brushes :) You get great quality for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They also came in perfect condition. This is a steal!</li>
            <li> Cheep cheep cheep and not in the good inexpensive way.... one brush had already fallen apart before I even opened it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful,other than the smell of.fresh paint that it has.</li>
            <li> I love this set of brushes and I have started using them and they are as good as my Baremineral Brushes that I paid big bugs for,, so I say peeps buy these and save some your cash for something else you really want..  smiles... :P)</li>
            <li> They smell funny but feel so soft but I still don&#x27;t try them out but I pull them and the hairs and come of so I&#x27;m guessing they are going to be amazing</li>
            <li> I thought there would be more of a variety but there is just multiples of the same brushes. Overall they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes I bought them for my moms birthday she loved when I was wrapping them I wanted them for myself and I dont know why people say they have a bad scent when I opend them they didn&#x27;t have any scent they were just fine and I absolutely love these brushes</li>

            <li> love these brushes they are amazing every brush you could want  with the added bonus of filling super soft  although only gave 4 stars because i was going to buy one for my teenage sister but they do not have the brush names on them but if you kow which brush to use for what they are amazing</li>
            <li> I ordered these from dresslink and it only cost 9 dollars. They are not very good so I gave them to my 4yo daughter to play with. She loves them though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone else and she was very happy with the purchase?</li>
            <li> I fell in love with these brushes.  Perfect for doing make-up</li>
            <li> Brushes arent as full as i had hoped but you get what you paid for i guess</li>
            <li> Slight chemical scent when first taken out of packaging but fine after exposed to air. Brushes work fine. Great starter set!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price point. They&#x27;re very similar to the BH Cosmetics ones, the only thing is the quality control isn&#x27;t as good. One of my fennels came apart from the handle, but nothing some e6000 glue couldn&#x27;t fix. The only gripe is that the spoolie brush just wasn&#x27;t built that well. The brush roll is nice, though a little on the floppy side. I&#x27;d give it a an 8/10. If you&#x27;re a beginner who really wants a bunch of brushes for a good price, I&#x27;d say this is for you.</li>
            <li> Love them its such a comlete set and a very ship alternative.....</li>
            <li> Horrible brushes, never buying again.</li>
            <li> So far so good Loving it 😁😁😁</li>
            <li> Looks great only took about 2 days to get shipped! Im just a beginner so I Cant wait to use these babies&lt;br /&gt;Pics of my face after using these brushes will be on my IG/Snapchat: BigB00ty_NoJudy</li>
