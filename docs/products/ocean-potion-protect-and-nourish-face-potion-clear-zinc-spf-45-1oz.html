            <li>This is the best face stuff I&#x27;ve been able to find.  </li>
            <li>Knowing zinc is supposed to be good for skin and seeing that this product, at just $3, is non-codemogenic</li>
            <li>My face is surprisingly matte after applying.</li>
            <li>so it is a good test on me.  </li>
            <li>And, what&#x27;s really good is that&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t look like a ghost after you put it on.  </li>

            <li>Nice feeling to it</li>
            <li>Preservatives Associated with both acute and chronic side effects, parabens</li>
            <li>Non greasy, mild scent, excellent protection, CRUELTY FREE</li>
            <li>Having fair skin that burns easily, it helps a lot to have a sun screen as protective and reliable.  </li>
            <li>I burn very quickly and the Ocean Potion has worked really good in keeping me from that.  </li>
            <li>Great item with tremendous sun protection</li>
            <li>it blended in very easily.</li>
            <li>This provides excellent coverage and is clear.</li>
            <li>The Face Potion Clear Zinc Oxide is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a golfer and this is BY FAR the best sunscreen that does NOT evaporate.</li>
            <li>This product had great reviews and the price was right</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make you break out or clog pores which is a super plus!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Ocean Potion&#x27;s Face Potion to anyone with fair skin like myself, it does the job!</li>
            <li>i really liked that this lotion was a light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>This was about the only product I found and it is great!</li>
            <li>Okay, Sunburn sufferers, your worries are over.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>I love this Face sun screen.  </li>
            <li>That way you can tell better if you missed any areas.  </li>
            <li>Get something more mineral based.</li>
            <li>I love to body board</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I no longer use this as I have found one that is foundation and sunscreen that I like better.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but have found one I like more.  </li>
            <li>Ordered more for a friend.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get it in many stores.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different sunscreens for the face and this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>This product was rated in 2013 as safe by EWG but it has since been reformulated to include oxybenzone.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this when I need to.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my surf trips to Mexico.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how healthy it is, but it works/</li>
            <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance unlike most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I tried it out until I could order more ..</li>
            <li>Believe me, living in southern California, you need the best.</li>
            <li>The price was way better on amazon then in the Hawaii stores.</li>
            <li>I use to be able to buy this product at WalMart, but they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>I am excited that I found this, Ocean Potion ROCKS!</li>
            <li>Like their amazing sunscreen, Ocean Potion Zinc is great for those places that need the extra protection.</li>
            <li>Great price and good product, but not as light as I expected.</li>
            <li>Ocean Face Potion Sunscreen goes on easy and offers protection for your face and all its attractive parts, including your eyes, ears and nose.  </li>
            <li>Other products have made my face break out, this product is awesome!  </li>
            <li>bought this hoping it would work like \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; zinc oxide that doesn&#x27;t rub off easily and blocks almost all of the sun</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and easy to remove with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I burn easily so I needed something to help me not burn.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, absorbs quickly and does not leave the skin greasy or as if a film is on it like so many sunblock products.</li>
            <li>With a reapplication, I would probably have been fine.</li>
            <li>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 97 percent of Americans have this chemical circulating in our bodies, as it can accumulate more quickly than our bodies can get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Speaking as someone with fair, sensitive, easily burned skin, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunblocks.</li>
            <li>Face Potion Sunscreen is non-greasy, PABA free, hypo-allergic, fragrance and oil free.</li>
            <li>You’ll be amazed how smoothly it goes on and stays on.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy the summer sun and be safe.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It was light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is light and, once applied, you would never know it was there.</li>
            <li>This along with the lip potion, kept us burn free.</li>
            <li>It feels light on the face.</li>
            <li>Used this on vacation in Hawaii and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great texture and does not leave a white visible residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Octocrylene When this chemical is exposed to UV light, it absorbs the rays and produces oxygen radicals that can damage cells and cause mutations.</li>
            <li>It is good for around the eyes and upper face as it stays put better than most and doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes as much.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again when I run out (which may be a while considering how effective it&#x27;s been!)</li>
            <li>I would love if the SPF was higher.</li>
            <li>I am pretty for more than a couple years.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this.  </li>
            <li>I am sincere, and not a fake paid should-be-killed reviewer.</li>
            <li>I used this product spending 12 hours a day in the sun last summer with great success.</li>
            <li>However I did not break out at all which is particularly special for me; your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li>Not greasy!\\&quot; because I&#x27;ve never found them to be true, for any brand or type of sunblock.</li>
            <li>It did feel greasy and I felt like my skin couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; or stay cool since there was this blanket of product on my face.</li>
            <li>Has good lasting power when paddleboarding and sweating.  </li>
            <li>Good consistency and soaks in quickly with no white residue.</li>
            <li>She tried it one more time to be sure and the swelling came back.</li>
            <li>For playing sports and hiking outside, this stuff is perfect, especially if you&#x27;re like me and forget to re-apply every hour or two (although still</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.</li>
            <li>Many of them rate highly on the toxicity index.    </li>
            <li>Very lightweight, easily absorbs into skin, odorless, and truly leaves no whitish cast at all.</li>
            <li>easily and cleanly&lt;br /&gt;Dries fast, soaks in fast&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great- not sticky, rubs in well, and lasts quite a few hours.  </li>
            <li>We belong to Amazon Prime so shipping was free and fast.</li>
            <li>i know most people like clear</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin under my eyes and on the top of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it goes on clear -</li>
            <li>Once the ingredient has been absorbed, homosalate accumulates in our bodies faster than we can get rid of it, becomes toxic and disrupts our hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is readily absorbed by your skin and may accumulate within your body in measurable amounts.</li>
            <li>Right size for travel in purse.</li>
            <li>Its small and lightweight, which makes it a great choice when hiking.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective, nonirritating facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and clear.  </li>
            <li>It fells light and it never runs into and burns my eyes like most other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, cost-effective product!   </li>
            <li>It stays on all day, even when its really hot</li>
            <li>I thought this stuff was okay until we spent a full day at the beach.</li>
            <li>This stuff really sticks!</li>
            <li>Without that, the Potion Clear Zinc does not apply as smoothly and for me ends up looking pasty and way too shiny.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>white residue on my shirt collar either :)</li>
            <li>Really like this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and lasted the entire day of fishing.</li>
            <li>on so easy and does not look cakey or white.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>So I bought a large quantity through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>For the amount you get, this stuff is very overpriced.</li>
            <li>(it was also the only zinc oxide product available at the store where I was).</li>
            <li>This product does NOT tell you how much is in it......</li>
            <li>I found this product very helpful with going out in the sun.</li>
            <li>I discovered Face Potion many years ago in Hawaii and ordered it through Amazon when I ran out of my carefully rationed container.  </li>
            <li>kept my kids skin from any sunburn on a really sunny day after 5 hours of skiing.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, as well.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it absorbed into their skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only detraction for me is that the container doesn&#x27;t lend itself to be carried by men (dang jar won&#x27;t fit in the pocket).  </li>
            <li>Even after swimming for over an hour, I could still feel that it was present on my face, but again, was comfortable and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>It really works and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes when you sweat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is also very affordable for me.</li>
            <li>Lastly when rubbing it in it dissolves nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue that never seems to go away.</li>
            <li>Goes on like an expensive cream &amp; not at all greasy, perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Octinoxate One of the most common ingredients found in sunscreens with SPF, octinoxate is readily absorbed by our skin and helps other ingredients to be absorbed more readily.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and loved it, but I could no longer get it where I live.  </li>
            <li>If you drive a lot you should look to see if one side of your face is getting some more sun exposure then the other</li>
            <li>I love Ocean Potions other products.  </li>
            <li>works very well and is pretty clear</li>
            <li>, the most important part is that I can do my two hour long run, (or any other outdoor activity), sweat up a storm, and know at the end my face won&#x27;t be burned.</li>
            <li>Face is more of a cream than the average sunscreen lotion.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this didn&#x27;t feel greasy or weird in any way, and went on my face smoothly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you use this product to prevent sunburning your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many different kinds of sunscreen for faces and most of them dry out my skin so much that I have dry red patches.  </li>
            <li>Use it on my dogs nose where she has a pink spot (vet reccomended) and it goes on smoothly and stays on while she bathes in the sun</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for quality sunscreen at a great price you can&#x27;t go wrong with Face.</li>
            <li>I definitley don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who wants a clear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I live in San Diego, California.  </li>
            <li>I was really careful to apply with clean hands, not touch my face during the day, and wash it off once I was inside.</li>
            <li>We were in the sun on Lake Powell for seven days and my children never had sunburnt faces nor complained of stinging or burning the whole week, which we often get with many days in the sun.</li>
            <li>My kids also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>First application Mid-</li>
            <li>it more expensive, but totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Putting on most sunscreens will actually cause a sensation similar to a sunburn before I even go outside.</li>
            <li>It is white when first applied but turns clear in no time.</li>
            <li>Safe and long-lasting, leaves a slight but detectable white tint to the face, which fades in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>As an ingredient in sunscreen, it&#x27;s function is to improve the product&#x27;s performance against the aging effects of UV exposure, However, certain forms of vitamin A found in sun protection products—namely retinyl palmitate, a combination of retinol (vitamin A) and palmitic acid, an ingredient found in tropical plants such as palm and coconut—can be cause for concern.</li>
            <li>say it&#x27;s ever burned my skin or eyes, which is a definite plus over many of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried too that sting if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I have been using Ocean Potion Clear Zinc SPF 45</li>
            <li>and it goes on perfectly clear.</li>
            <li>Goes on evenly and is definitely clear.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and with out any perfumes.</li>
            <li>Does the job, it&#x27;s zinc but in clear form.  </li>
            <li>In fact, FDA studies have shown that retinyl palimitate may speed the development of malignant cells and skin tumors when applied to skin before sun exposure, so steer clear of skin sun products that harbor the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This zinc lotion goes on clear</li>
            <li>rubs on clear and works well .</li>
            <li>With increasingly sensitive skin and occasional rosacea flare-ups, I&#x27;m beginning to be more careful about the care of my skin, especially in the sun.  </li>
            <li>The amount of zinc oxide directly relates to the products effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Ocean Potion’s Face Potion Sunscreen reduces the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by over exposure to the sun.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any burning and I was in direct sunlight all day.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any eye watering when sweat got into my eyes either--and I went for long sweaty walks in the hot Caribbean sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A finger scoop was enough to cover my whole face and keep me protected from the summer sun.</li>
            <li>Protects your face naturally.</li>
            <li>works well with sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>if I apply it anywhere near my eye</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;ve yet to get burned while using it.</li>
            <li>small tub makes it easy to take it around wherever I go</li>
            <li>It observes quick, but has one major downside, I noticed that it makes my face extremely sweaty.</li>
            <li>All the benefits of zinc without the classic lifeguard white nose.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use a little of the product for the full effect!</li>
            <li>When oxybenzone is absorbed by your skin, it can cause an eczema-like allergic reaction that can spread beyond the exposed area and last long after you&#x27;re out of the sun.</li>
            <li>Apparently Ocean Potion has changed its formula because now it is no longer clear.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a face sunscreen 40 SPF (or higher) with zinc, as my face is extremely sensitive to sun due to medication I take.</li>
            <li>happen to find another (mineral based formula) &amp;#34;ThinkBaby&amp;#34; brand, which is broad spectrum</li>
            <li>We live in hot Arizona all year and we use this everyday.</li>
            <li>It is white in the tub but goes on clear.</li>
            <li>Goes on white, turns clear when you rub it in.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise the container was almost empty.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no reaction to the product and simply scrubbing my face with water got it off pretty well</li>
            <li>(though while I was at the National Whitewater Center it stayed on pretty solid!)</li>
            <li>There is also a false bottom to the container to give you the illusion that you&#x27;re getting more for your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a solid physical block for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use as much most other sunscreens as just a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;ve found is that most so called zinc based sunblocks actually have a small percentage of zinc oxide and instead use other chemicals for their sunblock properties.    </li>
            <li>so you only get half as much as what you see on the outside.</li>
            <li>It’s like adding a new layer of skin to your face and other effected body parts.</li>

            <li> Great great</li>
            <li> I wear it for tennis and find it stays on even when sweaty and protects very nicely.  </li>
            <li> they are great and water proof ...leave it on your skin for 20 minutes before going in water or sun :o)</li>
            <li> This is the best face stuff I&#x27;ve been able to find.  </li>
            <li> Knowing zinc is supposed to be good for skin and seeing that this product, at just $3, is non-codemogenic</li>
            <li> My face is surprisingly matte after applying.</li>
            <li> so it is a good test on me.  </li>
            <li> And, what&#x27;s really good is that&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t look like a ghost after you put it on.  </li>

            <li> Lasts at the beach! and does not sting the eyes at all, and has a great texture goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is a cream that smooths on nicely and doesn&#x27;t show at all.  </li>
            <li> Nice feeling to it</li>
            <li> Preservatives Associated with both acute and chronic side effects, parabens</li>
            <li> Non greasy, mild scent, excellent protection, CRUELTY FREE</li>
            <li> Having fair skin that burns easily, it helps a lot to have a sun screen as protective and reliable.  </li>
            <li> I burn very quickly and the Ocean Potion has worked really good in keeping me from that.  </li>
            <li> Great item with tremendous sun protection</li>
            <li> it blended in very easily.</li>
            <li> This provides excellent coverage and is clear.</li>
            <li> The Face Potion Clear Zinc Oxide is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a golfer and this is BY FAR the best sunscreen that does NOT evaporate.</li>
            <li> This product had great reviews and the price was right</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make you break out or clog pores which is a super plus!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Ocean Potion&#x27;s Face Potion to anyone with fair skin like myself, it does the job!</li>
            <li> i really liked that this lotion was a light and non greasy.</li>
            <li> This was about the only product I found and it is great!</li>
            <li> Okay, Sunburn sufferers, your worries are over.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I love this Face sun screen.  </li>
            <li> That way you can tell better if you missed any areas.  </li>
            <li> Get something more mineral based.</li>
            <li> I love to body board</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I no longer use this as I have found one that is foundation and sunscreen that I like better.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but have found one I like more.  </li>
            <li> Ordered more for a friend.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get it in many stores.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different sunscreens for the face and this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> This product was rated in 2013 as safe by EWG but it has since been reformulated to include oxybenzone.</li>
            <li> I will buy more of this when I need to.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my surf trips to Mexico.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how healthy it is, but it works/</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance unlike most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I tried it out until I could order more ..</li>
            <li> Believe me, living in southern California, you need the best.</li>
            <li> The price was way better on amazon then in the Hawaii stores.</li>
            <li> I use to be able to buy this product at WalMart, but they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li> I am excited that I found this, Ocean Potion ROCKS!</li>
            <li> Like their amazing sunscreen, Ocean Potion Zinc is great for those places that need the extra protection.</li>
            <li> Great price and good product, but not as light as I expected.</li>
            <li> Ocean Face Potion Sunscreen goes on easy and offers protection for your face and all its attractive parts, including your eyes, ears and nose.  </li>
            <li> Other products have made my face break out, this product is awesome!  </li>
            <li> bought this hoping it would work like \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; zinc oxide that doesn&#x27;t rub off easily and blocks almost all of the sun</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and easy to remove with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I burn easily so I needed something to help me not burn.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, absorbs quickly and does not leave the skin greasy or as if a film is on it like so many sunblock products.</li>
            <li> With a reapplication, I would probably have been fine.</li>
            <li> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 97 percent of Americans have this chemical circulating in our bodies, as it can accumulate more quickly than our bodies can get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Speaking as someone with fair, sensitive, easily burned skin, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunblocks.</li>
            <li> Face Potion Sunscreen is non-greasy, PABA free, hypo-allergic, fragrance and oil free.</li>
            <li> You’ll be amazed how smoothly it goes on and stays on.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy the summer sun and be safe.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It was light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is light and, once applied, you would never know it was there.</li>
            <li> This along with the lip potion, kept us burn free.</li>
            <li> It feels light on the face.</li>
            <li> Used this on vacation in Hawaii and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great texture and does not leave a white visible residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Octocrylene When this chemical is exposed to UV light, it absorbs the rays and produces oxygen radicals that can damage cells and cause mutations.</li>
            <li> It is good for around the eyes and upper face as it stays put better than most and doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes as much.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again when I run out (which may be a while considering how effective it&#x27;s been!)</li>
            <li> I would love if the SPF was higher.</li>
            <li> I am pretty for more than a couple years.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this.  </li>
            <li> I am sincere, and not a fake paid should-be-killed reviewer.</li>
            <li> I used this product spending 12 hours a day in the sun last summer with great success.</li>
            <li> However I did not break out at all which is particularly special for me; your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Not greasy!\\&quot; because I&#x27;ve never found them to be true, for any brand or type of sunblock.</li>
            <li> It did feel greasy and I felt like my skin couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; or stay cool since there was this blanket of product on my face.</li>
            <li> Has good lasting power when paddleboarding and sweating.  </li>
            <li> Good consistency and soaks in quickly with no white residue.</li>
            <li> She tried it one more time to be sure and the swelling came back.</li>
            <li> For playing sports and hiking outside, this stuff is perfect, especially if you&#x27;re like me and forget to re-apply every hour or two (although still</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Many of them rate highly on the toxicity index.    </li>
            <li> Very lightweight, easily absorbs into skin, odorless, and truly leaves no whitish cast at all.</li>
            <li> easily and cleanly&lt;br /&gt;Dries fast, soaks in fast&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great- not sticky, rubs in well, and lasts quite a few hours.  </li>
            <li> We belong to Amazon Prime so shipping was free and fast.</li>
            <li> i know most people like clear</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin under my eyes and on the top of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it goes on clear -</li>
            <li> Once the ingredient has been absorbed, homosalate accumulates in our bodies faster than we can get rid of it, becomes toxic and disrupts our hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is readily absorbed by your skin and may accumulate within your body in measurable amounts.</li>
            <li> Right size for travel in purse.</li>
            <li> Its small and lightweight, which makes it a great choice when hiking.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective, nonirritating facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and clear.  </li>
            <li> It fells light and it never runs into and burns my eyes like most other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, cost-effective product!   </li>
            <li> It stays on all day, even when its really hot</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff was okay until we spent a full day at the beach.</li>
            <li> This stuff really sticks!</li>
            <li> Without that, the Potion Clear Zinc does not apply as smoothly and for me ends up looking pasty and way too shiny.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> white residue on my shirt collar either :)</li>
            <li> Really like this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and lasted the entire day of fishing.</li>
            <li> on so easy and does not look cakey or white.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> So I bought a large quantity through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> For the amount you get, this stuff is very overpriced.</li>
            <li> (it was also the only zinc oxide product available at the store where I was).</li>
            <li> This product does NOT tell you how much is in it......</li>
            <li> I found this product very helpful with going out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I discovered Face Potion many years ago in Hawaii and ordered it through Amazon when I ran out of my carefully rationed container.  </li>
            <li> kept my kids skin from any sunburn on a really sunny day after 5 hours of skiing.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, as well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it absorbed into their skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only detraction for me is that the container doesn&#x27;t lend itself to be carried by men (dang jar won&#x27;t fit in the pocket).  </li>
            <li> Even after swimming for over an hour, I could still feel that it was present on my face, but again, was comfortable and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> It really works and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes when you sweat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is also very affordable for me.</li>
            <li> Lastly when rubbing it in it dissolves nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue that never seems to go away.</li>
            <li> Goes on like an expensive cream &amp; not at all greasy, perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Octinoxate One of the most common ingredients found in sunscreens with SPF, octinoxate is readily absorbed by our skin and helps other ingredients to be absorbed more readily.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it, but I could no longer get it where I live.  </li>
            <li> If you drive a lot you should look to see if one side of your face is getting some more sun exposure then the other</li>
            <li> I love Ocean Potions other products.  </li>
            <li> works very well and is pretty clear</li>
            <li> , the most important part is that I can do my two hour long run, (or any other outdoor activity), sweat up a storm, and know at the end my face won&#x27;t be burned.</li>
            <li> Face is more of a cream than the average sunscreen lotion.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this didn&#x27;t feel greasy or weird in any way, and went on my face smoothly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you use this product to prevent sunburning your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many different kinds of sunscreen for faces and most of them dry out my skin so much that I have dry red patches.  </li>
            <li> Use it on my dogs nose where she has a pink spot (vet reccomended) and it goes on smoothly and stays on while she bathes in the sun</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for quality sunscreen at a great price you can&#x27;t go wrong with Face.</li>
            <li> I definitley don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who wants a clear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I live in San Diego, California.  </li>
            <li> I was really careful to apply with clean hands, not touch my face during the day, and wash it off once I was inside.</li>
            <li> We were in the sun on Lake Powell for seven days and my children never had sunburnt faces nor complained of stinging or burning the whole week, which we often get with many days in the sun.</li>
            <li> My kids also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> First application Mid-</li>
            <li> it more expensive, but totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Putting on most sunscreens will actually cause a sensation similar to a sunburn before I even go outside.</li>
            <li> It is white when first applied but turns clear in no time.</li>
            <li> Safe and long-lasting, leaves a slight but detectable white tint to the face, which fades in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> As an ingredient in sunscreen, it&#x27;s function is to improve the product&#x27;s performance against the aging effects of UV exposure, However, certain forms of vitamin A found in sun protection products—namely retinyl palmitate, a combination of retinol (vitamin A) and palmitic acid, an ingredient found in tropical plants such as palm and coconut—can be cause for concern.</li>
            <li> say it&#x27;s ever burned my skin or eyes, which is a definite plus over many of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried too that sting if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ocean Potion Clear Zinc SPF 45</li>
            <li> and it goes on perfectly clear.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and is definitely clear.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear and with out any perfumes.</li>
            <li> Does the job, it&#x27;s zinc but in clear form.  </li>
            <li> In fact, FDA studies have shown that retinyl palimitate may speed the development of malignant cells and skin tumors when applied to skin before sun exposure, so steer clear of skin sun products that harbor the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This zinc lotion goes on clear</li>
            <li> rubs on clear and works well .</li>
            <li> With increasingly sensitive skin and occasional rosacea flare-ups, I&#x27;m beginning to be more careful about the care of my skin, especially in the sun.  </li>
            <li> The amount of zinc oxide directly relates to the products effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Ocean Potion’s Face Potion Sunscreen reduces the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by over exposure to the sun.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any burning and I was in direct sunlight all day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any eye watering when sweat got into my eyes either--and I went for long sweaty walks in the hot Caribbean sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A finger scoop was enough to cover my whole face and keep me protected from the summer sun.</li>

            <li> works well with sensitive skin as well.</li>

            <li> so far I&#x27;ve yet to get burned while using it.</li>
            <li> small tub makes it easy to take it around wherever I go</li>
            <li> It observes quick, but has one major downside, I noticed that it makes my face extremely sweaty.</li>
            <li> All the benefits of zinc without the classic lifeguard white nose.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a little of the product for the full effect!</li>
            <li> When oxybenzone is absorbed by your skin, it can cause an eczema-like allergic reaction that can spread beyond the exposed area and last long after you&#x27;re out of the sun.</li>
            <li> Apparently Ocean Potion has changed its formula because now it is no longer clear.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a face sunscreen 40 SPF (or higher) with zinc, as my face is extremely sensitive to sun due to medication I take.</li>
            <li> happen to find another (mineral based formula) &amp;#34;ThinkBaby&amp;#34; brand, which is broad spectrum</li>
            <li> We live in hot Arizona all year and we use this everyday.</li>
            <li> It is white in the tub but goes on clear.</li>
            <li> Goes on white, turns clear when you rub it in.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise the container was almost empty.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no reaction to the product and simply scrubbing my face with water got it off pretty well</li>
            <li> (though while I was at the National Whitewater Center it stayed on pretty solid!)</li>
            <li> There is also a false bottom to the container to give you the illusion that you&#x27;re getting more for your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a solid physical block for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use as much most other sunscreens as just a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve found is that most so called zinc based sunblocks actually have a small percentage of zinc oxide and instead use other chemicals for their sunblock properties.    </li>
            <li> so you only get half as much as what you see on the outside.</li>
            <li> It’s like adding a new layer of skin to your face and other effected body parts.</li>
            <li> I found that it&#x27;s basically regular sunscreen: no better, no worse, but much more expensive.</li>
            <li> It’s simple,  just visit your local Drug Store, Supermarket or other retail venue and buy, Ocean Potion’s Face Potion Sunscreen, 45 Broad Spectrum SPF-45.  </li>
            <li> This is a small jar, and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> no trouble whatsoever; spent 2-3 hours in the midday sun swimming, and got only slightly pink.</li>
            <li> However, I was surprised to hit the bottom of the jar about 1/2 way down.</li>
            <li> In fact I bought 2 lip balms, and a DAB container(a instant dry liquid for the face</li>
            <li> I tried other brands, such as the CVS brand, but only this one works.  </li>
            <li> HAS DANGEROUS INGREDIENTS THAT ARE IN MANY SCREENS:</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you look white like other zinc oxide products.</li>
            <li> On dry skin, they didn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> As a minority we often forget to use sun screen and just a little bit of this a day does wonders to my overall complexion.</li>
            <li> So Far this is the lightest, least visible sunbolock (must contain zinc oxide or titanium) that I have used.</li>
            <li> We bought via Amazon when we spent 2 months in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t look white on your skin or make me look pale.</li>
            <li> When exposed to the sun&#x27;s UV rays, retinol compounds break down and produce destructive free radicals that are toxic to cells, damage DNA, and may lead to cancer.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It will help you avoid sunburn, if used as directed with other sun protection measures.  </li>
            <li> My son used to get sunburn under his eyes from rubbing off the other brands when he came up out of the water.  </li>
            <li> greasy-- doesn&#x27;t make my face look like an oil slick when I use the proper amount</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oxybenzone This penetration enhancer (i.e., chemical that helps other chemicals penetrate the skin) undergoes a chemical reaction when exposed to UV rays.</li>
            <li> We spent weeks out in the Brazilian sun on vacation and didn&#x27;t get burned once!</li>
            <li> I choose this product over any other for my face moisturizer and protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> active:  </li>
            <li> While butylparaben was reported to be non-carcinogenic in rats and mice, but it has been previously suspected that parabens and other chemicals in underarm cosmetics may contribute to the rising incidence of breast cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blocks the sun - it&#x27;s a small container but is lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bike around town and this stuff doesn&#x27;t drop down my face</li>
            <li> The only negative for me is that is causes the skin around my eyes to sting a little.</li>
            <li> I break out over anything and am slightly allergic to almost everything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take forever to rub in and it doesn&#x27;t feel like typical sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a zinc sunblock on my son&#x27;s face, but I reapplied this one several times and he still burned pretty badly.</li>
            <li> There is no greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I did get a little bit of color, but there was no sun burn, and</li>
            <li> This small container usually last me at least six months, even using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Not your average sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Felt a little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Though SPF products are designed to protect skin from sun-induced aging, octinoxate may actually be a culprit for premature aging, as it produces menacing free radicals that can damage skin and cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was having trouble finding sunscreen that would not run into my eyes and burn while I was in the water.  </li>
            <li> When they were wet, they complained that it was burning.</li>
            <li> I wore this everyday for a month in 90 degree sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve been in the sun just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> My only buyer beware caution is the marketing gimmick of putting a false bottom in the container</li>
            <li> It does have a faint smell, but definitely not the pungent smell other sunscreens can have.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave or oily or dull residue but feels like my face is protected.</li>
            <li> My father even complained over the burning sensation as he had applied it to his scalp and face.</li>
            <li> While allergic reactions from octinoxate aren&#x27;t common, hormone disruption is: the chemical&#x27;s effects on estrogen can be harmful for humans and wildlife, too, should they come into contact with the chemical once it gets into water.</li>
            <li> Having this unpleasant experience, I decided to look for zinc oxide for facial sunblocking.  </li>
            <li> After a BAD sunburn last year that blistered across my nose, I wasn&#x27;t taking any chances.  </li>
            <li> One of my children even was crying that it was painful.</li>
            <li> The zinc is recommended by dermatologist, but it is difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this product as I am unable to find a list of ingredients on this nor the companies web site.    </li>

    <ol>
            <li> i really liked that this lotion was a light and non greasy. it blended in very easily. kept my face from burning in Mexico!</li>
            <li> It blocks the sun - it&#x27;s a small container but is lasts a long time. I put it under my Zinka nose coat.</li>
            <li> For those of you looking for a physical sunscreen, this is not it. Here are the ingredients, which should be listed here (in order of appearance). Many of them rate highly on the toxicity index.    active:  octinoxate, octocrylene, octisalate, oxybenzone, zinc oxide    inactive:  deionized water, propylene glycol, cetearyl &amp; stearyl alcohol, sorbitan stearate &amp; sucrose cocoate, acrylates copolymer, dimethicone &amp; c12-15, alkyl bezoate, xanthan gum, methyl paraben, propyl parabeb, diazolydinyl urea</li>
            <li> Gentle, cost-effective product!   With increasingly sensitive skin and occasional rosacea flare-ups, I&#x27;m beginning to be more careful about the care of my skin, especially in the sun.  I had previously hated applying sunscreens for face- they always felt oily or sticky, and made me fearful of a break-out.    After a BAD sunburn last year that blistered across my nose, I wasn&#x27;t taking any chances.  Knowing zinc is supposed to be good for skin and seeing that this product, at just $3, is non-codemogenic, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot while vacationing in FL.  First application Mid-May- no trouble whatsoever; spent about 2 hours in the midday sun, and the only color I got was a gradual tan- no redness! No breakouts afterward, either. Period.  Second application End-of-May- no trouble whatsoever; spent 2-3 hours in the midday sun swimming, and got only slightly pink. With a reapplication, I would probably have been fine. No breakout. Period.  Use in confidence! Only reason I gave it 4 stars is for parabens.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of sunblock, especially on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never ever believed the claims \\&quot;absorbs instantly! Not greasy!\\&quot; because I&#x27;ve never found them to be true, for any brand or type of sunblock. Applied to my face even the sheerest formulas leave me looking like a mirror ball.&lt;br /&gt;However, after using this one... I will believe. There is no greasy mess. My face is not shiny. My face is surprisingly matte after applying. Which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;But, the most important part is that I can do my two hour long run, (or any other outdoor activity), sweat up a storm, and know at the end my face won&#x27;t be burned.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors and in the sun. I&#x27;ve tried many sun screens in my time and I must say this is one of my favorites! It stays on all day, even when its really hot and I&#x27;m sweating, the Ocean Potion Face Potion stays on and does it job. Its small and lightweight, which makes it a great choice when hiking. After an entire day out, I came home and was not sun burned at all. I did get a little bit of color, but there was no sun burn, and no skin peeling what so ever a couple days later. Its as if I wasn&#x27;t out in the sun at all. I highly recommend Ocean Potion&#x27;s Face Potion to anyone with fair skin like myself, it does the job!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! Would have given 5 stars, however, this one expires sooner than a year.</li>
            <li> I have used a dozen or so jars of this product.  It is good for around the eyes and upper face as it stays put better than most and doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes as much.  But, Ama price is steep at 5 bucks.  $1.97 at WM, $2.97 at Tar. Same packaging and size.</li>
            <li> For the amount you get, this stuff is very overpriced. There is also a false bottom to the container to give you the illusion that you&#x27;re getting more for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this hoping it would work like \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; zinc oxide that doesn&#x27;t rub off easily and blocks almost all of the sun (it was also the only zinc oxide product available at the store where I was). I found that it&#x27;s basically regular sunscreen: no better, no worse, but much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a face sunscreen 40 SPF (or higher) with zinc, as my face is extremely sensitive to sun due to medication I take. This product had great reviews and the price was right so I decided to give it a try. It observes quick, but has one major downside, I noticed that it makes my face extremely sweaty. It also contains just 7% Zink Oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to find another (mineral based formula) &amp;#34;ThinkBaby&amp;#34; brand, which is broad spectrum 50 SPF and it contains 20% zinc! it more expensive, but totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> I recently was diagnosed with skin cancer on my lip and had to have it removed.  Having this unpleasant experience, I decided to look for zinc oxide for facial sunblocking.  This was about the only product I found and it is great! In fact I bought 2 lip balms, and a DAB container(a instant dry liquid for the face and mouth)and of course the cream ocean potion.  It goes on easily, absorbs quickly and does not leave the skin greasy or as if a film is on it like so many sunblock products. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a great product!</li>
            <li> The amount of zinc oxide directly relates to the products effectiveness. 5% is minimum....This product does NOT tell you how much is in it......Won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen on my children&#x27;s faces and necks this summer.  They did not get burned, especially helpful for the tender skin below the eyes and on the nose.  It&#x27;s great- not sticky, rubs in well, and lasts quite a few hours.  I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best sunscreens for your face. It doesn&#x27;t leave or oily or dull residue but feels like my face is protected. As a minority we often forget to use sun screen and just a little bit of this a day does wonders to my overall complexion. This small container usually last me at least six months, even using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Every lotion and soap I try to use that isn&#x27;t 100% glycerin causes my face to turn red and peel.  When shopping for sunblock for my face a coworker recommended this, I tried it, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Absolutely no reaction to the product and simply scrubbing my face with water got it off pretty well (though while I was at the National Whitewater Center it stayed on pretty solid!)</li>
            <li> Okay, Sunburn sufferers, your worries are over.  You ask how the pain and agony of being fried by the Sun will be ended.

            <li> My wife used this product several times over the summer and always had swelling of her lips after use. We thought it was something else but the swelling came back every time she used the product. She stopped and the problem went away. She tried it one more time to be sure and the swelling came back. Be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Rubs in well and not greasy!</li>
            <li> I break out over anything and am slightly allergic to almost everything. I used this one time when I knew I was going to be outside all day. It did feel greasy and I felt like my skin couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; or stay cool since there was this blanket of product on my face. However I did not break out at all which is particularly special for me; your mileage may vary. I was really careful to apply with clean hands, not touch my face during the day, and wash it off once I was inside. It is white in the tub but goes on clear. If you drive a lot you should look to see if one side of your face is getting some more sun exposure then the other and then maybe this product is for you. symmetry is beauty.</li>
            <li> I found this product very helpful with going out in the sun. It was light and not greasy. I didn&#x27;t experience any burning and I was in direct sunlight all day.</li>
            <li> I discovered Face Potion many years ago in Hawaii and ordered it through Amazon when I ran out of my carefully rationed container.  It is just perfect.  I wear it for tennis and find it stays on even when sweaty and protects very nicely.  I am very fair skinned so it is a good test on me.  I gave it to everyone one Christmas for stocking stuffers.  It is a cream that smooths on nicely and doesn&#x27;t show at all.  It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy at all.  I have used it for swimming as well and I have not had any burns while wearing it.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best face sunscreen I have ever used.  I have used many different kinds of sunscreen for faces and most of them dry out my skin so much that I have dry red patches.  Even sunscreen for kids doesn&#x27;t work.  After wearing this every day for two weeks I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  No break-outs, no chapping.  And, what&#x27;s really good is that&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t look like a ghost after you put it on.  And, you don&#x27;t have to rub and rub to make it disappear.  I didn&#x27;t have any eye watering when sweat got into my eyes either--and I went for long sweaty walks in the hot Caribbean sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain that it tastes terrible on their lips.  This isn&#x27;t for lips.  If you need to protect your lips use a lipstick or lip balm with sunscreen it it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, for kids, I would find something specifically for kids.</li>
            <li> This stuff is light and, once applied, you would never know it was there. Plus, it works perfectly. My face has never burned while using this sunblock.</li>
            <li> Use it on my dogs nose where she has a pink spot (vet reccomended) and it goes on smoothly and stays on while she bathes in the sun</li>
            <li> This provides excellent coverage and is clear. (If only this were around in my youth when my mom slathered my nose with white zinc oxide!) This is a small jar, and you don&#x27;t need much. However, I was surprised to hit the bottom of the jar about 1/2 way down. But it works well. So I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> The only sunscreen my kids and husband will use! Truly prevents sun exposure in tropical climates and doesn&#x27;t sting at all!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be in the sun, as I will break out! This is the only thing that I have found that stay&#x27;s on all day and protects my face 100%.. Will always buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this Face sun screen.  It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Not your average sunscreen! Face is more of a cream than the average sunscreen lotion. I didn&#x27;t have to use as much most other sunscreens as just a little goes a long way! A finger scoop was enough to cover my whole face and keep me protected from the summer sun. For playing sports and hiking outside, this stuff is perfect, especially if you&#x27;re like me and forget to re-apply every hour or two (although still recommended).&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s ever burned my skin or eyes, which is a definite plus over many of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried too that sting if you&#x27;re not careful. It does have a faint smell, but definitely not the pungent smell other sunscreens can have. Lastly when rubbing it in it dissolves nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue that never seems to go away. Just spread it and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for this to get you bronzed in a day you might want to look elsewhere. But if you&#x27;re looking for quality sunscreen at a great price you can&#x27;t go wrong with Face. Would definitely buy again when I run out (which may be a while considering how effective it&#x27;s been!)</li>
            <li> i know most people like clear but I like white.  That way you can tell better if you missed any areas.  Right size for travel in purse.</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff was okay until we spent a full day at the beach. My fair-skinned son was in and out of the water, but I reapplied several times. He still got burned. Get something more mineral based.</li>
            <li> I live in San Diego, California.  I love to body board and I was having trouble finding sunscreen that would not run into my eyes and burn while I was in the water.  This stuff is fantastic!  It goes on easy and clear.  It fells light and it never runs into and burns my eyes like most other sunscreens.  I am excited that I found this, Ocean Potion ROCKS!</li>
            <li> I no longer use this as I have found one that is foundation and sunscreen that I like better.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s the best face sun lotion I&#x27;ve used in a while.&lt;br /&gt;The product applies evenly and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue. Definitely recommend this products to friends, especially those with kids!</li>
            <li> This along with the lip potion, kept us burn free. Easy to apply and lasted the entire day of fishing. I&#x27;ll keep this in my fishing bag for future trips.</li>
            <li> Blends into skin and doesnt turn ur face ghostly white. kept my kids skin from any sunburn on a really sunny day after 5 hours of skiing.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but have found one I like more.  The zinc is recommended by dermatologist, but it is difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, easily absorbs into skin, odorless, and truly leaves no whitish cast at all.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I had been purchasing it at Walmart, but haven&#x27;t seen it there in a while. It provides good protection from the sun without feeling oily. Reasonably priced, as well.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it was delivered on time at a good price. Ordered more for a friend.</li>
            <li> The Face Potion Clear Zinc Oxide is an excellent product.  The cream goes on your face and protected my face from sunburn.  Zinc Oxide SPF 45 is one of the best sunscreen potions that protects your face from sunburn.  I highly recommend that you use this product to prevent sunburning your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M.D. Florida</li>
            <li> This is the best face stuff I&#x27;ve been able to find.  You can&#x27;t get it in many stores.  My son used to get sunburn under his eyes from rubbing off the other brands when he came up out of the water.  This stuff really sticks!</li>
            <li> it is good and goes on nicely. I would love if the SPF was higher.</li>
            <li> My daughter and her friend applied this product to their faces prior to going to the sprayground (a playground with water fountains for kids to run through).  I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it absorbed into their skin.  It wasn&#x27;t greasy nor did it leave a chalky film!  That was great.  It was also odorless and didn&#x27;t burn their eyes-big plus.  I would certainly recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective, nonirritating facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and performs perfectly</li>
            <li> Needing a stronger sunscreen for my children&#x27;s face, I purchased this product. On dry skin, they didn&#x27;t mind it. When they were wet, they complained that it was burning. One of my children even was crying that it was painful. My father even complained over the burning sensation as he had applied it to his scalp and face. Wish it would&#x27;ve worked, but my family had a terrible experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The burning seemed to occur after they got in the pool.</li>
            <li> Great product!  All the benefits of zinc without the classic lifeguard white nose.  No sunburnt noses for my family during our vacation.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ocean Potion Clear Zinc SPF 45 I am pretty for more than a couple years.  Sometimes I buy on Amazon, sometimes at my local drugstore.  Having fair skin that burns easily, it helps a lot to have a sun screen as protective and reliable.  I use with a daytime moisturizer.  Without that, the Potion Clear Zinc does not apply as smoothly and for me ends up looking pasty and way too shiny.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it, but I could no longer get it where I live.  So I bought a large quantity through Amazon.  Apparently Ocean Potion has changed its formula because now it is no longer clear.  It is very white just like regular zinc oxide.  I am stuck with a bunch of facial sunscreen that I don&#x27;t want to use.  I definitley don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who wants a clear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. We were in the sun on Lake Powell for seven days and my children never had sunburnt faces nor complained of stinging or burning the whole week, which we often get with many days in the sun. My kids also have very sensitive skin and this was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on so easy and does not look cakey or white.</li>
            <li> great protection, not too greasy</li>
            <li> Nice feeling to it and it goes on perfectly clear.</li>
            <li> Good all around face cream.  Lasts at the beach! and does not sting the eyes at all, and has a great texture goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, mild scent, excellent protection, CRUELTY FREE</li>
            <li> always use ocean potion products..they are great and water proof ...leave it on your skin for 20 minutes before going in water or sun :o)</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen for my face!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Like their amazing sunscreen, Ocean Potion Zinc is great for those places that need the extra protection. I use mine on my nose.</li>
            <li> Love it! Face is not left feeling greasy . It feels light on the face. I have tried many different sunscreens for the face and this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> This product was rated in 2013 as safe by EWG but it has since been reformulated to include oxybenzone.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and easy to remove with soap and water.  Does not build up a waxy film like spray on sunscreen.  Does not burn eyes or nose like spray on sunscreen.  Does not pile when rubbed with continuous contact like spray on sunscreen.  I use spray on sunscreen for my body.  But this is what I use for my face.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and is definitely clear.  I burn very quickly and the Ocean Potion has worked really good in keeping me from that.  It&#x27;s only detraction for me is that the container doesn&#x27;t lend itself to be carried by men (dang jar won&#x27;t fit in the pocket).  I will buy more of this when I need to.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin under my eyes and on the top of my cheeks. Putting on most sunscreens will actually cause a sensation similar to a sunburn before I even go outside. Ocean potion doesn&#x27;t react with my skin and keeps me protected when I work outside. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis.  This stuff keeps it away.  I tried other brands, such as the CVS brand, but only this one works.  I put it on face and neck when I go biking.  When it dries, its invisible, but remains for hours providing protetion.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. We live in hot Arizona all year and we use this everyday. Good consistency and soaks in quickly with no white residue.</li>
            <li> Great item with tremendous sun protection</li>
            <li> This product is great for blocking the sun.  It goes on clear and with out any perfumes. excellent way to protect skin and enjoy the out doors.</li>
            <li> I surf, skate, bike ride, etc...&lt;br /&gt;I sweat A LOT as well and this stuff works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take forever to rub in and it doesn&#x27;t feel like typical sunscreen.  Love this stuff for my surf trips to Mexico.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically to use on my lips.  I&#x27;m one of the people who is ALWAYS putting on lip balm.  I have a tube with me at all times.  All the kinds with sun protection that I&#x27;ve tried have always caused my lips to feel like they&#x27;re burning.  I was so excited to find this.  I love Ocean Potions other products.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but this tastes so terrible bitter to me ( I must be a lip-licker) that I can&#x27;t stand to wear it.  How disappointing</li>
            <li> Safe and long-lasting, leaves a slight but detectable white tint to the face, which fades in about 30 minutes. I don&#x27;t leave home without it!without it</li>
            <li> I love this product because it goes on clear - and it works! Definitely appears to be keeping the sun off. I like that it doesn&#x27;t look white on your skin or make me look pale.</li>
            <li> I wore this everyday for a month in 90 degree sun. Forgot it one day and was burnt for a week. I don&#x27;t know how healthy it is, but it works/</li>
            <li> Great price and good product, but not as light as I expected. Felt a little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Betty</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this sunscreen, it&#x27;s like whipped butter! Goes on like an expensive cream &amp; not at all greasy, perfect for sensitive skin. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance unlike most sunscreens. It also kept me well protected from the sun, after all day in the sun, no burning whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Protects your face naturally. Used this on vacation in Hawaii and it was fantastic. Prevented sunburn, didn&#x27;t burn eyes, and didn&#x27;t cause our faces to breakout.</li>
            <li> Does the job, it&#x27;s zinc but in clear form.  works well with sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this product as I am unable to find a list of ingredients on this nor the companies web site.    One thing I&#x27;ve found is that most so called zinc based sunblocks actually have a small percentage of zinc oxide and instead use other chemicals for their sunblock properties.    I don&#x27;t buy products unless I can read the ingredients as I don&#x27;t want to get ripped off again.    stevie</li>
            <li> This did not work for our family.  I usually use a zinc sunblock on my son&#x27;s face, but I reapplied this one several times and he still burned pretty badly.</li>
            <li> Best face sunscreen cream ever</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast shipping! Thank You!</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this didn&#x27;t feel greasy or weird in any way, and went on my face smoothly. Even after swimming for over an hour, I could still feel that it was present on my face, but again, was comfortable and non-greasy. I didn&#x27;t get burned while I had it on (for several hours), so I&#x27;d say that it does everything that it says it will do. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Speaking as someone with fair, sensitive, easily burned skin, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunblocks. This has become my go-to facial sunblock for a lot of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally invisible zinc sunblock-- no white cast!&lt;br /&gt;No white residue on my shirt collar either :)&lt;br /&gt;Totally non greasy-- doesn&#x27;t make my face look like an oil slick when I use the proper amount&lt;br /&gt;Applies easily and cleanly&lt;br /&gt;Dries fast, soaks in fast&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes (a lot of facial sunblocks sting my eyes like heck if I apply it anywhere near my eye area)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t break me out&lt;br /&gt;No lingering \\&quot;sunblocky\\&quot; or \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; odor&lt;br /&gt;Relatively sweat-resistant... I bike around town and this stuff doesn&#x27;t drop down my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small tub makes it easy to take it around wherever I go so I never forget to reapply it, and (knock wood) so far I&#x27;ve yet to get burned while using it. I can&#x27;t speak for how well it works under makeup because I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy. A little goes a long way. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used Ocean Potion for years and just tried this one when I ran out and could not find the tubes of the Ocean Potion 50 .. I found this at a local store and knowing the consistancy and quality of Ocean Potion .. I tried it out until I could order more .. OMGoodness .. it worked great.</li>
            <li> Works great! Has good lasting power when paddleboarding and sweating.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea.</li>
            <li> Really like this sunscreen! No sunburn at all. Easy to apply. Great coverage. It is white when first applied but turns clear in no time. Didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. The only negative for me is that is causes the skin around my eyes to sting a little. Otherwise, great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Been using it for a while. Perfect for days at the beach or pool. You only need to use a little of the product for the full effect! Definitely would recommend to others shopping around!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find there was fragrance in this and also chemical sunscreen- I was looking for a solid physical block for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> works very well and is pretty clear</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Never got a burn on my face and it does not irritate my skin at all. Great texture and does not leave a white visible residue.</li>
            <li> I used this product spending 12 hours a day in the sun last summer with great success. I applied it to my face liberally in the morning and again at noon. It goes on great and disappears. Not oily. Never got sunburned or, for that matter, tanned. My only buyer beware caution is the marketing gimmick of putting a false bottom in the container so you only get half as much as what you see on the outside. I took it on vacation in September thinking I had plenty left. Much to my surprise the container was almost empty. I tried to stretch it by applying it sparingly once per day in the morning and got a sunburn on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for your face but the Walmart in my area carries it for $1.50 each. Doesn&#x27;t make you look white like other zinc oxide products.</li>
            <li> HAS DANGEROUS INGREDIENTS THAT ARE IN MANY SCREENS: HERE THEY ARE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 SCARY SUNSCREEN INGREDIENTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxybenzone This penetration enhancer (i.e., chemical that helps other chemicals penetrate the skin) undergoes a chemical reaction when exposed to UV rays. When oxybenzone is absorbed by your skin, it can cause an eczema-like allergic reaction that can spread beyond the exposed area and last long after you&#x27;re out of the sun. Experts also suspect that oxybenzone disrupts hormones (i.e., mimics, blocks, and alters hormone levels) which can throw off your endocrine system. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 97 percent of Americans have this chemical circulating in our bodies, as it can accumulate more quickly than our bodies can get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Octinoxate One of the most common ingredients found in sunscreens with SPF, octinoxate is readily absorbed by our skin and helps other ingredients to be absorbed more readily. While allergic reactions from octinoxate aren&#x27;t common, hormone disruption is: the chemical&#x27;s effects on estrogen can be harmful for humans and wildlife, too, should they come into contact with the chemical once it gets into water. Though SPF products are designed to protect skin from sun-induced aging, octinoxate may actually be a culprit for premature aging, as it produces menacing free radicals that can damage skin and cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate) Just like the vitamin A we eat, retinyl palmitate is an antioxidant. As an ingredient in sunscreen, it&#x27;s function is to improve the product&#x27;s performance against the aging effects of UV exposure, However, certain forms of vitamin A found in sun protection products—namely retinyl palmitate, a combination of retinol (vitamin A) and palmitic acid, an ingredient found in tropical plants such as palm and coconut—can be cause for concern. When exposed to the sun&#x27;s UV rays, retinol compounds break down and produce destructive free radicals that are toxic to cells, damage DNA, and may lead to cancer. In fact, FDA studies have shown that retinyl palimitate may speed the development of malignant cells and skin tumors when applied to skin before sun exposure, so steer clear of skin sun products that harbor the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homosalate This UV-absorbing sunscreen ingredient helps sunscreen to penetrate your skin. Once the ingredient has been absorbed, homosalate accumulates in our bodies faster than we can get rid of it, becomes toxic and disrupts our hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Octocrylene When this chemical is exposed to UV light, it absorbs the rays and produces oxygen radicals that can damage cells and cause mutations. It is readily absorbed by your skin and may accumulate within your body in measurable amounts. Plus, it can be toxic to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paraben Preservatives Associated with both acute and chronic side effects, parabens (butyl-, ethyl-, methyl-, and propyl-) can induce allergic reactions, hormone disruption, developmental and reproductive toxicity. While butylparaben was reported to be non-carcinogenic in rats and mice, but it has been previously suspected that parabens and other chemicals in underarm cosmetics may contribute to the rising incidence of breast cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY WISELY!!!!</li>
            <li> I burn easily so I needed something to help me not burn. This stuff is amazing. It doesnt run into your eyes and keeps my skin from burning. I wore it every day at Disney world and did not get burned at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a golfer and this is BY FAR the best sunscreen that does NOT evaporate. Put it on your face in the morning and go all day. It&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve been in the sun just a few minutes. Believe me, living in southern California, you need the best. Goes on white, turns clear when you rub it in. Great great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Check my reviews. I am sincere, and not a fake paid should-be-killed reviewer.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Used this for a week of surfing and didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet; saving it for a camping trip to the desert.  But, I grew up with a group of surfers, who always used zinc oxide to protect their noses...so I know it works.</li>
            <li> We started using this suncare when we had our boat in Mexico. It really works and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes when you sweat. We bought via Amazon when we spent 2 months in Hawaii. The price was way better on amazon then in the Hawaii stores. We belong to Amazon Prime so shipping was free and fast.</li>
            <li> This cream works so great! We spent weeks out in the Brazilian sun on vacation and didn&#x27;t get burned once! This zinc lotion goes on clear so you don&#x27;t look dorky. It also doesn&#x27;t make you break out or clog pores which is a super plus!! Leaves skin feeling super soft. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> rubs on clear and works well . my head is shaved and i rub it in all over . keep it away from sweat and your eyes . itl burn if it runs in the eye area</li>
            <li> So Far this is the lightest, least visible sunbolock (must contain zinc oxide or titanium) that I have used.</li>
            <li> I use to be able to buy this product at WalMart, but they no longer carry it.  I choose this product over any other for my face moisturizer and protection from the sun. Other products have made my face break out, this product is awesome!  I have been using this product for years and years.  It is also very affordable for me.</li>
