            <li> , a few years later, I&#x27;m in my third career, as a Film &amp; Television Actor, so you can imagine that whether I have white hairs or not makes a big difference in what kinds of roles I get cast in.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> THE SHIPPING COST WAS EXHORBITANT - IT WAS THE EXACT PRICE OF THE PRODUCT AND I QUESTIONED IT AND NO ONE ANSWERED ME!!! ALSO MY HUSBAND USES THE PRODUCT AND HE SAID IT WAS EITHER AN INFERIOR \\&quot;WATERED-DOWN\\&quot; PRODUCT OR IT WAS \\&quot;OLD SHELF-LIFE PRODUCT\\&quot;  SO AFTER ALL THE TIMES WE BOUGHT IT IT IS TOTALLY UNLIKELY WE WILL AGAIN PURCHASE IT!</li>
            <li> I think this product works great and I have been using it for years now. It works just as well as a styling product as a gray or in my case white hair cover-up. I just automatically use it every morning when I comb my hair.</li>
            <li> Started to use and make your hair naturally black</li>
            <li> My husband is 79 years old &amp; because his hair isn&#x27;t gray, people think he is in his 60s.  It is so nature &amp; his hair doesn&#x27;t look dyed.  Guys are so jealous that my husband doesn&#x27;t have gray hair like them.  Since it is so natural looking, men know he doesn&#x27;t dye his hair!!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> It did not work on my gray eyebrows after a month trying.To be clear Grecian Formula says to not use on eyebrows.Thats all I was interested in,eyebrows.So I don&#x27;t know how it works on gray head hair.I wont give it a bad review for that reason.Just a heads up if your thinking about eyebrows only.I knew it might not work when I bought it,</li>
            <li> its a good product.  I wash my hair every day so I didi not get immediate results.  I bought a small spray bottle to apply and used it every night, when I got home.  My hair darkened and no one noticed.</li>
            <li> Unlike some,l I found this to be vry effective. I slowly colors your hair back to original color over time. Some object to the lead pigment, but I don&#x27;t think there is much to worry about. Works very well. Great alternative to keep coloring your hair.</li>
            <li> It sure is hard to tell any difference, however if you believe your hair is getting any darker, all the better. Maybe, it works.  Contains lead, so don&#x27;t let junior use it without parent oversight... and wash his hands.</li>
            <li> Fantastic BUT purchase a small spray bottle...........I am 51 and gray hair fairly gone in 48 hours..........the first day, used 4 times first day......2nd day, a nice difference and again, used 4 times.......3rd day, I was shocked........impressive.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used initially w/out a spray bottle and took forever..........w/ Spray Bottle, incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, the sprayer will stick but use water........</li>
            <li> works great but messy to apply</li>
            <li> It burned/irritate my skin didn&#x27;t realize it had lead. Did not say in the ad but of course it&#x27;s in small print on the bottle when you receive it. Risky s**ht</li>
            <li> Works great once you get over it&#x27;s aroma!</li>
            <li> Works slowly but effectively in covering most (but not all) of the gray</li>
            <li> It works great for me, took about a week to start seeing results.</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago but decided to use &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair coloring for a while.  After a recent disastrous experience with henna, I decided to go back to it and found that it still works great.  My hair had grown out about 2 inches and was half white and half  henna red (and looked ridiculous).  This time, I didn&#x27;t want to wait 3 weeks for the Grecian Formula to work,  so I soaked my hair with it  and wore a plastic bonnet all day to keep it from drying.  By evening, the white hair was a nice light brown.  My reddish henna hair seemed to blend better with the now darker hair and looked a lot better than the stark contrast of the red/white combination I had going on.  Also, I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting caught in a rainstorm and having dark hair rinse dripping down my face.  Now I just spray it on 2 or 3 times per week to maintain the color.  Good stuff!  Just make sure to shake it very well before putting it on or it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I guess the effectiveness must vary quite a bit between individuals. I used Grecian quite a few years ago to minimize my &amp;#34;premature&amp;#34; gray. This time, after three weeks of use and about 40% of a bottle consumed, the color difference is close to imperceptible.  I have been careful to vigorously shake the bottle before dispensing into my palm, then  applying two palmfuls at the start of each day and washing the hair once every four days.  The resulting difference in coloration between my original completely gray and the present is so slight as to be uncertain, so it must work better for most men.  I&#x27;ll finish with this bottle and evaluate but so far, it&#x27;s really really slow going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am now, at 2+ months, on the 2nd half of the second bottle with the hair still gradually darkening.  I am still washing hair only twice/week with liberal morning application and vigorous shaking of the bottle.  Boy, this is a lot slower than I would have expected...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After about seven months of daily usage and twice a week shampooing, I can say that I now have a definite darkening of my hair.  It&#x27;s not gray anymore, but a fairly uniform medium to light brown.  So it is easy to use and works, just be very very patient if you&#x27;re starting from full gray.</li>
            <li> Says it will begin to show signs of reducing gray hair in about two weeks. I&#x27;ve been using it well over a month and simply have not seen any benefit. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The stuff works great. For those that say it&#x27;s watered down?  You must shake the hell out of the bottle, especially when you first get it.</li>
            <li> Works as described. A little faster than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Really really pleased with the results!  I had very short, nearly all gray hair (think Jamie Lee Curtis)... in two weeks time, my hair is a pleasing shade of brown - actually a little lighter than my hair was in my youth, but I love it. It looks very natural, not like kiwi shoe polish (think Paul McCartney) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I put it in nightly before bed; I&#x27;m going to go to 2-3x a week to maintain the color it is now...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the fourth of five failed attempts by my parents at having a daughter, and none of my four brothers ranging in age from five years older to five years younger has a single white hair.  My father&#x27;s hair is entirely white, but he&#x27;s about eighty.  My mother has no white or grey hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair started turning white when I took a job in the financial services industry.  It&#x27;s a clear example of how stress effects hair color.  And research has show that it has absolutely nothing to do with age; it&#x27;s simply that your body loses the abilty to break down the natural peroxide, one folicle at a time.  It can happen at a very young age, but usually doesn&#x27;t happen until you&#x27;re at least middle age, if ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect of increasing white hairs on my head become not only bothersome, but made me look older than I am, and that effected my ability to market myself for jobs because it made me seem older than I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, when I was unemployed for about a month, I dyed my hair with Just for Men until I landed my next job.  During that time my photo was in the paper, and the article came out after I had started the job.  &amp;#34;One person commented, that must have been about ten years ago, right?&amp;#34; and I replied, &amp;#34;That was last month!&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;But you look so much younger in the photo,&amp;#34; she said.  So obviously, hair coloring does matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about Just for Men though was that it came off on just about everything, and it was somewhat difficult to apply, so I just stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a few years later, I&#x27;m in my third career, as a Film &amp; Television Actor, so you can imagine that whether I have white hairs or not makes a big difference in what kinds of roles I get cast in.  I&#x27;ve played detectives, a US Senator, an well-to-do father type.  While these roles were age appropriate, they were only just.  Except for my hair, I easily could play ten years younger up to my real age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of acting, I&#x27;m also a headshot photographer, so I do my own headshots, and would often &#x27;touch up&#x27; my hair a bit in my photos until a magazine editor friend of mine said it looked dishonest, that I didn&#x27;t look exactly like my photo--which is death to a headshot photographer.  So he suggested I either don&#x27;t touch it up at all, or that I dye it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to go back to Just for Men, but I also didn&#x27;t want to pay a pro to dye my hair every three weeks, and so I began studying about hair coloring.  It appealed to me less and less, but I figured that if women can do this on a regular basis so can I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, just as I was shopping for hair coloring, I happened across Grecian Formula.  I liked the science of it; it made sense to me; so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In only four days all the white hairs were gone and my hair looked completely natural.  No dye, no rubber gloves, no staining my pillowcase slightly brown.  The only slight negative I&#x27;ll say is that after four days--you only have to do this daily for the first week--the smell is a bit bothersome, but then you wash your hair normally after that and it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I told an actress about it, she was amazed and said she was going to get Grecian Formula for her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much better than hair dye if you ask me, and it was really easy to do.  The results are totally natural.  I highly recommend it.&#x27;m also a headshot photographer, so I do my own headshots, and would often &#x27;touch up&#x27; my hair a bit in my photos until a magazine editor friend of mine said it looked dishonest, that I didn&#x27;t look exactly like my photo--which is death to a headshot photographer.
