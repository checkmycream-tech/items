            <li> Two main problems:  very hard to push down the sprayer; didn&#x27;t smell quite the same as the last time I used it years ago.</li>
            <li> That being said, the I do wish it were slightly stronger or that there was a perfume in the line since when I just want to add a bit during the day, the fragrance disappears in a fairly short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product arrived partially damaged because it was not wrapped in protective packaging.</li>
            <li> but when I got it the cap was unscrewed a little bit and some had leaked out.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent and it is unfortunate that it is no longer carried by Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
            <li> Too bad bath and body discontinued making it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a change in bottle or something else, but I was disappointed with my Body Splash.  </li>

            <li> Not what was ordered as shown in the site</li>
            <li> When my mother smelled me on this scent, she said \\&quot;smells like the ones you get in a spa\\&quot;.  This whole line of products with the white tea and ginger scent smell fresh and elegant, not sweet or sticky, like other fruit-based ones.</li>
            <li> I love this particular scent and it&#x27;s my favorite in the Bath and Body Works line.  I use the body cream, body lotion and the body splash daily during the warm weather months and it&#x27;s just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body splash is light and works well in combination with either the cream or lotion and is not overpowering.  That being said, the I do wish it were slightly stronger or that there was a perfume in the line since when I just want to add a bit during the day, the fragrance disappears in a fairly short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great in combination with other products in the line but doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as a stand-alone product, but still my favorite !</li>

            <li> So glad I was able to find this particular Bath &amp; Body Works splash on Amazon.  I did not realize it was a limited&lt;br /&gt;classic scent at the actual Bath &amp; Body stores.  Amazon is the best place to shop.  Thank you....</li>
            <li> Bath and body works splash is just my wife´s favorite scent. She uses this after working out at the gym or just whenever needed. Recommended.</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance!  This is my signature scent.  BBW sold out of this wonderful aroma, and I have depleted my stash. ;O)  Had to find it on Amazon, until it&#x27;s restocked at BBW.  Shipping was not favorable with Shell&#x27;s Jewels. The product arrived partially damaged because it was not wrapped in protective packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this body splash. Scent is fabulous. And feels so fresh. I get compliments every time I use it. GREAT FOR ANY DAY AND EVERY OCCASION</li>

            <li> Not bad at all, a really nice feminine, fresh scent great for just spritzing on. Something to wear when you don&#x27;t want people to think you&#x27;re wearing perfume. Very floral.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BBW fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is one of my faves I love this scent and it lasts all day and night, so I am very pleased</li>
