            <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff. Best buy ever!</li>
            <li> Always buy from VS but since I&#x27;m almost out and well that&#x27;s not an option ðŸ˜Š I had to buy from here! Tried a lot of cologne but Victoria knows her stuff! I get smelled all the time and well I love the smell cause its not a musky scent and the ladies love it! As do I! Hope they never stop making it! Thanks Victoria and Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> Quick and fast shipping as promised. This smells exactly like the previous one I had. I would absolutely recommend this to other people. Just not my immediate group of friends because I don&#x27;t want any of them smelling like me.</li>
            <li> Product smells watered down not as strong smelling as it has been when i bought from Victoria Secrets</li>

            <li> The scent is fabulous and fresh! Not a bad price for the size of the bottle! Great gift for any man in your life!</li>

            <li> This is the only cologne I let my husband wear. I love, love, love it. I hate the price, but the bottle tends to last him about a year so I guess I really can not complain. It smells amazing and lasts all day long.</li>
