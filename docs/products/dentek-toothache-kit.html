    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I was in an incredible amount of pain until I could get a dentist appointment.  </li>
            <li>A great temporary fix until I could get to the dentist.</li>
            <li>This is great for the emergency that we hope we never have.</li>
            <li>Great kit for a great price.  </li>
            <li>For those of you who have experienced this, you know the level of pain.</li>
            <li>It worked great for a tooth of mine that broke.</li>
            <li>Better to be prepared!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to use it yet, but I am very glad to have it here</li>
            <li>but it will come in handy</li>
            <li>Great addition to first aid kit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have this product in my emergency medicine travel bag.</li>
            <li>This is such a great piece of my 120 hour kit!</li>
            <li>Without the items in this kit, I would not be able to continue life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t, I sincerely hope you never experience it.</li>
            <li>so I washed it out with water many times til the burning went away.  </li>
            <li>I now fear that it will never get better and I will not regain feeling in my lip and inside of my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>outstanding package for a tackle box or the road</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t needed it and hope I never do, but it appears to be able to do the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very good kit to have on hand before you actually need to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I also have a prepared glob of the Temparin filling material on the plastic tool, and as soon as the cotton ball is securely tamped in place, I spread the temp filling material,</li>
            <li>Easy to use works well great to have in the medical cupboard ready for use.</li>
            <li>expense of this kit, which also carries with it peace of mind, is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the filling material is quite easy since it is like a soft clay until you roll it and place it into the cavity (or as a cement for a dislodged crown).</li>
            <li>This DenTex \\&quot;first aid\\&quot; kit is one item that always goes with me on a trip.  </li>
            <li>I never leave them in for more than 4-5 days, since the unclean tooth damage is covered up, and an infection could start if I left the filling covered the area too</li>
            <li>I keep this in my car&#x27;s first aid kit.</li>
            <li>one of those things that you don&#x27;t really think about until it happens.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s clay-like), across and gently into the cavity.</li>
            <li>that was very close to  </li>
            <li>I use clean tee shirt material for the drying and push some between my cheek and gum to soak up saliva while I put the small compressed piece of cotton ball I previously LIGHTLY dipped in the Eugenol, (Eugenol is clove oil, an intensely hot chemical oil - it WILL blister the skin in large enough quantities if not wiped off).  </li>

            <li>Purchased Dental First Aid Kit as a emergency back up in case of a dental problem.</li>
            <li>Naturally, this type of kit doesn&#x27;t take the place of professional dentistry, but if you can&#x27;t get an appointment right away it can be a potential tooth saver.</li>
            <li>These directions are clear, concise, and thorough.  </li>
            <li>then use a corner of the tee shirt material to spread the filling material so it completely covers the cotton ball, and I don&#x27;t worry about the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems complete.</li>
            <li>I was in so much pain that I placed the cotton swab into the clove oil and spread it on my gum... not reading the very tiny and brief instructions to not get the oil on any tissue, only on the tooth!  </li>
            <li>There is a small Temparin tooth &amp; crown saver container to put your lost crowns in, some temporary filling material (which will also secure a loose crown or cap), some all-natural toothache medication, and applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Has what I was looking for. Toothache pain and lost filling kit. A must have for outdoor activities and disaster kits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have this product in my emergency medicine travel bag. I used it in the past when a filling fell out. I wanted the insurance of knowing I&#x27;ll have it if needed while traveling. A great temporary fix until I could get to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This DenTex \\&quot;first aid\\&quot; kit is one item that always goes with me on a trip.  It is small enough to put in a Ziploc bag along with several other items I carry with me.  I bought this soon after I lost a crown and ended up carrying it in a napkin to a frantic visit to the dentist.  This little kit is very compact and the hard plastic casing protects its contents.  There is a small Temparin tooth &amp; crown saver container to put your lost crowns in, some temporary filling material (which will also secure a loose crown or cap), some all-natural toothache medication, and applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The expense of this kit, which also carries with it peace of mind, is worth every cent.

            <li> This is such a great piece of my 120 hour kit!</li>
            <li> another little kit I hope will never get used- but it will come in handy should I or someone I am hunting , fishing, or camping with break a crown or get a sore tooth due to a cavity. it beats suffering until you can get to a dentist. one of those things that you don&#x27;t really think about until it happens.</li>
            <li> Easy to use works well great to have in the medical cupboard ready for use.</li>
            <li> This is great for the emergency that we hope we never have. We bought them for all of our kids too!</li>
            <li> Great kit for a great price.  Cannot get it at my local CVS/Safeway.  I live in a small town.</li>
            <li> Purchased Dental First Aid Kit as a emergency back up in case of a dental problem. Have not used this item as yet, but it seems to have the necessary items if needed. Better to be prepared!!</li>
            <li> I am disabled, without dental insurance, and live on SS. I have two teeth broken at the jaw line and two teeth that have uncovered, incomplete root canals/crowns.  Without the items in this kit, I would not be able to continue life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eat nearly a liquid diet, but occasionally I bite down incorrectly and impact an exposed nerve or tooth pulp. For those of you who have experienced this, you know the level of pain. For those who don&#x27;t, I sincerely hope you never experience it. Think of the impact and abruptness of a solid electric shock delivering a bone deep, intensely sharp pain instead of the numbing &#x27;thump&#x27; of an electrical shock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this happens, I dry around the tooth, the tooth and the cavity in the tooth. I use clean tee shirt material for the drying and push some between my cheek and gum to soak up saliva while I put the small compressed piece of cotton ball I previously LIGHTLY dipped in the Eugenol, (Eugenol is clove oil, an intensely hot chemical oil - it WILL blister the skin in large enough quantities if not wiped off).  I also have a prepared glob of the Temparin filling material on the plastic tool, and as soon as the cotton ball is securely tamped in place, I spread the temp filling material, (it&#x27;s clay-like), across and gently into the cavity. If I jab it in the cavity, and apply even a little bit of pressure, it compresses the nerve or tooth pulp, and it&#x27;s as bad as biting down on it. So, I have learned to wipe across, and SLIGHTLY down into the cavity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then use a corner of the tee shirt material to spread the filling material so it completely covers the cotton ball, and I don&#x27;t worry about the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eugenol instantly stops the pain - instantly. The filling material hardens over the course of several hours, and if careful, it will last 3-5 days. Within a few hrs, I typically can&#x27;t taste anything from the Eugenol.  I never leave them in for more than 4-5 days, since the unclean tooth damage is covered up, and an infection could start if I left the filling covered the area too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a permanent fix, but it does kill the pain, and will last entirely long enough to make a difference.  I WOULD not live without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above narrative is not instructions for use, not professional advice or, advice of any kind; it is ONLY a narrative of how I use the product to obtain relief from unbearable pain. I wrote the narrative because the product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These kits have enough for 8-10 emergency events, with some Eugenol left over. There are 4oz containers of [[ASIN:B0056AYSZ2 Eugenol]], a single container of [[ASIN:B001AIWJZU Temparin Max 2.2g + Applicator]], and a package of 6 containers of [[ASIN:B002WTCK50 Temparin Max 2.2g + Applicator]] on Amazon, as well.ered up, and an infection could start if I left the filling covered the area too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a permanent fix, but it does kill the pain, and will last entirely long enough to make a difference.

This is not recommended, but it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good kit to have on hand before you actually need to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> Great addition to first aid kit</li>
            <li> I recently had a filling fall out that was very close to  the nerve and I was in an incredible amount of pain until I could get a dentist appointment.  I tried this product after Ambesol no longer relieved the pain and all suggested home remedies didn&#x27;t do anything.  I was in so much pain that I placed the cotton swab into the clove oil and spread it on my gum... not reading the very tiny and brief instructions to not get the oil on any tissue, only on the tooth!  Immediately my mouth was burning so I washed it out with water many times til the burning went away.  It did numb me up but then I felt as if I just got back from the dentist with a fully numb face! It also swelled up a little but the next day, my cheek, lips and chin puffed up and became hard, with no feeling whatsoever.  I read that other people have had this happen and it might last over a week...  Well, it has been 3 weeks now, and I am still numb (although not as much - it has reduced some and is not as hard).  I now fear that it will never get better and I will not regain feeling in my lip and inside of my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if you use this product, beware to only use a very little amount of clove oil and ONLY use it on your tooth! (it does work to numb the tooth...)</li>
            <li> outstanding package for a tackle box or the road</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use it yet, but I am very glad to have it here just it case I ever need it.</li>
            <li> Seems complete. I haven&#x27;t needed it and hope I never do, but it appears to be able to do the job. I keep this in my car&#x27;s first aid kit.</li>
            <li> It worked great for a tooth of mine that broke. It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
