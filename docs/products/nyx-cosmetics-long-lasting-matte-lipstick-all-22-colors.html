            <li> If you are a NYX girl, you must have these in your collection. Same quality as original retail, markings, casing and everything is the same, all the way down to NYX infamous smell, but with a much better price.</li>
            <li> I recieved my Lipsticks in perfect condition. The amount of product you get for this price is amazing. The lipsticks have great pigment and the colors are to die for. If you want to spice up your lipstick collection this buy is a must.</li>
            <li> I buy this product becuse the reviews all them say this lipstick are&lt;br /&gt;long lasting like you well see that reviews , BUT NO&lt;br /&gt;I give two stars because have nice colors are creamy and soft to use&lt;br /&gt;but the true is are \\&quot;not long lasting at all\\&quot; in my opinion this product are over priced</li>
            <li> Not the color I was looking forward from the image -_-</li>
            <li> been about a year but they are going strong and long lasting!!!!perfect pigment!perfect colors!needs darker berry colors but i still love these with all my soul!</li>
            <li> thanks, these are great value,  a few were a little chalky but great to use if you add a layer of gloss, (although no longer matte they still give youa very wearable lipstick)</li>
            <li> Make the price cheaper then that because you will make more money off it then what your prices are pleasr</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors but I wish that there were more purples in this set. Other than that  its still really good and it feels really smooth on my lips.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t these.  They smell like plastic and the colors just aren&#x27;t pretty.  I would not recommend spending the money on them.  Their jumbo lip pencils are nice and I also like thier lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller and product.</li>
            <li> I love every shade and these are great! They last a long time and you will literally have every color you need. Must have for the price!</li>
            <li> love and recommend they do not dry out your lips and all the colors are beautiful! I love matte lipsticks but have always had the issue with my lips looking as if they were peeling. THESE DO NOT DO THIS. they stay true to their color even after eating.</li>
            <li> REALLY DISAPPOINTED, all swatches I received where light pastel pink/nude/beige Colors and only ONE OF THEM was reddish (Bloody Mary). All the other cool red or dark nyx swatches weren&#x27;t in the pack. If you like Red or dark colours, don&#x27;t buy this. SO expensive and i don&#x27;t even like any of them!!!!! And If that wasn&#x27;t enough i received two pairs of the same color.... MEHH</li>
            <li> The product came in very quick. I love the colors. Some of the colors are fairly similar but I appreciate that, because I don&#x27;t stray to far in how I do my makeup. It is long lasting but can dry out your lips. I always put coconut lip balm on before I put on the lipstick. Afterwards you can leave it matte, add lip balm or gloss to change the look of the lipstick. I enjoy having those options as well.</li>
            <li> Great variety. I love to see the looks on my clients face after I pull these babies out. They&#x27;re like wow look at all the colors lol</li>
            <li> Love it , so beautiful</li>
            <li> I love the colors, and the matte lipsticks are exactly what I was looking for. so far I love all the NYX products.</li>
            <li> the colors of the image does not match with the colors I received are many very similar light colors sorry But im disappointed</li>
