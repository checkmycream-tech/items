            <li>Great product for keeping blondes and greys from turning brassy, and equally superb at detangling; but, makes my baby fine wavy hair SO limp and greasy.</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>

            <li>and I like the way this product is all I need to use on my hair most of the time.</li>
            <li>After reading so many glowing reviews of this for gray hair, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for it for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I love all Pantene products and this one delivers as well.</li>
            <li>OMG I am so glad Pantene started making Silver Expressions Shampoo or Conditioner again.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>

            <li>I love this conditioner and I use it with the Silver Expressions shampoo.</li>

            <li>I love the feel and shine</li>
            <li>I, like many un-natural blonds, am constantly searching for that perfect toning product to combat brassiness.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...smells great, leaves my silver/blonde hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky smooth after using this conditioner with the shampoo!  </li>
            <li>This product is the best for my white hair.  </li>
            <li>I am so so glad, that i ordered this product..</li>
            <li>In combination I have noticed that my hair looks better</li>
            <li>A great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help with that at all, but it was wonderfully gentle, smelled great and helped moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li>this is a great shampoo thanks</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky, lighter and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>But what I really love is how it extends the life of my non-permanent dye job.</li>
            <li>So I was so glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is perfect for grey hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best conditioner I have found for long hair.  </li>
            <li>At 61 I am happy with my natural color.</li>
            <li>Works great and keeps my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>keeps my silver from becoming brassy</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered on line and now will have plenty to help me keep my beautiful, silver hair as silvery as possible.</li>
            <li>This product really made my hair look and feel good.</li>
            <li>Pantene conditioner makes my hair feel very nice and soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>But it does a great job with my parched hair and leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>nice soft conditioning to go with the Silver Expressions shampoo - nice lighter scent</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice and soft after using this during a nice shower.</li>
            <li>Pantene and Suave make a daily clarifying shampoo and conditioner that work beautifully.</li>
            <li>I read a lot online about using conditioner because I recall it used to make my fine hair</li>
            <li>I use both the shampoo and conditioner to give my fine hair the color, shine, and body that I need.</li>
            <li>My hair is rather fine</li>
            <li>I have fine, graying hair.</li>
            <li>It works quickly (softens &amp; smooths) and adds to your \\&quot;silver shine\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft, smells great, and is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>but my hair are now a great color gray and very nicely conditioned, as I live in a very dry area I need the moisture !</li>
            <li>I got a great deal on both the shampoo and conditioner and my hair has no trace of yellow.</li>
            <li>It lathers on well and leaves my hair silky smooth as well as brass-free.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to recolor often) - brass free and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair is gorgeous, soft and shiny and silver.</li>
            <li>Love it and so glad I found it, thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Does very nice job of keeping brassiness at bay on my blonde hair and leaves it smooth.  </li>
            <li>Cannot find it in most stores and the Amazon price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t noticed that when I ordered it and was more than willing to pay $10 for 1 bottle.</li>
            <li>Love how much softer my hair is now!</li>
            <li>The supporting shampoo and this product work for me as I paid more attention to my hair color after shampooing and drying.</li>
            <li>Looked shiny and felt both clean and controlled, but</li>
            <li>daughters, who have dark blond to light brown hair have used it also and their hair shiny and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>This deal on Amazon gives me the product I love to use at a very decent price.  </li>
            <li>Love it, wish it was available more readily locally.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer and shinier, I love it</li>
            <li>Be sure to rinse really well.</li>
            <li>Really helped make my gray hair more controllable.  </li>
            <li>It smells and acts like every other Pantene conditioner, which is great.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use very much, though!</li>
            <li>Perfect for Grey, silver or white hair.</li>
            <li>Would add that I have best results using toning conditioners when I towel dry hair a little before applying to allow better penetration into hair.</li>
            <li>I tied everything from the most expensive to the cheap brands and this work great.</li>
            <li>If you have white hair is does a great job of bringing out the natural color,,,,</li>
            <li>Great pair product with the Pantene Silver Expression Shampoo for natural white and silver hair.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Having more and more gray hair, I truly appreciate a product which helps keep my hair looking more white than yellow.</li>
            <li>(blond color is more natural</li>
            <li>conditioner is thick and rich, the smell is okay, nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>Good for every other day use and kept the frizzies at bay all winter.  </li>
            <li>conditioner is amazing if you have dyed grey hair.</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair to a level 9-10 and then applied Wella cooling additive to make it a nice steel grey.</li>
            <li>They do a beautiful job of brightening my (I prefer &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34;) hair, do not effect the color of my dark hair and leave my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Be aware it is purple/blue in the bottle</li>
            <li>If you Google top shampoo/conditioners for gray hair this combo is listed and is the most affordable and comparably priced, if not better priced online.</li>
            <li>Also It was only just okay as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>that I put my first order of the Pantene Silver Expressions shampoo on the subscribe &amp; save program.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair brighter!  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner for my &#x27;silvered&#x27; brown hair, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the local stores.</li>
            <li>and I love to bleach and dye my hair all different colors.</li>
            <li>Actually I found the Silver E press ions products to work better than another leading name brand I used for years.</li>
            <li>I personally use the Pantene Highlighting Expressions for Blondes and love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this Silver Expressions Daily Color Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily, more like twice a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they finally came to their senses!  </li>
            <li>but if it is left on for long enough it does tone wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It is the best product on the market for me to further remove the dull gray turning it to a white/silver look.  </li>
            <li>I was very upset when Pantene stopped making it,I tried other products and never found one I liked.</li>
            <li>They shipped this product out pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>I have very long mostly gray hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a purple based toning shampoo which tones my hair but leaves it dry and even more brittle.</li>
            <li>I do have to apply a large amount and really work it through my hair as it doesn&#x27;t have much slip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a good quality violet conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product was very drying on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t rinse out very well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do much to brighten my hair or make it shiney.</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It really makes my silver hair sparkle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light purple but does not leave purple or blue in your hair.  </li>
            <li>It really softens my hair and leaves it feeling silky.  </li>
            <li>but this shampoo has really changed the tone</li>
            <li>Works very well with the shampoo to enhance my silver hairl</li>
            <li>Pantene s.e. conditions  very well.  </li>
            <li>It was very well packaged, no chance of spilling or breakage.</li>
            <li>Makes it silky smooth and shiny as possible.</li>
            <li>Take a comb at the end and pull it trough your hair to really get it in.</li>
            <li>For awhile I was useing a different brand, because the CVS store said this was no longer available.</li>
            <li>I purchased on clearance at a drug store worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>so much it shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and tangle free, but not limp.  </li>
            <li>When it came the bottle had opened and I had shampoo in the box, kind of messy.  </li>
            <li>We live in a dry climate and it helps to keep the static out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Wish it came as a shampoo/rinse combination like many of their other products.</li>
            <li>My hair is salt and pepper grey and the color seems fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As long as these products are available, I will be buying this conditioner and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who bleaches their hair because the conditioner is purple, which helps remove the yellowish tint to bleached hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Pantene Silver Expressions</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for gray or graying hair.  </li>
            <li>I also hoped for a little more color enhancement.</li>
            <li>I leave it on in the shower for 5 minutes, rinse, and apply a little more as a leave in.</li>
            <li>Fast action.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent to use as I use a wide tooth comb to take the tangles out of my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It can start to dry your hair out after a while of use, so make sure you use a deep conditioner once a week to combat it.</li>
            <li>Took the yellow right out of my husbands hair.</li>
            <li>Helps keep the color tone down for hair that has been bleached and makes my hair easy to work with.</li>
            <li>so I can live with it,</li>
            <li>As a reference I live in a 70-80% humidity area.</li>
            <li>When I realized they were again available on Amazon, if not in my local stores, I quickly bought quite a few bottles, just in case they were discontinued again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I continue to spend $$$ on more expensive products when Pantene is available.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure what prevents Amazon from being able to sending this product now.</li>
            <li>I no longer have any dull bluish grey, but bright silver every time now.</li>
            <li>I have grey-ing hair that is more white than grey, especially around my face.</li>
            <li>Too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li>A little advice is to make sure the container lid is closed tightly.  : )</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but it does prevent yellowing in graying hair, and helps keep hair smooth (in conjunction with keratin treatments.)</li>
            <li>my hair is pure white, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This would also be great for blondes who have hair that turns dull or green in water.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to stop experimenting, use this combo daily, and not give it another thought.</li>
            <li>In my old age, I seldom use hairspray or mousse</li>
            <li>not \\&quot;old lady gray\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Keeps my white/grey hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair shining and soft.</li>
            <li>The silver practically glows, plus your hair is so soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>But as far as the quality of the shampoo, I can&#x27;t go without a conditioning rise with this...</li>
            <li>Really does keep gray from turning yellow.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything as far as toning.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Really enhances my white hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft but still manageable</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>but it sure can be messy if I don&#x27;t rinse off the outside of the bottles!</li>
            <li>i love this product, the smell and the texture of my hair after i use  is unbelievable!</li>
            <li>It is thick &amp; rich, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.  </li>
            <li>It is thick &amp; rich, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>Goes on thick and rinses out easily leaving hair soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I use it as the last product in my long hair washing regime, right after a hair therapy/conditioner product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure why because it is fabulous for my hair.</li>
            <li>This works very well for a grey hair like myself.</li>
            <li>None of us have the lavender hair I expected when I first saw the shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in the local store, so was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love gray sheep, gray chickens, and gray cats, so I finally decided to stop covering up my silvering hair with dull brown hair color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our stores here in Kalamazoo Michigan carry this product only occasionally, and at a very high price.  </li>
            <li>Grocery shopping is a new experience now, I get several compliments on my hair all the time.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t suds up very well with well water (hard), but cleans and keeps the grey the color it should be, instead of light brown tinted.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really helps keep my grey silvery and not yellow.  </li>
            <li>My blonde hair is in the transition to gray and I decided that I dont want to color anymore, but need something to brighten my hair and bring out natural highlights.  </li>
            <li>I went from being a bleach blonde to my natural gray hair.</li>
            <li>Along with the shampoo, leaves white hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Conditioner on my platinum hair left it extremely soft and shining.</li>
            <li>I finally called Pantene directly and was told the company was discontinuing the Silver Expressions</li>
            <li>oddly enough my short hair took much longer to dry naturally and didn&#x27;t fluff.up the way I like it.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the color right and prevents it from being dried out.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, to be serious here, the stuff works fantastic if you have silver or even gray hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind that dulls my grey.</li>
            <li>FAR A LONG TIME</li>
            <li>, Pantene has apparently decided to bring back these 2 terrific products.  </li>
            <li>I used this after bleaching my hair at home and it really toned down the brassy-ness of it and it is actually softer than before I bleached it.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde starting to go grey.</li>

            <li> Great shipping, fast and easy !</li>
            <li> Its easy and healing on your hair, leaves it soft and with wonderful highlights.</li>
            <li> Great product for keeping blondes and greys from turning brassy, and equally superb at detangling; but, makes my baby fine wavy hair SO limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>

            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using this brand.</li>

            <li> If you are using the Pantene Silver Expressions shampoo, make sure you get this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Pantene Silver Expressions Daily Color Enhancing Conditioner is the perfect complement to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Brass free!</li>
            <li> If you healthy looking gray/white hair this is for you.</li>
            <li> and I like the way this product is all I need to use on my hair most of the time.</li>
            <li> After reading so many glowing reviews of this for gray hair, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for it for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I love all Pantene products and this one delivers as well.</li>
            <li> OMG I am so glad Pantene started making Silver Expressions Shampoo or Conditioner again.  </li>

            <li> This product is the best for my white hair.  </li>
            <li> I am so so glad, that i ordered this product..</li>
            <li> In combination I have noticed that my hair looks better</li>
            <li> A great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help with that at all, but it was wonderfully gentle, smelled great and helped moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> this is a great shampoo thanks</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky, lighter and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> But what I really love is how it extends the life of my non-permanent dye job.</li>
            <li> So I was so glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is perfect for grey hair.</li>

            <li> This product really made my hair look and feel good.</li>
            <li> Pantene conditioner makes my hair feel very nice and soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> But it does a great job with my parched hair and leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> nice soft conditioning to go with the Silver Expressions shampoo - nice lighter scent</li>
            <li> My hair feels nice and soft after using this during a nice shower.</li>
            <li> Pantene and Suave make a daily clarifying shampoo and conditioner that work beautifully.</li>
            <li> I read a lot online about using conditioner because I recall it used to make my fine hair</li>
            <li> I use both the shampoo and conditioner to give my fine hair the color, shine, and body that I need.</li>
            <li> My hair is rather fine</li>
            <li> I have fine, graying hair.</li>
            <li> It works quickly (softens &amp; smooths) and adds to your \\&quot;silver shine\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft, smells great, and is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> but my hair are now a great color gray and very nicely conditioned, as I live in a very dry area I need the moisture !</li>
            <li> I got a great deal on both the shampoo and conditioner and my hair has no trace of yellow.</li>
            <li> It lathers on well and leaves my hair silky smooth as well as brass-free.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to recolor often) - brass free and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is gorgeous, soft and shiny and silver.</li>
            <li> Love it and so glad I found it, thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Does very nice job of keeping brassiness at bay on my blonde hair and leaves it smooth.  </li>
            <li> Cannot find it in most stores and the Amazon price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t noticed that when I ordered it and was more than willing to pay $10 for 1 bottle.</li>
            <li> Love how much softer my hair is now!</li>
            <li> The supporting shampoo and this product work for me as I paid more attention to my hair color after shampooing and drying.</li>
            <li> Looked shiny and felt both clean and controlled, but</li>
            <li> daughters, who have dark blond to light brown hair have used it also and their hair shiny and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> This deal on Amazon gives me the product I love to use at a very decent price.  </li>
            <li> Love it, wish it was available more readily locally.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and shinier, I love it</li>
            <li> Be sure to rinse really well.</li>
            <li> Really helped make my gray hair more controllable.  </li>
            <li> It smells and acts like every other Pantene conditioner, which is great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use very much, though!</li>
            <li> Perfect for Grey, silver or white hair.</li>
            <li> Would add that I have best results using toning conditioners when I towel dry hair a little before applying to allow better penetration into hair.</li>
            <li> I tied everything from the most expensive to the cheap brands and this work great.</li>
            <li> If you have white hair is does a great job of bringing out the natural color,,,,</li>
            <li> Great pair product with the Pantene Silver Expression Shampoo for natural white and silver hair.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Having more and more gray hair, I truly appreciate a product which helps keep my hair looking more white than yellow.</li>
            <li> (blond color is more natural</li>
            <li> conditioner is thick and rich, the smell is okay, nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> Good for every other day use and kept the frizzies at bay all winter.  </li>
            <li> conditioner is amazing if you have dyed grey hair.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair to a level 9-10 and then applied Wella cooling additive to make it a nice steel grey.</li>
            <li> They do a beautiful job of brightening my (I prefer &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34;) hair, do not effect the color of my dark hair and leave my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Be aware it is purple/blue in the bottle</li>
            <li> If you Google top shampoo/conditioners for gray hair this combo is listed and is the most affordable and comparably priced, if not better priced online.</li>
            <li> Also It was only just okay as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> that I put my first order of the Pantene Silver Expressions shampoo on the subscribe &amp; save program.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair brighter!  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my &#x27;silvered&#x27; brown hair, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the local stores.</li>
            <li> and I love to bleach and dye my hair all different colors.</li>
            <li> Actually I found the Silver E press ions products to work better than another leading name brand I used for years.</li>
            <li> I personally use the Pantene Highlighting Expressions for Blondes and love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this Silver Expressions Daily Color Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily, more like twice a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they finally came to their senses!  </li>
            <li> but if it is left on for long enough it does tone wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It is the best product on the market for me to further remove the dull gray turning it to a white/silver look.  </li>
            <li> I was very upset when Pantene stopped making it,I tried other products and never found one I liked.</li>
            <li> They shipped this product out pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> I have very long mostly gray hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a purple based toning shampoo which tones my hair but leaves it dry and even more brittle.</li>
            <li> I do have to apply a large amount and really work it through my hair as it doesn&#x27;t have much slip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a good quality violet conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product was very drying on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rinse out very well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much to brighten my hair or make it shiney.</li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It really makes my silver hair sparkle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light purple but does not leave purple or blue in your hair.  </li>
            <li> It really softens my hair and leaves it feeling silky.  </li>
            <li> but this shampoo has really changed the tone</li>
            <li> Works very well with the shampoo to enhance my silver hairl</li>
            <li> Pantene s.e. conditions  very well.  </li>
            <li> It was very well packaged, no chance of spilling or breakage.</li>
            <li> Makes it silky smooth and shiny as possible.</li>
            <li> Take a comb at the end and pull it trough your hair to really get it in.</li>
            <li> For awhile I was useing a different brand, because the CVS store said this was no longer available.</li>
            <li> I purchased on clearance at a drug store worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> so much it shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and tangle free, but not limp.  </li>
            <li> When it came the bottle had opened and I had shampoo in the box, kind of messy.  </li>
            <li> We live in a dry climate and it helps to keep the static out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Wish it came as a shampoo/rinse combination like many of their other products.</li>
            <li> My hair is salt and pepper grey and the color seems fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As long as these products are available, I will be buying this conditioner and shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who bleaches their hair because the conditioner is purple, which helps remove the yellowish tint to bleached hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Pantene Silver Expressions</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for gray or graying hair.  </li>
            <li> I also hoped for a little more color enhancement.</li>
            <li> I leave it on in the shower for 5 minutes, rinse, and apply a little more as a leave in.</li>
            <li> Fast action.  </li>
            <li> This product is excellent to use as I use a wide tooth comb to take the tangles out of my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It can start to dry your hair out after a while of use, so make sure you use a deep conditioner once a week to combat it.</li>
            <li> Took the yellow right out of my husbands hair.</li>
            <li> Helps keep the color tone down for hair that has been bleached and makes my hair easy to work with.</li>
            <li> so I can live with it,</li>
            <li> As a reference I live in a 70-80% humidity area.</li>
            <li> When I realized they were again available on Amazon, if not in my local stores, I quickly bought quite a few bottles, just in case they were discontinued again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I continue to spend $$$ on more expensive products when Pantene is available.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what prevents Amazon from being able to sending this product now.</li>
            <li> I no longer have any dull bluish grey, but bright silver every time now.</li>
            <li> I have grey-ing hair that is more white than grey, especially around my face.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li> A little advice is to make sure the container lid is closed tightly.  : )</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but it does prevent yellowing in graying hair, and helps keep hair smooth (in conjunction with keratin treatments.)</li>
            <li> my hair is pure white, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This would also be great for blondes who have hair that turns dull or green in water.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to stop experimenting, use this combo daily, and not give it another thought.</li>
            <li> In my old age, I seldom use hairspray or mousse</li>
            <li> not \\&quot;old lady gray\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Keeps my white/grey hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair shining and soft.</li>
            <li> The silver practically glows, plus your hair is so soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> But as far as the quality of the shampoo, I can&#x27;t go without a conditioning rise with this...</li>
            <li> Really does keep gray from turning yellow.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything as far as toning.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Really enhances my white hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft but still manageable</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> but it sure can be messy if I don&#x27;t rinse off the outside of the bottles!</li>
            <li> i love this product, the smell and the texture of my hair after i use  is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> It is thick &amp; rich, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.  </li>
            <li> It is thick &amp; rich, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick and rinses out easily leaving hair soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I use it as the last product in my long hair washing regime, right after a hair therapy/conditioner product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why because it is fabulous for my hair.</li>
            <li> This works very well for a grey hair like myself.</li>
            <li> None of us have the lavender hair I expected when I first saw the shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in the local store, so was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love gray sheep, gray chickens, and gray cats, so I finally decided to stop covering up my silvering hair with dull brown hair color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our stores here in Kalamazoo Michigan carry this product only occasionally, and at a very high price.  </li>
            <li> Grocery shopping is a new experience now, I get several compliments on my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t suds up very well with well water (hard), but cleans and keeps the grey the color it should be, instead of light brown tinted.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helps keep my grey silvery and not yellow.  </li>
            <li> My blonde hair is in the transition to gray and I decided that I dont want to color anymore, but need something to brighten my hair and bring out natural highlights.  </li>
            <li> I went from being a bleach blonde to my natural gray hair.</li>
            <li> Along with the shampoo, leaves white hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Conditioner on my platinum hair left it extremely soft and shining.</li>
            <li> I finally called Pantene directly and was told the company was discontinuing the Silver Expressions</li>
            <li> oddly enough my short hair took much longer to dry naturally and didn&#x27;t fluff.up the way I like it.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the color right and prevents it from being dried out.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, to be serious here, the stuff works fantastic if you have silver or even gray hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind that dulls my grey.</li>
            <li> FAR A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> , Pantene has apparently decided to bring back these 2 terrific products.  </li>
            <li> I used this after bleaching my hair at home and it really toned down the brassy-ness of it and it is actually softer than before I bleached it.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde starting to go grey.</li>
            <li> My grey hair loves this product, and the accompanied shampoo, sorry it is out of the stores and glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or that dreaded purple tint that some products will cause if used to frequently on white or grey hair.  </li>
            <li> I then use this each time I shower to keep the grey vibrant and avoid going green.</li>
            <li> does take care of yellowing but one needs to take time off lest you look like a little old blue haired lady</li>
            <li> scent is very subtle and clean.  </li>
            <li> limp-- that was probably 40 years ago,  I do concentrate on working a small amount into the ends so that the shafts stay a little more &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; after thorough rinsing.</li>
            <li> I cut out all colr and am growing out natural Tones down the grey and my hais is noit so brassy.</li>
            <li> Had tried other products touted for results but at my last haircut when I saw the yellow tinted dingy colored hair instead of silver gray on the floor</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my wet hair without tangles, and feeling soft without being weighed down or greasy when dry.  </li>
            <li> The formula for this long awaited item has changed, don&#x27;t know if it will work as well...</li>
            <li> I think it adds highlights to the grey in my  hair</li>
            <li> My wife told me that there are products made for grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner and the matching shampoo is a dream for long gray hair.</li>
            <li> Gives my grey hair a prettier color.</li>
            <li> I have long blond highlighted hair that is wavy and dry.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is moisturizing on my thick African hair leaving my natural hair softer.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair which is bleached and highlighted which left my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days to give additional softness to my grey (white) hair.  </li>
            <li> Was unable to find in the local stores anymore and really like this conditioner for my silver hair.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find in stores</li>
            <li> I use it all year round after using the Daily Color Enhancing shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding this locally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find this product in a store.</li>
            <li> and I find that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> hair is 80% gray and I did not see any&lt;br /&gt;difference other than the drying of my hair.</li>
            <li> Use it every other day or so...</li>
            <li> Her hair has always been oily but is now drying out due to the graying.  </li>
            <li> I have to use conditioner, and would recommend this product to other.  </li>
            <li> It only has a light violent color, and has no effect on hair color.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A few years ago, this conditioner, and the Silver Expressions Shampoo, became harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> Hair was dull and lifeless, just like the commercial said it was...</li>
            <li> I see a lot of Patene&#x27;s products for blondes, red heads, but have a really hard time finding their silver highlights products in the store.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost of shipping to return.  </li>
            <li> I use this to tone down any brass I get in my bleached hair.</li>
            <li> It adds shine, and somehow it seems to make the line of demarcation between my dyed hair &amp; my roots less noticeable.</li>
            <li> not sure if that is a change due to not coloring my hair anymore, or the shampoo itself.  </li>
            <li> very hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> A tad too heavy for summer use otherwise.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I found it on AMAZON...and now my gray hair is shiny gray, again, rather than \\&quot;yellowish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> AND HAD TROUBLE FINDING IT.</li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair (at least not mine).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the local stores do not carry it.</li>
            <li> not sure why,</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this in stores so decided to go through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Extremely hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is thick (does not run all over the place when you squeeze.)  </li>
            <li> This is so hard to find, unless you go on eBay with a ridiculous price and shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Pantene Silver Expressions and it is almost impossible to find in the stores now.  </li>
            <li> did try it for a few weeks but was not impressed</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> I have happily not used conditioner with my Pantene Pro-V Volume shampoo over the years.</li>
            <li> Weird color of liquid.</li>
            <li> I was a bit afraid when opening the tub</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is going to be an unpleasant transition - that stuff that&#x27;s supposed to wash out in 26 shampoos never does all come out</li>
            <li> I do have an impossible time trying to find it in my grocery store or nearby drug stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad Pantene discontinued this, but through Amazon, the price isn&#x27;t too bad at all</li>
            <li> There may be a reason that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; is bad, but I&#x27;ve always like that.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have white hair is does a great job of bringing out the natural color,,,,</li>
            <li> Nice quality conditioner. It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is gorgeous, soft and shiny and silver. Love love love it. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tried several shampoos and conditioners of this type.  I think this is the best.  It makes my hair shiney and silvery without any oiliness.</li>
            <li> I used this after bleaching my hair at home and it really toned down the brassy-ness of it and it is actually softer than before I bleached it.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who bleaches their hair because the conditioner is purple, which helps remove the yellowish tint to bleached hair.  It&#x27;s too bad Pantene discontinued this, but through Amazon, the price isn&#x27;t too bad at all and it&#x27;s still cheaper than most toners or toning conditioners.</li>
            <li> This product was very drying on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I did try it for a few weeks but was not impressed&lt;br /&gt;with the results.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is 80% gray and I did not see any&lt;br /&gt;difference other than the drying of my hair.</li>
            <li> Oops, thought the product was shampoo. Not worth the cost of shipping to return.  Haven&#x27;t tried the actual product yet.</li>
            <li> Not great. Doesn&#x27;t rinse out very well. But my hair feels okay I guess.</li>
            <li> Best thing for gray hair!</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores--they had the shampoo, but not conditioner. Good product.</li>
            <li> If you have gray/silver/white hair this Pantene Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is perfect for you. Be aware it is purple/blue in the bottle but your hair does not reflect this. This is not your Great Grandma&#x27;s shampoo. It takes out the yellow and the dullness. It makes my hair a lot shiner and tames the roughies underneath by the nape of my neck. It is gentle enough to use everyday. It is getting harder to find in stores and I&#x27;m not sure why because it is fabulous for my hair. If you Google top shampoo/conditioners for gray hair this combo is listed and is the most affordable and comparably priced, if not better priced online.</li>
            <li> Our stores here in Kalamazoo Michigan carry this product only occasionally, and at a very high price.  This deal on Amazon gives me the product I love to use at a very decent price.  Thank you Amazon for this.</li>
            <li> My grey hair loves this product, and the accompanied shampoo, sorry it is out of the stores and glad to find it on Amazon. I highly recommend the Pantene Silver Expressions</li>
            <li> Bought this with the Silver Expressions shampoo.  Great combination for my silver/gray hair.  Cannot find it in most stores and the Amazon price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much to brighten my hair or make it shiney. Also It was only just okay as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this shampoo and conditioner, but we can no longer find it in the stores in our area. Thanks for carrying it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It leaves my hair shiny and takes out the yellow.  Unfortunately, the local stores do not carry it.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using this brand. I reccomend to all my family and friends who like it as well.</li>
            <li> nice soft conditioning to go with the Silver Expressions shampoo - nice lighter scent</li>
            <li> Works great with silver expressions shampoo</li>
            <li> I have happily not used conditioner with my Pantene Pro-V Volume shampoo over the years. But I tried this conditioner in combination with Silver Expressions Color Enhancing Shampoo.  The effect is more shine on the whitest parts of my hair as well as good volume and and softness.  I read a lot online about using conditioner because I recall it used to make my fine hair limp-- that was probably 40 years ago,  I do concentrate on working a small amount into the ends so that the shafts stay a little more &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; after thorough rinsing. There may be a reason that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; is bad, but I&#x27;ve always like that. I even tried using the conditioner first--as some recommended.  Looked shiny and felt both clean and controlled, but oddly enough my short hair took much longer to dry naturally and didn&#x27;t fluff.up the way I like it.  OK. I&#x27;m ready to stop experimenting, use this combo daily, and not give it another thought.</li>
            <li> been using it for years</li>
            <li> Love it, wish it was available more readily locally.</li>
            <li> does take care of yellowing but one needs to take time off lest you look like a little old blue haired lady</li>
            <li> This conditioner is thick (does not run all over the place when you squeeze.)  It only has a light violent color, and has no effect on hair color.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only conditioner I am now using for my mix of gray and brown hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is perfect for grey hair. Leaves my hair soft and tangle free, but not limp.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> What can I say this is great conditioner. People always notice my gray/silver hair. They always tell me how great it looks. Shinny and no yellowing. If you got to have gray hair you might as well make it work for you.</li>
            <li> Does very nice job of keeping brassiness at bay on my blonde hair and leaves it smooth.  Would add that I have best results using toning conditioners when I towel dry hair a little before applying to allow better penetration into hair. I only rinse about 3/4 of it back out also.  Great value.</li>
            <li> If you are using the Pantene Silver Expressions shampoo, make sure you get this conditioner.  I noticed that just using the shampoo, my white hair would get a yellowish tint - however, using the conditioner regularly, I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to alert people in Hawaii (and possibly Alaska)  that I put my first order of the Pantene Silver Expressions shampoo on the subscribe &amp; save program.  It arrived and I didn&#x27;t think anything about it until the conditioner arrived (also on subscribe &amp; save) but the shampoo never came.  When I checked on Amazon, I found that the shampoo cannot be shipped to Hawaii!!  I finally found it on the Proctor &amp; Gamble site and had no problems with them shipping several bottles of the shampoo so I&#x27;m not sure what prevents Amazon from being able to sending this product now.</li>
            <li> I love this product.I was very upset when Pantene stopped making it,I tried other products and never found one I liked.I was thrilled to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. It&#x27;s a shame I can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and shinier, I love it</li>
            <li> Works great with my Pantene shampoo and leaves my silver hair bright and shiny. Everyone comments on how white my hair is!</li>
            <li> Pantene Silver Expressions Daily Color Enhancing Conditioner is the perfect complement to the shampoo. This product is excellent to use as I use a wide tooth comb to take the tangles out of my thick coarse hair. After combing thru I leave it in my hair for five minutes then I rinse thoroughly. Excellent product at a nice price!</li>
            <li> Keeps my blonde looking......blonde. Brass free!</li>
            <li> If you healthy looking gray/white hair this is for you.</li>
            <li> I use both the shampoo and conditioner to give my fine hair the color, shine, and body that I need. In my old age, I seldom use hairspray or mousse and I like the way this product is all I need to use on my hair most of the time.</li>
            <li> After reading so many glowing reviews of this for gray hair, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for it for quite a while. I got a great deal on both the shampoo and conditioner and my hair has no trace of yellow. Once I stopped coloring I knew that I would have to put some effort into keeping it shiny and bright and not \\&quot;old lady gray\\&quot;. This does the trick.</li>
            <li> The formula for this long awaited item has changed, don&#x27;t know if it will work as well...time will tell. Hair is not shiny and the dullness of my gray hair has not improved...yet</li>
            <li> Great product and I use it exclusively.</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there for us silver foxes.</li>
            <li> Good for every other day use and kept the frizzies at bay all winter.  I use it all year round after using the Daily Color Enhancing shampoo. A tad too heavy for summer use otherwise.  Keeps my white/grey hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helps keep my grey silvery and not yellow.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the local store, so was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love all Pantene products and this one delivers as well.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is great.  Goes great with the shampoo.  I use this every day and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or that dreaded purple tint that some products will cause if used to frequently on white or grey hair.  I had a hard time finding this in stores so decided to go through Amazon.  It came in a 2 pack.  Great price for two of them.  Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> My hair has not had coloring for 11 years. This conditioner and its matching shampoo have kept my silver hair bright and shiny. Always complements on how beautiful my hair is. At 61 I am happy with my natural color. This makes it beautiful.</li>
            <li> Like this conditioner.  My hair is salt and pepper grey and the color seems fine.  My hair is rather fine and I find that a little goes a long way.  Can be too heavy if I use too much.  Some days I alternate with something lighter or skip conditioner but when I do use it I find it effective.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;color enhancing&amp;#34; effect has escaped me and my friends as we have not noticed any difference.  It does a good job of cleansing however.</li>
            <li> It really makes my silver hair sparkle. Great conditioner! I use it as the last product in my long hair washing regime, right after a hair therapy/conditioner product.</li>
            <li> OMG I am so glad Pantene started making Silver Expressions Shampoo or Conditioner again.  This conditioner complements Silver Expressions Shampoo. It&#x27;s light purple but does not leave purple or blue in your hair.  It really softens my hair and leaves it feeling silky.  I&#x27;m a fan and always  purchase it from Amazon in the double pack.</li>
            <li> I had used this product for a number of years. and then it disappeared from the shelves. A few weeks ago I found it on AMAZON...and now my gray hair is shiny gray, again, rather than \\&quot;yellowish\\&quot;. Thank you AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I love gray sheep, gray chickens, and gray cats, so I finally decided to stop covering up my silvering hair with dull brown hair color.&lt;br /&gt;There is going to be an unpleasant transition - that stuff that&#x27;s supposed to wash out in 26 shampoos never does all come out but this shampoo has really changed the tone so I can live with it, french braided with the braid pinned up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters, who have dark blond to light brown hair have used it also and their hair shiny and beautiful.  None of us have the lavender hair I expected when I first saw the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very subtle and clean.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a good quality violet conditioner. I use this to tone down any brass I get in my bleached hair. I recommend this for silver/grey hair as well. It can start to dry your hair out after a while of use, so make sure you use a deep conditioner once a week to combat it. This works best if you use the Silver Expressions shampoo in conjunction with this. Hope they don&#x27;t stop making this as I can&#x27;t find it in retail stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for gray hair - makes hair manageable , soft and silvery.</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find, unless you go on eBay with a ridiculous price and shipping. But it&#x27;s here on Amazon! Perfect for Grey, silver or white hair. Grocery shopping is a new experience now, I get several compliments on my hair all the time. So glad to find it at a good price, and even cheaper if you buy 2.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but it does prevent yellowing in graying hair, and helps keep hair smooth (in conjunction with keratin treatments.)</li>
            <li> It does a beautiful job! I have silver hair and used both the shampoo and conditioner. But, if you only used these products there will be a buildup of bluish-purple coloring on your hair over time. Even when alternating it with another shampoo and conditioner. What I discovered though is if you alternate this with a daily clarifying shampoo and conditioner then there will not be any buildup. Pantene and Suave make a daily clarifying shampoo and conditioner that work beautifully. I no longer have any dull bluish grey, but bright silver every time now.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my hair super soft, smells great, and is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;For reference I have long blond highlighted hair that is wavy and dry.</li>
            <li> If you have white/silver hair as I do, the product is the best on the market!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I was so happy to find here, and with the dual pack it&#x27;s a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my silver hair shiny and soft.....love it !!!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well with the shampoo to enhance my silver hairl</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. I love the shine and how my hair feels after a wash.  &amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions stated are 100% my own&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Helps keep the color tone down for hair that has been bleached and makes my hair easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Pantene conditioner makes my hair feel very nice and soft and manageable. Also has brightened my gray hair to a shiny silver state which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Fast action.  Pantene s.e. conditions  very well.  It helped with reducing brassy  tones in blond/ gray hair.  Use sparingly  on the gray for a white ...not blue tone.  Hope this helps.  It is the Best of these type conditioners.</li>
            <li> This is the Best conditioner for gray hair!  It really makes my hair brighter!  I also love the fact that it can be used every day!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my &#x27;silvered&#x27; brown hair, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the local stores. Very happy to find it at Amazon and better yet to discover I was getting 2 bottles! I hadn&#x27;t noticed that when I ordered it and was more than willing to pay $10 for 1 bottle. It was very well packaged, no chance of spilling or breakage. I think it adds highlights to the grey in my  hair But won&#x27;t swear to it, but it is a very nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> This is not your grandmothers purple shampoo.  My blonde hair is in the transition to gray and I decided that I dont want to color anymore, but need something to brighten my hair and bring out natural highlights.  This shampoo fits the bill!  I also purchased the conditioner.  I absolutely love this stuff.  Its easy and healing on your hair, leaves it soft and with wonderful highlights.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and I use it with the Silver Expressions shampoo. I have fine, graying hair. It conditions the ends without over-conditioning the root area. We live in a dry climate and it helps to keep the static out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great in my hair love the smell also</li>
            <li> Great product.  Using it along with the shampoo it keeps gray or white hair from turning yellow.</li>
            <li> keeps my silver from becoming brassy</li>
            <li> I tied everything from the most expensive to the cheap brands and this work great. I did Phyto products for a while great looking bottle but did not do the job ! I did not think I would be using Pantene but my hair are now a great color gray and very nicely conditioned, as I live in a very dry area I need the moisture ! Great shipping, fast and easy !</li>
            <li> Dealing with a mid-life crisis going gray.  Decided to embrace the change and not dye my hair.  My wife told me that there are products made for grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did a search and found this one.  I do find my hair to be shinier and thicker so pleased with results.  Weird color of liquid.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I WAS HAPPY TO RECEIVE IT, I HAVE BEEN USEING IT FAR A LONG TIME AND HAD TROUBLE FINDING IT.</li>
            <li> Great value for a great product!</li>
            <li> very hard to find locally.  love this product</li>
            <li> good product  prompt service</li>
            <li> Was unable to find in the local stores anymore and really like this conditioner for my silver hair.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, got rid of my dingy yellowing on my silver hair! Yayyy!</li>
            <li> I went from being a bleach blonde to my natural gray hair. This product keeps my hair shining and soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look like ice. Also my hair is still frizzy afterwards</li>
            <li> Great pair product with the Pantene Silver Expression Shampoo for natural white and silver hair.  The ticket to a crowning glory of hair with sass and sparkle.  Extremely hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Love how much softer my hair is now!</li>
            <li> I cannot find this conditioner in the stores any longer. I just wish it was sold as a set of one shampoo &amp; one conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was dubious about the ability of this conditioner to work as well as the Silver Expressions Shampoo but it does!  I had been using the Silver shampoo with the regular Pantene conditioner but when I began using the Silver conditioner I did notice that my hair was shinier.  This conditioner also leaves my hair softer than does the regular Pantene conditoner.  Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to use it but it really works wonderfully, I am in transition to get my hair pepper/silver and it works! I was a bit afraid when opening the tub and I saw the blue color but it does not stain your bathtub and it does not leave any blue streaks in your hair. Great product</li>
            <li> Excellent product for graying hair, makes gray shine. For some reason the stores in my area stopped carrying this, so I ordered six!</li>
            <li> If you have silver hair (or you&#x27;re ready to let it grow out), this is an EXCELLENT product.  The silver practically glows, plus your hair is so soft afterwards.  Try it!</li>
            <li> Very thick. Only  a dab is plenty of shampoo or conditioner . The bottle lasts months!  I had trouble finding this locally.</li>
            <li> I like this and have been using it for about a yr now. I cut out all colr and am growing out natural Tones down the grey and my hais is noit so brassy. Will keep buying</li>
            <li> I works great on my hair as i  have highlights and have frizzy hair .It helps restore shine to leave my hair looking brighter It is thick &amp; rich, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.  This helps to prolong my highlights for several weeks! i get good deals in amazon so continue to subscrive here or buy individual products. Once the current bottle is over i plan to buy it again for the family.</li>
            <li> I have grey-ing hair that is more white than grey, especially around my face. Finding a shampoo and conditioner to enhance this natural occurance is the best thing that happened to me~!!! This product is awesome! Nothing else like it on the market. I do have an impossible time trying to find it in my grocery store or nearby drug stores. I have had to purchase this product online, from Amazon! Great price, too!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I have very light blond hair and it keeps the yellow out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Hair was dull and lifeless, just like the commercial said it was...lol.  Anyway, to be serious here, the stuff works fantastic if you have silver or even gray hair.  Makes it silky smooth and shiny as possible.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Pantene Silver Expressions and it is almost impossible to find in the stores now.  I love the feel and shine it gives my hair.  Be sure to rinse really well.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner and shampoo. It does shine up my gray hair.</li>
            <li> No yellowing of my gray hairs!  But as far as the quality of the shampoo, I can&#x27;t go without a conditioning rise with this... not sure if that is a change due to not coloring my hair anymore, or the shampoo itself.  Works well, and it seems all the gray hair shampoo and conditioner products are purple.. not sure why, but it sure can be messy if I don&#x27;t rinse off the outside of the bottles!</li>
            <li> It seems to flatten my hair a bit rather than add volume, which I sorely need.  I also hoped for a little more color enhancement.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I continue to spend $$$ on more expensive products when Pantene is available. This conditioner left my wet hair without tangles, and feeling soft without being weighed down or greasy when dry.  The brightening agents did not leave me in fear of having &amp;#34;blue hair&amp;#34;, but did bring out the sparkle and shine I was hoping for.  Also smells great! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Really does keep gray from turning yellow.</li>
            <li> I, like many un-natural blonds, am constantly searching for that perfect toning product to combat brassiness. This is not it. It smells and acts like every other Pantene conditioner, which is great. It&#x27;s just purple. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything as far as toning. I leave it on in the shower for 5 minutes, rinse, and apply a little more as a leave in. My hair hasn&#x27;t changed or improved at all. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> The best choice for silver hair.</li>
            <li> What a surprise! I bought it for the color effect and got the silkiest hair instead!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and thrilled to have found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Really helped make my gray hair more controllable.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to rate this 5 stars, but it&#x27;s not quite hydrating enough to earn that.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is amazing if you have dyed grey hair. I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and I love to bleach and dye my hair all different colors. I bleached my hair to a level 9-10 and then applied Wella cooling additive to make it a nice steel grey. I then use this each time I shower to keep the grey vibrant and avoid going green. This would also be great for blondes who have hair that turns dull or green in water.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is thick and rich, the smell is okay, nothing amazing. I do have to apply a large amount and really work it through my hair as it doesn&#x27;t have much slip. But it does a great job with my parched hair and leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of Patene&#x27;s products for blondes, red heads, but have a really hard time finding their silver highlights products in the store.  Glad I ordered on line and now will have plenty to help me keep my beautiful, silver hair as silvery as possible.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. It makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This conditioner and the matching shampoo is a dream for long gray hair. You can tell that it is there as you rub it in. Take a comb at the end and pull it trough your hair to really get it in. No tangles after that.&lt;br /&gt;Phil</li>
            <li> Great product for keeping blondes and greys from turning brassy, and equally superb at detangling; but, makes my baby fine wavy hair SO limp and greasy. With body being the one thing I like about my hair, that&#x27;s definitely a deal-breaker.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind that dulls my grey.</li>
            <li> I also use the shampoo. Missed this item when it was off the market. Really enhances my white hair. Leaves hair soft but still manageable</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...smells great, leaves my silver/blonde hair nice and soft. Use it every other day or so...</li>
            <li> This is a great product to follow up the \\&quot;Silver Expressions\\&quot; Shampoo!  It works quickly (softens &amp; smooths) and adds to your \\&quot;silver shine\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky smooth after using this conditioner with the shampoo!  Highly recommended for gray or graying hair.  Don&#x27;t use very much, though!</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair which is bleached and highlighted which left my hair dry and brittle. I purchased a purple based toning shampoo which tones my hair but leaves it dry and even more brittle. This conditioner is great as a toner but it isn&#x27;t as concentrated in color as the purple shampoos but if it is left on for long enough it does tone wonderfully. Very satisfied with my purchase and price.</li>
            <li> I have gray hair and was looking for a hair care system that would cater to it.  I found Pantene at my grocery store and started using it.  When my store stopped carrying I checked at Amazon online, and there it was!  I like it it doesn&#x27;t yellow my hair.  The product comes out purple but doesn&#x27;t make my hair purple, just makes my gray nice and shiny!</li>
            <li> This product is the best for my white hair.  For awhile I was useing a different brand, because the CVS store said this was no longer available.</li>
            <li> Having more and more gray hair, I truly appreciate a product which helps keep my hair looking more white than yellow.</li>
            <li> The Silver Expression conditioner I purchased from Amazon and shampoo I purchased on clearance at a drug store worked better than I expected.  Actually I found the Silver E press ions products to work better than another leading name brand I used for years.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my Mom who is 63 and has a touch of gray in her brunette hair.  Her hair has always been oily but is now drying out due to the graying.  I personally use the Pantene Highlighting Expressions for Blondes and love it.  Mom raved about both the shampoo and the conditioner.  It highlights her hair and leaves it silky and shiny.  I can&#x27;t find it at a brick and mortar store and love Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t require you use a lot. Goes on thick and rinses out easily leaving hair soft and natural looking. Enhances gray.</li>
            <li> Along with the shampoo, leaves white hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner.  They do a beautiful job of brightening my (I prefer &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34;) hair, do not effect the color of my dark hair and leave my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps my gray hair beautiful and mousy-free!  Used it for years and always get compliments on my hair because of it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner totally helps my hair to look lighter.. I am so so glad, that i ordered this product..</li>
            <li> Love this Silver Expressions Daily Color Conditioner. It lathers on well and leaves my hair silky smooth as well as brass-free. I keep it in my hair for about 3 minutes before washing it off. I use this conditioner after using Matrix Total Results Color Care So Silver Shampoo. In combination I have noticed that my hair looks better (blond color is more natural and I don&#x27;t need to recolor often) - brass free and silky. Definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine, colored blond. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair (at least not mine). As a reference I live in a 70-80% humidity area.</li>
            <li> What a different this shampoo made. Took the yellow right out of my husbands hair. A great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The Pantene Silver Expressions Conditioner is a great compliment to the Pantene Silver Expressions Shampoo.  I use it every few days to give additional softness to my grey (white) hair.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Gives my grey hair a prettier color.</li>
            <li> Not just great for my silver hair but it&#x27;s the best conditioner I have found for long hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would mellow out the brassy tones after I bleached my hair blonde.  It didn&#x27;t help with that at all, but it was wonderfully gentle, smelled great and helped moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> One: my hair does NOT turn purple from this product. Two: it&#x27;s a conditioner and it acts as such! My hair feels nice and soft after using this during a nice shower.</li>
            <li> It is the best product on the market for me to further remove the dull gray turning it to a white/silver look.  The conditioner is moisturizing on my thick African hair leaving my natural hair softer.  It feels good and smells good.  I prefer this product whenever I can find it.  I get compliments on my hair from all races when I use the conditioner and shampoo combination.</li>
            <li> Love it and so glad I found it, thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Keeps the hair white!</li>
            <li> Always my favorite product for years!  Strongly recommend this to family and friends!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Very nice texture and it makes my gray silver again instead of blonde or brassy.  Good stuff!!  Wish it came as a shampoo/rinse combination like many of their other products.</li>
            <li> i can stop looking for the perfect shampoo for i have found it.  my hair is pure white, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is really nice conditioner.  I have very long mostly gray hair.  I have to use conditioner, and would recommend this product to other.  I like the scent as well.</li>
            <li> this is a great shampoo thanks so much it shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li> i love this product, the smell and the texture of my hair after i use  is unbelievable! Go get It!</li>
            <li> Pantene is a good product does what it says have used it for years couldn&#x27;t find it in my town that why it was ordered</li>
            <li> I am in the process of growing out my gray so after reading about the best shampoo for shine &amp; moisture I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> They shipped this product out pretty fast.  When it came the bottle had opened and I had shampoo in the box, kind of messy.  Probably something just happened in transit.  I am still happy with the product and will order again.  A little advice is to make sure the container lid is closed tightly.  : )</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It leaves my hair silky, lighter and more manageable.  I am going to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Conditioner on my platinum hair left it extremely soft and shining.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t suds up very well with well water (hard), but cleans and keeps the grey the color it should be, instead of light brown tinted.</li>
            <li> Use this product in conjunction  with the shampoo, PANTENDE Silver Expressions.  Together they work for me.  Had tried other products touted for results but at my last haircut when I saw the yellow tinted dingy colored hair instead of silver gray on the floor I knew that results were not as desired.  Searched for another product and found this one.  The supporting shampoo and this product work for me as I paid more attention to my hair color after shampooing and drying.</li>
            <li> This works very well for a grey hair like myself. I don&#x27;t use it daily, more like twice a week. I like it.</li>
            <li> This product really made my hair look and feel good. Seeing the purple color when it comes out of the bottle is a bit disconcerting but the purple did not affect my hair color at all.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, this conditioner, and the Silver Expressions Shampoo, became harder and harder to find.  I finally called Pantene directly and was told the company was discontinuing the Silver Expressions line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Pantene has apparently decided to bring back these 2 terrific products.  I&#x27;m glad they finally came to their senses!  When I realized they were again available on Amazon, if not in my local stores, I quickly bought quite a few bottles, just in case they were discontinued again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as these products are available, I will be buying this conditioner and shampoo.  I recommend them to anyone with graying or silver hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t already tried them, do yourself a favor and order them now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is thick &amp; rich, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down. But what I really love is how it extends the life of my non-permanent dye job. I am a natural blonde starting to go grey. This conditioner has a blue tint which neutralizes brassiness. It adds shine, and somehow it seems to make the line of demarcation between my dyed hair &amp; my roots less noticeable. This helps to prolong my color for several weeks! It&#x27;s getting harder to find this product in a store. So I was so glad to find it here. I hope Pantene continues to make this great product!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff and I wish I could find it in town but the only place to buy it is online.  good price</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner for my blonde highlighted hair.  It keeps the color right and prevents it from being dried out.  Love it!</li>
