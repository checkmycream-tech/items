            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This powder does give your hair lift and the look of more body.  </li>
            <li>The Dust It Powder is a fabulous product, but the ones from this seller are fakes!  </li>
            <li>Tried many many products, skeptical,but decided to order.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>And this price is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>FYI, this dust is the consistency of silica sand and there are a lot of holes in the shaker top.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for anyone with fine hair and the sender was very fast.</li>
            <li>Kind of fun to use!  </li>
            <li>I shall be a forever user, cause after trying so many others,this is incredible ,and only growing thicker hair would be better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff, and when I first started buying from this seller it was great and the real deal.</li>
            <li>I only use it on the top and crown of my hair and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>but it is fine, so it had to be something light weight.</li>
            <li>this is huge flakes, makes you look like you have dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on my short hair.</li>
            <li>and then I take my finger tips and swirl around my head,then lightly style with brush,hair is one inch spiky style.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product, cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li>I use it for the days in between washes or for special occasions.</li>
            <li>were they right!  </li>
            <li>It used to be such a good deal</li>
            <li>Glad I found this product, thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li>Received my order quickly.</li>
            <li>aNd I do not need to wash my hair any more frequent.</li>
            <li>I apply this (lightly) directly to the roots of my hair at the crown and WOW...instant sexy hair.</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for one of these to results, this is definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li>Agree with previous reviewers who advised taping the holes or making sure you&#x27;ve placed your fingers over most of them.</li>
            <li>Have hair down to my waist and need a good root lifter.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I think I will need more in 2 months and will come right back her!!</li>
            <li>The Big Sexy Hair version does not work as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I had to use a lot more to get same result.  </li>
            <li>If I had to I wouldn&#x27;t mind spending 26$ for it because it really works great, and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Best part it only takes small amount!</li>
            <li>I first found out about it a well over a year ago and just recently had to replace my original bottle.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair,thinning as I age,wear very short, scalp will show.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair, so I look for products that add lasting volume and lift.</li>
            <li>The powder feels like talc and comes out fast.  </li>
            <li>You do not need much.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li>Well this stuff is the real deal</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s no worse than hairspray being in your hair.  </li>
            <li>You really have to try it to understand it</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare</li>
            <li>Works like magic.does not get sticky,even hair got wet in rain, and when it dried, combed out beautifully.</li>
            <li>I have fine, blonde hair that gets super flat an hour after styling.</li>
            <li>I am able to fluff in right back into place!</li>
            <li>Plus as a bonus, my normally oily scalp stays dry so that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day and it still looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Just dust a little on through the top of the head and through the crown...</li>
            <li>Take if from someone who has always struggled to get the hairdo&#x27;s that every other girl seems to master easily.   </li>
            <li>It looks similar, but doesn&#x27;t have the same texture as the original product.  </li>
            <li>I had to pop off the top and crush the clumps back down to a powder.  </li>
            <li>Instead of it being a fine powder, it&#x27;s almost like little flakes.  </li>
            <li>Acts a bit like &amp;#34;teasing&amp;#34; hair in days of old.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product thinking I was getting a good deal because the stuff from the salon is so expensive.  </li>
            <li>I opened the lid and put tape over half of the holes because otherwise it comes out too much, too fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not exactly sure what is in this bottle, but it&#x27;s not the original OSIS dust it.</li>
            <li>It makes my fine hair feel thick and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>so I have a hard time finding stuff that I can use in my hair that is scent free and works.</li>
            <li>The powder is clumping and I can barely shake it out of the container.  </li>
            <li>I usually set it with quick-drying hairspray, and a quick zhuzh with your fingertips restores any lost volume as the day (or night) goes on.</li>
            <li>... makes it a little hard to run your fingers through your own hair...</li>
            <li>All I have to do is scrunch throughout the day if I am feeling a little flat and the volume comes right back.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this on my hair and I tried it (very expensive from her salon but more reasonable when purchased on Amazon).  </li>

            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair and I tried it (very expensive from her salon but more reasonable when purchased on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> And it is so much easier than using a mouse or any other product you put on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, coarse hair</li>
            <li> No need to wear a cap when the hair goes flat.</li>
            <li> Ordered the 2 pack several days, after receiving single.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to buy it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Usually have to lightly use a second product after I apply this to my hair to get rid of the dusty look and bring back shine.</li>
            <li> I only shampoo my long hair 3 time a week, the powder stays and is active until I shampoo and reapply...</li>
            <li> If you have a naturally dry scalp this can help get you through those days off from washing.</li>
            <li> It will do the job of holding your hair if you want a dry look or have just straightened your hair and need to style.</li>
            <li> This product does the job of lifting hair up when the hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> The only down side</li>
            <li> Downside is your hair will be super sticky and unable to comb through.  </li>
            <li> Dust at roots then rat a little &#x3D; big hair without hair spray</li>
            <li> Just a little of this powder goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You learn that it only takes a small amount to work.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other brands</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this stuff.</li>
            <li> If you put it at the base of your scalp on top of your head, then your hair will fluff up for the day.  </li>
            <li> Very little goes a long way and I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;need hairspray to hold it.</li>
            <li> It may seem like a small amount but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The main thing I can tell you that I wanted it for is that if you have bands that always are flat, you put this at the base of your bands and they will stay up the entire day.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and heavy and always flat because I cant tease my hair with just hairspray but this dust it powder does the trick and it stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> All it takes is a little sprinkle.</li>
            <li> it ended up working alright, but definitely not as fine as previous orders.  </li>
            <li> You just shake a little of the powder in your fingertips and pt</li>
            <li> Using a powder to create serious volume &amp; texture - sounds crazy, right?</li>
            <li> I guess it adds some amount of volume but is not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Not a good idea when hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and the quality of the 2 containers that I purchased are poor.</li>
            <li> Just a little shake at the roots, use your fingertips to rub it in &amp; create both texture and volume, and VOILA!</li>
            <li> It seemed expensive, but the small cannister will last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ordered from this shipper in the past, and will probably avoid them again.</li>
            <li> i bought this product in the past and it was a powder</li>
            <li> All you do is section your hair, dust in a small amount of this powder at the roots and rub it into your hair.  </li>
            <li> It always ships on time and never been late!</li>
            <li> Also leaves a dusty look in your hair and takes out all shine.</li>
            <li> I use this powder to add volume to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> A small warning - it makes your hair feel really dirty,</li>
            <li> This is expensive and lives your hair sticky .  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look bad but it feels weird.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it does make your hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> this batch seemed bad, like it had been in contact with moisture.  </li>
            <li> or i just got a bad one</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife tried this product as freind intruduced. Seems it  does the job, she was satisfied. The shipment is on time as what said.</li>
            <li> Agree with previous reviewers who advised taping the holes or making sure you&#x27;ve placed your fingers over most of them. The powder feels like talc and comes out fast.  You do not need much.  Part your hair and sprinkle a bit on the scalp and keep working in.  I have long, coarse hair and I can get more body on top that lasts throughout workouts, sweat and humidity.  No need to wear a cap when the hair goes flat.</li>
            <li> It works on my daughters hair &amp; mine! It gives it volume where ever I put it on your head! Best part it only takes small amount!</li>
            <li> way better than greasy, waxy, crunchy hair... makes it a little hard to run your fingers through your own hair... it give it some volume and control.  i have been converted.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I first found out about it a well over a year ago and just recently had to replace my original bottle. It may seem like a small amount but a little goes a long way. I use it for the days in between washes or for special occasions. If you have a naturally dry scalp this can help get you through those days off from washing. It gives you tons of body and makes anyone&#x27;s hair manageable and style-able. Take if from someone who has always struggled to get the hairdo&#x27;s that every other girl seems to master easily.   This stuff works great. I&#x27;ll continue to buy it as long as they make it. P.S. The Big Sexy Hair version does not work as well.</li>
            <li> Goodbye rollers and hair spray.  This product does the trick without presetting.  Best used when there isn&#x27;t a chance of sweating so you keep your fluffiness.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  It makes my fine hair feel thick and luxurious.  My hair stylist introduced me to it a year or so ago and it was amazing the difference it made. It seemed expensive, but the small cannister will last quite a while.  You learn that it only takes a small amount to work.  The only down side it that is makes your hair feel oilier the next day and sometimes you have to use a clarifying shampoo to get it all out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking I was getting a good deal because the stuff from the salon is so expensive.  It looks similar, but doesn&#x27;t have the same texture as the original product.  Instead of it being a fine powder, it&#x27;s almost like little flakes.  I think it still works, somewhat, but it does leave bigger chunks in your hair which could be mistaken for dandruff.  I&#x27;m not exactly sure what is in this bottle, but it&#x27;s not the original OSIS dust it.</li>
            <li> The powder is clumping and I can barely shake it out of the container.  I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and the quality of the 2 containers that I purchased are poor.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! This product is great for anyone with fine hair and the sender was very fast. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my hairdresser used it on my hair. I am allergic to fragrance so I have a hard time finding stuff that I can use in my hair that is scent free and works. This stuff does it. I use it to add volume to my hair. I have a lot of hair but it is fine, so it had to be something light weight. I recommend this product to everyone. Just don&#x27;t use to much. All it takes is a little sprinkle.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  And it is so much easier than using a mouse or any other product you put on wet hair.  Received my order quickly.</li>
            <li> This powder does give your hair lift and the look of more body.  Your hairdo looks good.  A small warning - it makes your hair feel really dirty, like you haven&#x27;t washed it for a week.  But you look good!</li>
            <li> this batch seemed bad, like it had been in contact with moisture.  I had to pop off the top and crush the clumps back down to a powder.  it ended up working alright, but definitely not as fine as previous orders.  I haven&#x27;t ordered from this shipper in the past, and will probably avoid them again.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair, so I look for products that add lasting volume and lift. I use this product on my roots before teasing (back-combing) my hair for extra volume. I finish with hairspray to keep my hair in place, and my hair stays lifted all day.</li>
            <li> Hello! I used the vendor, SuperCoolStuff and boy were they right!  Great stuff at a great price.  I think I will need more in 2 months and will come right back her!!</li>
            <li> It will do the job of holding your hair if you want a dry look or have just straightened your hair and need to style. However, the dust gets everywhere, which wastes so much of the product. Also leaves a dusty look in your hair and takes out all shine. Usually have to lightly use a second product after I apply this to my hair to get rid of the dusty look and bring back shine.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product at my hair stylist. Works great on my short hair. I work in an operating room and my wear a cap. When I come out of the O.R. I am able to fluff in right back into place!</li>
            <li> amazing product for volume, thickening hair, and for hair that gets oily.  Very little goes a long way and I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;need hairspray to hold it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff, and when I first started buying from this seller it was great and the real deal. The last time I purchased it was def not the same product and I had to use a lot more to get same result.  I returned it and won&#x27;t buy off amazon again.  It used to be such a good deal but now I buy it at Ulta.  If you are reviewing for the product, def BUY it, but not through here.</li>
            <li> The Dust It Powder is a fabulous product, but the ones from this seller are fakes!  Do not buy from this seller!</li>
            <li> I love this product -- this is a must have for fine hair!! And it&#x27;s at an excellent price too!</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this stuff. Using a powder to create serious volume &amp; texture - sounds crazy, right? Well this stuff is the real deal and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and I cannot get it big enough - this stuff ALWAYS does the trick! Just a little shake at the roots, use your fingertips to rub it in &amp; create both texture and volume, and VOILA! BIG HAIR FOR DAYS! I usually set it with quick-drying hairspray, and a quick zhuzh with your fingertips restores any lost volume as the day (or night) goes on. Love love love this product, cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> Ordered the 2 pack several days, after receiving single.I have fine hair,thinning as I age,wear very short, scalp will show.Tried many many products, skeptical,but decided to order.I am in awe of this product.Works like magic.does not get sticky,even hair got wet in rain, and when it dried, combed out beautifully. A mist of powder on my crown,and then I take my finger tips and swirl around my head,then lightly style with brush,hair is one inch spiky style.Seems to hold style longer aNd I do not need to wash my hair any more frequent.I shall be a forever user, cause after trying so many others,this is incredible ,and only growing thicker hair would be better.Glad I found this product, thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> i bought this product in the past and it was a powder this is huge flakes, makes you look like you have dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t know if they changed the product or i just got a bad one</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My daughter gave me a bottle several months ago.  Helps my thinning hair stay in place without hairspray, gives it volume and control. I reordered several bottles, don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> This powder is wonderful! Just dust a little on through the top of the head and through the crown...tada...volume! All I have to do is scrunch throughout the day if I am feeling a little flat and the volume comes right back. The dust does not go away...I only shampoo my long hair 3 time a week, the powder stays and is active until I shampoo and reapply...GREAT STUFF![[ASIN:B003N80NUS OSIS Dust It ~ Mattifying Powder by Schwarzkopf .35oz (3 pack)!]]</li>
            <li> I use this powder to add volume to my thin hair. Its also great to mattify oily hair! Its a bit of a hassle to wash off but its really a great product. You can purchase it for 26$ at a salon. I decided to save some money, and ordered two for the price of one. If I had to I wouldn&#x27;t mind spending 26$ for it because it really works great, and last a long time. I had my 1st bottle for 4/5months! Using it twice a week seeing as the hold lasted until I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> I have VERY fine blonde hair. I apply this (lightly) directly to the roots of my hair at the crown and WOW...instant sexy hair. Plus as a bonus, my normally oily scalp stays dry so that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day and it still looks fantastic. Great product. And this price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair and I tried it (very expensive from her salon but more reasonable when purchased on Amazon).  It is absolutely wonderful.  The main thing I can tell you that I wanted it for is that if you have bands that always are flat, you put this at the base of your bands and they will stay up the entire day.  Some people don&#x27;t like the feel of it in their hair for some reason but it&#x27;s no worse than hairspray being in your hair.  If you put it at the base of your scalp on top of your head, then your hair will fluff up for the day.  You really have to try it to understand it but if you are looking for one of these to results, this is definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair is very thick and heavy and always flat because I cant tease my hair with just hairspray but this dust it powder does the trick and it stays for a long time. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product does the job of lifting hair up when the hair is dry.  Not a good idea when hair is wet.  Acts a bit like &amp;#34;teasing&amp;#34; hair in days of old.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Have hair down to my waist and need a good root lifter.  You just shake a little of the powder in your fingertips and pt it where you need it on your hair and your done.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. She says it&#x27;s great so I help her save money and time and order multiple bottles online. It always ships on time and never been late!</li>
            <li> Just a little of this powder goes a long way. Dust at roots then rat a little &#x3D; big hair without hair spray</li>
            <li> This is expensive and lives your hair sticky .  I guess it adds some amount of volume but is not easy to use.  Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well on problem areas of my hair style. I like it, but it does make your hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I have fine, blonde hair that gets super flat an hour after styling. I took this dust along to work and boy does it work!!  All you do is section your hair, dust in a small amount of this powder at the roots and rub it into your hair.  Voila! Your hair will have fullness and body like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I only use it on the top and crown of my hair and it looks great.  It will last until you wash it out. You can refurbish the fullness by rubbing your fingertips on your scalp and freshening it again.  Kind of fun to use!  Downside is your hair will be super sticky and unable to comb through.  It doesn&#x27;t look bad but it feels weird. Had to lather and repeat to get it all to wash out.  My friends at work all tried it and they ended up buying some too.  I haven&#x27;t tried other brands so I can&#x27;t really compare but I would recommend this product.  FYI, this dust is the consistency of silica sand and there are a lot of holes in the shaker top.  I opened the lid and put tape over half of the holes because otherwise it comes out too much, too fast!</li>
            <li> This powder gives my hair the lift i need and i don&#x27;t need to use any hairspray when i use it.</li>
