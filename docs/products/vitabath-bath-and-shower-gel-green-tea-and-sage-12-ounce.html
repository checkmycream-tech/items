            <li>Vitabath shower soaps are the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells and feels wonderful.</li>

            <li>My favorite thing is the awesome scent that both men and women can enjoy so my husband will use it!!</li>

            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>and I love this one!</li>
            <li>Whenever I took a shower with this, I came out smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Pine scented and decided to try the newer ones that they have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice lather.</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely on a bath pouf, but I don&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li>This scent smells nice</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is not to strong and leaves your skin feeling amazing!</li>
            <li>This is the best smelling body wash I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m pretty sure.</li>
            <li>It smells very nice, and the bathroom smells fresh when I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I really, really like this and its great for using it in the bath(s) and shower(s).  </li>
            <li>The fragrance was okay</li>
            <li>and it lathered okay,</li>
            <li>I have been more satisfied by items purchased in the bath wash section of Walmart.</li>
            <li>Mellow more than refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>It is more on the sage side.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my spray-tan colour either.</li>
            <li>I know amazon does that to sell more stuff</li>
            <li>Just purchased my second bottle plus another scent from this brand and am very happy.</li>
            <li>Love ,love, love this shower gel.</li>
            <li>Very clean refreshing scent, too.</li>
            <li>Love this unique body wash!</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for men or someone looking for a very mild smell to no smell product.  </li>
            <li>OK, nothing special for me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rate as a user, just a giver and that seemed fine.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is paraben and sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Looking for a Sulfate and Paraben Free body wash</li>
            <li>I was looking for a paraben free body wash that wouldn&#x27;t bother my psoriasis</li>
            <li>It suds easily and works excellently for shaving (unlike many other natural soaps that stump the razor).</li>
            <li>Fresh clean spa-like scent that my husband can use too!  </li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean not over whelming.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh feeling after shower.</li>
            <li>Great fresh, clean everyday scent!  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I struggle with sensitive skin, so the primary reason I chose this product was because it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>Vitabath agrees with my skin, so have been using other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; for many, many years.</li>
            <li>The original Green is a better scent but this is not a bad smelling product.</li>
            <li>The smell of greentea is very well blended with Fresh smell of Sake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better soap in the same scent for way cheaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich formula that leaves your skin soft but not feeling residue-y as some body washes can.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this two stars, as opposed to one star, because it&#x27;s quite possible that the issue is mine, but I believe that a product that is labeled sulfate free has a certain implication of being mild, and that&#x27;s just not this product.</li>
            <li>Such a clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I still give 4 stars, as it&#x27;s hard to find good bubble bath these days.</li>
            <li>A dime-sized amount into a pouf can make enough suds for a whole comfortable shower with a bit of excess to rinse out.</li>
            <li>so it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 5 different scents, all are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products that I like more.</li>
            <li>but I like the other scents much better.  </li>
            <li>I bought this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; body wash in hopes that it might moisturize better and for less money than what I was using.</li>
            <li>Please continue selling this particular one.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to paraban so this product worked very well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fresh and light and unique, not super sugary or fruity like some other brands.</li>
            <li>I began using Vitabath Spring Green as a teenager :)  </li>
            <li>We bought this Green Tea and Sage body wash because the Lime Citron Basal (which my husband has enjoyed using as a body wash and shampoo) was out of stock.  </li>
            <li>I usually prefer unscented products when available, but this natural scent sounded intriguing.</li>
            <li>I was hoping the scent would be more subtle and have a more green tea/sage scent</li>
            <li>The Green Tea and Sage has a distinctly green, herbal scent that&#x27;s guy friendly but lets ladies still enjoy something aromatic.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this body wash, you definitely get the green tea scent unlike some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>smells great..very refreshing like green tea with a little herbal kick..</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skill and a sulfate allergy.</li>

            <li> my spouse and I need a body wash that doesn&#x27;t dry our skin out</li>
            <li> I will definitely try other scents!</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times, but I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Hope it will help my itchy and rough winter skin.</li>
            <li> Look no further than Vitabath&#x27;s Bath and Shower Gel in Green Tea and Sage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for the cost of the bottle it was just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth what they are charging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted quite a few months.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like green tea at all in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else is in it, but it is extremely irritating.  </li>
            <li> To say the least it was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> He was disappointed because the Green Tea was thinner and didn&#x27;t work well as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> For the males out there uncomfortable with dousing themselves in the scent of cupcakes and assorted fruits will appreciate this gender-neutral scent.</li>

            <li> Nice clean scent. The smell of greentea is very well blended with Fresh smell of Sake. It contains aloe as well so it is very moisturizing. Love this unique body wash! Please continue selling this particular one. I will buy it again.</li>

            <li> This is the best smelling body wash I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m pretty sure. I&#x27;ll probably keep this stocked for years to come.</li>
            <li> I bought several different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Vitabath for a gift. I can&#x27;t rate as a user, just a giver and that seemed fine. But I recall not being overwhelmed by the fragrances I chose (which were maybe 5 total). I still give 4 stars, as it&#x27;s hard to find good bubble bath these days.</li>
            <li> The original Green is a better scent but this is not a bad smelling product. Scent does not stay on the skin for very long. Mellow more than refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Not as good as their Pine scented. This shower gel is too perfumey. I was hoping the scent would be more subtle and have a more green tea/sage scent but it smells like perfume. I really liked the Pine scented and decided to try the newer ones that they have.&lt;br /&gt;My wife gave some of them away and I don&#x27;t like when she showers with it.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I struggle with sensitive skin, so the primary reason I chose this product was because it is sulfate free.  I don&#x27;t know what else is in it, but it is extremely irritating.  It smells very nice, and the bathroom smells fresh when I get out of the shower.

            <li> This product smelled so good!! It doesn&#x27;t smell like green tea at all in my opinion. It is more on the sage side. Whenever I took a shower with this, I came out smelling amazing. It just feels luxurious to me!</li>
            <li> Fresh clean spa-like scent that my husband can use too!  I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my spray-tan colour either.</li>
            <li> Great fresh, clean everyday scent!  Nice lather.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but I wish it wasn&#x27;t an add on item I know amazon does that to sell more stuff but I still don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I do  not use soaps. Vitabath agrees with my skin, so have been using other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; for many, many years.</li>
            <li> I bought this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; body wash in hopes that it might moisturize better and for less money than what I was using. It doesn&#x27;t, and I still have to use body lotion afterwards. Lathers up nicely on a bath pouf, but I don&#x27;t care for the scent. I usually prefer unscented products when available, but this natural scent sounded intriguing. Still, it&#x27;s not offensive, some may like it  and I&#x27;m getting used to it. I will finish out the bottle since I paid for it, but probably won&#x27;t order another.</li>
            <li> OK, nothing special for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  I&#x27;ve used other products that I like more.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Vitabath bath gels!  This scent smells nice but I like the other scents much better.  I bought this scent for my husband because I didn&#x27;t want it to smell too girly on him.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to paraban so this product worked very well for that purpose.  I would recommend this for men or someone looking for a very mild smell to no smell product.  I gave this to my grandson because he has the same type of skin condition I do.</li>
            <li> Looking for a Sulfate and Paraben Free body wash that&#x27;s unisex? Look no further than Vitabath&#x27;s Bath and Shower Gel in Green Tea and Sage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my spouse and I need a body wash that doesn&#x27;t dry our skin out but he doesn&#x27;t care for the girly scents I gravitate toward. The Green Tea and Sage has a distinctly green, herbal scent that&#x27;s guy friendly but lets ladies still enjoy something aromatic. It&#x27;s a rich formula that leaves your skin soft but not feeling residue-y as some body washes can.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body wash, you definitely get the green tea scent unlike some other products I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s really fresh and light and unique, not super sugary or fruity like some other brands. It lathers up nicely and leaves you feeling clean.

            <li> Not worth what they are charging. I&#x27;ve used better soap in the same scent for way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.  Feels invigorating when applied to the skin.  Clean fresh feeling after shower.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a paraben free body wash that wouldn&#x27;t bother my psoriasis and I love this one! My favorite thing is the awesome scent that both men and women can enjoy so my husband will use it!!</li>
            <li> smells great..very refreshing like green tea with a little herbal kick..came quickly and in perfect condition..I will definitely try other scents!</li>
            <li> Love ,love, love this shower gel. Such a clean and fresh scent. Makes me feel rejuvenated each time I shower!</li>
            <li> We bought this Green Tea and Sage body wash because the Lime Citron Basal (which my husband has enjoyed using as a body wash and shampoo) was out of stock.  He was disappointed because the Green Tea was thinner and didn&#x27;t work well as a shampoo.</li>
