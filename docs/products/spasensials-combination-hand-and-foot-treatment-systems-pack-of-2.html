    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>best of luck this winter.</li>
            <li>The smell was delightfully herbal with a touch of florals.  </li>
            <li>Attractive packaging!</li>
            <li>I was honestly impressed.</li>
            <li>I was impressed again.  </li>
            <li>I think the best part of the product was the buff you use on your feet before putting the socks on.</li>
            <li>These are especially great for your feet!!  </li>
            <li>SpaSenials Combination Hand and Foot Treatment systems is a great way to paper yourself and would make an awesome gift for the women in your life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this before I rememberd how my Great Grandmother used to soften her hands.  </li>
            <li>This promised to be some kind of wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, I reiterate, the product smelled and felt great, and since I have Amazon Prime, I received it promptly within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My feet feel great in the morning! :)</li>
            <li>I thought there might be some pleasant</li>
            <li>It was rather pleasant to slip into the gloves for the hand and for the feet.</li>
            <li>However, the lotion inside did moisturize and had a pleasant</li>
            <li>My husband laughed when I came out, looking like a mummy, for the 15-minute application period.</li>
            <li>- Feels good - for awhile    </li>
            <li>The gloves are surprisingly well made (I&#x27;m amazed they&#x27;re made to be thrown away.</li>
            <li>I was a good girl and followed all the directions closely,  and I have to say...  </li>
            <li>I think these would be good for people who don&#x27;t like rubbing lotions on their hands and feet three times a day.</li>
            <li>The good: The product had a wonderful aroma, the wash felt good, and when I pulled the socks off my skin felt smooth and refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The socks are comfortable while in place, and the moisturizers make your feet feel great!!</li>
            <li>i am loving these and wish i had gotten more!!</li>
            <li>The product does, after a fashion, work and the scent is nice, but a product that makes my skin crawl while using it, no matter how nice the result, is NOT indicative of any spa experience I ever had!</li>
            <li>You better put on a tv show or something!</li>
            <li>I love wearing them over night!</li>
            <li>This product is nice.  </li>
            <li>I even reused the gloves one time, using my own hand cream.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice gift for someone who needs some pampering.</li>
            <li>I removed the gloves, and my hands just felt sticky, kind of waxy but without the wax.</li>
            <li>I actually liked the foot exfoliator.</li>
            <li>She was pleased and thought it was a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The SpaSensials kit is a nice home spa treatment.</li>
            <li>Got one of those mood candles handy?  </li>
            <li>- Smells great  - Economic   - Exfoliating scrub very effective  </li>
            <li>Though the product was good it really wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>The good news was that in spite of warnings that the socks were slippery, I found that they gave plenty of grip and I was fine walking, even on stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave it a five stars because it is trully the best product I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>This time I dampened paper towels and put them between the heating pad/gloves - this turned out to be the best way so far.  </li>
            <li>I got these as a Gold Box deal and my wife really thinks they make her feet feel great.</li>
            <li>I did notice some softness after the treatment-but not any more than I&#x27;ve noticed after applying store bought lotion.  </li>
            <li>I feel more noticible improvment should be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure to take rings off while using gloves.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find anything disposable to be particularly &#x27;innovative&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper, smarter, more eco, and you won&#x27;t look like a clown in gloves.</li>
            <li>My hands and feet feel much better after the treatment, but maybe it will take a couple more times before they are fully moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I suppose these are &#x27;ok&#x27; for what you get.  </li>
            <li>The feet felt OK, though.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many hand creams,  face balms, lotions of all kinds that I have.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So try it with confidence :)</li>
            <li>When I first had the opportunity to try the SpaSensials product, I was thrilled!  </li>
            <li>so I observe more than most people, I am sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>get better results from some creams than I do this.  </li>
            <li>review indicates that this is nothing more than an application of lotion</li>
            <li>when I thought a bit more about heat realized that I had two heating pads, one of which was intended for &#x27;moist heat&#x27;</li>
            <li>It seemed to get things softened up better than my pumice</li>
            <li>I would buy them for her again, and all of her comments indicated her hands were softer and felt much better after use.</li>
            <li>She liked how they worked, but she didn&#x27;t think they were that much better than some of the really good lotions she normally uses.    </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The foot treatment, however was more effective because the kit includes a sloughly cloth which did an impressive job of smoothing my heavy callouses.</li>
            <li>The scrub seems moderately effective (the idea is great, although larger granules might be a better idea.</li>
            <li>I suppose the best thing would be to use in a shower or bath and then get out, dry off and don the socks and gloves.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for dry skin caused from heat etc during the winter months.</li>
            <li>The cool moisturizing feel during the treatment was nice, and my hands and feet felt fine after the treatment.  </li>
            <li>Seemed like a good idea, but how did it work out in real life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Advanced Technology helps SpaSensials intensive conditioning formula to quickly and effectively absorb into the skin\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it really is as good as a good pedicure,  and much better than an average one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t stand out as an EXCEPTIONAL product.</li>
            <li>I liked using the SpaSensials, but the end result doesn&#x27;t justify the much higher cost of the product.</li>
            <li>I wear a size 10 shoe, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting that the booties would be an easy fit.</li>
            <li>You can get just as good or superior moisturizers not in coated sockies and gloves for much less.</li>
            <li>feet actually felt great, and smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li>A nice spa treatment for \\&quot;Me Time\\&quot; and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>- they barely fit my size</li>
            <li>This is a great item for couples, especially if your s/</li>
            <li>of course I can think of plenty of ways to do this at home with what is available but</li>
            <li>How can that compare to a perfume costing many, many times as much (some over a hundred dollars)</li>
            <li>fragrance of the moisturizer was lovely so all of my efforts were not lost, but I would like to see someone come out with a better more effective product that really leaves skin truly moisturized for more than half a 24 hour period.cks.    </li>
            <li>The fragrance of the moisturizer was lovely so all of my efforts were not lost, but I would like to see someone come out with a better more effective product that really leaves skin truly moisturized for more than half a 24 hour period.</li>
            <li>knowing quite a bit about moisturizing treatments and after reading the instructions, I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how to use it.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It felt nice and the cleanser was pretty decent, although there seemed to be more suds than anything substantial (I am a person who is very interested in cleansing agents</li>
            <li>This is a great \\&quot;band-aid\\&quot; treatment for emergency foot situations (say you&#x27;re going to be wearing strappy shoes and your feet are dry and unmanaged).</li>
            <li>But, it was nothing special.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating scrub seemed to work well, more for a scrubbing wash than a real exfoliation, in my case.  </li>
            <li>As someone who lives in a rural area, I have good use for hand and feet softening products.  </li>
            <li>This is true-</li>
            <li>She just didn&#x27;t think they offered much above a good skin lotion.</li>
            <li>At first they felt pretty nice, but honestly, I get the same experience from putting on hand or body lotion and putting on gloves or socks.  </li>
            <li>The product seems primarily targeted for women, so the gloves and socks just barely fit my large man&#x27;s hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>night while we had family movie night, I quickly opened the box to prepare to be pampered.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that they&#x27;re relatively inexpensive on Amazon, so it&#x27;s worth it to keep some on hand.</li>
            <li>I soaked my hands for a minute in warm water to open the pores and make it more ready for the glove treatment.    </li>
            <li>The lotion in the SpaSensials smells &amp; feels nice, but my main reaction was that I didn&#x27;t find this product to be any more effective than my usual routine (rubbing lotion on my feet and then putting on a pair of ankle socks).</li>
            <li>This product will come in handy once the snow hits but until then, it hasn&#x27;t been tried to its full potential.</li>
            <li>This product is very convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While my hands and feet were definitely more moisturized in the end, I think it would be more environmentally friendly (with the same results) just to apply some very intensive cream and use socks and gloves.</li>
            <li>The advent of \\&quot;free and clear\\&quot; detergents is a positive trend, so I am dismayed that this spa product does not have a fragrance-free option.</li>
            <li>The sock size itself was fine, but it hurt the top of my foot to put it on and remove it since the stitching on top was so tight.</li>
            <li>I, for one, would prefer to spend fifteen bucks more to get pampered by a trained pedicurist than mess with my own treatment at home.</li>
            <li>the gloves are large but comfortable.</li>
            <li>Kind of similar,</li>
            <li>Is it worth the $10 price tag for two applications?  </li>
            <li>I had ordered it thinking these are some soft reusable cotton gloves that can be used with my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was nice to have a \\&quot;Spa\\</li>
            <li>But this is worth the fifteen minutes of relaxation that they give you.</li>
            <li>Once that&#x27;s done, you work it in and your feet feel fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>Intensive Care is great and plain cotton gloves.</li>
            <li>this invention is a very smart idea.</li>
            <li>I tried the foot and hand treatments and my dry and rough skin felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>The cleansing/scrub sponge provides a nice cleaning and exfoliation, even if you have super rough heels.</li>
            <li>They felt very much like something you would wear in a hospital, not a spa.</li>
            <li>This treament was painless, easy, low-cost and very practical for a very busy mom.  </li>
            <li>The idea of a disposable system for deeply moisturizing your feet and hands, that sounds like a winner if you&#x27;re not terribly worried about the environment and like the convenience factor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite understand the totally different results from foot to hand, but since this is packaged as a kit, I would not be able to purchase the socks</li>
            <li>Very soothing!</li>
            <li>It does not smell funny.  </li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;m pretty diligent with keeping up with the callouses via my trust pumice stone, I wasn&#x27;t in the \\&quot;cracked, dry\\</li>
            <li>If you pull on the front part first, it&#x27;s easier to slip on.</li>
            <li>Added to that the socks and gloves feel more papery than cloth and the socks actually tore a bit going onto to my size 9.5</li>
            <li>I got my package in the mail, I planned that evening to try my first application.  </li>
            <li>sticking by the instructions exactly,</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in a spa they will slather on lotions (whatever concoction is hip that day), wrap the body parts with whatever they use to keep the lotion in place (plastic, linen strips, leaves ;)and then they apply heat in the form of steamed towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I put the gloves on after washing my feet, I took the gloves off first.  </li>
            <li>When she&#x27;d get up the next morning she&#x27;d have the softest, smoothest and most moist hands.</li>
            <li>- I absolutely agree if these are used right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a pumice stone afterward, but the exfoliator was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>A friend used the other pair and liked how her hands and feet felt.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it is not as effective as professional treatments.</li>
            <li>If you can stand the way they feel - which is utter yuck - they&#x27;d be great to keep and use for some other purpose.)    </li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t compare to a pedicure.</li>
            <li>And they certainly do the job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The outstanding feature that I liked was that my skin did not feel the least bit greasy, but just a lot more moist than usual.</li>
            <li>most of the other Vine reviewers have reviewed this product pretty well,  but here are my pros and cons of trying this product.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think that it does very much - and certainly in my experience doesnot live up to its claim.  </li>
            <li>Just 15 minutes really made a difference and left both hands and feet smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will be very thankful.</li>
            <li>I have found if you stretch the footies several times they then will fit well.</li>
            <li>You can add \\&quot;neosporin\\&quot; and really helps to heal any cracks that are already there.  </li>
            <li>The whole \\&quot;use and toss\\&quot; mindset needs to stop because it does nothing for our world.  </li>
            <li>After reading some reviews, one of the complaints seemed to be that the hand moisturizer didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t recommend this product, but that&#x27;s because I absolutely loathe the pruney, dimpled feeling you get when you use them.</li>
            <li>You add water to activate the soap, and start scrubbing gently -</li>
            <li>The gloves were much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Come to think of it, maybe that is the real benefit of the gloves/socks</li>
            <li>I really planned to use these.  </li>
            <li>(the gloves don&#x27;t prevent you from doing much).  </li>
            <li>My feet were really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I thought this product would really help restore some softness to my feet.</li>
            <li>however, if you are really wanting the gloves too, then consider what happened to</li>
            <li>Being sensitive to most perfumes, I&#x27;m on  constant search for items that won&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I spent a great deal of time barefoot which is killer to the skin, so I have very rough feet.</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to follow and the product fit fine, but I felt silly sitting around with my hands and feet in socks for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have some other moisturizing creams that do a better job than this does- without gloves and socks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The easy to use slip on gloves or booties begin healing dry, cracked skin</li>
            <li>This is a quick moisturizing treatment, one that you can accomplish in quick 15 minutes while doing other things.</li>
            <li>So when I received this very light box with this oddly shaped scrubbing device and 2 pairs of socks and gloves, I have to admit I was a bit dubious.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;1-the labeling is a bit misleading:  since most users will do both the hands and feet at the same time there is actually 2 treatments in the box,</li>
            <li>I tend to get dry hands and feet and the thought of placing a glove and sock on with high intensity moisturizing capabilities was a very exciting prospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; Treatment at home without paying the high spa price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I do have a problem with dry hands and feet in the winter, and I have to tell you, this product did an excellent job on my rough, dry skin, especially on the soles of my feet which get downright leathery.  </li>
            <li>I used the rough side for exfoliating my feet, and I use the smooth side for cleansing them.  </li>
            <li>they are a rare occasion gift as lotion with white socks</li>
            <li>unique scratch/sponge is loaded with foaming cream to help remove the brittle pieces that crack on your heels but refuse to let loose without a pair of scissors.  </li>
            <li>But it certainly is more effective and less messy than my prior attempts at moisturizing by smearing myself with Vaseline Intensive Care.</li>
            <li>This is far more sanitary and less</li>
            <li>On the very first use I noticed that my skin did feel considerably softer, very similar to the result I get from a parafin dip.  </li>
            <li>First off, putting on the gloves and socks were extremely confortable and gives a cool, tingly feeling and fit nice and snug (on me at least, not sure if they are really one size fits all).  </li>
            <li>It does what it promises in a new manner.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have a particular smell, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>That feeling went away a bit after washing hands the next morning, but I don&#x27;t know how much more could be expected from a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>leaves your hands and feet very soft.</li>
            <li>The kit of balms and gloves/socks makes it easy to spa yourself at home, with reduced mess or fuss.  </li>
            <li>first thing I did was open the exfoliating buff.  </li>
            <li>Once I let them \\&quot;dry\\&quot; off, so to speak, my skin did get very soft, which surprised me -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some professional treatments, such as manicures and paraffin dips for special occasions or gifts, but cannot afford such luxuries on a continual basis.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this product as I have dry cracked skin, especially on my feet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: the box clearly states that there are 2 buff pads, 2 socks and 2 gloves.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the SpaSensials hand and foot treatments for those reasons.  </li>
            <li>The gloves and socks fit snugly enough that you can actually put them on and go about your daily routines while you wait for the 15 minutes to remove them.  </li>
            <li>Also, this is recommended for people with sensitive skin, and believe me, mine is.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for soft hands and feet - get some burt bee coconut foot cream, apply and put cotton socks/gloves on.</li>
            <li>Leaves hand and feet soft.  </li>
            <li>You WILL be surprised with the result.    </li>
            <li>could not wait to have my soft hands and feet after doing this process.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s outside much of the time</li>
            <li>opened the box, and much to my surprise and chagrin, this was only 2 applications.  </li>
            <li>that soft.  </li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that the product simply wasn&#x27;t that effective.</li>
            <li>Yes it can be a bit more messy, but I could use plastic bags from the vegetable dept under the socks and get the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved that the treatment for hands and feet together took only about 20 minutes, a far cry less time than scheduling at a salon, for much less money.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from seriously dry skin during the winter, so I am always interested in anything that can help with that problem.</li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s an avid gardener) and thus has a problem with dry, cracked hands and feet.</li>
            <li>My hands were a mess (dry and chapped from yard work and lots of hand washings) and did feel significantly better after using these with HEAT.</li>
            <li>The scent of the moisturizer is subtly floral but not overly perfumey, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a turnoff for most men.</li>
            <li>I tried the hand treatments out right away and, while it gave me some relief in the short term, the effects were not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li>It felt a little odd at first- sort of like wearing plastic gloves on a very humid hot day.  </li>
            <li>It really was non-stellar in performance after such a short time that I have given it 1 star.  </li>
            <li>His hands look better, not perfect, but a lot better and not nearly as many cracks as last year.</li>
            <li>I think it was a personal feel, as I don&#x27;t really suffer from dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I think that this product needs at least to have S, M and L sizes before it can really be workable for those who don&#x27;t happen to fit the designer&#x27;s average size.    </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not certain she was the target audience for this particular application.</li>
            <li>I have larger feet and am usually suspicious of \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot;, although in this case the socks seem to be adequate.     </li>
            <li>7 feet  - effects do not last long - I had to apply my normal hand lotion again the next day  </li>
            <li>my horned calloused feet are actually softer,  and not only that,  but the effect has lasted for much longer than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked particularly well during the winter after a long morning of shoveling and building snowmen and then again this weekend after a very long day of Spring preparation in our yard.  </li>
            <li>When I used the product my hands and feet were soft but still dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if you actually get your money&#x27;s worth out of this product.</li>
            <li>However, there are no long term effects - you would have to repeat the same treatment daily in order to keep the softness.</li>

            <li> best of luck this winter.</li>
            <li> The smell was delightfully herbal with a touch of florals.  </li>
            <li> Attractive packaging!</li>
            <li> I was honestly impressed.</li>
            <li> I was impressed again.  </li>
            <li> I think the best part of the product was the buff you use on your feet before putting the socks on.</li>
            <li> These are especially great for your feet!!  </li>
            <li> SpaSenials Combination Hand and Foot Treatment systems is a great way to paper yourself and would make an awesome gift for the women in your life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this before I rememberd how my Great Grandmother used to soften her hands.  </li>
            <li> This promised to be some kind of wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, I reiterate, the product smelled and felt great, and since I have Amazon Prime, I received it promptly within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My feet feel great in the morning! :)</li>
            <li> I thought there might be some pleasant</li>
            <li> It was rather pleasant to slip into the gloves for the hand and for the feet.</li>
            <li> However, the lotion inside did moisturize and had a pleasant</li>
            <li> My husband laughed when I came out, looking like a mummy, for the 15-minute application period.</li>
            <li> - Feels good - for awhile    </li>
            <li> The gloves are surprisingly well made (I&#x27;m amazed they&#x27;re made to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> I was a good girl and followed all the directions closely,  and I have to say...  </li>
            <li> I think these would be good for people who don&#x27;t like rubbing lotions on their hands and feet three times a day.</li>
            <li> The good: The product had a wonderful aroma, the wash felt good, and when I pulled the socks off my skin felt smooth and refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The socks are comfortable while in place, and the moisturizers make your feet feel great!!</li>
            <li> i am loving these and wish i had gotten more!!</li>
            <li> The product does, after a fashion, work and the scent is nice, but a product that makes my skin crawl while using it, no matter how nice the result, is NOT indicative of any spa experience I ever had!</li>
            <li> You better put on a tv show or something!</li>
            <li> I love wearing them over night!</li>
            <li> This product is nice.  </li>
            <li> I even reused the gloves one time, using my own hand cream.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice gift for someone who needs some pampering.</li>
            <li> I removed the gloves, and my hands just felt sticky, kind of waxy but without the wax.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the foot exfoliator.</li>
            <li> She was pleased and thought it was a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The SpaSensials kit is a nice home spa treatment.</li>
            <li> Got one of those mood candles handy?  </li>
            <li> - Smells great  - Economic   - Exfoliating scrub very effective  </li>
            <li> Though the product was good it really wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> The good news was that in spite of warnings that the socks were slippery, I found that they gave plenty of grip and I was fine walking, even on stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave it a five stars because it is trully the best product I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> This time I dampened paper towels and put them between the heating pad/gloves - this turned out to be the best way so far.  </li>
            <li> I got these as a Gold Box deal and my wife really thinks they make her feet feel great.</li>
            <li> I did notice some softness after the treatment-but not any more than I&#x27;ve noticed after applying store bought lotion.  </li>
            <li> I feel more noticible improvment should be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> make sure to take rings off while using gloves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find anything disposable to be particularly &#x27;innovative&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper, smarter, more eco, and you won&#x27;t look like a clown in gloves.</li>
            <li> My hands and feet feel much better after the treatment, but maybe it will take a couple more times before they are fully moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I suppose these are &#x27;ok&#x27; for what you get.  </li>
            <li> The feet felt OK, though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many hand creams,  face balms, lotions of all kinds that I have.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So try it with confidence :)</li>
            <li> When I first had the opportunity to try the SpaSensials product, I was thrilled!  </li>
            <li> so I observe more than most people, I am sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> get better results from some creams than I do this.  </li>
            <li> review indicates that this is nothing more than an application of lotion</li>
            <li> when I thought a bit more about heat realized that I had two heating pads, one of which was intended for &#x27;moist heat&#x27;</li>
            <li> It seemed to get things softened up better than my pumice</li>
            <li> I would buy them for her again, and all of her comments indicated her hands were softer and felt much better after use.</li>
            <li> She liked how they worked, but she didn&#x27;t think they were that much better than some of the really good lotions she normally uses.    </li>
            <li> They are easy to use and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The foot treatment, however was more effective because the kit includes a sloughly cloth which did an impressive job of smoothing my heavy callouses.</li>
            <li> The scrub seems moderately effective (the idea is great, although larger granules might be a better idea.</li>
            <li> I suppose the best thing would be to use in a shower or bath and then get out, dry off and don the socks and gloves.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for dry skin caused from heat etc during the winter months.</li>
            <li> The cool moisturizing feel during the treatment was nice, and my hands and feet felt fine after the treatment.  </li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea, but how did it work out in real life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Advanced Technology helps SpaSensials intensive conditioning formula to quickly and effectively absorb into the skin\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it really is as good as a good pedicure,  and much better than an average one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t stand out as an EXCEPTIONAL product.</li>
            <li> I liked using the SpaSensials, but the end result doesn&#x27;t justify the much higher cost of the product.</li>
            <li> I wear a size 10 shoe, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting that the booties would be an easy fit.</li>
            <li> You can get just as good or superior moisturizers not in coated sockies and gloves for much less.</li>
            <li> feet actually felt great, and smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li> A nice spa treatment for \\&quot;Me Time\\&quot; and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> - they barely fit my size</li>
            <li> This is a great item for couples, especially if your s/</li>
            <li> of course I can think of plenty of ways to do this at home with what is available but</li>
            <li> How can that compare to a perfume costing many, many times as much (some over a hundred dollars)</li>
            <li> fragrance of the moisturizer was lovely so all of my efforts were not lost, but I would like to see someone come out with a better more effective product that really leaves skin truly moisturized for more than half a 24 hour period.cks.    </li>
            <li> The fragrance of the moisturizer was lovely so all of my efforts were not lost, but I would like to see someone come out with a better more effective product that really leaves skin truly moisturized for more than half a 24 hour period.</li>
            <li> knowing quite a bit about moisturizing treatments and after reading the instructions, I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how to use it.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It felt nice and the cleanser was pretty decent, although there seemed to be more suds than anything substantial (I am a person who is very interested in cleansing agents</li>
            <li> This is a great \\&quot;band-aid\\&quot; treatment for emergency foot situations (say you&#x27;re going to be wearing strappy shoes and your feet are dry and unmanaged).</li>
            <li> But, it was nothing special.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating scrub seemed to work well, more for a scrubbing wash than a real exfoliation, in my case.  </li>
            <li> As someone who lives in a rural area, I have good use for hand and feet softening products.  </li>
            <li> This is true-</li>
            <li> She just didn&#x27;t think they offered much above a good skin lotion.</li>
            <li> At first they felt pretty nice, but honestly, I get the same experience from putting on hand or body lotion and putting on gloves or socks.  </li>
            <li> The product seems primarily targeted for women, so the gloves and socks just barely fit my large man&#x27;s hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> night while we had family movie night, I quickly opened the box to prepare to be pampered.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that they&#x27;re relatively inexpensive on Amazon, so it&#x27;s worth it to keep some on hand.</li>
            <li> I soaked my hands for a minute in warm water to open the pores and make it more ready for the glove treatment.    </li>
            <li> The lotion in the SpaSensials smells &amp; feels nice, but my main reaction was that I didn&#x27;t find this product to be any more effective than my usual routine (rubbing lotion on my feet and then putting on a pair of ankle socks).</li>
            <li> This product will come in handy once the snow hits but until then, it hasn&#x27;t been tried to its full potential.</li>
            <li> This product is very convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While my hands and feet were definitely more moisturized in the end, I think it would be more environmentally friendly (with the same results) just to apply some very intensive cream and use socks and gloves.</li>
            <li> The advent of \\&quot;free and clear\\&quot; detergents is a positive trend, so I am dismayed that this spa product does not have a fragrance-free option.</li>
            <li> The sock size itself was fine, but it hurt the top of my foot to put it on and remove it since the stitching on top was so tight.</li>
            <li> I, for one, would prefer to spend fifteen bucks more to get pampered by a trained pedicurist than mess with my own treatment at home.</li>
            <li> the gloves are large but comfortable.</li>
            <li> Kind of similar,</li>
            <li> Is it worth the $10 price tag for two applications?  </li>
            <li> I had ordered it thinking these are some soft reusable cotton gloves that can be used with my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was nice to have a \\&quot;Spa\\</li>
            <li> But this is worth the fifteen minutes of relaxation that they give you.</li>
            <li> Once that&#x27;s done, you work it in and your feet feel fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> Intensive Care is great and plain cotton gloves.</li>
            <li> this invention is a very smart idea.</li>
            <li> I tried the foot and hand treatments and my dry and rough skin felt wonderful.</li>
            <li> The cleansing/scrub sponge provides a nice cleaning and exfoliation, even if you have super rough heels.</li>
            <li> They felt very much like something you would wear in a hospital, not a spa.</li>
            <li> This treament was painless, easy, low-cost and very practical for a very busy mom.  </li>
            <li> The idea of a disposable system for deeply moisturizing your feet and hands, that sounds like a winner if you&#x27;re not terribly worried about the environment and like the convenience factor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand the totally different results from foot to hand, but since this is packaged as a kit, I would not be able to purchase the socks</li>
            <li> Very soothing!</li>
            <li> It does not smell funny.  </li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;m pretty diligent with keeping up with the callouses via my trust pumice stone, I wasn&#x27;t in the \\&quot;cracked, dry\\</li>
            <li> If you pull on the front part first, it&#x27;s easier to slip on.</li>
            <li> Added to that the socks and gloves feel more papery than cloth and the socks actually tore a bit going onto to my size 9.5</li>
            <li> I got my package in the mail, I planned that evening to try my first application.  </li>
            <li> sticking by the instructions exactly,</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in a spa they will slather on lotions (whatever concoction is hip that day), wrap the body parts with whatever they use to keep the lotion in place (plastic, linen strips, leaves ;)and then they apply heat in the form of steamed towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I put the gloves on after washing my feet, I took the gloves off first.  </li>
            <li> When she&#x27;d get up the next morning she&#x27;d have the softest, smoothest and most moist hands.</li>
            <li> - I absolutely agree if these are used right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a pumice stone afterward, but the exfoliator was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> A friend used the other pair and liked how her hands and feet felt.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it is not as effective as professional treatments.</li>
            <li> If you can stand the way they feel - which is utter yuck - they&#x27;d be great to keep and use for some other purpose.)    </li>
            <li> It certainly didn&#x27;t compare to a pedicure.</li>
            <li> And they certainly do the job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The outstanding feature that I liked was that my skin did not feel the least bit greasy, but just a lot more moist than usual.</li>
            <li> most of the other Vine reviewers have reviewed this product pretty well,  but here are my pros and cons of trying this product.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think that it does very much - and certainly in my experience doesnot live up to its claim.  </li>
            <li> Just 15 minutes really made a difference and left both hands and feet smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Your skin will be very thankful.</li>
            <li> I have found if you stretch the footies several times they then will fit well.</li>
            <li> You can add \\&quot;neosporin\\&quot; and really helps to heal any cracks that are already there.  </li>
            <li> The whole \\&quot;use and toss\\&quot; mindset needs to stop because it does nothing for our world.  </li>
            <li> After reading some reviews, one of the complaints seemed to be that the hand moisturizer didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t recommend this product, but that&#x27;s because I absolutely loathe the pruney, dimpled feeling you get when you use them.</li>
            <li> You add water to activate the soap, and start scrubbing gently -</li>
            <li> The gloves were much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Come to think of it, maybe that is the real benefit of the gloves/socks</li>
            <li> I really planned to use these.  </li>
            <li> (the gloves don&#x27;t prevent you from doing much).  </li>
            <li> My feet were really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I thought this product would really help restore some softness to my feet.</li>
            <li> however, if you are really wanting the gloves too, then consider what happened to</li>
            <li> Being sensitive to most perfumes, I&#x27;m on  constant search for items that won&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I spent a great deal of time barefoot which is killer to the skin, so I have very rough feet.</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to follow and the product fit fine, but I felt silly sitting around with my hands and feet in socks for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have some other moisturizing creams that do a better job than this does- without gloves and socks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The easy to use slip on gloves or booties begin healing dry, cracked skin</li>
            <li> This is a quick moisturizing treatment, one that you can accomplish in quick 15 minutes while doing other things.</li>
            <li> So when I received this very light box with this oddly shaped scrubbing device and 2 pairs of socks and gloves, I have to admit I was a bit dubious.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;1-the labeling is a bit misleading:  since most users will do both the hands and feet at the same time there is actually 2 treatments in the box,</li>
            <li> I tend to get dry hands and feet and the thought of placing a glove and sock on with high intensity moisturizing capabilities was a very exciting prospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; Treatment at home without paying the high spa price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I do have a problem with dry hands and feet in the winter, and I have to tell you, this product did an excellent job on my rough, dry skin, especially on the soles of my feet which get downright leathery.  </li>
            <li> I used the rough side for exfoliating my feet, and I use the smooth side for cleansing them.  </li>
            <li> they are a rare occasion gift as lotion with white socks</li>
            <li> unique scratch/sponge is loaded with foaming cream to help remove the brittle pieces that crack on your heels but refuse to let loose without a pair of scissors.  </li>
            <li> But it certainly is more effective and less messy than my prior attempts at moisturizing by smearing myself with Vaseline Intensive Care.</li>
            <li> This is far more sanitary and less</li>
            <li> On the very first use I noticed that my skin did feel considerably softer, very similar to the result I get from a parafin dip.  </li>
            <li> First off, putting on the gloves and socks were extremely confortable and gives a cool, tingly feeling and fit nice and snug (on me at least, not sure if they are really one size fits all).  </li>
            <li> It does what it promises in a new manner.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have a particular smell, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> That feeling went away a bit after washing hands the next morning, but I don&#x27;t know how much more could be expected from a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> leaves your hands and feet very soft.</li>
            <li> The kit of balms and gloves/socks makes it easy to spa yourself at home, with reduced mess or fuss.  </li>
            <li> first thing I did was open the exfoliating buff.  </li>
            <li> Once I let them \\&quot;dry\\&quot; off, so to speak, my skin did get very soft, which surprised me -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some professional treatments, such as manicures and paraffin dips for special occasions or gifts, but cannot afford such luxuries on a continual basis.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this product as I have dry cracked skin, especially on my feet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : the box clearly states that there are 2 buff pads, 2 socks and 2 gloves.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the SpaSensials hand and foot treatments for those reasons.  </li>
            <li> The gloves and socks fit snugly enough that you can actually put them on and go about your daily routines while you wait for the 15 minutes to remove them.  </li>
            <li> Also, this is recommended for people with sensitive skin, and believe me, mine is.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for soft hands and feet - get some burt bee coconut foot cream, apply and put cotton socks/gloves on.</li>
            <li> Leaves hand and feet soft.  </li>
            <li> You WILL be surprised with the result.    </li>
            <li> could not wait to have my soft hands and feet after doing this process.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s outside much of the time</li>
            <li> opened the box, and much to my surprise and chagrin, this was only 2 applications.  </li>
            <li> that soft.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that the product simply wasn&#x27;t that effective.</li>
            <li> Yes it can be a bit more messy, but I could use plastic bags from the vegetable dept under the socks and get the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved that the treatment for hands and feet together took only about 20 minutes, a far cry less time than scheduling at a salon, for much less money.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from seriously dry skin during the winter, so I am always interested in anything that can help with that problem.</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s an avid gardener) and thus has a problem with dry, cracked hands and feet.</li>
            <li> My hands were a mess (dry and chapped from yard work and lots of hand washings) and did feel significantly better after using these with HEAT.</li>
            <li> The scent of the moisturizer is subtly floral but not overly perfumey, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a turnoff for most men.</li>
            <li> I tried the hand treatments out right away and, while it gave me some relief in the short term, the effects were not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li> It felt a little odd at first- sort of like wearing plastic gloves on a very humid hot day.  </li>
            <li> It really was non-stellar in performance after such a short time that I have given it 1 star.  </li>
            <li> His hands look better, not perfect, but a lot better and not nearly as many cracks as last year.</li>
            <li> I think it was a personal feel, as I don&#x27;t really suffer from dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I think that this product needs at least to have S, M and L sizes before it can really be workable for those who don&#x27;t happen to fit the designer&#x27;s average size.    </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not certain she was the target audience for this particular application.</li>
            <li> I have larger feet and am usually suspicious of \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot;, although in this case the socks seem to be adequate.     </li>
            <li> 7 feet  - effects do not last long - I had to apply my normal hand lotion again the next day  </li>
            <li> my horned calloused feet are actually softer,  and not only that,  but the effect has lasted for much longer than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked particularly well during the winter after a long morning of shoveling and building snowmen and then again this weekend after a very long day of Spring preparation in our yard.  </li>
            <li> When I used the product my hands and feet were soft but still dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you actually get your money&#x27;s worth out of this product.</li>
            <li> However, there are no long term effects - you would have to repeat the same treatment daily in order to keep the softness.</li>
            <li> test subject says the gloves made her hands feel a little sweaty, although the moisturizer feels cool from the outside.</li>
            <li> I come from a long line of white-skinned, red heads with freckles.</li>
            <li> While the texture change in my skin was apparent, I still had slightly rough knuckles.</li>
            <li> it is possible to use your hands or feet if you need to walk or pick up something, but 15 minutes is not too long to wait if you</li>
            <li> , so rather than go through the long and drawn out process of shipping these boxes back, I have opted to just use the socks...</li>
            <li> Living in a region that is extremely dry at the moment, I was constantly dealing with sores, bleeding, and chapped</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife, who complains occasionally about having dry hands from washing her hands so often as a therapist.  </li>
            <li> Obviously the user cannot slip on the gloves/socks and then continue to be active, so put on some of your fav music, select your fav big chair, and sit back to relax.  </li>
            <li> It is VERY highly scented and provides very little moisturizing for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money and natural resources!  </li>
            <li> My hands, however, felt tight and funny, the feeling you get if you&#x27;ve touched a harsh cleaning solvent.</li>
            <li> Also, people who have a difficult time reaching their feet due to medical issues might like being able to slip these on, waiting a while, and then slipping them off rather than massaging lotions in.</li>
            <li> The concept here involves gloves and socks, but there is only one size - which is contrary to the wide variety of sizes sold for those clothing items.   </li>
            <li> My fingers felt pruney, the way you get when you&#x27;re in the bathtub too long.</li>
            <li> The result, after removing the socks, was the same as removing the gloves: if you can WAIT a few minutes, the stuff gets absorbed, the waxy, icky feeling goes away, and yes, your feet are smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> However, I got used to the wet feeling and sat back to watch our movie with the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On a night when I decided to shower to a long time (until pickly) and wash my hair, that I&#x27;d use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like other reviewers I have big ole size</li>
            <li> Now, this is not so bad a product, just a little more expensive in that you could do the same with creams that you can apply yourself and get a lot more than just 4 treatments you get in the box.  </li>
            <li> This product is advertised as something to treat severely dry and cracked hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I did have trouble slipping the socks on as my feet are size 10 and this clearly isn&#x27;t meant for size 10 - I had to rip them a bit, but they still stayed on my feet for the recommended 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re looking for a spa experience, you should go to a spa...</li>
            <li> He is not easy to convince and not particularly inclined to participating in any major skin moisterizing routine.</li>
            <li> When winter comes, he gets very dry and cracked skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry, calloused feet</li>
            <li> White, scrunchy, tight.</li>
            <li> the company doesn&#x27;t take that into consideration-only by carefully pulling the socks on</li>
            <li> Here is what I expected based upon the claims on the box</li>
            <li> I wet the pad to activate the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a lotion that was creamy or thick, but this was thin, almost a light feeling of an oil.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve stated in some other review on skin-care items, I try to take care of mine, but am not a high-maintenance person.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike some other treatments I&#x27;ve tried, the feeling lasted for the day, not just until I washed my hands and the oil came off.  </li>
            <li> the scrubby side was harder than the scrubber I use on my pots!  </li>
            <li> and I usually buy a lot of different products to see which</li>
            <li> You get two sets in the box so you can work on each other.</li>
            <li> First &#x27;treatment&#x27; - not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> After washing my hands it felt no better than using regular lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To get my hands this soft, I&#x27;d have to soak them in paraffin, which means you&#x27;re pretty worthless for about 30 mins (dipping, waiting to dry, sitting, then pealing).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, not a perfect product, but it certainly softened things up a bit.</li>
            <li> From my wife: This product is not worth what it costs.</li>
            <li> But although it says \\&quot;6\\&quot; on the product box, that&#x27;s a little misleading, because they mean 3 gloves, 3 sockies, which means unless you are an amputee you actually only have 2 uses of the product for your 12 bucks.  </li>
            <li> and the box did appear to have been previously opened.  </li>
            <li> socks were a little tight, even for size 7 feet (ladies&#x27;); I suppose they have to be in order to squeeze the moisturizer in, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t associate a good result with a horrible process.</li>
            <li> My only knock would be that the footies run a bit small, but you can tear the seam and they&#x27;ll get over at least size 13.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps that&#x27;s me, being a little dimwitted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little easier to take on the feet, though; I kept squishing my toes around.    </li>
            <li> It did help a little, but not to the extent I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if they gave plain exfoliator pads which allows the consumer to use a non-Sodium Lauryl Sulfate impregnated cleanser (which dries out skin terribly) that could give a better improvement in the long range effect of the moisturizing part-</li>
            <li> Only complaint was that the booties were a little small!  </li>
            <li> Minimizes all the reapplications and stickyness you have to endure with the heavy lotions.  </li>
            <li> Wait a few minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not going to waste any time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After that, I dried my feet and hands</li>
            <li> Then I realized that there was something missing that these didn&#x27;t have but spa treatments did - HEAT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> results were that the longer application made my skin a little softer, but what disappointed me is that my skin only stayed soft for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> My grandmother was a firm believer in plain ol&#x27; ordinary petroleum jelly [like Vaseline].</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product is something I would buy.</li>
            <li> Also, I find that there is an excessive use of \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; in products.  </li>
            <li> Cons:   - small booties</li>
            <li> one of the packs of footies was way too small and tore while trying to get them on.</li>
            <li> - I did these &#x27;treatments&#x27; in the usual way but this time used the heating pad on one hand at a time</li>
            <li> I also spent a lot of time in soap and water, as well as hand sanitizer after dirty diapers, so my hands are often so dry that they crack and bleed.  </li>
            <li> bad: The socks were hard to put on due to the odd stichinng.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express exactly how much I HATE that sensation!</li>
            <li> This is a stupid product, where the benefits last for one day, before you&#x27;ll need to reapply moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> But the socks and gloves were not attractive, and that&#x27;s a fact.</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims to, but the added scent, presumably unnecessary, is irritating to me.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time with dry, cracked hands, so when I had the chance to try this out, I could hardly wait for the UPS man to deliver!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed at the short range effect of this treatment.  </li>
            <li> Why would you want your bath product to clash with your expensive perfume product ?    </li>
            <li> too expensive for use often.</li>
            <li> Also, I found the plasticy feeling of the disposables to be a bit uncomfortable and they felt cold.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is bad.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t think they were bad; in fact, she thought they worked well.</li>
            <li> really bad</li>
            <li> I never watched a clock so intently; the sensation was absolutely horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this before I rememberd how my Great Grandmother used to soften her hands.  She used cotton gloves at night and coated her hands in Crisco.  Kind of similar, but Crisco is a heck of a lot cheaper!!</li>
            <li> The idea of a disposable system for deeply moisturizing your feet and hands, that sounds like a winner if you&#x27;re not terribly worried about the environment and like the convenience factor. However, this product isn&#x27;t all that it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even knowing quite a bit about moisturizing treatments and after reading the instructions, I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how to use it. There are three packets: a scrub pad infused with soap; a pair of socks and a pair of gloves. But does one scrub in the tub? In a sink? I suppose the best thing would be to use in a shower or bath and then get out, dry off and don the socks and gloves. But by the time I figured all this out, I was dripping water everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps that&#x27;s me, being a little dimwitted. But the socks and gloves were not attractive, and that&#x27;s a fact. They felt very much like something you would wear in a hospital, not a spa. White, scrunchy, tight. My husband laughed when I came out, looking like a mummy, for the 15-minute application period. The good news was that in spite of warnings that the socks were slippery, I found that they gave plenty of grip and I was fine walking, even on stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I removed the gloves and socks, I was to work any remaining moisturizer into my skin. I was expecting a lotion that was creamy or thick, but this was thin, almost a light feeling of an oil. It didn&#x27;t have a particular smell, which surprised me. I thought there might be some pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet actually felt great, and smoother to the touch. My hands, however, felt tight and funny, the feeling you get if you&#x27;ve touched a harsh cleaning solvent. I don&#x27;t quite understand the totally different results from foot to hand, but since this is packaged as a kit, I would not be able to purchase the socks separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think I prefer using lotion and wearing socks overnight when I want to give my feet a beauty overhaul. I&#x27;m not sure this product is something I would buy.</li>
            <li> I got these as a Gold Box deal and my wife really thinks they make her feet feel great.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the story: I got this product for my wife to try, and it sat in the box for about three months, so eventually I said, \\&quot;Well, SOMEONE has to try it and write a review!\\&quot; and gave it a go myself.  The product seems primarily targeted for women, so the gloves and socks just barely fit my large man&#x27;s hands and feet.  The scent of the moisturizer is subtly floral but not overly perfumey, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a turnoff for most men. The exfoliating scrub seemed to work well, more for a scrubbing wash than a real exfoliation, in my case.  I do have a problem with dry hands and feet in the winter, and I have to tell you, this product did an excellent job on my rough, dry skin, especially on the soles of my feet which get downright leathery.  Just 15 minutes really made a difference and left both hands and feet smooth and refreshed.  Is it worth the $10 price tag for two applications?  Maybe, maybe not.  But it certainly is more effective and less messy than my prior attempts at moisturizing by smearing myself with Vaseline Intensive Care.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve stated in some other review on skin-care items, I try to take care of mine, but am not a high-maintenance person. I&#x27;ve had some professional treatments, such as manicures and paraffin dips for special occasions or gifts, but cannot afford such luxuries on a continual basis. Also, at the mother of 2 children under the age of 3, I don&#x27;t have the time to spend hours at the salon for said treatments.  I was pleasantly surprised by the SpaSensials hand and foot treatments for those reasons.  I spent a great deal of time barefoot which is killer to the skin, so I have very rough feet. I also spent a lot of time in soap and water, as well as hand sanitizer after dirty diapers, so my hands are often so dry that they crack and bleed.  I loved that the treatment for hands and feet together took only about 20 minutes, a far cry less time than scheduling at a salon, for much less money.  On the very first use I noticed that my skin did feel considerably softer, very similar to the result I get from a parafin dip.  The gloves and socks fit snugly enough that you can actually put them on and go about your daily routines while you wait for the 15 minutes to remove them.  The outstanding feature that I liked was that my skin did not feel the least bit greasy, but just a lot more moist than usual. Also, unlike some other treatments I&#x27;ve tried, the feeling lasted for the day, not just until I washed my hands and the oil came off.  Also, this is recommended for people with sensitive skin, and believe me, mine is. I come from a long line of white-skinned, red heads with freckles. This treament was painless, easy, low-cost and very practical for a very busy mom.  I would definitely use these again.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it is not as effective as professional treatments. While the texture change in my skin was apparent, I still had slightly rough knuckles. The foot treatment, however was more effective because the kit includes a sloughly cloth which did an impressive job of smoothing my heavy callouses. Overall, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is bad. This literally felt like I am wearing tarp on my hands with chemicals in it. I could not bear it at all. I had ordered it thinking these are some soft reusable cotton gloves that can be used with my favorite moisturizer. No where in the product says these are disposable. If you are looking for soft hands and feet - get some burt bee coconut foot cream, apply and put cotton socks/gloves on. Your skin will be very thankful.</li>
            <li> The concept here involves gloves and socks, but there is only one size - which is contrary to the wide variety of sizes sold for those clothing items.   I think that this product needs at least to have S, M and L sizes before it can really be workable for those who don&#x27;t happen to fit the designer&#x27;s average size.    Also, I find that there is an excessive use of \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; in products.  I&#x27;ve never understood this concept.    You have an OTC product which wholesales for a dollar or two, so the fragrance ingredient can only cost a penny or two.   How can that compare to a perfume costing many, many times as much (some over a hundred dollars), that is the result of extensive research ?   Why would you want your bath product to clash with your expensive perfume product ?    In any event, these penny fragrances are inevitably horrid, and I only use fragrance-free bath and personal products.  The advent of \\&quot;free and clear\\&quot; detergents is a positive trend, so I am dismayed that this spa product does not have a fragrance-free option.</li>
            <li> I did not like how slimy my hands and feet felt after using the gloves and socks.  A friend used the other pair and liked how her hands and feet felt.  I think it was a personal feel, as I don&#x27;t really suffer from dry skin.  I would not reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> most of the other Vine reviewers have reviewed this product pretty well,  but here are my pros and cons of trying this product.  I wanted to mention that I&#x27;ve never had a spa treatment or pedicure so I was excited to try this product as I have dry cracked skin, especially on my feet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-the labeling is a bit misleading:  since most users will do both the hands and feet at the same time there is actually 2 treatments in the box, not four-the seller obviously realizes this aw well since they only include 2 exfoliating buffers-but they put 4 treatments on the outside of the box-poor salesmanship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-the exfoliating pad:  HURTS-the scrubby side was harder than the scrubber I use on my pots!  I couldn&#x27;t use the thing for a minute or so without cringing:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-the moisturizing socks:  like other reviewers I have big ole size 10 feet-and the company doesn&#x27;t take that into consideration-only by carefully pulling the socks on did I not tear them-and they were tighter than a mummy&#x27;s wrappings:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-the reveal:  I did notice some softness after the treatment-but not any more than I&#x27;ve noticed after applying store bought lotion.  At about $3 per set of hands or feet I feel more noticible improvment should be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the only \\&quot;pro\\&quot; I have of the product is that the next morning when I stepped into the shower the lasting effects of SpaSensials did not make my feet slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regrettably I would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.5 stars</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for dry skin caused from heat etc during the winter months. A nice spa treatment for \\&quot;Me Time\\&quot; and reasonably priced. Very soothing!</li>
            <li> Pros:   - Smells great  - Economic   - Exfoliating scrub very effective  - Feels good - for awhile    Cons:   - small booties - they barely fit my size 7 feet  - effects do not last long - I had to apply my normal hand lotion again the next day  - box has only 2 treatments - not 4    Overall, it was nice to have a \\&quot;Spa\\&quot; Treatment at home without paying the high spa price. But I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I tried the foot and hand treatments and my dry and rough skin felt wonderful. This product will come in handy once the snow hits but until then, it hasn&#x27;t been tried to its full potential. It does what it promises in a new manner. Recommended.</li>
            <li> SpaSenials Combination Hand and Foot Treatment systems is a great way to paper yourself and would make an awesome gift for the women in your life. They are easy to use and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Product does work to moisterize your skin but the effects don&#x27;t seem to last any longer than just useing lotion on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This product is nice.  Leaves hand and feet soft.  Only complaint was that the booties were a little small!  Had to squeze my foot in!</li>
            <li> This product is very convenient and easy to use.  Just put the gloves or \\&quot;socks\\&quot; on and let them do the work for you. I even reused the gloves one time, using my own hand cream.  This is a nice gift for someone who needs some pampering. It doesn&#x27;t get any easier.</li>
            <li> the gloves are large but comfortable. one of the packs of footies was way too small and tore while trying to get them on.I have found if you stretch the footies several times they then will fit well. they are a rare occasion gift as lotion with white socks will work just as well. too expensive for use often. make sure to take rings off while using gloves.</li>
            <li> He is not easy to convince and not particularly inclined to participating in any major skin moisterizing routine. When winter comes, he gets very dry and cracked skin and I usually buy a lot of different products to see which if any he will try and use to get him through the winter. The SpaSensials* Combination Hand &amp; Foot Treatment Systems (4 Treatments) was one of my selections for this year. What a HIT! He uses it and even kept a pair to have under his winter gloves while he is snow shoveling. His hands look better, not perfect, but a lot better and not nearly as many cracks as last year.I gave it a five stars because it is trully the best product I have found so far.  1. It does not smell funny.  2. He wears it at night or under his winter gloves. Minimizes all the reapplications and stickyness you have to endure with the heavy lotions.  3. You can add \\&quot;neosporin\\&quot; and really helps to heal any cracks that are already there.  best of luck this winter.</li>
            <li> I suffer from seriously dry skin during the winter, so I am always interested in anything that can help with that problem. The lotion in the SpaSensials smells &amp; feels nice, but my main reaction was that I didn&#x27;t find this product to be any more effective than my usual routine (rubbing lotion on my feet and then putting on a pair of ankle socks). I liked using the SpaSensials, but the end result doesn&#x27;t justify the much higher cost of the product. Really, the only advantage is that you can moisturize your feet without getting messy foot cream all over your hands.</li>
            <li> From my wife: This product is not worth what it costs. The instructions were easy to follow and the product fit fine, but I felt silly sitting around with my hands and feet in socks for 15 minutes. You better put on a tv show or something! My biggest complaint is that the product simply wasn&#x27;t that effective. The cool moisturizing feel during the treatment was nice, and my hands and feet felt fine after the treatment.  But, it was nothing special. It certainly didn&#x27;t compare to a pedicure. I, for one, would prefer to spend fifteen bucks more to get pampered by a trained pedicurist than mess with my own treatment at home. Call me a princess, but that&#x27;s what I think!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and natural resources!  I don&#x27;t find anything disposable to be particularly &#x27;innovative&#x27;.  It&#x27;s sort of silly to wear gloves around the house, and doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than applying lotion.  The whole \\&quot;use and toss\\&quot; mindset needs to stop because it does nothing for our world.  This is a stupid product, where the benefits last for one day, before you&#x27;ll need to reapply moisturizer.  My advice: buy a bottle of lotion, use it, recycle the bottle when finished.  Cheaper, smarter, more eco, and you won&#x27;t look like a clown in gloves.</li>
            <li> but THIS product wasn&#x27;t it.    I&#x27;m still getting over the \\&quot;yuck\\&quot; factor after taking the gloves off my hands. is that moisturizer in it? My hands are sticky, unlike any moisturizer I ever used!    I started with the gloves. After reading some reviews, one of the complaints seemed to be that the hand moisturizer didn&#x27;t really do much. I soaked my hands for a minute in warm water to open the pores and make it more ready for the glove treatment.    The gloves are surprisingly well made (I&#x27;m amazed they&#x27;re made to be thrown away. If you can stand the way they feel - which is utter yuck - they&#x27;d be great to keep and use for some other purpose.)    You&#x27;re supposed to leave the gloves on for 15 minutes. I never watched a clock so intently; the sensation was absolutely horrible. My fingers felt pruney, the way you get when you&#x27;re in the bathtub too long. I can&#x27;t express exactly how much I HATE that sensation! Utter ugh.    I removed the gloves, and my hands just felt sticky, kind of waxy but without the wax. Once I let them \\&quot;dry\\&quot; off, so to speak, my skin did get very soft, which surprised me - I usually don&#x27;t associate a good result with a horrible process. I&#x27;d recommend that if you use this, rub the \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; around on your hands a bit before you get the urge to wash the stuff off. Wait a few minutes. You WILL be surprised with the result.    Onto the foot product. I wear a size 10 shoe, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting that the booties would be an easy fit. I was not disappointed. Since this product is made in China, it seems as if they used foot-bound geishas as foot models. American girls have bigger tootsies than China dolls! How about a small-medium and medium-large size range for these booties?    I actually liked the foot exfoliator. I used it after soaking my feet in a foot bath. I usually use a pumice stone afterward, but the exfoliator was a pleasant surprise. Now the booties were a different story. I had to snip the tops to get my foot in, and I had the same yucky sensation as the gloves. It&#x27;s a little easier to take on the feet, though; I kept squishing my toes around.    I have callouses on my feet from sandal wearing, so this stuff sorta, kinda worked. But since I&#x27;m pretty diligent with keeping up with the callouses via my trust pumice stone, I wasn&#x27;t in the \\&quot;cracked, dry\\&quot; category.     The result, after removing the socks, was the same as removing the gloves: if you can WAIT a few minutes, the stuff gets absorbed, the waxy, icky feeling goes away, and yes, your feet are smoother and softer. It&#x27;s just having to endure how it...did I say \\&quot;yuck\\&quot;?...FEELS meanwhile.    I just can&#x27;t recommend this product, but that&#x27;s because I absolutely loathe the pruney, dimpled feeling you get when you use them. The product does, after a fashion, work and the scent is nice, but a product that makes my skin crawl while using it, no matter how nice the result, is NOT indicative of any spa experience I ever had!</li>
            <li> It was rather pleasant to slip into the gloves for the hand and for the feet. And they certainly do the job of moisturizing. This is a quick moisturizing treatment, one that you can accomplish in quick 15 minutes while doing other things. What comes in the package is two pairs of gloves and two pairs of socks, as well as an exfoliating buff. I did have trouble slipping the socks on as my feet are size 10 and this clearly isn&#x27;t meant for size 10 - I had to rip them a bit, but they still stayed on my feet for the recommended 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re looking for a spa experience, you should go to a spa...</li>
            <li> First off, putting on the gloves and socks were extremely confortable and gives a cool, tingly feeling and fit nice and snug (on me at least, not sure if they are really one size fits all).  Even the smell that they give off is soothing in itself.  But even after the recommended fifteen minutes, my hands were still cracked when I took them off.  My hands and feet feel much better after the treatment, but maybe it will take a couple more times before they are fully moisturized.  But this is worth the fifteen minutes of relaxation that they give you.</li>
            <li> Being sensitive to most perfumes, I&#x27;m on  constant search for items that won&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction. This product does what it claims to, but the added scent, presumably unnecessary, is irritating to me.</li>
            <li> i am loving these and wish i had gotten more!! leaves your hands and feet very soft. the socks are durable enough to wear walking around the house too, but the gloves, of course, wear while sleeping. this invention is a very smart idea.</li>
            <li> My wife tried out this product, which is designed as a moisturizer.  She was pleased and thought it was a good moisturizer.  But although it says \\&quot;6\\&quot; on the product box, that&#x27;s a little misleading, because they mean 3 gloves, 3 sockies, which means unless you are an amputee you actually only have 2 uses of the product for your 12 bucks.  You can get just as good or superior moisturizers not in coated sockies and gloves for much less.</li>
            <li> The SpaSensials kit is a nice home spa treatment. The cleansing/scrub sponge provides a nice cleaning and exfoliation, even if you have super rough heels. Then you put on the footies and wait fifteen minutes. Once that&#x27;s done, you work it in and your feet feel fresh and rejuvenated. This is a great item for couples, especially if your s/o enjoys a foot treatment, and who doesn&#x27;t? You get two sets in the box so you can work on each other. My only knock would be that the footies run a bit small, but you can tear the seam and they&#x27;ll get over at least size 13. My wife gives a thumbs up as well.</li>
            <li> I suppose these are &#x27;ok&#x27; for what you get.  I ordered the combo (foot and hand) and instead got all feet treatments only and the box did appear to have been previously opened.  I was not going to send this back as I just sighed and kept them.  Now, this is not so bad a product, just a little more expensive in that you could do the same with creams that you can apply yourself and get a lot more than just 4 treatments you get in the box.  But convenience is what they get you with and this alone is a winner.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea, but how did it work out in real life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you get an exfoliating pad. You add water to activate the soap, and start scrubbing gently - I used it on the feet only. Well, you get a clean-feet feeling, if nothing else. Then you put on the moisturizing gloves and socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The socks were a little tight, even for size 7 feet (ladies&#x27;); I suppose they have to be in order to squeeze the moisturizer in, I don&#x27;t know. If you pull on the front part first, it&#x27;s easier to slip on. The gloves were much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My test subject says the gloves made her hands feel a little sweaty, although the moisturizer feels cool from the outside. The feet felt OK, though. Left them on for 15 minutes or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward? The hands and feet did feel softer. That feeling went away a bit after washing hands the next morning, but I don&#x27;t know how much more could be expected from a moisturizer. The effect seemed to last a day or two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a spa product fiend.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many hand creams,  face balms, lotions of all kinds that I have.  So when I received this very light box with this oddly shaped scrubbing device and 2 pairs of socks and gloves, I have to admit I was a bit dubious.  Added to that the socks and gloves feel more papery than cloth and the socks actually tore a bit going onto to my size 9.5 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was a good girl and followed all the directions closely,  and I have to say...  my horned calloused feet are actually softer,  and not only that,  but the effect has lasted for much longer than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  So it really is as good as a good pedicure,  and much better than an average one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So try it with confidence :)</li>
            <li> When I first had the opportunity to try the SpaSensials product, I was thrilled!  As someone who lives in a rural area, I have good use for hand and feet softening products.  I tend to get dry hands and feet and the thought of placing a glove and sock on with high intensity moisturizing capabilities was a very exciting prospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my package in the mail, I planned that evening to try my first application.  Here is what I expected based upon the claims on the box (I am quoting here):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot; Intensive one-step moisturizing and conditioning Hand &amp; Foot Treatment System..... Advanced Technology helps SpaSensials intensive conditioning formula to quickly and effectively absorb into the skin\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little graphic in the box that illustrates how other skin technologies leave little droplets of moisturizer on top of the skin and SpaSensials have the droplets actually break through the surface of the skin, moisturizing from the inside at a sublevel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  This promised to be some kind of wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night while we had family movie night, I quickly opened the box to prepare to be pampered.  Inside the box were two exfoliating buffs, two pair of softening socks, and two pair of softening gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not going to waste any time.  I was doing both my hands and feet- and I could not wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did was open the exfoliating buff.  I wet the pad to activate the cleanser.  I used the rough side for exfoliating my feet, and I use the smooth side for cleansing them.  It felt nice and the cleanser was pretty decent, although there seemed to be more suds than anything substantial (I am a person who is very interested in cleansing agents so I observe more than most people, I am sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I dried my feet and hands and then I put the socks and gloves on.  The smell was delightfully herbal with a touch of florals.  It felt a little odd at first- sort of like wearing plastic gloves on a very humid hot day.  However, I got used to the wet feeling and sat back to watch our movie with the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to leave on the socks or gloves for 15 minutes and that the moisturizers stay on the inside and not the outside.  This is true- it is possible to use your hands or feet if you need to walk or pick up something, but 15 minutes is not too long to wait if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the socks and gloves are removed, I massaged the rest of the moisturizer into my hands and feet also as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EVALUATION:&lt;br /&gt;I could not wait to have my soft hands and feet after doing this process.  At first they felt pretty nice, but honestly, I get the same experience from putting on hand or body lotion and putting on gloves or socks.  Yes it can be a bit more messy, but I could use plastic bags from the vegetable dept under the socks and get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product in two ways- sticking by the instructions exactly, and then the second time, leaving the gloves on for over an hour and the socks on over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were that the longer application made my skin a little softer, but what disappointed me is that my skin only stayed soft for a few hours.  By the next morning (or in the case of the overnight socks- 8 hours later), my skin was just the same as if I had not used anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get better results from some creams than I do this.  Perhaps if they gave plain exfoliator pads which allows the consumer to use a non-Sodium Lauryl Sulfate impregnated cleanser (which dries out skin terribly) that could give a better improvement in the long range effect of the moisturizing part- but I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed at the short range effect of this treatment.  It really was non-stellar in performance after such a short time that I have given it 1 star.  I just don&#x27;t think that it does very much - and certainly in my experience doesnot live up to its claim.  I have some other moisturizing creams that do a better job than this does- without gloves and socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of the moisturizer was lovely so all of my efforts were not lost, but I would like to see someone come out with a better more effective product that really leaves skin truly moisturized for more than half a 24 hour period.cks.

            <li> I got some SpaSensials Hand &amp; Foot Treatments for my mom. She&#x27;s outside much of the time (she&#x27;s an avid gardener) and thus has a problem with dry, cracked hands and feet. She liked how they worked, but she didn&#x27;t think they were that much better than some of the really good lotions she normally uses.    I think these would be good for people who don&#x27;t like rubbing lotions on their hands and feet three times a day. You can slip them on and watch TV, for example, and forget about them for a while. Also, people who have a difficult time reaching their feet due to medical issues might like being able to slip these on, waiting a while, and then slipping them off rather than massaging lotions in. (NOTE: You still have to massage in the remaining SpaSentials lotion left on your feet after removing the slips, so this problem doesn&#x27;t disappear entirely.)    My mom doesn&#x27;t mind applying lotions, as it&#x27;s a habit for her by now. So I&#x27;m not certain she was the target audience for this particular application. She didn&#x27;t think they were bad; in fact, she thought they worked well. She just didn&#x27;t think they offered much above a good skin lotion.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time with dry, cracked hands, so when I had the chance to try this out, I could hardly wait for the UPS man to deliver! I tried the hand treatments out right away and, while it gave me some relief in the short term, the effects were not long lasting at all. I feel like I can probably do just as well with a tube of Neutrogena moisturizer, which I can just apply as needed.</li>
            <li> These work just like the pedicure treatments you&#x27;d receive in a spa or salon, just at a fraction of the cost. However, there are no long term effects - you would have to repeat the same treatment daily in order to keep the softness. The good news is that they&#x27;re relatively inexpensive on Amazon, so it&#x27;s worth it to keep some on hand.</li>
            <li> The easy to use slip on gloves or booties begin healing dry, cracked skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unique scratch/sponge is loaded with foaming cream to help remove the brittle pieces that crack on your heels but refuse to let loose without a pair of scissors.  This is far more sanitary and less dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had multiple uses from both the booties and the gloves.  Living in a region that is extremely dry at the moment, I was constantly dealing with sores, bleeding, and chapped skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I do not have splits or ridges on my feet or hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A1 product! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Attractive packaging! This is definitely something I would pick up and look at in the store.  I have larger feet and am usually suspicious of \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot;, although in this case the socks seem to be adequate.     The scrub seems moderately effective (the idea is great, although larger granules might be a better idea. Perhaps a coarser scrub for feet?).    This is a great \\&quot;band-aid\\&quot; treatment for emergency foot situations (say you&#x27;re going to be wearing strappy shoes and your feet are dry and unmanaged). Will it last? No. But it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> The kit of balms and gloves/socks makes it easy to spa yourself at home, with reduced mess or fuss.  That said, you have to get used to the gloves and socks bit, and that may put off some potential users, even while this feature lures and attracts others.  Obviously the user cannot slip on the gloves/socks and then continue to be active, so put on some of your fav music, select your fav big chair, and sit back to relax.  Got one of those mood candles handy?  Add it to your spa mix, and luxuriate in honeysuckle or roses smells.  Come to think of it, maybe that is the real benefit of the gloves/socks - they force you to sit back and relax even in the midst of your busiest weekly schedule.</li>
            <li> First &#x27;treatment&#x27; - not impressed at all.  After washing my hands it felt no better than using regular lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One review indicates that this is nothing more than an application of lotion - I absolutely agree if these are used right out of the package.  Then I realized that there was something missing that these didn&#x27;t have but spa treatments did - HEAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in a spa they will slather on lotions (whatever concoction is hip that day), wrap the body parts with whatever they use to keep the lotion in place (plastic, linen strips, leaves ;)and then they apply heat in the form of steamed towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this got me thinking...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously - I am not going to &#x27;steam a towel&#x27; and when I thought a bit more about heat realized that I had two heating pads, one of which was intended for &#x27;moist heat&#x27; (you dampen the outer cover).&lt;br /&gt;So - I did these &#x27;treatments&#x27; in the usual way but this time used the heating pad on one hand at a time (I was reading a book).  The difference from the regular &#x27;treatments&#x27; was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now of course I can think of plenty of ways to do this at home with what is available but for the convenience I would probably use this again.&lt;br /&gt;It worked particularly well during the winter after a long morning of shoveling and building snowmen and then again this weekend after a very long day of Spring preparation in our yard.  This time I dampened paper towels and put them between the heating pad/gloves - this turned out to be the best way so far.  My hands were a mess (dry and chapped from yard work and lots of hand washings) and did feel significantly better after using these with HEAT.</li>
            <li> I really planned to use these.  On a night when I decided to shower to a long time (until pickly) and wash my hair, that I&#x27;d use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box, and much to my surprise and chagrin, this was only 2 applications.  The product states nothing about it only being two applications, just six pouches.  Those six pouches are two gloves sets, two socks sets, and 2 sponges.  So one star deduction to misleading advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after showering, I sat over the tub and washed my feet as instructed with the sponge, and put on the socks.  I then followed suit with my hands.  Then I went to get dressed (the gloves don&#x27;t prevent you from doing much).  I then blowdryed my hair with gloves and socks on.  Though I put the gloves on after washing my feet, I took the gloves off first.  I was honestly impressed. My hands felt like they&#x27;d come out of a paraffin bath...that soft.  Now, granted, my hands were softened by my shower, but I think that may actually be the key.  Then I took off the socks.  I was impressed again.  My feet were really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the residue from the gloves and socks too bothersome.  My hands looked shiny, but didn&#x27;t feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $8, I&#x27;m not going to complain at all.  To get my hands this soft, I&#x27;d have to soak them in paraffin, which means you&#x27;re pretty worthless for about 30 mins (dipping, waiting to dry, sitting, then pealing).  But walking around in socks and gloves was a breeze.</li>
            <li> This product is advertised as something to treat severely dry and cracked hands and feet. Though the product was good it really wasn&#x27;t great. It really didn&#x27;t stand out as an EXCEPTIONAL product. When I used the product my hands and feet were soft but still dry. I&#x27;m not sure if you actually get your money&#x27;s worth out of this product. My grandmother was a firm believer in plain ol&#x27; ordinary petroleum jelly [like Vaseline]. She&#x27;d apply it to her hands and feet just before she&#x27;d go to bed. When she&#x27;d get up the next morning she&#x27;d have the softest, smoothest and most moist hands.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, calloused feet (I&#x27;m a runner) and I thought this product would really help restore some softness to my feet. It did help a little, but not to the extent I was hoping. I think the best part of the product was the buff you use on your feet before putting the socks on. It seemed to get things softened up better than my pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hands and feet were definitely more moisturized in the end, I think it would be more environmentally friendly (with the same results) just to apply some very intensive cream and use socks and gloves. Also, I found the plasticy feeling of the disposables to be a bit uncomfortable and they felt cold.  However, the lotion inside did moisturize and had a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a perfect product, but it certainly softened things up a bit.</li>
            <li> The good: The product had a wonderful aroma, the wash felt good, and when I pulled the socks off my skin felt smooth and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The socks were hard to put on due to the odd stichinng. I&#x27;m a size 8 shoe, to give you an idea of what to expect. The sock size itself was fine, but it hurt the top of my foot to put it on and remove it since the stitching on top was so tight. My husband is a size 8 men&#x27;s and he had the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The really bad: the box clearly states that there are 2 buff pads, 2 socks and 2 gloves. However, both boxes (I ordered 2), had 2 pads and 4 sock sets - NO GLOVES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so rather than go through the long and drawn out process of shipping these boxes back, I have opted to just use the socks...however, if you are really wanting the gloves too, then consider what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I reiterate, the product smelled and felt great, and since I have Amazon Prime, I received it promptly within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my review helps you decide!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  It is VERY highly scented and provides very little moisturizing for dry skin.  It has no lasting effects.  I would suggest using regular hand lotion....Vasoline Intensive Care is great and plain cotton gloves.</li>
            <li> These are especially great for your feet!!  The socks are comfortable while in place, and the moisturizers make your feet feel great!!</li>
            <li> These are neat! I love wearing them over night! My feet feel great in the morning! :)</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife, who complains occasionally about having dry hands from washing her hands so often as a therapist.  She tried these and found them helpful in moisturizing her hands, even re-using them with another lotion when they had been used once before.  I would buy them for her again, and all of her comments indicated her hands were softer and felt much better after use.</li>
