            <li>It was completely amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>warm water thend followed the directions that came in the box.</li>
            <li>still- easier, faster and more effective than anything I have tried before-</li>
            <li>Love Love Love This.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>this thing is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I just bought more.</li>
            <li>We have so many layers of skin on our feet,</li>
            <li>but they did peel and looked much better after a week.</li>
            <li>She is going to love it.</li>
            <li>My feet felt so smooth after the treatment!</li>
            <li>Sleeping is much better now and it&#x27;s easier to pull on socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with how much peeling, and how soft my feet are 3 weeks after the treatment.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use but you had to soak your feet for an hour before applying the boots.</li>
            <li>When you want to accelerate the process by soaking in hot water, Keep the water as warm as you can tolerate and eventually.</li>
            <li>Feet started to peel after 1 week and became smooth.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my package that I started you tubing the recommendations from others.  </li>
            <li>your feet peel for over a week and the result is feet that are baby soft - truly amazing -</li>
            <li>These unique exfoliator booties really do exactly what they say!  </li>
            <li>Soak feet four days after initial use - like magic!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>but well worth it...</li>
            <li>We slipped our feet into the booties and to make sure they were extra secure we placed socks over them as some users online have recommended.</li>
            <li>My feet we not nearly as bad as I give myself monthly pedicures but the skin on the bottom of my feet still peeled off in almost a whole piece all at once within 4 days.</li>
            <li>The first treatment lasted 3 months.</li>
            <li>my feet feel soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>Still pretty neat to try.</li>
            <li>(yes, folks, I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>- *yurg*).</li>
            <li>So my husband has pretty ballerina feet while mine look like I have chemical burns and targeted scleroderma.</li>
            <li>Worked very well, and I will order it again!</li>
            <li>I had almost no peeling for the first week or so, and peeled beyond the 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>soak my feet up to the ankles in a tub of hot water with a cup of bath salts or epsom salts along with a 1/4 - 1/2 cup baking soda, for 30 minute or so.</li>
            <li>When it flakes off, be ready!</li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>wife watched apprehensively as I tried it first but is peeling as I type.</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>This product did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>My feet looked exactly like the pictures sent in.</li>
            <li>I tried a few variations and am delighted with results.</li>
            <li>I put one of the Baby Foot packets on each foot, sit down with feet wrapped in towels to keep them warm.</li>
            <li>A week later, ALL the skin peels off your dry feet leaving them smooth as a baby&#x27;s tummy :-)</li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>You really have to soak your feet before you put the booties on for it to work well.</li>
            <li>This product really, truly does the job</li>
            <li>No pedicure, pumas, scraper, ointment, wax or moisturizer really worked for me...</li>
            <li>it really works -</li>
            <li>This really does what it says.</li>
            <li>The dry skin painlessly peels away over a two week period, leaving fresh looking, smooth, soft to the touch skin.</li>
            <li>Either I have the thickest most callused feet in the free western world, or else I&#x27;m not letting it &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; undisturbed long enough to do the whole &amp;#34;natural peeling&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The challenge is then to protect and moisturize the new skin surface so you don&#x27;t have to repeat it!</li>
            <li>One for my daughter (main reason for buying) and one for myself.</li>
            <li>Phenomenal - my feet haven&#x27;t felt this fresh since my last pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;Results last several weeks.</li>
            <li>and DONT try to scrape/peel it off too soon, it will absolutely leave you with baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product repeatedly (like 6 times in the past year) and only got a good peel once.</li>
            <li>As suggested, soak your feet in warm water for at least 30 minutes before using the booties.</li>
            <li>And Watch Your New Feet Emerge.</li>
            <li>Her feet started peeling within 2 days and look like brand new feet.</li>
            <li>My husband, who can go for weeks without even considering the state of his feet (or his toenails, or even whether or not his feet are still human), got a fantastic result; his calluses simply fell off after about 10 days, like snakeskins (I know this because I found them in his socks and at the foot of the bed</li>
            <li>After all the peeling was over my feet were very soft.</li>
            <li>They continued to peel for a week or so until very soft all over.  </li>
            <li>one application of Baby Foot will leave your feet in the exact same state they were to begin with after about a month or so.  </li>
            <li>you should be rewarded with those soft Baby Feet!</li>
            <li>Always leaves my feet baby soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The next few days are gross as others have noted because the peeling continues so unless you want to leave large patches of your DNA all over the place, keep the socks on! :)</li>
            <li>Make sure to soak you feet nightly for at least 10 minutes...or just take your nightly bath/shower and that will work as well.</li>
            <li>Wow does this work.  </li>
            <li>Now they are so soft.</li>
            <li>In a week to 10 days, the peeling should be complete.</li>
            <li>The whole foot pealed when I only needed the bottom of my feet to be treated.</li>
            <li>This is when the old skin on my feet starts to come off in peels and cracks - no pain, but soft pink skin</li>
            <li>so after 2 or 3 days, when my feet start getting all dry and the edges of callus are hanging like old wallpaper, I cannot resist the urge to start stripping off the skin.</li>
            <li>couple of days pass and, as others have reported, sometimes there isn&#x27;t much action, so I soak my feet up to the ankles for at least 30 minutes in hot water with bath or epsom salts and baking soda.</li>

            <li> If you were one of those people in high school who could actually, really and truly, leave a big fat oozy chin-pimple &amp;#34;alone&amp;#34; until it popped all by itself, if you can resist the urge to rip off a hangnail, or if you can fumble around with tape on a broken fingernail until it has a chance to grow out -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic - I recommend soaking your feet 10 minutes a night - you&#x27;ll see a dramatic skin peel happening</li>
            <li> Another negativity is the results do not last that long if your the type of person who walks around barefoot or wears sandals a lot of the time, like me, For someone like that, it will last about a month to three months.</li>
            <li> The following Wednesday night about 25% of my dead foot skin fell off starting from the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Within 48 hours the skin is loose and will start to peel like a sunburn without the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> my feet are generally very dry and calloused.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first few tries yielded encouraging but not astounding results.</li>
            <li> only negatives about this product is that your feet peel for about a week or a little bit longer so you might not want to wear shoes that show off your feet while they are in the peeling phase.</li>
            <li> dead skin will start to come back in around two month.</li>
            <li> After reading dozens of reviews, I tried the product and was amazed at how much dead skin came off my feet - and I scrub them with a  pumice stone in the shower several times a week.</li>
            <li> My feet were so rough that they were dragging on the sheets like Velcro.  </li>
            <li> My heals were still thick but the ladies at the nail place couldn&#x27;t get them all soft</li>
            <li> But be careful, they are addicting!</li>
            <li> I am one of the unfortunates who have feet rough with callouses and thick, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had so much dead skin that my feet were constantly hard and dry.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few applications, however, for a changeable difference.  </li>
            <li> crusty dog-pads still stuck firmly to my heels.</li>
            <li> the dead skin peel away.</li>
            <li> We each soaked our feet for 30 minutes before using and than dried our feet.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve dried my feet</li>
            <li> After two hours, I follow package directions by unwrapping my feet, pulling off the Baby Foot booties, then wash all the Baby Foot &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; off my feet.d I apply heavy duty moisturizer and keep my feet in</li>
            <li> and I had to wear socks to keep the dead skin from flaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> Your foot will shed like a major sunburn, it is weird.</li>
            <li> This was the first summer I didn&#x27;t have painful, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> After 2 applications, my feet are piggy pink with all new fresh skin and no calloused dry ugly horrible looking skin!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my feet were too bad, so I thought I wouldn&#x27;t get much peeling because  I keep up with them and baby them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice in the past year.</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s feet were worse than mine and now thay are piggy pink, too!  </li>
            <li> I was very doubtful about this product with it&#x27;s claims saying your old skin will just peel off and you will have baby soft feet.</li>
            <li> Some skin shed over a two week period, but my feet were still disappointingly hard and calloused.</li>
            <li> Alas, it is not for me - and I need to stop wasting my money on it.</li>
            <li> im not happy with this seller at all...never buying anything for this seller....</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about how well this would work, but after doing alot of research online I gave in.  </li>
            <li> I would not advise you to use this if you are going to be wearing sandals soon after using the product just because it looks weird when your feet begin to peel.</li>

            <li> Love Love Love This. I Have Purchased This Product Several Times And It Never Ceases To Amaze Me. Apply, Wait About 3 Days And Watch Your New Feet Emerge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the scent, because I can&#x27;t smell, but I can say, these are the best foot peels out there! Love them. But be careful, they are addicting!</li>
            <li> Friend raved about how well it worked. I personally didn&#x27;t see results. I will repeat treatment to see if second treatment does the trick.</li>
            <li> omg! this thing is phenomenal. even after reading everyone&#x27;s review, I was a bit skeptic but it totally worked for me. its so good, i have bought additional packets and i am giving them away as part of my xmas spa baskets that i am making for my friends.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I just bought more. The first treatment lasted 3 months.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about how well this would work, but after doing alot of research online I gave in.  It really does work.  This was the first summer I didn&#x27;t have painful, cracked heels.  Am hooked on Baby Foot from this point forward.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my package that I started you tubing the recommendations from others.  So I soaked my feet for 1 hour before in warm water thend followed the directions that came in the box. I didn&#x27;t start peeling til 4 days later, then I looked like a snake shedding it&#x27;s skin...DISGUSTING! but well worth it...my feet feel soft and smooth...</li>
            <li> Yes, the skin on the soles of your feet will peel like you&#x27;ve never seen before.  It does take a few applications, however, for a changeable difference.  We have so many layers of skin on our feet, one application of Baby Foot will leave your feet in the exact same state they were to begin with after about a month or so.  Still pretty neat to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product repeatedly (like 6 times in the past year) and only got a good peel once. Either I have the thickest most callused feet in the free western world, or else I&#x27;m not letting it &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; undisturbed long enough to do the whole &amp;#34;natural peeling&amp;#34; thing. My problem is that I can&#x27;t leave anything hanging off my body alone (yes, folks, I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34;) so after 2 or 3 days, when my feet start getting all dry and the edges of callus are hanging like old wallpaper, I cannot resist the urge to start stripping off the skin. So I wind up with red and irritated insteps with crusty dog-pads still stuck firmly to my heels. Attractive, it is not. My husband, who can go for weeks without even considering the state of his feet (or his toenails, or even whether or not his feet are still human), got a fantastic result; his calluses simply fell off after about 10 days, like snakeskins (I know this because I found them in his socks and at the foot of the bed - *yurg*). So my husband has pretty ballerina feet while mine look like I have chemical burns and targeted scleroderma. If you were one of those people in high school who could actually, really and truly, leave a big fat oozy chin-pimple &amp;#34;alone&amp;#34; until it popped all by itself, if you can resist the urge to rip off a hangnail, or if you can fumble around with tape on a broken fingernail until it has a chance to grow out - then by all means, this product is for you! Alas, it is not for me - and I need to stop wasting my money on it.</li>
            <li> Yes it takes a while but works great</li>
            <li> works as describe . the dead skin peel away. dead skin will start to come back in around two month.</li>
            <li> Worked very well, and I will order it again!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will.  I had almost no peeling for the first week or so, and peeled beyond the 2 weeks.  Although it did not attack some of my hardest calluses, I am hoping that repeated use will eventually remove the hardened areas.</li>
            <li> Very bad Bad service....takes hella long to get my product plus i have to pay extra $$$ for my product because the seller didn&#x27;t pay for shipping and handling correctly.....i pay alot of $$$$ + shipping and handling for this product and now extra $$$....damn wat a rip off!!!!  Very bad service im not happy with this seller at all...never buying anything for this seller....</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it twice in the past year. You really have to soak your feet before you put the booties on for it to work well. My feet were not in terrible condition to begin with but they did peel and looked much better after a week. I would not advise you to use this if you are going to be wearing sandals soon after using the product just because it looks weird when your feet begin to peel.</li>
            <li> It was completely amazing. I&#x27;m giving it to my mom for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift. She is going to love it.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2 pack of these to try. One for my daughter (main reason for buying) and one for myself. We each soaked our feet for 30 minutes before using and than dried our feet. We slipped our feet into the booties and to make sure they were extra secure we placed socks over them as some users online have recommended. We left them on for one hr, even though the companies Facebook page says to leave on for 2hrs. After the hr we washed our feet and put on socks. My daughter walks around barefoot almost all the time and had very thick ugly calluses on her heels and the pads of her feet. Her feet started peeling within 2 days and look like brand new feet. She is still peeling but she feet have improved by 90%. My feet we not nearly as bad as I give myself monthly pedicures but the skin on the bottom of my feet still peeled off in almost a whole piece all at once within 4 days. Make sure to soak you feet nightly for at least 10 minutes...or just take your nightly bath/shower and that will work as well. I will be buying this again next month for another application for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This product really, truly does the job and I am delighted. I am one of the unfortunates who have feet rough with callouses and thick, dry skin. No amount of Pedicures, exfoliating, wild-wacky products, or happy thoughts can touch. ~~ That is until I gave Baby Foot a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few tries yielded encouraging but not astounding results. Some skin shed over a two week period, but my feet were still disappointingly hard and calloused. Bummer. But what about all the rave reviews?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried a few variations and am delighted with results. The dry skin painlessly peels away over a two week period, leaving fresh looking, smooth, soft to the touch skin. Finally. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soak my feet up to the ankles in a tub of hot water with a cup of bath salts or epsom salts along with a 1/4 - 1/2 cup baking soda, for 30 minute or so. Once I&#x27;ve dried my feet I put one of the Baby Foot packets on each foot, sit down with feet wrapped in towels to keep them warm. After two hours, I follow package directions by unwrapping my feet, pulling off the Baby Foot booties, then wash all the Baby Foot &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; off my feet.d I apply heavy duty moisturizer and keep my feet in socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days pass and, as others have reported, sometimes there isn&#x27;t much action, so I soak my feet up to the ankles for at least 30 minutes in hot water with bath or epsom salts and baking soda. This is when the old skin on my feet starts to come off in peels and cracks - no pain, but soft pink skin underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next few days are gross as others have noted because the peeling continues so unless you want to leave large patches of your DNA all over the place, keep the socks on! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is all I know. When you want to accelerate the process by soaking in hot water, Keep the water as warm as you can tolerate and eventually. you should be rewarded with those soft Baby Feet!</li>
            <li> Phenomenal - my feet haven&#x27;t felt this fresh since my last pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;Results last several weeks. I&#x27;ve already purchased a second one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my feet were too bad, so I thought I wouldn&#x27;t get much peeling because  I keep up with them and baby them.  I wanted to see if this product would do anything for me.  I am really impressed with how much peeling, and how soft my feet are 3 weeks after the treatment.  I want to do it again!</li>
            <li> I will hail this product from the mountaintops!  my feet are generally very dry and calloused.  All the women in my family have similar feet.  I have tried everything to make them soft and pink.  No pedicure, pumas, scraper, ointment, wax or moisturizer really worked for me... then I. discovered Baby Foot.  After 2 applications, my feet are piggy pink with all new fresh skin and no calloused dry ugly horrible looking skin!  My sister&#x27;s feet were worse than mine and now thay are piggy pink, too!  I will be giving this to all my girlfriends, from now on.  THANK YOU BABY FOOT!!</li>
            <li> Baby Foot worked wonderfully. Feet started to peel after 1 week and became smooth.</li>
            <li> Wow does this work.  I will probably do this before every summer, from now on!!</li>
            <li> This works. I had so much dead skin that my feet were constantly hard and dry.  Now they are so soft. Great now that it is summer and sandals are required.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. When it flakes off, be ready! I was at yoga. Try to monitor when it will flake. Works well. Will not get rid of bunions.</li>
            <li> Amazing. After all the peeling was over my feet were very soft. My heals were still thick but the ladies at the nail place couldn&#x27;t get them all soft either so I&#x27;m not concerned.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten to use this product yet but I am looking forward to trying it out.</li>
            <li> After reading dozens of reviews, I tried the product and was amazed at how much dead skin came off my feet - and I scrub them with a  pumice stone in the shower several times a week. As suggested, soak your feet in warm water for at least 30 minutes before using the booties. I leave the product on for 60-90 minutes before rinsing. Within 48 hours the skin is loose and will start to peel like a sunburn without the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;. I have used 2 sets of booties in 6 months and will used the third after spring holiday. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product !  I &amp;#34;discovered &amp;#34; it last year and I swear by it still- easier, faster and more effective than anything I have tried before-</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used!  Soak feet four days after initial use - like magic!</li>
            <li> Be patient and soak your feet using bath salts/Epsom salts before treatment and every night. Don&#x27;t freak out when your feet start to peel--roll the skin off with your towel. In a week to 10 days, the peeling should be complete.</li>
            <li> These unique exfoliator booties really do exactly what they say!  Put your feet in, wait an hour and voila!  A week later, ALL the skin peels off your dry feet leaving them smooth as a baby&#x27;s tummy :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic - I recommend soaking your feet 10 minutes a night - you&#x27;ll see a dramatic skin peel happening and it&#x27;s so awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  I would highly recommend this product!!! This is like a peel for ur feet!  My feet felt so smooth after the treatment!</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks. My feet were so rough that they were dragging on the sheets like Velcro.  Tried Baby Foot on a Friday night. The following Wednesday night about 25% of my dead foot skin fell off starting from the bottom.  They continued to peel for a week or so until very soft all over.  Zero pain or discomfort and I am on my feet a lot.  Sleeping is much better now and it&#x27;s easier to pull on socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife watched apprehensively as I tried it first but is peeling as I type.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> These are the best and freaky. Your foot will shed like a major sunburn, it is weird. But your feet won&#x27;t hurt and won&#x27;t be red. Just don&#x27;t be tempted to peel when your feet are wet, just let it peal off naturally</li>
            <li> it really works - my daughter and I were amazed...your feet peel for over a week and the result is feet that are baby soft - truly amazing -</li>
            <li> Really works!  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Always leaves my feet baby soft!</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what it said it would do. The peeling started for me on day 4.  I did soak my feet for 30 minutes each night after soaking my feet in the bags. My feet looked exactly like the pictures sent in. Looked horrible, but no pain, at all. Loved it. Will use again when needed.  It even removed my callouses on toes and heals.</li>
            <li> I was very doubtful about this product with it&#x27;s claims saying your old skin will just peel off and you will have baby soft feet. I got to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this product. It&#x27;s a chemical peel for your feet, no lie. Like the product says it take a while for your feet to peel. So don&#x27;t expect it to happen overnight. It takes about a week for your feet to start peeling. Don&#x27;t freak out either when they start to peel all over. It&#x27;s supposed to happen and they do peel a lot and  it take a lot of skin off but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives about this product is that your feet peel for about a week or a little bit longer so you might not want to wear shoes that show off your feet while they are in the peeling phase. Another negativity is the results do not last that long if your the type of person who walks around barefoot or wears sandals a lot of the time, like me, For someone like that, it will last about a month to three months. I&#x27;m guessing the products results would last longer if you are someone who wears sneakers and maybe even heels a lot.</li>
            <li> This really does what it says. If you follow the directions (I leave the footpads on for 1.5-2 hrs.) and DONT try to scrape/peel it off too soon, it will absolutely leave you with baby soft skin. The challenge is then to protect and moisturize the new skin surface so you don&#x27;t have to repeat it!</li>
            <li> It was easy to use but you had to soak your feet for an hour before applying the boots. It took a week before any skin started to peel. The peeling continued for the next week and I had to wear socks to keep the dead skin from flaking everywhere. The whole foot pealed when I only needed the bottom of my feet to be treated. You can&#x27;t spot treat.  It didn&#x27;t remove the thicker skin on the ball of my foot.  I was disappointed with the results considerating the cost of the treatment. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
