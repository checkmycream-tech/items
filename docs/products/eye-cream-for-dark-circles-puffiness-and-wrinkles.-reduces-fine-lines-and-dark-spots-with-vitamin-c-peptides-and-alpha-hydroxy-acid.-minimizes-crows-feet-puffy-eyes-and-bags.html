            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>

            <li>This formula has one of my favorite ingredients in it for moisture and vibrance...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>they are so costly and this affordable eye cream gets better results.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get sucked in to thinking that just because you pay a lot you are getting better quality.  </li>

            <li>And I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I love toulon eye gel.</li>
            <li>In fact the company even called me , Said I should get more sleep, are you kidding me.</li>
            <li>My crow&#x27;s feet are already looking better.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>The long-term effectiveness of this product are still to be determined, but I&#x27;m looking forward to finding out more if the immediate effects are so visible.  </li>
            <li>, I figured I should probably do more to take care of my skin.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Received many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Most men don&#x27;t use eye cream</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream</li>
            <li>Well  glad I saw that.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to have received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>product feels very rich and</li>
            <li>Very smooth, goes on easy.</li>
            <li>I tried La Mer first and loved the cream&#x27;s texture and reputation but didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li>Excited about the results!</li>
            <li>Great new product from this company.  </li>
            <li>If you read the reviews the ones saying they love it are mostly the ones who got it for free...........</li>
            <li>During the day it has been fine to apply my make up over the cream and in the evening I have been more liberal with the product.  </li>
            <li>and I think that the fine lines around my eyes are looking better.  </li>
            <li>and I am certainly happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>and I can already see the circles becoming lighter and</li>
            <li>I like this light, refreshing, non-greasy eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and fresh and looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is loaded with great ingredients and makes the delicate skin around my eyes feel great.</li>
            <li>it is very informative and useful with great information on how your skin works and how to take care of it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use; works well with face Toulon moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>And anyone else that doesn&#x27;t want to put something on their face that is strong smelling, this cream is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not done any better so far than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, but will continue with it to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one searching for that perfect miracle eye cream,  I&#x27;ve used them all, I use medical grade skin care,  this cream is the same thing, not greasy, absorbs perfectly, I&#x27;ve been using day and night over my retinol eye serum, lightly scented kinda like lavender, calming,  the scent fades, most burn my eyes, not this one.</li>
            <li>I’m actually impressed: I’ve only been using it for a short time, and my wrinkles already look a good bit smoother.</li>
            <li>Best Solution for Reducing Puffiness and Dark Circles under the eye while Diminishing Stubborn Wrinkles, Fine Lines and Crow&#x27;s Feet.</li>
            <li>I love the clean smell and the creamy, smooth, application of the eye renewal therapy.  </li>
            <li>I have a stubborn fine line under my eye after 4 days</li>
            <li>my fine lines around my eyes are ironing out too.</li>
            <li>My mom (50) tried it and it brightened her skin around the eyes and smoothed out the fine lines.</li>
            <li>Product was provided for review, thank youe while Diminishing Stubborn Wrinkles, Fine Lines and Crow&#x27;s Feet.</li>
            <li>but I do have puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I have been amazed at how this product is helping with my eye problems of puffiness/dark circles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I am eagerly looking forward to continue to use this product to treat my puffiness/dark circles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I had noticed fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>fine lines disappear.  </li>
            <li>The aloe Vera helps improve blood circulation, also helping with puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>A noticable difference on crows feet and fine lines in a week.</li>
            <li>applying the fragrance-free, gentle lotion around your eye, notice how mild the AHA moisturizer is for all skin types yet effective with glycolic acid to get incredible facial treatment results.</li>
            <li>I already exfoliate my skin every weekend with a microdermabrasion machine, so I don&#x27;t see a huge difference, but</li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference in the skin coloration around my eyes as well as reduction in puffiness that I was carrying under my lower eyelid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already notice a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>This is a huge factor for me.  </li>
            <li>Lack of sleep is a huge reason I wanted to try this eye cream out.</li>
            <li>the eye cream is really fabulous.  </li>
            <li>My eyeliner went on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free and organic.</li>
            <li>This eye cream goes on  so smooth and  gives an immediate cooling effect to the eye area.</li>
            <li>Simply a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>so I bought one of the eye creams as soon as it was available for my wife and I to try.  </li>

            <li>I can’t say for sure if my crows feet are better because I didn’t make it a point to really look at them before I started using this.</li>
            <li>I must say so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>the luxurious, nutrient filled eye creme &amp; feel the organic, rich, non-oily moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I am so excited that I ran across these products that I will use for life.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited because it has helped already</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my mom to try</li>
            <li>but it is already evident that it is better than what I was using before.  </li>
            <li>Feels so soft on my skin and has a light, refreshing fragrance!</li>
            <li>Excited to keep using it.</li>
            <li>: I bought this product on discount with a coupon, but I believe the full-price is worth it!</li>
            <li>rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>At first, it seemed to make my wrinkles look more pronounced (maybe about 5 days or so), but with continued use I can see the moisture levels around my eyes have risen</li>
            <li>my under eye looked more dehydrated - only thing I liked about it</li>
            <li>I have found that after applying my tinted moisturizer or foundation after the cream has absorbed, my make-up looks more fresh.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, this cream absorbs beautifully.</li>
            <li>I work hard and always try to look my best</li>
            <li>I bought the full line of skin care (the Vitamin C Serum, the eye cream, and the face cream).  </li>
            <li>Leaves you eyes felling cool and relaxed.  </li>
            <li>I bough this cream for my girlfriend, and she absolutely loves it, it does everything it claims and more.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far.</li>
            <li>The cream is soothing and cool and creamy when applied under my eye.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>Most eye creams irritate my eyes, and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Plus the packaging is so luxe and reasonably priced. :)</li>
            <li>Not a bad combo of ingredients, but spoiled ingredients like rotten food.</li>
            <li>Decided to try the eye cream since I have been happy with the other skin care products from Toulon.  </li>
            <li>I love my new eye cream!  </li>
            <li>formulated the perfect blend of ingredients (Vitamin C, Rosehip Oil, Green Tea, Glycolic Acid and other AHA like Lactic Acid &amp; Alpha Lipoic Acid, Coenzyme Q10, Grapeseed Oil, jojoba oil, Vit E &amp; A) with the precise tested effective ratios.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>This eye cream is dermatologist or spa worthy.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>This makes my entire face look so much better and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It gives my eyes a more vibrant appearance.</li>
            <li>Mild and Proven</li>
            <li>This eye cream is dermatologist or spa worthy.</li>
            <li>Mild and Proven</li>
            <li>This eye cream is dermatologist or spa worthy.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>barely made a dent in my jar, too, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with every products and I can’t wait to see what they come out with next.</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely great eye cream for dark circles and puffiness under the eye.  </li>
            <li>this is my new favorite product</li>
            <li>Get ready to say goodbye to dark circles, puffiness, and crow&#x27;s feet &amp; welcome to a rejuvenated youthful look with fabulously radiant eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Open</li>
            <li>I’ll be interested to see how it works over time!</li>
            <li>So far great,  and way better than any pricey eye cream,  big names spend money on advertising verses product, this one is very much like a high priced brand eye cream  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light on my skin and gentle to my eye area.  </li>
            <li>I really like the texture of this eye cream and the fact that it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li>Is absorbed well, not greasy or leftover residue.  </li>
            <li>So far it looks great and my makeup aroiund my eyes last longer.</li>
            <li>So far I love the product</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve had success with Toulons moisturizer, I decided to try their eye cream a go.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used it every morning since and I have to say the results are astonishingly noticeable.</li>
            <li>I use this product at morning and night on my freshly washed skin and apply basically from my under-eyes up to my forehead.</li>
            <li>This eye cream does make your skin feel incredibly soft and makes you look more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Other creams I&#x27;ve used have caused my skin to either get hot or sting but this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>It makes my entire face look better, more youthful and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>but I am so excited that I found this eye cream which is reasonably prices.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this about 2 weeks and it makes me excited to take off my makeup and get ready for bed.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel like my face is sticking to my pillow when I go to bed right after applying it.</li>
            <li>I have to say I look pretty good after being hungover and not much</li>
            <li>My 66 years old skin after only 2 days looks better, more refreshed and feels tighter.  </li>
            <li>Lucky, I have no dark eye circle or fine line yet.</li>
            <li>i only been using it for less than 2 weeks, but I like it because it&#x27;s not greasy and easy to absorb, plus they have great customer service that follow up the purchased.  </li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe the results I&#x27;ve already seen, I&#x27;m so happy that I finally find a product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li>I have been able to apply make-up directly after applying this product and haven&#x27;t felt like I&#x27;ve got too much on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different eye creams and this one I saw results right away</li>
            <li>As soon as I purchased the product I received an email from the company with very detailed instructions on the product as well as contact information if I needed further assistance with the product or my order.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly surprised at the difference this cream has made in reducing my fine lines and my puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoy other Toulon products for my skin for a more youthful glow.</li>
            <li>A eye gel that is mild and luscious while strong enough to provide results for all skin</li>
            <li>I also love the way their new packaging looks, very classy on my bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference with my puffiness under the eye in the morning and my stubborn dark circles are looking way better,  My eyes look brighter</li>
            <li>This is such a huge improvement for me!</li>
            <li>just the tiniest amount is more than enough to cover my under-eye area.</li>
            <li>Thanks TOULON!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Toulôn!</li>
            <li>I haev looked and tried so many different product vit K .</li>
            <li>The day before my order arrived I received a second email from the company to follow up on my purchase and make sure it arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Love that I can finally use an eye cream with glycolic.</li>
            <li>It arrived before it was expected nicely packed.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying any type of eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet, but I have tried so many different kinds of skin care to prevent deep wrinkles from forming.</li>
            <li>People that see me daily have now asked me if I am sleeping better since I look alert</li>
            <li>It really and truly worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless eye creams and honestly most don&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed when I got the package is it is not NSF certified or USDA Organic Certified ingredients.</li>
            <li>I can say that not only am I noticing results, but I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first year of my 30s...</li>
            <li>I have used many eye creams and I can&#x27;t say enough about Toulon.</li>
            <li>and they actually are safe, I just close my eyes and rub it all over, with no fear of getting hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And after moving here about 2 years ago I&#x27;ve really had to up my moisturizing routine!</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with my other Toulon products and have been thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>The cream is also nice and silky which feels really nice on tired eyes!</li>
            <li>Wrinkles lessen quickly, puffiness improves drastically, and dark circles lighten miraculously giving way to radiant, glowing, healthy eyes that pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What separates Eye Renewal Therapy Cream from its competitors?&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I love applying it before bed after a long day</li>
            <li>This is the first eye cream I really have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>My dark circles have cleared up so nicely.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin around eyes like most creams.</li>
            <li>A tiny amount can easily do both my eyes</li>
            <li>Thank you TOULON for another can&#x27;t live without product!!</li>
            <li>You normally don&#x27;t think of your eye cream as having a scent, but it&#x27;s very gentle and does not bother the eye area at all.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company (they are really helpful) and</li>
            <li>It is really helping me</li>
            <li>I have never had a company care so much about what I think about the product.</li>
            <li>Better then expected....</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>nothing has really helped....</li>
            <li>really find the cream soothing under my eye.</li>
            <li>The texture is very similar to lotion, the smell reminds of some of the lotions with light fragrances.</li>
            <li>I suffer from crows feet (being blonde with a light complexion just draws out my flaws too)</li>
            <li>I am rating this cream 3 stars, but only because I like the light scent and it works well as an over all moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all ladies out there !</li>
            <li>There is really no scent to this which makes it even more natural and appealing to wear daily.  </li>
            <li>Waiting between products for drying is important prior to applying concealer.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t expect anything to get rid of them but this cream really brightens up the area.  </li>
            <li>I really like Toulon products</li>
            <li>I let it &amp;#34;marinate&amp;#34; like that for a minute or two while I load my toothbrush, then I gently spread it out.</li>
            <li>I am really ahppy with this choice for an eye treatment.</li>
            <li>It has really helped me..</li>
            <li>Very luxurious feel and does not leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li>and it is really making a difference with the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much to everyone at TOULON.</li>
            <li>This cream really does work wonders.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have tried this and it instantly makes my face look smooth and youthful.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed the other Toulon products</li>
            <li>I was never a believer in using eye creams, but this is definitely a product worth having in your beauty arsenal!</li>
            <li>It may be too soon to see long term results but it seems to work well for fine lines.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very pretty and everything is clearly labelled with concise directions.  </li>
            <li>I have dark circles under my eyes and, over the years, have tried many products to correct this.  </li>
            <li>An ok eye cream, but did not improve at all the appearance of dark circles or help reduce puffiness.</li>
            <li>I love the way the dark circles faded</li>
            <li>This is going back to amazon immediately for a full refund.</li>
            <li>The dark circles were much better after a week of use.</li>
            <li>will be sending it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li>So disappointed, I honestly tough it would work great because of the many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles are less noticeable and my eyes look more awake.</li>
            <li>Less wrinkles, more fullness.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the entire line and will definitely be ordering this from now on.  </li>
            <li>I have known that glycolic acid and other aha really help to plump fine lines</li>
            <li>An amazing eye cream that delivers all it promises.all the puffiness and dark circles are gone.my skin looks much healthier and younger</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with puffiness or bags under their eye.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all of these products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eye cream.  </li>

            <li>Working well so far!!</li>
            <li>All I can saw is wow!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use eye creams</li>
            <li>I have been putting it on my very deep laugh lines instead.</li>
            <li>So far, I have waited more than enough time to see results, however, I am not quite convince.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it, and will update for further results ....</li>
            <li>I still have dark circles and some puffiness, but I am a full time graduate student and mother so sleep is not something that I get a lot of!</li>
            <li>really helped with my dark circles and it hydrated my eyes significantly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without these 3 life changing products.</li>
            <li>As I said I look and feel like a new person.  </li>
            <li>I like my new Toulon eye cream.</li>
            <li>I bought a jar of this eye cream at an event in New York City about a week ago.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly, it doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling after, and it gives a slight cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s been zero reduction in fine lines and dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Subtle but effective</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin and this product is gentle, natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had much luck when it came to eye creams as far as helping minimize the puffiness, but I was pleasantly surprised when I started seeing results after about 5 days.</li>
            <li>Taking care of the skin around my eye has always been important to me since I know it makes a big difference in overall appearance.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, gentle and silky which helps it go on easily as I do not rub my eye area.  </li>
            <li>I completely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Really seems to help eye puffiness!  </li>
            <li>First, I like how the product feels on my skin, especially when I dab it on after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I know because I worked for a major department store brand!!!</li>
            <li>The jar is kind of small but only a couple of dabs a day does the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll repost later if I have positive results.</li>
            <li>The seller contacted me shortly after purchasing this cream making sure any typical questions asked were answered.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to see results so quickly when so many products failed to help anything.</li>
            <li>feels great going on, but disappointing results.</li>
            <li>they explained that it is just the natural scent of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I think that it is important to use the eye cream everyday.</li>
            <li>Oh wow another hit from Toulon.</li>
            <li>but if your skin is sensitive I suggest once a day.</li>
            <li>Wow factor!!I can&#x27;t for Toulon to make something else...</li>
            <li>I already notice a considerable difference in the skin under my eyes after just one week of use.</li>
            <li>I feel my puffiness might disappear completely.</li>
            <li>All around my eye area now looks so much brighter, younger and healthier.  </li>
            <li>was the velvet soft feel.</li>
            <li>I have been using for a week now and really like the moisture that last all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;ORGANIC, NATURAL, &amp; CRUELTY-FREE:</li>
            <li>/&gt;ORGANIC, NATURAL, &amp; CRUELTY-FREE:</li>
            <li>Been using glycolic for 40 yrs and my 65 year old skin looks like 40yr old skin, but always had to avoid eye area.</li>
            <li>The cream is gentle enough to use in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li>Once applied, you have a velvety soft feel to your skin.</li>
            <li>wow what a difference.</li>
            <li>I can just apply my cream &amp; go about my day with soft looking eyes.</li>
            <li>I am consistently surprised when I accidentally touch my eyes during the day and feel just how soft and moist my eyes feel.</li>
            <li>The eye treatment cream is all organic and natural.  </li>
            <li>The dark circles under my eyes are barely visible anymore, and better yet, coworkers have been asking me why I look so different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31, and I thought I was too young to have to worry about this stuff until I looked in the mirror one day and felt so old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman who is routinely asked what products do I use on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I also like all the natural ingredients...</li>
            <li>The only downside is it REALLY stings when it got in my eyes when I was in a rush.</li>
            <li>It is 60% organic and 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>Working full time and being a mom of small children can be very tiring.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is non irritating, soothing and absorbs into my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>The cream is very light and does not irritate my eyes at all and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>A little jar of rich, luxurious eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Just a super tiny dab turns out to go a very long way.</li>
            <li>As with many creams, a little goes a long way with this one.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product everyday 2x a day the undereye bags have cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li>This product not only leaves your skin soft and smooth but helps diminish dark circles and eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>Excited to see results after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>no more fine lines (bye bye crows feet).  </li>
            <li>For being such a tiny jar, I first thought it was sort of a rip off.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have dark circles or much puffiness</li>
            <li>overall I have a nice complexion but under my eyes are always puffy and dark due to allergies.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the past week on the right eye and haven&#x27;t seen any difference between the right and left eye yet.</li>
            <li>Highly suspiscious when the stars are coming from reviewers that have only made reviews about Toulon&#x27;s line....</li>
            <li>The cream is a nice consistency (not too thick and not too thin) and has a light natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The cream was absorbed quickly and did not leave any residue behind.  </li>
            <li>The vitamin c in the product is protected since light is deflected and not able to penetrate through the pot container.  </li>
            <li>No dark circles either.</li>
            <li>People have been saying that I look younger and my eyes feel like they have a new lift to them.</li>
            <li>Does say you can use as a general moisturizer if you would like.</li>
            <li>Have only used it 3 times so far, but noticed a difference in skin texture under my eyes already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m halfway  on my first jar and can slightly see a difference  will update once i finish  jar</li>
            <li>Although it is only 15 mL, it really only takes a dab on each eye to get complete coverage!  </li>
            <li>Just purchased this, i was a little shock of how small it was, but a little goes a long way, i noticed my dark circles getting lighter, so far so good!!</li>
            <li>Not irritating like other products I have used.  </li>
            <li>but you can find that much cheaper in other products.</li>
            <li>The creme is so thick and soft, instantly hydrating my skin to appear as if I have had a full night sleep.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving this through a promotion, I recommend this low price cream to add to your beauty regime daily as the ingredients are organic and natural and it works when used often.</li>
            <li>so I love that this eye renewal therapy really helps me look less tired.  </li>
            <li>As of now the puffiness is gone and the dark circles have gotten so much lighter.  </li>
            <li>This works very well but doesn&#x27;t seem to have an effect on my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Seems to have reduced dark circles and puffiness very well.</li>
            <li>I inherited my father&#x27;s eyes puffy dark eyes, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>And on the plus side, I don&#x27;t feel like I need as much make-up under the eyes, since the skin does not appear as dark.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry place- Utah-</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my puffiness/dark circles and fine lines have become less and less each day since I have only tried this product for a week now.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream, it is not greasy, but feels creamy when applying and the puffiness under my eyes has diminished slightly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have the biggest dark eye problem per se, but I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and need an overall pick-me-up in the eye area.</li>
            <li>I use the cream to help lessen wrinkles around the eye as I get older but also to prevent dark circles.  </li>

            <li>now I have been using this product for a little over a month routinely and I am really seeing my under eye change in color and in puffiness.  </li>
            <li>The puffiness under my eyes has decreased and some of my fine lines are starting to not be so noticeable.  </li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>

            <li> This formula has one of my favorite ingredients in it for moisture and vibrance...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> they are so costly and this affordable eye cream gets better results.  </li>

            <li> In fact the company even called me , Said I should get more sleep, are you kidding me.</li>
            <li> My crow&#x27;s feet are already looking better.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> The long-term effectiveness of this product are still to be determined, but I&#x27;m looking forward to finding out more if the immediate effects are so visible.  </li>
            <li> , I figured I should probably do more to take care of my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Received many compliments.  </li>
            <li> Most men don&#x27;t use eye cream</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream</li>
            <li> Well  glad I saw that.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to have received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> product feels very rich and</li>
            <li> Very smooth, goes on easy.</li>
            <li> I tried La Mer first and loved the cream&#x27;s texture and reputation but didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> Excited about the results!</li>
            <li> Great new product from this company.  </li>
            <li> If you read the reviews the ones saying they love it are mostly the ones who got it for free...........</li>
            <li> During the day it has been fine to apply my make up over the cream and in the evening I have been more liberal with the product.  </li>
            <li> and I think that the fine lines around my eyes are looking better.  </li>
            <li> and I am certainly happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> and I can already see the circles becoming lighter and</li>
            <li> I like this light, refreshing, non-greasy eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and fresh and looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is loaded with great ingredients and makes the delicate skin around my eyes feel great.</li>
            <li> it is very informative and useful with great information on how your skin works and how to take care of it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; works well with face Toulon moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> And anyone else that doesn&#x27;t want to put something on their face that is strong smelling, this cream is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not done any better so far than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, but will continue with it to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one searching for that perfect miracle eye cream,  I&#x27;ve used them all, I use medical grade skin care,  this cream is the same thing, not greasy, absorbs perfectly, I&#x27;ve been using day and night over my retinol eye serum, lightly scented kinda like lavender, calming,  the scent fades, most burn my eyes, not this one.</li>
            <li> I’m actually impressed: I’ve only been using it for a short time, and my wrinkles already look a good bit smoother.</li>
            <li> Best Solution for Reducing Puffiness and Dark Circles under the eye while Diminishing Stubborn Wrinkles, Fine Lines and Crow&#x27;s Feet.</li>
            <li> I love the clean smell and the creamy, smooth, application of the eye renewal therapy.  </li>
            <li> I have a stubborn fine line under my eye after 4 days</li>
            <li> my fine lines around my eyes are ironing out too.</li>
            <li> My mom (50) tried it and it brightened her skin around the eyes and smoothed out the fine lines.</li>
            <li> Product was provided for review, thank youe while Diminishing Stubborn Wrinkles, Fine Lines and Crow&#x27;s Feet.</li>
            <li> but I do have puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I have been amazed at how this product is helping with my eye problems of puffiness/dark circles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I am eagerly looking forward to continue to use this product to treat my puffiness/dark circles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I had noticed fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> fine lines disappear.  </li>
            <li> The aloe Vera helps improve blood circulation, also helping with puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> A noticable difference on crows feet and fine lines in a week.</li>
            <li> applying the fragrance-free, gentle lotion around your eye, notice how mild the AHA moisturizer is for all skin types yet effective with glycolic acid to get incredible facial treatment results.</li>
            <li> I already exfoliate my skin every weekend with a microdermabrasion machine, so I don&#x27;t see a huge difference, but</li>
            <li> I can see a huge difference in the skin coloration around my eyes as well as reduction in puffiness that I was carrying under my lower eyelid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already notice a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> This is a huge factor for me.  </li>
            <li> Lack of sleep is a huge reason I wanted to try this eye cream out.</li>
            <li> the eye cream is really fabulous.  </li>
            <li> My eyeliner went on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free and organic.</li>
            <li> This eye cream goes on  so smooth and  gives an immediate cooling effect to the eye area.</li>
            <li> Simply a fantastic product.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> the luxurious, nutrient filled eye creme &amp; feel the organic, rich, non-oily moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I ran across these products that I will use for life.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited because it has helped already</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my mom to try</li>
            <li> but it is already evident that it is better than what I was using before.  </li>
            <li> Feels so soft on my skin and has a light, refreshing fragrance!</li>
            <li> Excited to keep using it.</li>
            <li> : I bought this product on discount with a coupon, but I believe the full-price is worth it!</li>
            <li> rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> At first, it seemed to make my wrinkles look more pronounced (maybe about 5 days or so), but with continued use I can see the moisture levels around my eyes have risen</li>
            <li> my under eye looked more dehydrated - only thing I liked about it</li>
            <li> I have found that after applying my tinted moisturizer or foundation after the cream has absorbed, my make-up looks more fresh.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, this cream absorbs beautifully.</li>
            <li> I work hard and always try to look my best</li>
            <li> I bought the full line of skin care (the Vitamin C Serum, the eye cream, and the face cream).  </li>
            <li> Leaves you eyes felling cool and relaxed.  </li>
            <li> I bough this cream for my girlfriend, and she absolutely loves it, it does everything it claims and more.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far.</li>
            <li> The cream is soothing and cool and creamy when applied under my eye.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> Most eye creams irritate my eyes, and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Plus the packaging is so luxe and reasonably priced. :)</li>
            <li> Not a bad combo of ingredients, but spoiled ingredients like rotten food.</li>
            <li> Decided to try the eye cream since I have been happy with the other skin care products from Toulon.  </li>
            <li> I love my new eye cream!  </li>
            <li> formulated the perfect blend of ingredients (Vitamin C, Rosehip Oil, Green Tea, Glycolic Acid and other AHA like Lactic Acid &amp; Alpha Lipoic Acid, Coenzyme Q10, Grapeseed Oil, jojoba oil, Vit E &amp; A) with the precise tested effective ratios.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> This eye cream is dermatologist or spa worthy.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> This makes my entire face look so much better and healthy.  </li>
            <li> It gives my eyes a more vibrant appearance.</li>
            <li> Mild and Proven</li>
            <li> This eye cream is dermatologist or spa worthy.</li>
            <li> Mild and Proven</li>
            <li> This eye cream is dermatologist or spa worthy.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> barely made a dent in my jar, too, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with every products and I can’t wait to see what they come out with next.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely great eye cream for dark circles and puffiness under the eye.  </li>
            <li> this is my new favorite product</li>
            <li> Get ready to say goodbye to dark circles, puffiness, and crow&#x27;s feet &amp; welcome to a rejuvenated youthful look with fabulously radiant eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Open</li>
            <li> I’ll be interested to see how it works over time!</li>
            <li> So far great,  and way better than any pricey eye cream,  big names spend money on advertising verses product, this one is very much like a high priced brand eye cream  </li>
            <li> It is very creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is light on my skin and gentle to my eye area.  </li>
            <li> I really like the texture of this eye cream and the fact that it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li> Is absorbed well, not greasy or leftover residue.  </li>
            <li> So far it looks great and my makeup aroiund my eyes last longer.</li>
            <li> So far I love the product</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had success with Toulons moisturizer, I decided to try their eye cream a go.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used it every morning since and I have to say the results are astonishingly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I use this product at morning and night on my freshly washed skin and apply basically from my under-eyes up to my forehead.</li>
            <li> This eye cream does make your skin feel incredibly soft and makes you look more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Other creams I&#x27;ve used have caused my skin to either get hot or sting but this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> It makes my entire face look better, more youthful and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> but I am so excited that I found this eye cream which is reasonably prices.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about 2 weeks and it makes me excited to take off my makeup and get ready for bed.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel like my face is sticking to my pillow when I go to bed right after applying it.</li>
            <li> I have to say I look pretty good after being hungover and not much</li>
            <li> My 66 years old skin after only 2 days looks better, more refreshed and feels tighter.  </li>
            <li> Lucky, I have no dark eye circle or fine line yet.</li>
            <li> i only been using it for less than 2 weeks, but I like it because it&#x27;s not greasy and easy to absorb, plus they have great customer service that follow up the purchased.  </li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe the results I&#x27;ve already seen, I&#x27;m so happy that I finally find a product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I have been able to apply make-up directly after applying this product and haven&#x27;t felt like I&#x27;ve got too much on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different eye creams and this one I saw results right away</li>
            <li> As soon as I purchased the product I received an email from the company with very detailed instructions on the product as well as contact information if I needed further assistance with the product or my order.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly surprised at the difference this cream has made in reducing my fine lines and my puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoy other Toulon products for my skin for a more youthful glow.</li>
            <li> A eye gel that is mild and luscious while strong enough to provide results for all skin</li>
            <li> I also love the way their new packaging looks, very classy on my bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference with my puffiness under the eye in the morning and my stubborn dark circles are looking way better,  My eyes look brighter</li>
            <li> This is such a huge improvement for me!</li>
            <li> just the tiniest amount is more than enough to cover my under-eye area.</li>
            <li> Thanks TOULON!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Toulôn!</li>
            <li> I haev looked and tried so many different product vit K .</li>
            <li> The day before my order arrived I received a second email from the company to follow up on my purchase and make sure it arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Love that I can finally use an eye cream with glycolic.</li>
            <li> It arrived before it was expected nicely packed.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying any type of eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet, but I have tried so many different kinds of skin care to prevent deep wrinkles from forming.</li>
            <li> People that see me daily have now asked me if I am sleeping better since I look alert</li>
            <li> It really and truly worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless eye creams and honestly most don&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed when I got the package is it is not NSF certified or USDA Organic Certified ingredients.</li>
            <li> I can say that not only am I noticing results, but I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first year of my 30s...</li>
            <li> I have used many eye creams and I can&#x27;t say enough about Toulon.</li>
            <li> and they actually are safe, I just close my eyes and rub it all over, with no fear of getting hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And after moving here about 2 years ago I&#x27;ve really had to up my moisturizing routine!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with my other Toulon products and have been thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> The cream is also nice and silky which feels really nice on tired eyes!</li>
            <li> Wrinkles lessen quickly, puffiness improves drastically, and dark circles lighten miraculously giving way to radiant, glowing, healthy eyes that pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What separates Eye Renewal Therapy Cream from its competitors?&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I love applying it before bed after a long day</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream I really have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles have cleared up so nicely.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin around eyes like most creams.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount can easily do both my eyes</li>
            <li> Thank you TOULON for another can&#x27;t live without product!!</li>
            <li> You normally don&#x27;t think of your eye cream as having a scent, but it&#x27;s very gentle and does not bother the eye area at all.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company (they are really helpful) and</li>
            <li> It is really helping me</li>
            <li> I have never had a company care so much about what I think about the product.</li>
            <li> Better then expected....</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> nothing has really helped....</li>
            <li> really find the cream soothing under my eye.</li>
            <li> The texture is very similar to lotion, the smell reminds of some of the lotions with light fragrances.</li>
            <li> I suffer from crows feet (being blonde with a light complexion just draws out my flaws too)</li>
            <li> I am rating this cream 3 stars, but only because I like the light scent and it works well as an over all moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all ladies out there !</li>
            <li> There is really no scent to this which makes it even more natural and appealing to wear daily.  </li>
            <li> Waiting between products for drying is important prior to applying concealer.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t expect anything to get rid of them but this cream really brightens up the area.  </li>
            <li> I really like Toulon products</li>
            <li> I let it &amp;#34;marinate&amp;#34; like that for a minute or two while I load my toothbrush, then I gently spread it out.</li>
            <li> I am really ahppy with this choice for an eye treatment.</li>
            <li> It has really helped me..</li>
            <li> Very luxurious feel and does not leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li> and it is really making a difference with the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much to everyone at TOULON.</li>
            <li> This cream really does work wonders.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have tried this and it instantly makes my face look smooth and youthful.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed the other Toulon products</li>
            <li> I was never a believer in using eye creams, but this is definitely a product worth having in your beauty arsenal!</li>
            <li> It may be too soon to see long term results but it seems to work well for fine lines.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very pretty and everything is clearly labelled with concise directions.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes and, over the years, have tried many products to correct this.  </li>
            <li> An ok eye cream, but did not improve at all the appearance of dark circles or help reduce puffiness.</li>
            <li> I love the way the dark circles faded</li>
            <li> This is going back to amazon immediately for a full refund.</li>
            <li> The dark circles were much better after a week of use.</li>
            <li> will be sending it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li> So disappointed, I honestly tough it would work great because of the many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are less noticeable and my eyes look more awake.</li>
            <li> Less wrinkles, more fullness.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the entire line and will definitely be ordering this from now on.  </li>
            <li> I have known that glycolic acid and other aha really help to plump fine lines</li>
            <li> An amazing eye cream that delivers all it promises.all the puffiness and dark circles are gone.my skin looks much healthier and younger</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with puffiness or bags under their eye.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all of these products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eye cream.  </li>

            <li> Working well so far!!</li>
            <li> All I can saw is wow!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use eye creams</li>
            <li> I have been putting it on my very deep laugh lines instead.</li>
            <li> So far, I have waited more than enough time to see results, however, I am not quite convince.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it, and will update for further results ....</li>
            <li> I still have dark circles and some puffiness, but I am a full time graduate student and mother so sleep is not something that I get a lot of!</li>
            <li> really helped with my dark circles and it hydrated my eyes significantly.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these 3 life changing products.</li>
            <li> As I said I look and feel like a new person.  </li>
            <li> I like my new Toulon eye cream.</li>
            <li> I bought a jar of this eye cream at an event in New York City about a week ago.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly, it doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling after, and it gives a slight cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s been zero reduction in fine lines and dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Subtle but effective</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin and this product is gentle, natural and organic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much luck when it came to eye creams as far as helping minimize the puffiness, but I was pleasantly surprised when I started seeing results after about 5 days.</li>
            <li> Taking care of the skin around my eye has always been important to me since I know it makes a big difference in overall appearance.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth, gentle and silky which helps it go on easily as I do not rub my eye area.  </li>
            <li> I completely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Really seems to help eye puffiness!  </li>
            <li> First, I like how the product feels on my skin, especially when I dab it on after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I know because I worked for a major department store brand!!!</li>
            <li> The jar is kind of small but only a couple of dabs a day does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll repost later if I have positive results.</li>
            <li> The seller contacted me shortly after purchasing this cream making sure any typical questions asked were answered.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to see results so quickly when so many products failed to help anything.</li>
            <li> feels great going on, but disappointing results.</li>
            <li> they explained that it is just the natural scent of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I think that it is important to use the eye cream everyday.</li>
            <li> Oh wow another hit from Toulon.</li>
            <li> but if your skin is sensitive I suggest once a day.</li>
            <li> Wow factor!!I can&#x27;t for Toulon to make something else...</li>
            <li> I already notice a considerable difference in the skin under my eyes after just one week of use.</li>
            <li> I feel my puffiness might disappear completely.</li>
            <li> All around my eye area now looks so much brighter, younger and healthier.  </li>
            <li> was the velvet soft feel.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a week now and really like the moisture that last all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ORGANIC, NATURAL, &amp; CRUELTY-FREE:</li>
            <li> /&gt;ORGANIC, NATURAL, &amp; CRUELTY-FREE:</li>
            <li> Been using glycolic for 40 yrs and my 65 year old skin looks like 40yr old skin, but always had to avoid eye area.</li>
            <li> The cream is gentle enough to use in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li> Once applied, you have a velvety soft feel to your skin.</li>
            <li> wow what a difference.</li>
            <li> I can just apply my cream &amp; go about my day with soft looking eyes.</li>
            <li> I am consistently surprised when I accidentally touch my eyes during the day and feel just how soft and moist my eyes feel.</li>
            <li> The eye treatment cream is all organic and natural.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes are barely visible anymore, and better yet, coworkers have been asking me why I look so different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31, and I thought I was too young to have to worry about this stuff until I looked in the mirror one day and felt so old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman who is routinely asked what products do I use on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I also like all the natural ingredients...</li>
            <li> The only downside is it REALLY stings when it got in my eyes when I was in a rush.</li>
            <li> It is 60% organic and 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> Working full time and being a mom of small children can be very tiring.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream is non irritating, soothing and absorbs into my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> The cream is very light and does not irritate my eyes at all and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little jar of rich, luxurious eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Just a super tiny dab turns out to go a very long way.</li>
            <li> As with many creams, a little goes a long way with this one.  </li>
            <li> Since using this product everyday 2x a day the undereye bags have cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li> This product not only leaves your skin soft and smooth but helps diminish dark circles and eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> Excited to see results after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> no more fine lines (bye bye crows feet).  </li>
            <li> For being such a tiny jar, I first thought it was sort of a rip off.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have dark circles or much puffiness</li>
            <li> overall I have a nice complexion but under my eyes are always puffy and dark due to allergies.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past week on the right eye and haven&#x27;t seen any difference between the right and left eye yet.</li>
            <li> Highly suspiscious when the stars are coming from reviewers that have only made reviews about Toulon&#x27;s line....</li>
            <li> The cream is a nice consistency (not too thick and not too thin) and has a light natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The cream was absorbed quickly and did not leave any residue behind.  </li>
            <li> The vitamin c in the product is protected since light is deflected and not able to penetrate through the pot container.  </li>
            <li> No dark circles either.</li>
            <li> People have been saying that I look younger and my eyes feel like they have a new lift to them.</li>
            <li> Does say you can use as a general moisturizer if you would like.</li>
            <li> Have only used it 3 times so far, but noticed a difference in skin texture under my eyes already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m halfway  on my first jar and can slightly see a difference  will update once i finish  jar</li>
            <li> Although it is only 15 mL, it really only takes a dab on each eye to get complete coverage!  </li>
            <li> Just purchased this, i was a little shock of how small it was, but a little goes a long way, i noticed my dark circles getting lighter, so far so good!!</li>
            <li> Not irritating like other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> but you can find that much cheaper in other products.</li>
            <li> The creme is so thick and soft, instantly hydrating my skin to appear as if I have had a full night sleep.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this through a promotion, I recommend this low price cream to add to your beauty regime daily as the ingredients are organic and natural and it works when used often.</li>
            <li> so I love that this eye renewal therapy really helps me look less tired.  </li>
            <li> As of now the puffiness is gone and the dark circles have gotten so much lighter.  </li>
            <li> This works very well but doesn&#x27;t seem to have an effect on my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Seems to have reduced dark circles and puffiness very well.</li>
            <li> I inherited my father&#x27;s eyes puffy dark eyes, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> And on the plus side, I don&#x27;t feel like I need as much make-up under the eyes, since the skin does not appear as dark.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry place- Utah-</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my puffiness/dark circles and fine lines have become less and less each day since I have only tried this product for a week now.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cream, it is not greasy, but feels creamy when applying and the puffiness under my eyes has diminished slightly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have the biggest dark eye problem per se, but I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and need an overall pick-me-up in the eye area.</li>
            <li> I use the cream to help lessen wrinkles around the eye as I get older but also to prevent dark circles.  </li>

            <li> now I have been using this product for a little over a month routinely and I am really seeing my under eye change in color and in puffiness.  </li>
            <li> The puffiness under my eyes has decreased and some of my fine lines are starting to not be so noticeable.  </li>
            <li> A little bit really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> The next morning after using this product the dry spot was smooth as a babies behind.</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t correct my hereditary dark circles, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s keeping my eyes from getting any worse.</li>
            <li> (this tiny jar is going to last me a very long time).  </li>
            <li> I absolutely will order again when I&#x27;m about half empty.  </li>
            <li> Super hydrating, not sure if I have noticed any results in the dark circles under my eyes, though.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is when I opened the jar it was only about half full.</li>
            <li> I am a mother of an infant (still nursing occasionally at night) and a toddler, so the &amp;#34;bags under the eyes&amp;#34; from limited sleep is almost a daily occurrence for me.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> While my circles have not gone away completely, I no longer look like that raccoon that I described earlier!</li>
            <li> so I can see it will be lasting me for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I was so skeptical buying such an inexpensive product expecting fabulous results but with a price tag</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to know long term effects</li>
            <li> I do have pretty dark bags and have only noticed a little difference, but not much.</li>
            <li> I have hardly used much of the container</li>
            <li> The delicate skin around my eyes is really moisturizers with the cream.</li>
            <li> I am not surprised...</li>
            <li> Over the course of a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference...</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a cream that would keep me moisturized all night long</li>
            <li> I stayed long before writing anything on the product because I wanted to try it for a week or two.</li>
            <li> I have just received this product so have not used it for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and creaming, a little goes a long way, and it absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> I noticed within the first few weeks my eyes were less puffy in the morn, and it has helped the Italian curse of dark circles.</li>
            <li> I definitely will continue using this as long as these ugly bags and fine lines stick around!  </li>
            <li> Would recommend as a product for all, but especially to the ladies who may be looking for a little smoother, creamier and long lasting product.</li>
            <li> As long as I have this stuff I seem to be fooling everyone!</li>
            <li> This eye cream is better than those expensive little jars I have gotten at Bloomingdales ...</li>
            <li> It is so moisturizing that I not only use it around my eyes but on other areas of my face that are showing signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long</li>
            <li> Well this time I had a stubborn dry spot under my eye.</li>
            <li> Using this cream helps with my dry skin in this eye area.</li>
            <li> This does not pill if allowed to dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t look as dry &amp; pulled under my eye.</li>
            <li> You want to wait until it&#x27;s completely dry before applying make up</li>
            <li> As I age, the skin around my eye area become dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry, but I don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling when using a eye</li>
            <li> I’ve always had dark circles under my eyes, at least since I was a teenager, and I’ve tried other products but without success.</li>
            <li> I’ve always had dark circles under my eyes, at least since I was a teenager, and I’ve tried other products but without success.  </li>
            <li> I’ve always had dark circles under my eyes, at least since I was a teenager, and I’ve tried other products but without success.  </li>
            <li> what I do notice is that this line of products leaves my skin feeling exfoliated each and every single day.  </li>
            <li> So far, the dark color under my eyes visibly less.  </li>
            <li> I was using moisturizer religiously and dabbing concealer to hide the dark circles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say by 80% and the dark circles are finally leaving.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> I actually look less</li>
            <li> As I enter into the 2nd half of my life, over 40, and am beginning to experience wrinkles and changes in my skin tone on my face</li>
            <li> My eyes definitely seem less puffy and baggy.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little for each eye.</li>
            <li> but you only need a little bit for your eyes and around your forehead.  </li>
            <li> very very moderate quality.....very little hydration.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days</li>
            <li> Been only using it for a few days, but I already feel a see a difference.</li>
            <li> The instruction asks to avoid eye contact, so you have to be careful not to get close to the eye which means</li>
            <li> My dark circles are fading and my skin is not so dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long and others have already noticed that the puffiness under my eye is getting less.  </li>
            <li> be awhile because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A bit pricy but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing again and can&#x27;t wait to try other Toulon products</li>
            <li> but if not will be asking for the company to refund me my money due to their guarentee.</li>
            <li> My email also included a coupon code to try out other products in their beauty line.</li>
            <li> Seems to be making a small difference, after only a week.  </li>
            <li> I felt the difference in only a few days!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing again and other products from Toulon.  </li>
            <li> I usually just smeared it all around my eyes, but the company rep explained how to properly DAB it around my eyes with my ring finger.</li>
            <li> have used other manufacturers&#x27; eye creams</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Sorry to say I&#x27;ve seen no help with puffiness under eyes, will say haven&#x27;t tried AHA pretty application as I just read in information..??</li>
            <li> You only need to dab a small amount around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> As with other creams for that area, you just dot it on very carefully with your weakest finger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this creme a short time, but already I feel reduced puffiness and that tired feeling my eyes get at the end of the day is diminishing.</li>
            <li> Purchased the product and it came half empty...</li>

            <li> Toulon Eye Renewal Therapy has helped with reducing the appearance of dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am not saying it was a miraculous change, as my age and health have taken their toll, but it did reduce a lot of the puffiness, and also lightened my dark circles.</li>
            <li> and wake up often with dark circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> My problem is dark circles and supposedly it helps lightening up the dark circles.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t cover all the dark circle area.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t affect the puffiness and dark shadows.  </li>
            <li> After using the it for three weeks, I have notice a change in my dark circles, plus the puffiness has gone down.  </li>
            <li> The puffiness is down</li>

            <li> the lines appear less and less.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for less than a week.</li>
            <li> It had a slightly off smell, and I didn&#x27;t notice any moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> I noticed less darkness under my eyes after 3 week</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes is softer and less puffy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried gel-based creams before, but they seem to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; and develop a weird, uneven surface texture that doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money did not do a thing for dark circles .</li>
            <li> Even in just 5-7 days, less appearance of dark circles!</li>

            <li> Going to keep trying for a little longer to see if it changes by then</li>
            <li> I never thought I would have dark circles at 28!  </li>
            <li> I was invited because I purchased some of their other products in the past.</li>
            <li> It seems to reduce little lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I see no significant change after two months of use.</li>

            <li> without Irritating the Fragile Skin Around the Eye.</li>
            <li> without Irritating the Fragile Skin Around the Eye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> As a mother of two toddlers 15 months apart, I have noticed increasing dark circles and puffiness (from lack of sleep) under my eyes for the past year.  </li>
            <li> Everyday I use the cream</li>
            <li> It absorbs within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too runny or thick like some of the other cream I used.</li>
            <li> The cream is not strong smelling at all.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after putting it on within a few hours the lines I usually have under my eyes from lack of sleep disappeared.</li>
            <li> but I can promise after only a week using a small amount of this product I can seem a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I inherited under eye dark circles and was looking for a product that could help me look less tired.</li>
            <li> but I use very little each time I put it on.  </li>
            <li> This all organic formula comes in a small container</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that creamy texture, usually this products have</li>
            <li> It comes in a small jar</li>
            <li> My once puffy dark eyes have now lightened, the puffiness has decreased, my lines are diminishing and my under eye looks smoother.</li>
            <li> I look less tired and the puffiness under my eye is almost non existant.  </li>
            <li> and I look less tired.  </li>
            <li> The eye cream itself is very thick and just a little bit of the cream goes along way</li>
            <li> and my eyes hardly have any darkening around them.  </li>
            <li> , we ensure our eye cream will exfoliate, treat and moisturize the delicate skin around the eye.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a thick creamy eye product.</li>
            <li> Slowly seeing  results</li>
            <li> No more tired eyes.</li>
            <li> Late night, no sleep, no problem!</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone who suffers from dark circles and/ or puffiness.</li>
            <li> Not very happy!</li>
            <li> People had been telling me that I look tired and when I looked at pictures or saw myself in the mirror</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t wear concealers-they make the circles look worse-</li>
            <li> Presenting like this makes me look tired, unprofessional and unhealthy.</li>
            <li> I lasted about 10 minutes before I had to wash my face again because the small was so atrocious.</li>
            <li> Kinda skeptical &#x27;cause it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking tired and sickly.  </li>
            <li> Well go ahead bad picture that</li>
            <li> already a bad sign  -___-</li>
            <li> I have horrible horrible bags under my eyes, that often become dark and puffier with stress and lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Used it for a week and notice that the wrinkles under my eyes were getting worst -  </li>
            <li> Made bags worse!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Decided to try the eye cream since I have been happy with the other skin care products from Toulon.  I am not surprised...the eye cream is really fabulous.  The smallest amount does the trick for both of my eyes.  Keeps my skin hydrated...feels great and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend raves about this stuff so I started using it. Now she makes ME buy it for her. Anyway, I didn’t know what to expect, but I’d have to say the skin around and especially under my eyes is brighter. I can’t say for sure if my crows feet are better because I didn’t make it a point to really look at them before I started using this. Bottom line, I’m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I use this aha eye cream to help improve the puffiness under my eye.  I have been impressed with the cream so far.  I also use the tips from the company and think that the application tips they provide have also helped with lymph drainage and the puffiness.  thank you toulon.  Will continue to use this under eye cream.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and I can already see a reduction in the dark circles under my eyes. I’ve always had dark circles under my eyes, at least since I was a teenager, and I’ve tried other products but without success. I determined that I would always just have to cover them up with concealer. So imagine my excitement as I was able to see a change in just a couple of weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve barely made a dent in my jar, too, which is nice. The tiniest dab is enough for both eyes so I’m very happy with the size of the jar. It has a slight scent to it, which goes away immediately after applying. I contacted the company (they are really helpful) and they explained that it is just the natural scent of the natural ingredients. No harmful perfumes or additives are used. Another plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product feels very rich and just the tiniest amount is more than enough to cover my under-eye area. I also love the way their new packaging looks, very classy on my bathroom shelf. Thanks TOULON!</li>
            <li> People had been telling me that I look tired and when I looked at pictures or saw myself in the mirror I began to see that I was beginning to have puffy, bags under my eyes. Since using this product everyday 2x a day the undereye bags have cleared up significantly. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with puffiness or bags under their eye. I think that it is important to use the eye cream everyday. During the day it has been fine to apply my make up over the cream and in the evening I have been more liberal with the product.  Try this product, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Working full time and being a mom of small children can be very tiring.  I began to see that I was having issues with under eye dryness and puffiness. I decided to try Toulon&#x27;s eye cream since I love their vit c and glycolic moisturizer and my eyes are looking so much better.  I look less tired and the puffiness under my eye is almost non existant.  Eye Renewal Therapy has been great for me and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream that has really helped my wrinkles.  I have known that glycolic acid and other aha really help to plump fine lines so I started to use the eye cream at night and put it on in the mornings as well.  It is really helping me and I think that the fine lines around my eyes are looking better.  Others have pointed out the difference as well.  It didn&#x27;t happen immediately but it is making a difference.  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I’m a night owl, so I get a lot of &amp;#34;late night...?&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;whoa, what happened to you?&amp;#34; comments. This stuff does the trick for me! Late night, no sleep, no problem! As long as I have this stuff I seem to be fooling everyone! I use it mostly at night, sometimes in the morning too. I have to say I look pretty good after being hungover and not much sleep! I am buying a second jar to be stocked up when my current one runs out, just in case! Do yourself a favor and buy this now!!</li>
            <li> Oh wow another hit from Toulon. This eye cream is dermatologist or spa worthy. It glides on. I get glycolic acid peels. My skin  peels like it should after. Well this time I had a stubborn dry spot under my eye. The next morning after using this product the dry spot was smooth as a babies behind. Amazing!!! I use the vitamin c serum the glycolic acid cream and now this all from Toulon. My skin glows!!! I have a stubborn fine line under my eye after 4 days yes four days it is going away!! I can&#x27;t believe it. I can use these products twice a day but if your skin is sensitive I suggest once a day. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 30 days. I know that fine line I can&#x27;t stand will be gone!! Since using these products I have not needed botox or my retina cream. These work better!! I am so excited that I ran across these products that I will use for life. My acne is gone now my fine lines around my eyes are ironing out too. Also my bb cream glides on. My eyeliner went on so smoothly. I can&#x27;t live without these 3 life changing products. Also the customer service is outstanding!!! I have never had a company care so much about what I think about the product. No department store product works like Toulon. Nothing I ever got from the spa works as well. My retina is out of date because I am using these with better results. Also no department store will care about you the way Toulon does. I know because I worked for a major department store brand!!! I thank you Toulon. I love this eye cream. I highly recommend all of these products. When used together Wow factor!!I can&#x27;t for Toulon to make something else...a scar cream. I will be waiting patiently.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is very creamy and smooth. I often have issues with eye creams making bumps under my eyes, but that is not happening so I sm thrilled!</li>
            <li> Worked visibly after 2 uses for me. Subtle but effective</li>
            <li> Better then expected....great purchase great product.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I already notice a considerable difference in the skin under my eyes after just one week of use. I am very pleased with the results thus far. I also use it on my forehead and around my mouth. It&#x27;s a tiny jar, but you only need a very tiny amount. I will keep purchasing this as needed. Thanks, Toulôn!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a eye cream that would help remove the puffiness from under my eyes and I only have been using this eye cream for a week and I&#x27;m excited because it has helped already and the more I use it I feel my puffiness might disappear completely. I use this eye cream all twice a day and I am certainly happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Eye cream is fantastic!!  It has been helping me.  Toulon products do not disappoint.  Fragrance free and organic.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream for puffiness.  Will defintely keep using this eye cream for under eye.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product. Absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin around eyes like most creams. I can see a difference. Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This eye cream goes on  so smooth and  gives an immediate cooling effect to the eye area. My dark circles and puffiness have begun to fade.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about a week now and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love my new eye cream!  Have noticed changes after a couple of weeks would recommend to family and friends and will reorder when I run out.could be awhile because a little goes a long way.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My friend recently recommended Toulon skin products.  I have tried the face moisturizer (which I love) and now this product.  I have dark circles under my eyes and, over the years, have tried many products to correct this.  I do have sensitive skin and this product is gentle, natural and organic.  After using the it for three weeks, I have notice a change in my dark circles, plus the puffiness has gone down.  I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;ve added this to my moisture routine!</li>
            <li> Feels very good on the eyes and I believe the dark circles are going away.  I will buy it again</li>
            <li> This a the best eye cream.  It does just as it says it does.  I have been very happy with it and will continue to use it.  I can already see a difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Works ok, not the best but its good.</li>
            <li> I immediately see an improvement after just two days. I will be purchasing again and can&#x27;t wait to try other Toulon products</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly. Packaged well. I love the feel of the cream and it has not burned my eyes. It only takes a little for each eye. It appears to be helping already with puffiness.</li>
            <li> This product not only leaves your skin soft and smooth but helps diminish dark circles and eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is great.  Is absorbed well, not greasy or leftover residue.  Even in just 5-7 days, less appearance of dark circles!</li>
            <li> Some of the darker circles faded. But puffyneas still there.</li>
            <li> Have only recently started using the eye cream.  I have used the other TOULON products and thought I would try the eye cream to deal with dark cirles.  Have been very happy with it and already seeing a difference.  TOULON is skincare that works!</li>
            <li> I bought the full line of skin care (the Vitamin C Serum, the eye cream, and the face cream).  I use all three items morning and night.  I already exfoliate my skin every weekend with a microdermabrasion machine, so I don&#x27;t see a huge difference, but what I do notice is that this line of products leaves my skin feeling exfoliated each and every single day.  My skin feels smooth and fresh and looks amazing.  I LOVE the entire line and will definitely be ordering this from now on.  This company might as well consider me a life-long customer now!</li>
            <li> This eye cream feels really nice when you put it on. It absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t feel like my face is sticking to my pillow when I go to bed right after applying it.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is non irritating, soothing and absorbs into my skin nicely.  I love the beneficial ingredients and look forward to making this a staple in my evening skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eye cream.  I tried it because i had used Toulon&#x27;s vit c serum and moisturizer and both were amazing.  So I decided to try the eye cream.  I have struggled with under eye dark circle and puffiness for decades. I haev looked and tried so many different product vit K . no vit k - drug store, department store...only on tv...everything...nothing has really helped....now I have been using this product for a little over a month routinely and I am really seeing my under eye change in color and in puffiness.  This makes my entire face look so much better and healthy.  I was tired of looking tired and sickly.  Thank you for this incredible eye treatment&lt;br /&gt;I really find the cream soothing under my eye. As of now the puffiness is gone and the dark circles have gotten so much lighter.  As I said I look and feel like a new person.  Will continur to use this product and share it with others.</li>
            <li> Fabulous cream!!  Over the course of a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference...I&#x27;ve battled puffiness under my eyes for years...no amount of anything helped until now.  All around my eye area now looks so much brighter, younger and healthier.  No more tired eyes. I love, love, love this cream!</li>
            <li> This works very well but doesn&#x27;t seem to have an effect on my dark circles.  It&#x27;s effective for reducing puffiness</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is great. It is not too heavy but not watery. It feels amazing and I actually use it all over my face. It immediately gives me a glow. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this, i was a little shock of how small it was, but a little goes a long way, i noticed my dark circles getting lighter, so far so good!!</li>
            <li> After using this product for approximately one week, I feel that it is helping me keep my skin clear around my eyes.  I continue to believe in the high-quality products offered by Toulon.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I originally bought it for my mom to try but I also tested it out as well. Immediately after putting it on within a few hours the lines I usually have under my eyes from lack of sleep disappeared. I actually looked my age (22) which made me extremely happy! My mom (50) tried it and it brightened her skin around the eyes and smoothed out the fine lines. For being such a tiny jar, I first thought it was sort of a rip off. That was until we used it. Just a super tiny dab turns out to go a very long way. I thought about buying another jar for my grandmother to use. She&#x27;s been using Olay Regenerist but this seems to work better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great new product from this company.  Looking forward to seeing the effects over a longer time span.  So far it looks great and my makeup aroiund my eyes last longer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I bought all three products. the eye cream, the face moisturizer and the Vitamim c serum. It feels wonderful. And it doesnt irritate my skin around the eyes like everything else has.  My 66 years old skin after only 2 days looks better, more refreshed and feels tighter.  I love, love love it.!!!!</li>
            <li> I only use it for about a week,  nothing happens yet...if anything changes,  I will write another review.</li>
            <li> Great cream. Only have to use a tiny bit to get coverage</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 1 week.  It is light on my skin and gentle to my eye area.  Not irritating like other products I have used.  I do see results already.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for over a month now and I have noticed a difference. My dark circles are fading and my skin is not so dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Toulon eye cream for a week.I like that I don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it goes into the skin.My skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> This is a nice for a moisturizer but you can find that much cheaper in other products. I was hoping it would make a difference in wrinkles &amp; crows feet but there is no difference what so ever after 2 weeks.  Update: The cream is gone, my wrinkles and crows feet are not! Very dissappointed, don&#x27;t waste your $$$$$</li>
            <li> I have horrible horrible bags under my eyes, that often become dark and puffier with stress and lack of sleep. I&#x27;ve never had much luck when it came to eye creams as far as helping minimize the puffiness, but I was pleasantly surprised when I started seeing results after about 5 days. My once puffy dark eyes have now lightened, the puffiness has decreased, my lines are diminishing and my under eye looks smoother. I didn&#x27;t expect to see results so quickly when so many products failed to help anything. This is a great product I don&#x27;t think I could say enough good things about this eye cream, but I absolutely love it. The texture is very similar to lotion, the smell reminds of some of the lotions with light fragrances. It absorbs very quickly, it doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling after, and it gives a slight cooling sensation. I still can&#x27;t believe the results I&#x27;ve already seen, I&#x27;m so happy that I finally find a product that actually does what it claims. I recommend this for anyone who suffers from dark circles and/ or puffiness. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Product works nicely.  Goes on well &amp; (forme) does not get too greasy/shiny later.  No irritations noted.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this eye cream  really helped with my dark circles and it hydrated my eyes significantly.  love this stuff</li>
            <li> A great product.  Leaves you eyes felling cool and relaxed.  I love applying it before bed after a long day</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream. I don&#x27;t normally use eye creams but I do have puffiness so I thought maybe this would help. I have not been using it long enough to know long term effects but it does seem to help and it does not irritate my skin so I am very pleased with it. Natural ingredients + good price + better skin &#x3D; happy customer!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye cream for a week and I definitely like it! It may be too soon to see long term results but it seems to work well for fine lines. I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are less noticeable and my eyes look more awake. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this eye cream!! The puffiness under my eyes has already reduced and the dark circles have lessened. What a difference! I&#x27;ve incorporated this into my daily routine and I am so pleased with the results already! It gives my eyes a more vibrant appearance. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> This product is good and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream.  Seems to have reduced dark circles and puffiness very well.</li>
            <li> Just started using it.  Very good so far</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference with this cream. None at all.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating, not sure if I have noticed any results in the dark circles under my eyes, though. Even if it doesn&#x27;t correct my hereditary dark circles, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s keeping my eyes from getting any worse.</li>
            <li> Have just begun using this product, along with the moisturizer at night.  Have been looking for a cream that would keep me moisturized all night long and this product seems to do the job.  Would recommend as a product for all, but especially to the ladies who may be looking for a little smoother, creamier and long lasting product.</li>
            <li> Simply a fantastic product.  I really like the texture of this eye cream and the fact that it is fragrance free.  I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long but it is already evident that it is better than what I was using before.  I work hard and always try to look my best so I love that this eye renewal therapy really helps me look less tired.  Really appreciate a great product.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed the other Toulon products so I bought one of the eye creams as soon as it was available for my wife and I to try.  Another great product.  It is loaded with great ingredients and makes the delicate skin around my eyes feel great. I think that I already see a difference and am very happy with the eye cream.</li>
            <li> It might be because mydark circles are part genetic but it hasn&#x27;t helped. Going to keep trying for a little longer to see if it changes by then but if not will be asking for the company to refund me my money due to their guarentee. This lotion does work well with moisturizing also. Does say you can use as a general moisturizer if you would like.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. When I ordered it, I was a little skeptical if it would really work but it has exceeded my expectations. I have severe allergies and pretty bad dark circles under my eyes. This product has not totally eliminated them but it has brightened my eyes and the puffiness is noticeably improved. Per the product recommendation, I decided to try it on my forehead as well and I have been extremely impressed with the improvement of the lines in my forehead. The best compliment I can give this company is there superior customer service. As soon as I purchased the product I received an email from the company with very detailed instructions on the product as well as contact information if I needed further assistance with the product or my order. The day before my order arrived I received a second email from the company to follow up on my purchase and make sure it arrived in a timely manner. My email also included a coupon code to try out other products in their beauty line. The customer service was extremely impressive and I will be ordering from them again. Thank you for the promotional deal and letting me review this product.  I have been very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Working well so far!!</li>
            <li> Used it for a week and notice that the wrinkles under my eyes were getting worst -  my under eye looked more dehydrated - only thing I liked about it was the velvet soft feel.</li>
            <li> An amazing eye cream that delivers all it promises.all the puffiness and dark circles are gone.my skin looks much healthier and younger</li>
            <li> This is by far the best skin care line I have ever bought! I have tried and used many skin care products over the years, and this brand gets the number one spot. I highly recommend you give all their products a try.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Feels so soft on my skin and has a light, refreshing fragrance! I love the way it makes my skin feel. I purchased it through special deal, but would happily spend top dollar on it.</li>
            <li> until now 4 days and no changing under my eye</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical buying such an inexpensive product expecting fabulous results but with a price tag this good I thought what the heck. All I can saw is wow!! I have been using philosophy products for years from sephora ranging upwards at 99 a bottle and this product is 10x better hands done. I suffer from crows feet (being blonde with a light complexion just draws out my flaws too) but I can promise after only a week using a small amount of this product I can seem a dramatic difference. I&#x27;m hooked and will never over pay again this is my new favorite product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this creme a short time, but already I feel reduced puffiness and that tired feeling my eyes get at the end of the day is diminishing. Excellent product and excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> I have been using for a week now and really like the moisture that last all day. I have also noticed the bags under my eyes from allergies is reduced. I also noticed a coolness when applying that is soothing.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream and it seems to do well.  I still have dark circles and some puffiness, but I am a full time graduate student and mother so sleep is not something that I get a lot of! All in all the product has brightened my eyes; however, it has not reversed the time line under my eyes as hoped.  I will keep using though because it may improve with time!</li>
            <li> GREAT product! great texture and feel!</li>

            <li> Goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Seems to be making a small difference, after only a week.  You only need a small amount, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> I am rating this cream 3 stars, but only because I like the light scent and it works well as an over all moisturizer. I honestly can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic change in the dark circles or bags under my eyes. :(</li>
            <li> I bough this cream for my girlfriend, and she absolutely loves it, it does everything it claims and more. I have noticed the change in her eyes since she started using it about three weeks ago. The puffiness is gone and so are those tiny wrinkles under her eyes. I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now. An ok eye cream, but did not improve at all the appearance of dark circles or help reduce puffiness.</li>
            <li> Love that I can finally use an eye cream with glycolic. Been using glycolic for 40 yrs and my 65 year old skin looks like 40yr old skin, but always had to avoid eye area. This cream is light and hydrating and smooths my lines. I&#x27;ll see how it is in 6 wks. My only complaint is when I opened the jar it was only about half full.</li>
            <li> I love my purchase. It arrived before it was expected nicely packed. I tried it and it is great! I highly recommend it to all ladies out there !I It leaves your skin fresh and healthy. Thank you! Great seller!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Using this cream helps with my dry skin in this eye area. Texture of this cream is smooth and light, yet its effect is substantial...I felt the difference in only a few days!</li>
            <li> So glad I tried the eye cream too when I purchased the face moisturizer.  The eye cream works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week and see no difference.  It does not reduce puffiness at all.  Three stars because it does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with a coupon as part of a promotional opportunity, and boy, am I glad I did!  As a mother of two toddlers 15 months apart, I have noticed increasing dark circles and puffiness (from lack of sleep) under my eyes for the past year.  I never thought I would have dark circles at 28!  I was using moisturizer religiously and dabbing concealer to hide the dark circles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toulon Eye Renewal Therapy is for dark circles, puffiness, and wrinkles.  It can be used as an exclusive eye cream, or it can be applied to the entire face for wrinkle therapy.  Since I do not have issues with wrinkles yet, I decided to use it exclusively as an eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just 5 days of using this product twice a day as directed, I am no longer having to dab extra concealer under my eyes!  I can see a huge difference in the skin coloration around my eyes as well as reduction in puffiness that I was carrying under my lower eyelid.  I have also noticed that the skin on my upper eyelid seems brighter when I am applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing the product, I received an E-Mail from the company outlining all of the directions to ensure that I would use the product properly.  The packaging is very pretty and everything is clearly labelled with concise directions.  Do not be discouraged by the size of the container.  Although it is only 15 mL, it really only takes a dab on each eye to get complete coverage!  I was never a believer in using eye creams, but this is definitely a product worth having in your beauty arsenal!</li>
            <li> The product and company are excellent.</li>
            <li> No significant changes as of using it for less than a week, will post again after 2 weeks, 1 month, etc.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying any type of eye cream.  I have used a retinol cream and glycolic acid peels for years with great success.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes but I do have puffiness and fine lines.  I am thoroughly surprised at the difference this cream has made in reducing my fine lines and my puffiness.  I actually look less tired!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions recommend putting it on your forehead and cheeks as well as your under your eyes.  I have been putting it on my very deep laugh lines instead. I am genuinely amazed at how much better they look! Everyday I use the cream the lines appear less and less.  The cream is gentle enough to use in the morning and at night.  So I have been using it twice a day for only two weeks.  It&#x27;s made such a difference that my husband is now using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product!  I will be purchasing again and other products from Toulon.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li> This eye cream is not too greasy and very smooth so makeup goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> This formula has one of my favorite ingredients in it for moisture and vibrance...rosehip oil!  I love this stuff.  This all organic formula comes in a small container but you only need a little bit for your eyes and around your forehead.  There is really no scent to this which makes it even more natural and appealing to wear daily.  I use this day and night and I can say that my puffiness from lack of sleep is reduced.  The free e-book that comes with it is very informative and useful with great information on how your skin works and how to take care of it. Once applied, you have a velvety soft feel to your skin. Upon receiving this through a promotion, I recommend this low price cream to add to your beauty regime daily as the ingredients are organic and natural and it works when used often.</li>
            <li> This eye cream feels so good.  It is luscious and creamy. A little bit really does go a long way. A tiny amount can easily do both my eyes and I like to put some on my forehead as well to prevent deep lines there. The delicate skin around my eyes is really moisturizers with the cream. I am seeing less under eye dark circles (have been an on going problem) and even my crows feet are also less pronounced.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet, but I have tried so many different kinds of skin care to prevent deep wrinkles from forming. This eye cream is better than those expensive little jars I have gotten at Bloomingdales ... they are so costly and this affordable eye cream gets better results.  Don&#x27;t get sucked in to thinking that just because you pay a lot you are getting better quality.  I love this organic eye cream...it works for my crows feet and the dark circles under my eye.  There is no way I would stop using this product now that I have found it.  I really love all of this company&#x27;s products.  Class Act.</li>
            <li> wow what a difference. I love the way the dark circles faded</li>
            <li> Been using this product for less than a week. Great moisture and great for sensitive skin. Excited to keep using it.</li>
            <li> At my age I have to layer products.  Pilling can be an issue.  Waiting between products for drying is important prior to applying concealer.  This does not pill if allowed to dry.  Loving it so far.</li>
            <li> overall I have a nice complexion but under my eyes are always puffy and dark due to allergies. I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice per day am am very impressed. I&#x27;ve already notice a huge improvement. The puffiness is down I&#x27;d say by 80% and the dark circles are finally leaving. I only wear make up on Sundays and noticed I needed next to no concealer. I&#x27;m very confident that I will continue to see improvement. I am so glad to have found this product. And the price!!! I&#x27;ve tried top dollar creams that didn&#x27;t work out. I will be checking out the rest of the skin care line.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and is unscented which is a plus for those with allergies.  It can be used as a night cream or under makeup.  So far an excellent &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> excellent product! Excited about the results! Easy to use; works well with face Toulon moisturizer.  I completely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Really seems to help eye puffiness!  Very happy consumer.</li>
            <li> I have been amazed at how this product is helping with my eye problems of puffiness/dark circles and fine lines.  First, I like how the product feels on my skin, especially when I dab it on after a shower.  It is smooth, gentle and silky which helps it go on easily as I do not rub my eye area.  The cream was absorbed quickly and did not leave any residue behind.  I have noticed that my puffiness/dark circles and fine lines have become less and less each day since I have only tried this product for a week now.  I have hardly used much of the container so I can see it will be lasting me for a very long time.  I am eagerly looking forward to continue to use this product to treat my puffiness/dark circles and fine lines.  People that see me daily have now asked me if I am sleeping better since I look alert and my eyes hardly have any darkening around them.  I let them know about this cream I am using  since they noticed the difference without me mentioning anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my product in return for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The cream is very light and does not irritate my eyes at all and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Highly suspiscious when the stars are coming from reviewers that have only made reviews about Toulon&#x27;s line....</li>
            <li> Made bags worse!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It reduced dark circles and puffines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like my new Toulon eye cream. I sure need something! I have both puffiness &amp; dark circles under my eyes. I really don&#x27;t expect anything to get rid of them but this cream really brightens up the area.  My skin doesn&#x27;t look as dry &amp; pulled under my eye. The cream goes on smoothly &amp; soaks in. Since I don&#x27;t wear concealers-they make the circles look worse-I can just apply my cream &amp; go about my day with soft looking eyes. I did receive this cream at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Try it! Thank You!</li>
            <li> work wonders i very impressed</li>
            <li> very very moderate quality.....very little hydration. would not purchase agian</li>
            <li> I received my order on time. I stayed long before writing anything on the product because I wanted to try it for a week or two. I can honestly say the product works great!!!! On my 2 to 3 day I saw improvement but refuse to write until now. My dark circles have cleared up so nicely. It really and truly worth a try.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream, it is not greasy, but feels creamy when applying and the puffiness under my eyes has diminished slightly.  Will continue to use and hopefully the puffiness under my eyes will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this eye cream..Just ordered another one!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  A little jar of rich, luxurious eye cream.  I am consistently surprised when I accidentally touch my eyes during the day and feel just how soft and moist my eyes feel.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, goes on easy. I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Alright, so I&#x27;m going to post before and after photos to see if this actually works, i&#x27;ll add edit marks and dates of course. Let&#x27;s see how this goes!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference yet. It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks if I&#x27;m not mistaken. And it feel like watery at times. It doesn&#x27;t have that creamy texture, usually this products have</li>
            <li> light &amp; nourishing. Still looking for something that lightens dark circles.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I will continue using.</li>
            <li> As I enter into the 2nd half of my life, over 40, and am beginning to experience wrinkles and changes in my skin tone on my face, I jumped at the chance to review this product for a reduced price.  I love the clean smell and the creamy, smooth, application of the eye renewal therapy.  I have been able to apply make-up directly after applying this product and haven&#x27;t felt like I&#x27;ve got too much on.  I have begun to witness results after only 4 days of regular application.</li>
            <li> What a product! I&#x27;ve been struggling with dark circles for a few years since I have trouble sleeping at night. It&#x27;s only been a few days and I can already see the circles becoming lighter and there is no puffiness in my eyes. Amazing product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I feel I see a difference the longer I use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about a week now and I do notice a change. I really like Toulon products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have the biggest dark eye problem per se, but I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and need an overall pick-me-up in the eye area. First, this cream smells delicious! You normally don&#x27;t think of your eye cream as having a scent, but it&#x27;s very gentle and does not bother the eye area at all. it just adds a nice touch. The application is simple. As with other creams for that area, you just dot it on very carefully with your weakest finger. I let it &amp;#34;marinate&amp;#34; like that for a minute or two while I load my toothbrush, then I gently spread it out. You want to wait until it&#x27;s completely dry before applying make up so you don&#x27;t get that caked effect. It absorbs, your eyes are bright and you&#x27;re on your way! I was happy to get this as part of a promotion but I&#x27;ll continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream I really have ever tried.  I had noticed fine lines around my eyes (I&#x27;m 38) and I wanted to use an eye cream to see if it would help.  So far I love the product and I&#x27;m still testing it out and will update back when I have used it for 30 days.  The puffiness under my eyes has decreased and some of my fine lines are starting to not be so noticeable.  The eye cream itself is very thick and just a little bit of the cream goes along way (this tiny jar is going to last me a very long time).  The cream is not strong smelling at all.  This is a huge factor for me.  And anyone else that doesn&#x27;t want to put something on their face that is strong smelling, this cream is the way to go.  I also put the cream on my cheek bones and around my forehead as well.  I did purchase this product during a promotion.  And I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what the results are after using for a month!</li>
            <li> Taking care of the skin around my eye has always been important to me since I know it makes a big difference in overall appearance.  I have always used fancy eye creams but I am so excited that I found this eye cream which is reasonably prices.  It is organic and cruelty free which is important to me.  AND IT IS EFFECTIVE.  I have been getting compliments on how great my skin is looking.  My eyes just pop and I have a glow about me.  I use the cream to help lessen wrinkles around the eye as I get older but also to prevent dark circles.  I am really ahppy with this choice for an eye treatment.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye cream!!! Other creams I&#x27;ve used have caused my skin to either get hot or sting but this stuff is amazing! It&#x27;s so light and feels really great... I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is a great under eye cream.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long and others have already noticed that the puffiness under my eye is getting less.  It makes my entire face look better, more youthful and vibrant.  I have a brighter look and am happy with the product.  It comes in a small jar but I use very little each time I put it on.  I have recommended this product to friends whether they have issues with crows feet, puffiness or even dark circles.  I think it will help them too.</li>
            <li> I love toulon eye gel. I use this in conjunction with my other Toulon products and have been thrilled with the results. The eye treatment cream is all organic and natural.  I think that this is very important.  The cream is soothing and cool and creamy when applied under my eye.  I try to put it on both morning and night. It has made a huge difference with my puffiness under the eye in the morning and my stubborn dark circles are looking way better,  My eyes look brighter and I look less tired.  I highly recommend this anti aging cream for eyes. It has really helped me..</li>
            <li> The cream is good I really don&#x27;t have dark circles or much puffiness so I can&#x27;t see if the cream addresses that.  I like it just fine!</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars for a good lying Job.  I did not get my money back. In fact the company even called me , Said I should get more sleep, are you kidding me. It&#x27;s a waste of money did not do a thing for dark circles . If you read the reviews the ones saying they love it are mostly the ones who got it for free...........</li>
            <li> Have you ever seen a run down raccoon who&#x27;s been up for days without sleep? Well go ahead bad picture that and then you&#x27;ll have an idea of how dark the circles under my eyes are. I&#x27;ve tried countless eye creams and honestly most don&#x27;t do anything at all. Since I&#x27;ve had success with Toulons moisturizer, I decided to try their eye cream a go. While my circles have not gone away completely, I no longer look like that raccoon that I described earlier! This is such a huge improvement for me! The jar is kind of small but only a couple of dabs a day does the trick. Very pleasant scent. Absorbs quickly. My new best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted for evaluation</li>
            <li> This cream helps reduce puffiness and dark circles. I use it morning and evening as a part of my facial care routine. Very luxurious feel and does not leave a greasy film. A bit pricy but a little goes a long way. My eyes definitely seem less puffy and baggy. A really nice product!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks and really give the product a chance to provide results...there&#x27;s been zero reduction in fine lines and dark under eye circles. I wasn&#x27;t hoping for a miracle, but had hoped for some change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for one week. Have not seen any improvement for in my puffiness yet. Will continue to use and see if there&#x27;s any improvement. I like the consistency of the cream a lot. It&#x27;s not too runny or thick like some of the other cream I used. Will definitely be the cream I go for if it helps to improve the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have just received this product so have not used it for a long period of time.  From what I can see , it does what it says!!&lt;br /&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li> I must say, this stuff works. I bought Clinique men&#x27;s  eye cream and for 1/2 the price this product beats it hands down. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream because it came up on my &#x27;recommended for you&#x27; feed and had great reviews at a great price. With a 60 day money back guarantee advertised, how could I lose? I lost. First thing I noticed when I got the package is it is not NSF certified or USDA Organic Certified ingredients. The ingredient list has some organic items, but again not certified ANYWHERE on the package or container. I opened the eye cream and tested on the back of my hand for about 8 hours. It had a slightly off smell, and I didn&#x27;t notice any moisturizing effect. Decided what the hell try it under your eyes before bed. I put it on with the Toulon face moisturizer (which I had tested on my inner arm). I lasted about 10 minutes before I had to wash my face again because the small was so atrocious. Not a bad combo of ingredients, but spoiled ingredients like rotten food. This is going back to amazon immediately for a full refund. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> feels great going on, but disappointing results. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> Loved this fragrance free eye cream.  It feels great and it is really making a difference with the skin around my eyes. My crow&#x27;s feet are already looking better.  I am happy to have this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is an incredible eye cream and has made a huge difference in the way the skin around my eyes look.  The vitamin c in the product is protected since light is deflected and not able to penetrate through the pot container.  Thank you TOULON for another can&#x27;t live without product!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I bought a jar of this eye cream at an event in New York City about a week ago. I was invited because I purchased some of their other products in the past. So far, I&#x27;ve used it every morning since and I have to say the results are astonishingly noticeable. The dark circles under my eyes are barely visible anymore, and better yet, coworkers have been asking me why I look so different. But I feel I should mention that at the event, they demonstrated how to apply an eye creme correctly. I had no idea there was a correct way. I usually just smeared it all around my eyes, but the company rep explained how to properly DAB it around my eyes with my ring finger. They even had a handout with illustrations. Great product, great company. I have been very pleased with every products and I can’t wait to see what they come out with next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week and there has been a noticeable improvement with the dark circles under my eyes. Great product, great customer service!</li>
            <li> I noticed less darkness under my eyes after 3 week</li>
            <li> Love it...I&#x27;ve tried many different eye creams and this one I saw results right away</li>
            <li> Has not worked as I thought it would. Not very happy!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been applying this eye cream for about 3 weeks and have not seen ANY bit of difference in my under eyes. So disappointed, I honestly tough it would work great because of the many good reviews.</li>
            <li> So far, I have waited more than enough time to see results, however, I am not quite convince.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it, and will update for further results ....</li>
            <li> I like this light, refreshing, non-greasy eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I feel like in just a couple days my wrinkles are less visible and the dark circles under my eyes are almost gone! I&#x27;m 31, and I thought I was too young to have to worry about this stuff until I looked in the mirror one day and felt so old. I tried La Mer first and loved the cream&#x27;s texture and reputation but didn&#x27;t see results. I also use a under eye concealer. The combo is great.</li>
            <li> As I age, the skin around my eye area become dry. Lucky, I have no dark eye circle or fine line yet. My skin is dry, but I don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling when using a eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this eye cream. It is thick and creaming, a little goes a long way, and it absorbs quick. It moisture my skin, without the greasy feeling. Fragrance-Free make the product even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After using this product for two weeks- I can say that not only am I noticing results, but I love this product. Toulon&#x27;s formula feels like butter (texture like a luxurious body butter). The creme is so thick and soft, instantly hydrating my skin to appear as if I have had a full night sleep. The long-term effectiveness of this product are still to be determined, but I&#x27;m looking forward to finding out more if the immediate effects are so visible.  I use this product at morning and night on my freshly washed skin and apply basically from my under-eyes up to my forehead. I recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a thick creamy eye product. I even use my moisturizer over this creme and there is no flaky product build up. Full disclosure: I bought this product on discount with a coupon, but I believe the full-price is worth it!</li>
            <li> Purchased the product and it came half empty...already a bad sign  -___-</li>
            <li> This eye cream caused a severe bacterial infection in both my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for several weeks.  I must say so far, so good.  I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman who is routinely asked what products do I use on my skin.  Toulon Eye Renewal Therapy has helped with reducing the appearance of dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one searching for that perfect miracle eye cream,  I&#x27;ve used them all, I use medical grade skin care,  this cream is the same thing, not greasy, absorbs perfectly, I&#x27;ve been using day and night over my retinol eye serum, lightly scented kinda like lavender, calming,  the scent fades, most burn my eyes, not this one. So far great,  and way better than any pricey eye cream,  big names spend money on advertising verses product, this one is very much like a high priced brand eye cream  I absolutely will order again when I&#x27;m about half empty.  Dr says peptides, and retinol help anti aging.</li>
            <li> A really nice product. For almost 2 months now I’ve been using it morning and night, and it did improve the looks around my eyes. I am not saying it was a miraculous change, as my age and health have taken their toll, but it did reduce a lot of the puffiness, and also lightened my dark circles. I also like all the natural ingredients... none of the chemicals or perfumes like in some others I tried. I also should mention that a TOULON representative reaches out and follows up with me every now and then to see how it’s going and answer my questions, and give me free skin care tips. Thanks so much to everyone at TOULON.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first year of my 30s... Yeah yeah.  So, my girlfriend finally called me out on my developing crow’s feet, I figured I should probably do more to take care of my skin. I tried this stuff on the advice of a coworker.  Kinda skeptical &#x27;cause it&#x27;s inexpensive. I’m actually impressed: I’ve only been using it for a short time, and my wrinkles already look a good bit smoother. No dark circles either. I’ll be interested to see how it works over time!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely great eye cream for dark circles and puffiness under the eye.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream and I would highly recommend buying it.  It is so moisturizing that I not only use it around my eyes but on other areas of my face that are showing signs of aging. It makes my skin look smooth and is helping to reduce the puffiness under my eyes. And it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I noticed a difference within days.</li>
            <li> Great cream! Most eye creams irritate my eyes, and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference. I noticed within the first few weeks my eyes were less puffy in the morn, and it has helped the Italian curse of dark circles. The cream is also nice and silky which feels really nice on tired eyes! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Been only using it for a few days, but I already feel a see a difference. The skin under my eyes is softer and less puffy. Excited to see results after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This product does help to tighten up my eyelids by smoothing out the creases and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love it. works well, can feel it working soon after applying it. Have only used it 3 times so far, but noticed a difference in skin texture under my eyes already. Less wrinkles, more fullness.</li>
            <li> Love it! Noticed smooth skin almost immediately...no more fine lines (bye bye crows feet).  Received many compliments.  The only downside is it REALLY stings when it got in my eyes when I was in a rush.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product !!! I don&#x27;t sleep well AT ALL !!!! (Being 50 doesn&#x27;t help !) and wake up often with dark circles and puffy eyes. Presenting like this makes me look tired, unprofessional and unhealthy. This cream really does work wonders. I use it daily and it helps me look refreshed. Most men don&#x27;t use eye cream but we all should ! I have recommended this to my close group of friends and they are seeing the benefits ! Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I have used many eye creams and I can&#x27;t say enough about Toulon. People have been saying that I look younger and my eyes feel like they have a new lift to them.</li>
            <li> I received the eye renewal therapy with the glycolic acid face moisturizer and the vit c serum.  I am really impressed with all the products.  I have been using the eye cream mostly at night and am very happy with the way my skin is looking.  I can also use it in the day and put my foundation and make up over it.  Thanks Toulon for a great product!</li>
            <li> I like it. The product works well.  It seems to reduce little lines around the eyes.  And I like to use it with their vitamin C product too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it for a week and have used it mornings and evenings since I got it. I do have pretty dark bags and have only noticed a little difference, but not much. It&#x27;s not done any better so far than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, but will continue with it to give it a fair chance. I&#x27;ll repost later if I have positive results. Not the miracle I was hoping for, but maybe that won&#x27;t ever be found.</li>
            <li> works Great ,Love it!!!! 5 stars</li>
            <li> Great product...show results with puffiness. Feels soothing on the face.  Look forward to extended use.</li>
            <li> I inherited under eye dark circles and was looking for a product that could help me look less tired. I highly recommend this product. I also enjoy other Toulon products for my skin for a more youthful glow. I was so happy to see a more targeted product for my problem. Thank you Toulon!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream! It goes on nicely, very soothing and moisturizing. I ordered a second one, this is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; cream from now on.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for me. The dark circles were much better after a week of use. The puffiness was also reduced. I inherited my father&#x27;s eyes puffy dark eyes, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream it is so smooth and cooling.  I can&#x27;t wait to see&lt;br /&gt;my fine lines disappear.  I will keep you posted.  Reviewing for amztrader.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> Ilove this eye cream, tightens up the lines makes me feel a decade younger and all without surgery.I recomend this amazing cream to any one over age 40.the circles are magically gone without using makeup!</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream because of all the good reviews I read. My problem is dark circles and supposedly it helps lightening up the dark circles. I have been using it for the past week on the right eye and haven&#x27;t seen any difference between the right and left eye yet. The instruction asks to avoid eye contact, so you have to be careful not to get close to the eye which means, I can&#x27;t cover all the dark circle area. It did get to my eye once and it did burn the inside of my eye.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other manufacturers&#x27; eye creams and they actually are safe, I just close my eyes and rub it all over, with no fear of getting hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I will be sending it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Sorry to say I&#x27;ve seen no help with puffiness under eyes, will say haven&#x27;t tried AHA pretty application as I just read in information..?? Didn&#x27;t realize it had AHA.... Well  glad I saw that.</li>
            <li> rich and creamy.  I haven&#x27;t seen an immediate results, but still am waiting.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is sooooooo smooth and just glides on effortlessly. I&#x27;ve had this about 2 weeks and it makes me excited to take off my makeup and get ready for bed. I literally keep this on my nightstand and smooth it on before bed and if I wake up during the night. At first, it seemed to make my wrinkles look more pronounced (maybe about 5 days or so), but with continued use I can see the moisture levels around my eyes have risen and I&#x27;m feeling a bit younger. I&#x27;ve tried gel-based creams before, but they seem to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; and develop a weird, uneven surface texture that doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very well. On the other hand, this cream absorbs beautifully. I live in a very dry place- Utah- the second driest state in the country. And after moving here about 2 years ago I&#x27;ve really had to up my moisturizing routine! This feels luxurious and I will order again.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  The instructions tell you to put it ONLY on the bone beneath your eyes.  That doesn&#x27;t affect the puffiness and dark shadows.  Also, have to use a different eye cream on lids.</li>
            <li> Lack of sleep is a huge reason I wanted to try this eye cream out. I am a mother of an infant (still nursing occasionally at night) and a toddler, so the &amp;#34;bags under the eyes&amp;#34; from limited sleep is almost a daily occurrence for me.  The seller contacted me shortly after purchasing this cream making sure any typical questions asked were answered.  I was informed that the product is paraben and papas free and has not been tested on animals.  It is 60% organic and 100% natural.  The moisture in this cream reduces dryness around the eye, which in return reduces swelling.  The aloe Vera helps improve blood circulation, also helping with puffiness and fine lines.  Although it is labeled as an eye cream, it can be used on the entire face.  I have tried this and it instantly makes my face look smooth and youthful. The cream is a nice consistency (not too thick and not too thin) and has a light natural fragrance.  As with many creams, a little goes a long way with this one.  You only need to dab a small amount around the eyes.  It absorbs within a few minutes.  It can be used morning and night and wears great under make-up.  I have found that after applying my tinted moisturizer or foundation after the cream has absorbed, my make-up looks more fresh.  And on the plus side, I don&#x27;t feel like I need as much make-up under the eyes, since the skin does not appear as dark. This eye cream does make your skin feel incredibly soft and makes you look more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34;.  I definitely will continue using this as long as these ugly bags and fine lines stick around!  I was fortunate to have received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> the cream is light and does not irritate my eyes. I like it.</li>
            <li> Wow! This works so well!! A noticable difference on crows feet and fine lines in a week. Highly recommended!!!! Plus the packaging is so luxe and reasonably priced. :)</li>
            <li> Slowly seeing  results I&#x27;m halfway  on my first jar and can slightly see a difference  will update once i finish  jar</li>
            <li> Loving this eye cream</li>
            <li> I see no significant change after two months of use.</li>
            <li> i only been using it for less than 2 weeks, but I like it because it&#x27;s not greasy and easy to absorb, plus they have great customer service that follow up the purchased.  So far, the dark color under my eyes visibly less.  That&#x27;s all I can say for now, maybe I&#x27;ll update again later after a month</li>
