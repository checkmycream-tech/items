            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m in my twenties after 10 days of use.  </li>
            <li>am satisfied with this product and will for sure buy it again.</li>
            <li>I will have a better idea of how well it works when I&#x27;ve used it for the 60 days that is suggested.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>I will be better able to evaluate it in 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re well pleased.</li>
            <li>I plan to use the whole bottle, but at this point I don&#x27;t see any great results.  </li>

            <li>I love this, it does wonders</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product, It Works MAGIC.</li>

            <li>I hope after a couple of weeks, the reaction will be better, and my skin will look better.</li>
            <li>I have not see a difference, but I wll give it more time&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>But I will try it one more month.</li>
            <li>but so far so good!  </li>
            <li>Feels rich and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Yucky skin and thid is one of my new staples for my current supple, happy skin :D  </li>
            <li>With high quality ingredients and sleek packaging, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>My friend loved it very much.</li>
            <li>I received this anti-aging serum by Nicci Marie at a special price during a promotion the company was having; in exchange, I would test their product and give you my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a really good product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Love this product - using it along with a Vitamin C w/sunscreen - get that more youthful, dewy complexion that hides those fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and contains all the right ingredients to keep me looking young and ageless!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and contains all the right ingredients to keep me looking young and ageless!</li>
            <li>It is worth for the price!!</li>
            <li>I also like that it is an easy to use pump that measures out the appropriate amount to apply to your face.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li>Luckily I got this product to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on much more smoothly and looks more finished.</li>
            <li>I am liking that the lines have lessened as I am single and want to put my best face forward when meeting people.</li>
            <li>The serum has a fresh, clean fragrance that dissipates fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my 50+ skin feel and look healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Ok now were talking about a product I enjoy putting on my face.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, it leaves my face smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with Jan Marini&#x27;s Anti-Oxidant Moisturizer applying the Nicci Marie Hyaluronic Acid Serum first and have been very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>The product came in good time, was very well packaged and after using it for a couple of weeks&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Feels good when applying, drys fast and helps my skin look healthier.</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin, is absorbed quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>So far the product is very nice</li>
            <li>, it goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Great Product , The only thing is I wish it had more  ounces .  </li>
            <li>, it is strong stuff and make my face swell for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very, very reasonable price for this kind of serum.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, it&#x27;s the most important product in my vanity!</li>
            <li>Her makeup also goes on easily over it which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sister&#x27;s have stated that their lines and fine wrinkles were diminished by this product.  </li>
            <li>This may be fine for some, however, it irritated my neck.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and even my husband has commented on the effects it has had on my fine lines.</li>
            <li>That worked fine, but I&#x27;d have to walk around all day with a greasy smear to manage the problem areas on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It suits me just fine.  </li>
            <li>; all works wonders on your skin to improve appearance and restore elasticity, not to mention reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any serum out there that will work on fine lines or the &#x27;11s&#x27; between my brow.</li>
            <li>Quick shipper although the pump mechanism could be better.</li>
            <li>Got my answer thank you very much for the instructions, very easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Easily and quickly absorbed, you can almost feel your skin being nourished!</li>
            <li>I feel like there is a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product - great under lotion, or by itself for younger looking skin!</li>
            <li>So when I saw them in February 2015, my sister&#x27;s looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>but then it makes it smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin feels taut, smooth and lifted - just as described.</li>
            <li>how light and non-oily this product is once it&#x27;s on your face.</li>
            <li>Your skin is so smooth I will be buying this again.  </li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs well  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a great product......</li>
            <li>It is light &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily feeling.</li>
            <li>It does not come out smoothly and ends it where you don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>But I like the way it goes on smooth</li>
            <li>Lightly moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>Great product, I definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my honest opinion that this anti-aging serum by Nicci Marie works very well and has become part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>and i really havent noticed any kind of change in my skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li>2 weeks time will tell but so far so good on this product</li>
            <li>Leaves your face soft and fades the lines fairly well.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>good so far feel the stretch of my face.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell if its working but feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>Very nice product that seems to work, especially for diminishing crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>First off this smells so good, its like a spring spa in a jar, MMMmmmmmm, and its like pure silk when you are rubbing it on your face.</li>
            <li>The serum is translucent, gel-like and absorbs quickly and easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>easy to use and definitely see good result.</li>
            <li>Such great ingredients in a pleasing formulation that absorbs quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of products out there, but this does in fact work and it is not expensive like the other products on the market and it has a wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>So excited to get it</li>
            <li>I gave it a four stars becuase the container did not come in its original box.</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  </li>
            <li>Just a 2-3 small pumps creates a perfect canvas.</li>
            <li>Great product affordable and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I believe it has helped my face tremendously with fine lines in tightening the my skin.  </li>
            <li>I got the cream and was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Just a 2-3 small pumps creates a perfect canvas.</li>
            <li>Outstanding moisturizer cream that really makes a difference on your skin!</li>
            <li>This is the first, of many, products I have purchased that truly does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>This serum is  really lightweight and absorbs in quickly, and you don&#x27;t need a great amount, just a couple of pumps and is more than enough to put on your face neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li>You have gained a loyal customer and a free word of mouth advertiser.</li>
            <li>I am 69 yrs old  and will continue using it expecting to continue to get more and more results.  </li>
            <li>Much more positive experience than with the G-R &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am finding so far that Nicci Marie Skincare is showing results (minimizing wrinkles) as well as or better than Nerium, which is what I was using for a fraction of the cost!  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was exactly as described!!</li>
            <li>People have told me how beautiful I look, but i keep this product a secret most of the time!</li>
            <li>I really like this product, as it seems to contain all the important ingredients in stimulating collagen and in providing other great benefits to assist in a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>I received it just a few days of ordering and it was packaged and sealed very good.  </li>
            <li>i was super excited about this,</li>
            <li>I am amazed at the facial tone, the bright skin color.</li>
            <li>great delivery product as expected</li>
            <li>Feels good on your skin but can&#x27;t see any different to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I will probably buy it again, and the price is reasonable compared to many.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth &amp; fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>and she says good results in the short time.</li>
            <li>Been using for a month or more and haven&#x27;t seen any real results.</li>
            <li>Feels good on my face, I like it, this I don&#x27;t think I look younger.</li>
            <li>I have seen some change, but I believe I need to use it longer to see if it&#x27;s making a true difference.</li>
            <li>And as I continue to use it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has a much smoother, more supple texture.</li>
            <li>Probrbly good for younger skin.</li>
            <li>I did a full product review on my you tube channel.</li>
            <li>And as I continue to use it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has a much smoother, more supple texture.</li>
            <li>For once, what was written was true.  </li>
            <li>This goes on smooth, is absorbed quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Not only my face has been clear of acne but it has been smooth from wrinkles (not that I care about wrinkles) but its also a good benifit :).</li>
            <li>great serum seriously feel it working right away its amazing</li>
            <li>Great product - any other Anti-Aging cream I&#x27;ve purchased seems to flake once I apply foundation.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>and I already see my sun spots fading, came quickly.</li>
            <li>I received my shipment quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this serum - it is more like a gel actually.  </li>
            <li>I was using a hyaluronic acid serum from another seller on Amazon’s website, but in my opinion, this particular brand is much better.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin is more soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Serum arrived quickly in a nice bottle with a smooth acting pump.</li>
            <li>it had a decent price- affordable but not so cheap that you wonder if its any good (although price really doesnt determine effectiveness ; one of my favorite beauty products of all time, select lash, only cost 3 bucks!)</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s not thick and sticky feeling...</li>
            <li>This product is also great for dark spots under the eyes that I like to call my &amp;#34;designer bags&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer with anti-aging properties for daily use!after a peel and most of the time I want to moisturize it, but lotion products burn my skin.</li>
            <li>While the seal was not broken or tempered with, I think it should not have been taking out of its original box as the box may have important information to read as well.</li>
            <li>I have  to apply moisturizer on top to make my face feel normal and move without feeling like it might crack.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly report a noticeable improvement in overall skin condition based on first week trial; I recommend this product without hesitation and can finally stop searching for an effective hyraluronic acid serum with vitamin c!  </li>
            <li>This one was perfect it absorbs well and light and smells good too  , my favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t have an insane department store mark up !</li>
            <li>I love trying out new beauty products.</li>
            <li>it feels great going on although with a slightly astringent feeling (perhaps from the witch hazel ingredient) --</li>
            <li>great serum at much less cost than dept. store brands</li>
            <li>This product is so lightweight and is absorbed quickly and isn&#x27;t at all greasy.</li>
            <li>Great product- does exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>My skin tone is improved but I was really looking for a product to diminish the fine lines.</li>
            <li>really has smoothed out my fine lines</li>
            <li>Great product just started using a few weeks can tell the difference in my skin already  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh smell which comes to me as the aloe in it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Been using this since I received and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion my face feel soft and fresh</li>
            <li>Even after applying a moisturizer on top to seal it in, I can still feel the effects and the tightening action of the product.</li>
            <li>and so far I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive after a peel and most of the time I want to moisturize it, but lotion products burn my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many brands of serums and I find this as good as any of them including the most expensive.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, so far I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>To short usage to say anything about supplementing effects but so far I&#x27;m happy of choosing it.</li>
            <li>This stuff works , it proves you don&#x27;t need to spend 100 bucks on a dept store serum to get results .</li>
            <li>That has made a difference and so far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference with the wrinkles on the of my face when I smile</li>
            <li>and I love how it hydrates my skin and makes it feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Whoever is looking for a great nurturing serum with natural ingredients … look no further.</li>
            <li>although moisturizes and makes skin so soft, I am sure that I will be a thumbs up product.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>it definitely worth the price..</li>
            <li>I feel it was definetley worth the money paid.</li>
            <li>My reviews are based on my own personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>Hands down amazing product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that the fine lines near my eyes and laugh lines have diminished a lot!</li>
            <li>Great product for much less than Botox!</li>
            <li>so much I am not willing to share it lol</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, clear formula, absorbs into skin quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a serum, which I love, because serums tend to have a more concentrated dose of active ingredients than do creams.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone seeking to improve the texture of their skin and reduce appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>In two weeks, the spots have significantly faded and the wrinkles are very reduced.  </li>
            <li>This tells me something is working right.</li>
            <li>Right product for the right price</li>
            <li>I use this product right after my shower, before bed.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a way to help,slow your aging process you are looking in the right place.</li>
            <li>, right?)</li>
            <li>I am still on the first bottle and am pleased with how the serum is working so far.</li>
            <li>This just proves you have to be smart, not rich to have great looking skin.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, absorbs completely, no strong scents.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the product was too strong for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results for at least a month after first using it but, to my great surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the depth of the lines around my mouth and on my cheeks within a week.</li>
            <li>so I moved on to this product getting ready to buy a second bottle I love that my laugh lines have  started to smooth out not gone but smoother like when I was in my 30s</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer with anti-aging properties for daily use!</li>
            <li>I purchase the hyaluronic acid to help keep my face hydrated but my face still looks kind of dry.</li>
            <li>Love it, face is alot more firm.</li>
            <li>i really wanted to love this, but unfortunately so far im just not a fan.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much!</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast service.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is a very gentle moisturizer and did not burn my face post</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is a very gentle moisturizer and did not burn my face post</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a marked decrease in the redness/dryness on my cheeks and it has helped a lot with the appearance of fine lines around my moth and at the corners of my eyes...</li>
            <li>So far, after more than a month using this, I have a noticeable positive difference in my skin texture, much softer and fewer lines.</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash face, dry hands and just a quick towel pat on your face before you spread this on as you Need the moisture for the Hyaluronif acid to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much !</li>
            <li>I have been using it on a daily basis since I received it as part of a promotion, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Do i first use this</li>
            <li>I have noticed some change in my skin, but I cannot tell you exactly what that change is.</li>
            <li>Most definitely.</li>
            <li>I had purchased Peterthomasroth Instant Firm which had the Good Housekeeping Seal of approval and was satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>and this is the first one that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>You would pay MUCH MORE for similar formulations at Murad.  </li>
            <li>My skin definitely feels more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>This serum is the first thing I use after I wash my face/neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and really does its job!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a serum before so this is my first one.</li>
            <li>It was ok but the line of products I usually buy are much better.</li>
            <li>there are definitely better products with the same ingredients with noticeable results.</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely holding moisture better with this under my face cream.</li>
            <li>with Clarisonic, mist with mineral water, lightly pad with soft towel, I use one spritz of serum for my hands, one for my neck and decollete, and one for my face.</li>
            <li>I simple love this product</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more and I have already recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li>I had ordered 2 bottles in the first order,</li>
            <li>it left my skin ok but for me i just didn&#x27;t care for the results.</li>
            <li>My face is much smoother and so radiant!</li>
            <li>skin soft and smooth and helps to reduce wrinkles .</li>
            <li>I love face creams, and I love to weed out the good from the bad.</li>
            <li>This serum is the first thing I use after I wash my face/neck.</li>
            <li>After the first use I could feel my skin tightening.  </li>
            <li>my hubby of 12 yrs came up and says your face looks so pretty..</li>
            <li>I also use a good face cream after the serum has dried.</li>
            <li>Though I am still fairly new to the usage of the serum, I have had no reaction to it, my skin seems to respond to it nicely, and will continue to wait and see with further use!</li>
            <li>The serum barely has a smell, absorbs very quickly and lasts about a month with using it on my hands, neck and decollete, and face (of course).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have seen very noticeable reductions in the fine wrinkles on my 40 year old skin, it also seems to lighten the two age spots I had on my hands.</li>
            <li>Seems to be doing a little good, but nothing really noticeable.</li>
            <li>People have commented that I look &amp;#34;really good&amp;#34;, and after having some serious health problems, this means a great deal to me.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and always feels so clean.</li>
            <li>In two weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen much on my face yet but the effect on the back of my hands has been phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, really reduced pore size and added glow to facial skin.</li>
            <li>Good not sure still using it</li>
            <li>I think it is more effective if you use with some type of procedure such as a derma peel, chemical peels or regular deep exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>The serum is very light, not too thick and spreads on the face easily.  </li>
            <li>I actually like it much better than my normal &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I think this was a good price for this - it seems like it will last me a long time</li>
            <li>There are certainly cheaper brands of this stuff out there but who knows what&#x27;s in the bottle.</li>
            <li>She already has a pure Hyalurnonic Acid product but this peaked my curiosity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We will certainly be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>I am older, 56, so it will take a little more time for changes to show significantly.</li>
            <li>It kind of makes my skin really tight feeling.  </li>
            <li>Have noticed big improvement in texture of skin and decrease in fine lines.</li>
            <li>Now, if I see overall skin improvement with even tone and fewer fine lines....I&#x27;ll be hooked for life.</li>
            <li>It has a very light, fresh scent (I really don&#x27;t like products with heavy smells).</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and have been to the dermatologist many times to try and find a solution without much luck.</li>
            <li>She said that we will have to get more when it gets empty.</li>
            <li>And believe me, I know a whole lot about beauty products...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very humid here</li>
            <li>and my skin is very oily and this product does NOT leave my skin oily</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice too much of a difference</li>
            <li>Does that exist or am expecting too much?</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t much difference at this time</li>
            <li>So much that I also decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it really made any difference</li>
            <li>Maybe I have too much damage already.  </li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for having this item.</li>
            <li>I really like this skincare product.  </li>
            <li>really appreciate that this product is made here in the USA.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect much but feel it is working.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of difference in wrinkles</li>
            <li>Also fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really Like it.</li>
            <li>After it absorbs, which is really fast, my skin feels tighter and refreshed.</li>
            <li>You really will with this stuff</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>fast</li>
            <li>thanks for making it so easy&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell much difference after using it for two or three weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Serum!</li>
            <li>have not had enough time to evaluate if its working, but the pump on the device is cheap and does not work well at all....</li>
            <li>He said well that really works.</li>
            <li>At this time I haven&#x27;t seen much change.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet after using for a month.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and prompt.</li>
            <li>serum really works.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves</li>
            <li>Item received fast and was everything I expecting.</li>
            <li>This product feels silky when applied, and it really improves the look of your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like strivectin</li>
            <li>I wish it came in quart sizes for my whole body.  </li>
            <li>I can really see the difference in 2 days on my face</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I purchased along with the anti-aging face cream and really like the duo.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the time you took to respond to my concerns.</li>
            <li>I see much improvements.  </li>
            <li>Really like this stuff - I use it twice a day</li>
            <li>I really cannot believe the results this product gives you at this price.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and it arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>, I am now seeing a real difference  in my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries quite fast and does not leave any  residues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes on really silky and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  </li>
            <li>I put my moisturizer on after using the serum day and night and it really enhances the absorption on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Is very tacky and drying.</li>
            <li>The product does what it says it will for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>fast shipping though.</li>
            <li>I first was my face, put on the serum, I then put on my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is proving very helpful.</li>
            <li>Like most Hyaluronic Acid serum on the market, this worked as expected.</li>
            <li>(We have very oily skin in our family).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old with most people thinking that I am 15 years younger.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is a pump dispenser, this way I always get just the right amount without waste or contamination.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and glides on like silk and has a soft, subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Not sure only used 1 bottle will try again and maybe will be able to give it more stars.</li>
            <li>I have only been using for two weeks and have seen significant improvement with my crows feer and wrinkles in my forehead.  </li>
            <li>If you want to really know your results, take a photo on the first day and every 7 days later in the exact same light.  </li>
            <li>A single half-pump of the easy pump bottle is all I need to target my undereyes, frown lines and forehead creases.</li>
            <li>Made my Wife&#x27;s skin develop a rash even after following all of the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Nicci Marie gave a full refund.</li>
            <li>It is much better than the lotion I previously used to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month - noticed a slight difference, will give it more time</li>
            <li>Have seen a slight improvement, but needs more time.</li>
            <li>I particularly like that it is made in the US.</li>
            <li>What I like about this particular product is that it has a combination of Vitamin A, Vitamin C,</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this hyaluronic acid is not irritating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum hasn&#x27;t seemed to have much effect on minor wrinkles, however, my skin has responded to the vitamins with improved soft and smooth texture...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never too late to reverse the signs of aging by using a vitamin packed serum your skin will love!</li>
            <li>I am the beauty product junkie and have tried EVERYTHING, from department stores to high end stores...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly refer this to all friends and family.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone wanting to rejuvenate their skin.</li>
            <li>; and I was not even wearing make up.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly reccommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 3 months and can certainly see a difference in my skin...</li>
            <li>My skin has become more smooth and has less wrinkles in just a few weeks, and my discoloration from being in the sun too much has dramatically improved!</li>
            <li>I live in the UK and was amazed at how quickly it was delivered and I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li>no mean that my friends and family were harassing me asking me what I was using on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Expected a 2oz bottle, but arrived as a 1oz bottle, perhaps I missed some small print on quantity, but works great</li>
            <li>I love the tingling sensation that tightens my face, but doesnt feel to harsh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few months, then make a more conclusive review.</li>
            <li>I said previously, I have been really enjoying this serum so far.</li>
            <li>Finally got it right.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;m using right now and need at the moment.  </li>
            <li>It has made a definite improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles in a short time.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii, so</li>
            <li>Just wish I could get a phone number to talk to a live person as some of my questions aren&#x27;t answered online.</li>
            <li>This is a new product to me...</li>
            <li>and that has reduced the smile creases around my mouth where many other products I tried did not give me the desired results that this product has given me in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li>Dont really think it&#x27;s worth the expense, it is almost  a month since I started using it and not much change.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking clear, vibrant and feeling smoother.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I also can tell my skin is very soft too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve spent a significant amount of money on lotions , moisturizers and other related products that haven&#x27;t had very effective or long lasting results.  </li>
            <li>Only a small amount shoots out with each pump, which is better than too much!</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I felt an instant tightening effect.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed that the fine lines around my mouth area have diminished slightly.</li>
            <li>If you have FINE lines you will see a slight improvement in your skin.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I felt an instant tightening effect.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side the company did contact me and tried to help me and had several suggestions, all of which did not help.  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks more &amp;#34;plumped.&amp;#34; So I definitely can see how it makes wrinkles less noticeable when wearing it.</li>
            <li>she said she feels her skin very soft and healthier and it really looks different.</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast via Prime; however, it was shipped in a large envelope with minimal padding.</li>
            <li>I only started using it in February, so I think it needs a little more time to see if it works miracles.  </li>
            <li>I naturally have dark circles under my eyes and very minimal wrinkles both have improved significantly since I started using this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and not at all oilly</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks I just don&#x27;t use it as regularly since I couldn&#x27;t tell much.</li>
            <li>Did not like it as much as I had hoped, not enough moisture for my skin</li>
            <li>But so far..</li>
            <li>Everyone (even health care professionals) are surprised to find out I am in my 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell if this item is doing what it said it would do I took a before and after picture and notice no difference with the product maybe it takes longer on different people who knows anyway</li>
            <li>Do not think it will restore as much as stop further damage.</li>
            <li>I am 61 yrs old, there is nothing out there that will make me look 40, wish there was.  </li>
            <li>I have been using daily and my face is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I am 65 years old</li>
            <li>My friend has not started to use the product yet, as she wants to finish using her current batch.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so far it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>I like that fact that it is odorless, because I am sensitive to perfumey</li>
            <li>A big plus that it is odorless and absorbs into the skin very well.</li>
            <li>I have been using Hualuronic Acid Serum for nearly two weeks ...</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t sing this serums praises enough.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin which can break out with heavier creams and serums.</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter and is instantly soft.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li>, so I will use the entire bottle even though I really can&#x27;t wait to be done with it.  </li>
            <li>So far after using this product a couple weeks</li>
            <li>So far I like this product.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle along with the same brand anti aging cream, about 3 months.</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old, tok pictures</li>
            <li>So far, I feel that my skin seems softer, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in the wrinkles around my eyes, which is the reason I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks so far.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and looks fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Must have something in it that is sensitive to the sun..  </li>
            <li>i thought this was a natural product</li>
            <li>but so far product doesn&#x27;t work as advertised</li>
            <li>and I am pleasantly surprised to notice a difference in just 2 weeks using Nicci Marie Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li>I am nearly 70 and look 50.</li>
            <li>So far this item lives up to it description.  </li>
            <li>The combination of vitamins along with hyaluronic acid is a potent regeneration complex.</li>
            <li>Feels good on face and no oily film left behind.  </li>
            <li>The first day or two it seemed to really dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Not uncomfortably tight, just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure how it works but is clear, smooth liquid.. Not sticky or shiny</li>
            <li>I clean my face, use a few drops of serum, then a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>has decreased facial lines, very pleased</li>
            <li>and I notice a different in my skin, and fine lines seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I still have to use a moisturizer on top because my skin feels a little dry after I apply the serum.</li>
            <li>My skin looks good and slow down the ageing process</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for younger, firmer looking skin.</li>
            <li>Overall highly recommend</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase again and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product does make a difference, and not only will I continue to use it, but highly recommend</li>
            <li>It tightens, but when its dry, it pronounces your wrinkles when you smile or make facial movements...</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a combination of both products, but after I use the serum, I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>the long hours I work really takes a toll.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit more pricier than alot of the ones I seen on amazon and im only seeing about a months use per bottle or atleast the bottle i purchased will buy another and try for a few months then come back and update my finding on what it did for my skin</li>
            <li>Right I am in dry/cold location so have been following the instructions for dry areas.</li>
            <li>I just expected a little more.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s really too soon to tell but what I have noticed is how dry it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Really hasn&#x27;t helped with my occasional menstrual related breakouts.</li>
            <li>No gimmicks no other products for you have to purchase to  &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34; it  </li>
            <li>Not see major improvent.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product no perfume delicate!</li>
            <li>If for no other reason, I&#x27;ll probably continue using this product (if on sale).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old and recently have been noticing how much I&#x27;ve aged in the last few years...too much too quickly!</li>
            <li>It helped me to make my skin smooth and my crows feet are hardly noticeable .</li>
            <li>This is not a miracle cure, but it does hydrate, tone, and generally brighten your complexion.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several anti Aging products but was presently surprised with&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C, A. D,</li>
            <li>Have used it daily and so far no difference.  </li>
            <li>I just turned 50 3 months ago and have stayed out of the sun for 12 years as far as tanning and sun related activities but</li>
            <li>My face still has natural lines but they are not nearly as deep.</li>
            <li>My husband is the quiet type, so I was surprised when he made that comment.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>My face actually feels smoother, and softer and looks brighter and young.  </li>
            <li>what with the dr oz endorsement and all, but to be honest i really am not impressed yet.</li>
            <li>Can be a little drying, so I use it right before I moisturize.</li>
            <li>It made my dry skin feel even more dry and tight.</li>
            <li>I feel I got a great deal on this product because other products on the market with the same ingredients are too expensive for me to buy .  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be more dramatic  in my appearance.</li>
            <li>She said there was no other way and the wrinkles will come back.</li>
            <li>My skin is more flexible, softer, less wrinkled and less dry.</li>
            <li>I had tons of wrinkles and dark spots from too much time in the sun in my 47 years.  </li>
            <li>keep the serum in a dark place as Hyaluronic acid is very susceptible to degrading in light.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate where the sun shines every day.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, really dried my skin, which is super dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;unproperly cared for i have dry, sensitive,</li>
            <li>I have dark circles under my eyes and wrinkles forming fast and big.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it after a few minutes of drying it instantly soften my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>It is a little harsh for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also like that you can use on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out or leave your skin red or blotchy.</li>

            <li> I bought this serum from NICCI MARIE like that it is nice and light</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m in my twenties after 10 days of use.  </li>
            <li> am satisfied with this product and will for sure buy it again.</li>
            <li> I will have a better idea of how well it works when I&#x27;ve used it for the 60 days that is suggested.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> I will be better able to evaluate it in 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re well pleased.</li>
            <li> I plan to use the whole bottle, but at this point I don&#x27;t see any great results.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see more results with the wrinkles on my lower eyelids.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C is probably my favorite aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this, it does wonders</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product, It Works MAGIC.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I hope after a couple of weeks, the reaction will be better, and my skin will look better.</li>
            <li> I have not see a difference, but I wll give it more time&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> But I will try it one more month.</li>
            <li> but so far so good!  </li>
            <li> Feels rich and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Yucky skin and thid is one of my new staples for my current supple, happy skin :D  </li>
            <li> With high quality ingredients and sleek packaging, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> My friend loved it very much.</li>
            <li> I received this anti-aging serum by Nicci Marie at a special price during a promotion the company was having; in exchange, I would test their product and give you my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a really good product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Love this product - using it along with a Vitamin C w/sunscreen - get that more youthful, dewy complexion that hides those fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and contains all the right ingredients to keep me looking young and ageless!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and contains all the right ingredients to keep me looking young and ageless!</li>
            <li> It is worth for the price!!</li>
            <li> I also like that it is an easy to use pump that measures out the appropriate amount to apply to your face.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li> Luckily I got this product to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on much more smoothly and looks more finished.</li>
            <li> I am liking that the lines have lessened as I am single and want to put my best face forward when meeting people.</li>
            <li> The serum has a fresh, clean fragrance that dissipates fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my 50+ skin feel and look healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Ok now were talking about a product I enjoy putting on my face.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it leaves my face smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Jan Marini&#x27;s Anti-Oxidant Moisturizer applying the Nicci Marie Hyaluronic Acid Serum first and have been very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The product came in good time, was very well packaged and after using it for a couple of weeks&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Feels good when applying, drys fast and helps my skin look healthier.</li>
            <li> It feels good on the skin, is absorbed quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> So far the product is very nice</li>
            <li> , it goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Great Product , The only thing is I wish it had more  ounces .  </li>
            <li> , it is strong stuff and make my face swell for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very, very reasonable price for this kind of serum.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, it&#x27;s the most important product in my vanity!</li>
            <li> Her makeup also goes on easily over it which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s have stated that their lines and fine wrinkles were diminished by this product.  </li>
            <li> This may be fine for some, however, it irritated my neck.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and even my husband has commented on the effects it has had on my fine lines.</li>
            <li> That worked fine, but I&#x27;d have to walk around all day with a greasy smear to manage the problem areas on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It suits me just fine.  </li>
            <li> ; all works wonders on your skin to improve appearance and restore elasticity, not to mention reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any serum out there that will work on fine lines or the &#x27;11s&#x27; between my brow.</li>
            <li> Quick shipper although the pump mechanism could be better.</li>
            <li> Got my answer thank you very much for the instructions, very easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Easily and quickly absorbed, you can almost feel your skin being nourished!</li>
            <li> I feel like there is a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product - great under lotion, or by itself for younger looking skin!</li>
            <li> So when I saw them in February 2015, my sister&#x27;s looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> but then it makes it smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin feels taut, smooth and lifted - just as described.</li>
            <li> how light and non-oily this product is once it&#x27;s on your face.</li>
            <li> Your skin is so smooth I will be buying this again.  </li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs well  </li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a great product......</li>
            <li> It is light &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily feeling.</li>
            <li> It does not come out smoothly and ends it where you don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> But I like the way it goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Lightly moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Great product, I definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is my honest opinion that this anti-aging serum by Nicci Marie works very well and has become part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> and i really havent noticed any kind of change in my skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks time will tell but so far so good on this product</li>
            <li> Leaves your face soft and fades the lines fairly well.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> good so far feel the stretch of my face.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Too early to tell if its working but feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> Very nice product that seems to work, especially for diminishing crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> First off this smells so good, its like a spring spa in a jar, MMMmmmmmm, and its like pure silk when you are rubbing it on your face.</li>
            <li> The serum is translucent, gel-like and absorbs quickly and easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> easy to use and definitely see good result.</li>
            <li> Such great ingredients in a pleasing formulation that absorbs quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of products out there, but this does in fact work and it is not expensive like the other products on the market and it has a wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li> So excited to get it</li>
            <li> I gave it a four stars becuase the container did not come in its original box.</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  </li>
            <li> Just a 2-3 small pumps creates a perfect canvas.</li>
            <li> Great product affordable and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I believe it has helped my face tremendously with fine lines in tightening the my skin.  </li>
            <li> I got the cream and was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Just a 2-3 small pumps creates a perfect canvas.</li>
            <li> Outstanding moisturizer cream that really makes a difference on your skin!</li>
            <li> This is the first, of many, products I have purchased that truly does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> This serum is  really lightweight and absorbs in quickly, and you don&#x27;t need a great amount, just a couple of pumps and is more than enough to put on your face neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li> You have gained a loyal customer and a free word of mouth advertiser.</li>
            <li> I am 69 yrs old  and will continue using it expecting to continue to get more and more results.  </li>
            <li> Much more positive experience than with the G-R &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am finding so far that Nicci Marie Skincare is showing results (minimizing wrinkles) as well as or better than Nerium, which is what I was using for a fraction of the cost!  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was exactly as described!!</li>
            <li> People have told me how beautiful I look, but i keep this product a secret most of the time!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, as it seems to contain all the important ingredients in stimulating collagen and in providing other great benefits to assist in a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> I received it just a few days of ordering and it was packaged and sealed very good.  </li>
            <li> i was super excited about this,</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the facial tone, the bright skin color.</li>
            <li> great delivery product as expected</li>
            <li> Feels good on your skin but can&#x27;t see any different to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I will probably buy it again, and the price is reasonable compared to many.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth &amp; fresh looking.  </li>
            <li> and she says good results in the short time.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month or more and haven&#x27;t seen any real results.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my face, I like it, this I don&#x27;t think I look younger.</li>
            <li> I have seen some change, but I believe I need to use it longer to see if it&#x27;s making a true difference.</li>
            <li> And as I continue to use it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has a much smoother, more supple texture.</li>
            <li> Probrbly good for younger skin.</li>
            <li> I did a full product review on my you tube channel.</li>
            <li> And as I continue to use it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has a much smoother, more supple texture.</li>
            <li> For once, what was written was true.  </li>
            <li> This goes on smooth, is absorbed quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Not only my face has been clear of acne but it has been smooth from wrinkles (not that I care about wrinkles) but its also a good benifit :).</li>
            <li> great serum seriously feel it working right away its amazing</li>
            <li> Great product - any other Anti-Aging cream I&#x27;ve purchased seems to flake once I apply foundation.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> and I already see my sun spots fading, came quickly.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this serum - it is more like a gel actually.  </li>
            <li> I was using a hyaluronic acid serum from another seller on Amazon’s website, but in my opinion, this particular brand is much better.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into your skin quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin is more soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Serum arrived quickly in a nice bottle with a smooth acting pump.</li>
            <li> it had a decent price- affordable but not so cheap that you wonder if its any good (although price really doesnt determine effectiveness ; one of my favorite beauty products of all time, select lash, only cost 3 bucks!)</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s not thick and sticky feeling...</li>
            <li> This product is also great for dark spots under the eyes that I like to call my &amp;#34;designer bags&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer with anti-aging properties for daily use!after a peel and most of the time I want to moisturize it, but lotion products burn my skin.</li>
            <li> While the seal was not broken or tempered with, I think it should not have been taking out of its original box as the box may have important information to read as well.</li>
            <li> I have  to apply moisturizer on top to make my face feel normal and move without feeling like it might crack.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly report a noticeable improvement in overall skin condition based on first week trial; I recommend this product without hesitation and can finally stop searching for an effective hyraluronic acid serum with vitamin c!  </li>
            <li> This one was perfect it absorbs well and light and smells good too  , my favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t have an insane department store mark up !</li>
            <li> I love trying out new beauty products.</li>
            <li> it feels great going on although with a slightly astringent feeling (perhaps from the witch hazel ingredient) --</li>
            <li> great serum at much less cost than dept. store brands</li>
            <li> This product is so lightweight and is absorbed quickly and isn&#x27;t at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product- does exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is improved but I was really looking for a product to diminish the fine lines.</li>
            <li> really has smoothed out my fine lines</li>
            <li> Great product just started using a few weeks can tell the difference in my skin already  </li>
            <li> It has a fresh smell which comes to me as the aloe in it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Been using this since I received and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion my face feel soft and fresh</li>
            <li> Even after applying a moisturizer on top to seal it in, I can still feel the effects and the tightening action of the product.</li>
            <li> and so far I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive after a peel and most of the time I want to moisturize it, but lotion products burn my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of serums and I find this as good as any of them including the most expensive.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, so far I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> To short usage to say anything about supplementing effects but so far I&#x27;m happy of choosing it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works , it proves you don&#x27;t need to spend 100 bucks on a dept store serum to get results .</li>
            <li> That has made a difference and so far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference with the wrinkles on the of my face when I smile</li>
            <li> and I love how it hydrates my skin and makes it feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Whoever is looking for a great nurturing serum with natural ingredients … look no further.</li>
            <li> although moisturizes and makes skin so soft, I am sure that I will be a thumbs up product.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> it definitely worth the price..</li>
            <li> I feel it was definetley worth the money paid.</li>
            <li> My reviews are based on my own personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Hands down amazing product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that the fine lines near my eyes and laugh lines have diminished a lot!</li>
            <li> Great product for much less than Botox!</li>
            <li> so much I am not willing to share it lol</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, clear formula, absorbs into skin quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a serum, which I love, because serums tend to have a more concentrated dose of active ingredients than do creams.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone seeking to improve the texture of their skin and reduce appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> In two weeks, the spots have significantly faded and the wrinkles are very reduced.  </li>
            <li> This tells me something is working right.</li>
            <li> Right product for the right price</li>
            <li> I use this product right after my shower, before bed.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for a way to help,slow your aging process you are looking in the right place.</li>
            <li> , right?)</li>
            <li> I am still on the first bottle and am pleased with how the serum is working so far.</li>
            <li> This just proves you have to be smart, not rich to have great looking skin.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, absorbs completely, no strong scents.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the product was too strong for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results for at least a month after first using it but, to my great surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the depth of the lines around my mouth and on my cheeks within a week.</li>
            <li> so I moved on to this product getting ready to buy a second bottle I love that my laugh lines have  started to smooth out not gone but smoother like when I was in my 30s</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer with anti-aging properties for daily use!</li>
            <li> I purchase the hyaluronic acid to help keep my face hydrated but my face still looks kind of dry.</li>
            <li> Love it, face is alot more firm.</li>
            <li> i really wanted to love this, but unfortunately so far im just not a fan.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast service.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a very gentle moisturizer and did not burn my face post</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a very gentle moisturizer and did not burn my face post</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a marked decrease in the redness/dryness on my cheeks and it has helped a lot with the appearance of fine lines around my moth and at the corners of my eyes...</li>
            <li> So far, after more than a month using this, I have a noticeable positive difference in my skin texture, much softer and fewer lines.</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash face, dry hands and just a quick towel pat on your face before you spread this on as you Need the moisture for the Hyaluronif acid to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> I have been using it on a daily basis since I received it as part of a promotion, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Do i first use this</li>
            <li> I have noticed some change in my skin, but I cannot tell you exactly what that change is.</li>
            <li> Most definitely.</li>
            <li> I had purchased Peterthomasroth Instant Firm which had the Good Housekeeping Seal of approval and was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> and this is the first one that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> You would pay MUCH MORE for similar formulations at Murad.  </li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> This serum is the first thing I use after I wash my face/neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and really does its job!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a serum before so this is my first one.</li>
            <li> It was ok but the line of products I usually buy are much better.</li>
            <li> there are definitely better products with the same ingredients with noticeable results.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely holding moisture better with this under my face cream.</li>
            <li> with Clarisonic, mist with mineral water, lightly pad with soft towel, I use one spritz of serum for my hands, one for my neck and decollete, and one for my face.</li>
            <li> I simple love this product</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more and I have already recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I had ordered 2 bottles in the first order,</li>
            <li> it left my skin ok but for me i just didn&#x27;t care for the results.</li>
            <li> My face is much smoother and so radiant!</li>
            <li> skin soft and smooth and helps to reduce wrinkles .</li>
            <li> I love face creams, and I love to weed out the good from the bad.</li>
            <li> This serum is the first thing I use after I wash my face/neck.</li>
            <li> After the first use I could feel my skin tightening.  </li>
            <li> my hubby of 12 yrs came up and says your face looks so pretty..</li>
            <li> I also use a good face cream after the serum has dried.</li>
            <li> Though I am still fairly new to the usage of the serum, I have had no reaction to it, my skin seems to respond to it nicely, and will continue to wait and see with further use!</li>
            <li> The serum barely has a smell, absorbs very quickly and lasts about a month with using it on my hands, neck and decollete, and face (of course).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have seen very noticeable reductions in the fine wrinkles on my 40 year old skin, it also seems to lighten the two age spots I had on my hands.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing a little good, but nothing really noticeable.</li>
            <li> People have commented that I look &amp;#34;really good&amp;#34;, and after having some serious health problems, this means a great deal to me.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and always feels so clean.</li>
            <li> In two weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen much on my face yet but the effect on the back of my hands has been phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, really reduced pore size and added glow to facial skin.</li>
            <li> Good not sure still using it</li>
            <li> I think it is more effective if you use with some type of procedure such as a derma peel, chemical peels or regular deep exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> The serum is very light, not too thick and spreads on the face easily.  </li>
            <li> I actually like it much better than my normal &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I think this was a good price for this - it seems like it will last me a long time</li>
            <li> There are certainly cheaper brands of this stuff out there but who knows what&#x27;s in the bottle.</li>
            <li> She already has a pure Hyalurnonic Acid product but this peaked my curiosity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We will certainly be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I am older, 56, so it will take a little more time for changes to show significantly.</li>
            <li> It kind of makes my skin really tight feeling.  </li>
            <li> Have noticed big improvement in texture of skin and decrease in fine lines.</li>
            <li> Now, if I see overall skin improvement with even tone and fewer fine lines....I&#x27;ll be hooked for life.</li>
            <li> It has a very light, fresh scent (I really don&#x27;t like products with heavy smells).</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have been to the dermatologist many times to try and find a solution without much luck.</li>
            <li> She said that we will have to get more when it gets empty.</li>
            <li> And believe me, I know a whole lot about beauty products...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very humid here</li>
            <li> and my skin is very oily and this product does NOT leave my skin oily</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice too much of a difference</li>
            <li> Does that exist or am expecting too much?</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t much difference at this time</li>
            <li> So much that I also decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it really made any difference</li>
            <li> Maybe I have too much damage already.  </li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for having this item.</li>
            <li> I really like this skincare product.  </li>
            <li> really appreciate that this product is made here in the USA.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect much but feel it is working.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of difference in wrinkles</li>
            <li> Also fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really Like it.</li>
            <li> After it absorbs, which is really fast, my skin feels tighter and refreshed.</li>
            <li> You really will with this stuff</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> fast</li>
            <li> thanks for making it so easy&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell much difference after using it for two or three weeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Serum!</li>
            <li> have not had enough time to evaluate if its working, but the pump on the device is cheap and does not work well at all....</li>
            <li> He said well that really works.</li>
            <li> At this time I haven&#x27;t seen much change.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet after using for a month.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and prompt.</li>
            <li> serum really works.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves</li>
            <li> Item received fast and was everything I expecting.</li>
            <li> This product feels silky when applied, and it really improves the look of your skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like strivectin</li>
            <li> I wish it came in quart sizes for my whole body.  </li>
            <li> I can really see the difference in 2 days on my face</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased along with the anti-aging face cream and really like the duo.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the time you took to respond to my concerns.</li>
            <li> I see much improvements.  </li>
            <li> Really like this stuff - I use it twice a day</li>
            <li> I really cannot believe the results this product gives you at this price.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and it arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> , I am now seeing a real difference  in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries quite fast and does not leave any  residues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It goes on really silky and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I put my moisturizer on after using the serum day and night and it really enhances the absorption on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Is very tacky and drying.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says it will for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> I first was my face, put on the serum, I then put on my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is proving very helpful.</li>
            <li> Like most Hyaluronic Acid serum on the market, this worked as expected.</li>
            <li> (We have very oily skin in our family).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old with most people thinking that I am 15 years younger.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it is a pump dispenser, this way I always get just the right amount without waste or contamination.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light and glides on like silk and has a soft, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure only used 1 bottle will try again and maybe will be able to give it more stars.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for two weeks and have seen significant improvement with my crows feer and wrinkles in my forehead.  </li>
            <li> If you want to really know your results, take a photo on the first day and every 7 days later in the exact same light.  </li>
            <li> A single half-pump of the easy pump bottle is all I need to target my undereyes, frown lines and forehead creases.</li>
            <li> Made my Wife&#x27;s skin develop a rash even after following all of the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Nicci Marie gave a full refund.</li>
            <li> It is much better than the lotion I previously used to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month - noticed a slight difference, will give it more time</li>
            <li> Have seen a slight improvement, but needs more time.</li>
            <li> I particularly like that it is made in the US.</li>
            <li> What I like about this particular product is that it has a combination of Vitamin A, Vitamin C,</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this hyaluronic acid is not irritating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum hasn&#x27;t seemed to have much effect on minor wrinkles, however, my skin has responded to the vitamins with improved soft and smooth texture...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never too late to reverse the signs of aging by using a vitamin packed serum your skin will love!</li>
            <li> I am the beauty product junkie and have tried EVERYTHING, from department stores to high end stores...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly refer this to all friends and family.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone wanting to rejuvenate their skin.</li>
            <li> ; and I was not even wearing make up.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly reccommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 3 months and can certainly see a difference in my skin...</li>
            <li> My skin has become more smooth and has less wrinkles in just a few weeks, and my discoloration from being in the sun too much has dramatically improved!</li>
            <li> I live in the UK and was amazed at how quickly it was delivered and I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> no mean that my friends and family were harassing me asking me what I was using on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Expected a 2oz bottle, but arrived as a 1oz bottle, perhaps I missed some small print on quantity, but works great</li>
            <li> I love the tingling sensation that tightens my face, but doesnt feel to harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a few months, then make a more conclusive review.</li>
            <li> I said previously, I have been really enjoying this serum so far.</li>
            <li> Finally got it right.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;m using right now and need at the moment.  </li>
            <li> It has made a definite improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles in a short time.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii, so</li>
            <li> Just wish I could get a phone number to talk to a live person as some of my questions aren&#x27;t answered online.</li>
            <li> This is a new product to me...</li>
            <li> and that has reduced the smile creases around my mouth where many other products I tried did not give me the desired results that this product has given me in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Dont really think it&#x27;s worth the expense, it is almost  a month since I started using it and not much change.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking clear, vibrant and feeling smoother.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I also can tell my skin is very soft too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent a significant amount of money on lotions , moisturizers and other related products that haven&#x27;t had very effective or long lasting results.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount shoots out with each pump, which is better than too much!</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I felt an instant tightening effect.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that the fine lines around my mouth area have diminished slightly.</li>
            <li> If you have FINE lines you will see a slight improvement in your skin.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I felt an instant tightening effect.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side the company did contact me and tried to help me and had several suggestions, all of which did not help.  </li>
            <li> and my skin looks more &amp;#34;plumped.&amp;#34; So I definitely can see how it makes wrinkles less noticeable when wearing it.</li>
            <li> she said she feels her skin very soft and healthier and it really looks different.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast via Prime; however, it was shipped in a large envelope with minimal padding.</li>
            <li> I only started using it in February, so I think it needs a little more time to see if it works miracles.  </li>
            <li> I naturally have dark circles under my eyes and very minimal wrinkles both have improved significantly since I started using this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and not at all oilly</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks I just don&#x27;t use it as regularly since I couldn&#x27;t tell much.</li>
            <li> Did not like it as much as I had hoped, not enough moisture for my skin</li>
            <li> But so far..</li>
            <li> Everyone (even health care professionals) are surprised to find out I am in my 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell if this item is doing what it said it would do I took a before and after picture and notice no difference with the product maybe it takes longer on different people who knows anyway</li>
            <li> Do not think it will restore as much as stop further damage.</li>
            <li> I am 61 yrs old, there is nothing out there that will make me look 40, wish there was.  </li>
            <li> I have been using daily and my face is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I am 65 years old</li>
            <li> My friend has not started to use the product yet, as she wants to finish using her current batch.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so far it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> I like that fact that it is odorless, because I am sensitive to perfumey</li>
            <li> A big plus that it is odorless and absorbs into the skin very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hualuronic Acid Serum for nearly two weeks ...</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t sing this serums praises enough.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin which can break out with heavier creams and serums.</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and is instantly soft.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li> , so I will use the entire bottle even though I really can&#x27;t wait to be done with it.  </li>
            <li> So far after using this product a couple weeks</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle along with the same brand anti aging cream, about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old, tok pictures</li>
            <li> So far, I feel that my skin seems softer, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in the wrinkles around my eyes, which is the reason I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks so far.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and looks fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Must have something in it that is sensitive to the sun..  </li>
            <li> i thought this was a natural product</li>
            <li> but so far product doesn&#x27;t work as advertised</li>
            <li> and I am pleasantly surprised to notice a difference in just 2 weeks using Nicci Marie Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> I am nearly 70 and look 50.</li>
            <li> So far this item lives up to it description.  </li>
            <li> The combination of vitamins along with hyaluronic acid is a potent regeneration complex.</li>
            <li> Feels good on face and no oily film left behind.  </li>
            <li> The first day or two it seemed to really dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Not uncomfortably tight, just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works but is clear, smooth liquid.. Not sticky or shiny</li>
            <li> I clean my face, use a few drops of serum, then a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> has decreased facial lines, very pleased</li>
            <li> and I notice a different in my skin, and fine lines seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I still have to use a moisturizer on top because my skin feels a little dry after I apply the serum.</li>
            <li> My skin looks good and slow down the ageing process</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for younger, firmer looking skin.</li>
            <li> Overall highly recommend</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase again and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product does make a difference, and not only will I continue to use it, but highly recommend</li>
            <li> It tightens, but when its dry, it pronounces your wrinkles when you smile or make facial movements...</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a combination of both products, but after I use the serum, I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> the long hours I work really takes a toll.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit more pricier than alot of the ones I seen on amazon and im only seeing about a months use per bottle or atleast the bottle i purchased will buy another and try for a few months then come back and update my finding on what it did for my skin</li>
            <li> Right I am in dry/cold location so have been following the instructions for dry areas.</li>
            <li> I just expected a little more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please copy &amp; paste these links into your browser to see the yellow discolor in a brand new, unopened bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too soon to tell but what I have noticed is how dry it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> Really hasn&#x27;t helped with my occasional menstrual related breakouts.</li>
            <li> No gimmicks no other products for you have to purchase to  &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34; it  </li>
            <li> Not see major improvent.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product no perfume delicate!</li>
            <li> If for no other reason, I&#x27;ll probably continue using this product (if on sale).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and recently have been noticing how much I&#x27;ve aged in the last few years...too much too quickly!</li>
            <li> It helped me to make my skin smooth and my crows feet are hardly noticeable .</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle cure, but it does hydrate, tone, and generally brighten your complexion.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several anti Aging products but was presently surprised with&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C, A. D,</li>
            <li> Have used it daily and so far no difference.  </li>
            <li> I just turned 50 3 months ago and have stayed out of the sun for 12 years as far as tanning and sun related activities but</li>
            <li> My face still has natural lines but they are not nearly as deep.</li>
            <li> My husband is the quiet type, so I was surprised when he made that comment.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> My face actually feels smoother, and softer and looks brighter and young.  </li>
            <li> what with the dr oz endorsement and all, but to be honest i really am not impressed yet.</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying, so I use it right before I moisturize.</li>
            <li> It made my dry skin feel even more dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I feel I got a great deal on this product because other products on the market with the same ingredients are too expensive for me to buy .  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be more dramatic  in my appearance.</li>
            <li> She said there was no other way and the wrinkles will come back.</li>
            <li> My skin is more flexible, softer, less wrinkled and less dry.</li>
            <li> I had tons of wrinkles and dark spots from too much time in the sun in my 47 years.  </li>
            <li> keep the serum in a dark place as Hyaluronic acid is very susceptible to degrading in light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate where the sun shines every day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, really dried my skin, which is super dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;unproperly cared for i have dry, sensitive,</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes and wrinkles forming fast and big.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it after a few minutes of drying it instantly soften my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> It is a little harsh for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also like that you can use on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out or leave your skin red or blotchy.</li>
            <li> Not even half empty on the first one.</li>
            <li> Has helped, with a few other things, to clear up some very stubborn cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and also live in a very dry climate.  </li>
            <li> Product has separated due to how old it is.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and have tried other things, including dermatologist appointments, but nothing has worked as well as this product.  </li>
            <li> The only negative issue would be my skin began to peel after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it could work so fast, but I will definitely continue to use it !!</li>
            <li> Product has made very visible improvements in wrinkles and small lines around my eyes especially.</li>
            <li> serum is full of key ingredients that help to restore and rejuvenate tired, aging or sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Im a 39 year old male with a slight case of breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for only ten days and can see the dark spots beginning to lighten and a general evening of the skin color.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have an opinion as to effectiveness  </li>
            <li> but they do not last long.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to produce results.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try for all of you who have a drawer full of partially used very expensive products</li>
            <li> I can tell it really won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> i realize i haven&#x27;t had it very long, but i have used products,  like the emu oil airbrush eyecream, that i literally saw instant results.</li>
            <li> Then I received an email from Nicki Marie Skincare explaining the proper way to use the product based on skin type ( dry, oily) .</li>
            <li> But overall I would recommend this for you people that have dry skin.!</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and this has definitely helped.</li>
            <li> I even went as far as using raw cocoa butter to slather on those specific dry patches that formed.  </li>
            <li> Finally a product that works for sun aged skin.</li>
            <li> I have spent years working outside and it has taken its toll.</li>
            <li> In just a few days I noticed  that my skin looks firmer, my lines around my eyes are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any skin improvement how long do i have to wait?</li>
            <li> but I also got a few unexpected surprises.</li>
            <li> This product is a bargain at the price paid, and I looked a long time before purchasing.</li>
            <li> my skin looks firm and soft</li>
            <li> I have a few tiny pockmarks on my face from long-ago acne that are deep enough to collect lotion, primer, or foundation.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I decided as long as I got it, I might as well try it.  </li>
            <li> Certaintly less expensive than most.</li>
            <li> No this isn&#x27;t the fountain of youth, but we do live in a very harsh sunshine(desert southwest) and I felt this might soften some areas on her face that have been exposed for years.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the same as other things I have used.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands of hyaluronic acid before, but this one is perhaps the only one that works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , otherwise, it is too dry to spread onto face.</li>
            <li> this seams to just dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin forms dry patches and then gets flaky.  </li>
            <li> I will say, however, I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t see dry patches forming on my skin any longer.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> IT DRY MY SKIN OUT</li>
            <li> only a few Tim&#x27;s so far...not enough to test it&#x27;s effectiveness, but I like the consistency and absorption.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products in the past that claim to reverse the effects of sun aged skin but nothing has worked as well or as fast as this anti aging skin care serum.</li>
            <li> face doesn&#x27;t have a single wrinkle!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I think it has actually helped my frown lines and even my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Noticed a big difference in my skin,pores seen tighter and a dark spot is fading.</li>
            <li> I just starting using it once a day instead of twice, and my skin seems to be settling down.</li>
            <li> Serum calmed down deep creases and smoothed out crows feet.</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way so this bottle does last.</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling dry and to tight.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I am living in a very dry climate region.</li>
            <li> I like to use a little extra on those lines around my mouth and between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> They only did a little bit on the side of the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for only 3 weeks and have been told I looked at least 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> I have a few wrinkles around my eyes sunspots and my face is starting to sag.</li>
            <li> Only had it a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on vitamin C serum prior to buying a few products that include them.</li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably smoother after only a few days&#x27; use..</li>
            <li> I have seen absolutely no results whatsoever</li>
            <li> Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried every anti-aging product and have spent thousands on med spas.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last but a few days, no difference on skin.  </li>
            <li> It sticks sometimes, so I end up needing to press harder.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no evidence of any improvement since I began using it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I usually would wash my face then apply a lotion based moisturizer such as cetaphil, but that sometimes left me feeling slightly greasy throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain</li>
            <li> I would never even try any other product.</li>
            <li> I just ran out of the other product ..</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is visibly noticeable, maybe over time it will be, but in the meantime it definitely FEELS that way.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Tried other types of serums like Neutrogena, it irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin  feel a little dry.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, and, I didn&#x27;t know this was possible until I tried this product; but, I&#x27;m one of the people whose skin becomes dry and tight -- as well as breaks out in pimples, when I use Hyaluronic Acid with Vitamin C. I can count the number of pimples I&#x27;ve had in my life on my hand (and I&#x27;m old) -- but within a week of using this product I had 2.</li>
            <li> also likes the fact that a little goes a long way and the dispenser ensures you don&#x27;t waste the serum.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how long any effect lasts, or if I&#x27;m showing any improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it for at least the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> The dark circles have lighten up and the wrinkles not forming anymore and disappearing.</li>
            <li> Once that flakiness falls off, it&#x27;ll leave a dark mark in that place.  </li>
            <li> Will report later after using it for at least one month</li>
            <li> the product is OK and supplier is annoying.</li>
            <li> have to turn upside down and play with it in order to work.......</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum, in this product and few other products, have helped with my skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just got this product less than a week ago.  </li>
            <li> My friends agree my face looks &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34;, I have less lines and skin seems firmer.</li>
            <li> Also appears that the wrinkles are less visable</li>
            <li> I find that I am seeing less and less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Seems to make my wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> In this case, I put it on half my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it until the bottle is empty, but so far I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks later i look at it, the liquid has turn to a weird yellow color.</li>
            <li> and I can feel the slight tightness of the cream.</li>
            <li> Within a few days I could already feel my face getting softer, I cant wait for what the next few weeks will hold for me!!</li>
            <li> I spent 5 months using a L&#x27;Oreal age spot serum and had very little results</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel toned and tight.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell that all 4 of these vitamins are hard at work!</li>
            <li> I live in cold, dry skin Alaska and have been relying on hyaluronic acid serums to keep my skin supple for a few years</li>
            <li> My skin feels a little tight after application</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles yet, but once you apply it to your face it has a slight tingling sensation, then after a few seconds that goes away</li>
            <li> Maybe a little.</li>
            <li> But I wish it were a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> covers those little lines...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum a little over a month and yesterday a friend looked at me and said &amp;#34;your</li>
            <li> Little change</li>
            <li> suffered from really bad hyper pigmentation from acne and was looking for something to fade my dark spots and this worked amazingly right away</li>
            <li> Wish I could afford to wear it year round.  </li>
            <li> This serum absorbs well and there is no greasy residue left behind.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and after the use of my Derma Roller twice a week.  </li>
            <li> Age, sun, and a harsh climate have damaged by skin over the years, but this item has worked to help rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does firm and plump the skin.</li>
            <li> I even have my husband and a few co-workers using it now.</li>
            <li> I have been using for approximately one week- two times a day and my only concern is that it will finish too soon.</li>
            <li> , could just take longer then a few weeks i don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the results would be long-term, but when you are wearing the serum it should plump up your wrinkles and help make them less noticeable on a day-to-day basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has only been 10 days since I&#x27;ve started using this product, but I&#x27;m not seeing any dramatic results yet.</li>
            <li> I put it on before my moisturizer and it still feels tight after and for the rest of the day!  </li>
            <li> It improves my skin&#x27;s tone by making it brighter and less dull.</li>
            <li> I have seen very little chance in my face.</li>
            <li> I have replaced this serum with my face moisturizer, not sure if everyone can do that, but that works for me because the make-up I use consists of SPF in it...</li>
            <li> Honestly, not sure if I&#x27;ve seen any results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles at all</li>
            <li> I usually use a moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> I have  tried (and failed) before in buying products from the net.  </li>
            <li> I visited her this past weekend.</li>
            <li> The price point of this product is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is really small.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, as usual, I tried this and applied as directed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in just a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I see a difference just yet</li>
            <li> I am not sure it was a need to do the eye either.</li>
            <li> When it gives, the serum flies out, usually on my mirror.</li>
            <li> The amount of serum is small compared to the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very firm and helps diminish the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I spent in the past on really expensive anti aging cream that never worked.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get the liquid out of the bottle also.</li>
            <li> This sucks, id give it away</li>
            <li> still waiting to receive any response to my complaint.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen lately where this combination is supposed to be the holy grail of youthful appearance, so I was all over this</li>
            <li> I said what do you mean.</li>
            <li> This DOES NOT - I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Maybe thats what they mean by firming.  </li>
            <li> But, it doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t be for you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference, sorry, not worth the $$$ for me!</li>
            <li> by then it was too late to return!</li>
            <li> This is very common when it&#x27;s not followed up with another cream.</li>
            <li> but the amount u get is a rip-off; plus the pump always breaks and u have to scrape out the cream.</li>
            <li> At my age thought it is not a  great help</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any dramatic results.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I however was skeptical for the longest time, but when I saw that it worked for my sisters, I thought that I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> but it made no difference at all sadly</li>
            <li> My mom LOVES this, she has had crows feet and has used it for a week and the lines are faint now.</li>
            <li> My product arrived in a timely manner unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I used every drop of this bottle and did not noticed anything.</li>
            <li> It was too difficult to get the serum from this container</li>
            <li> I hate to waste it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all with this product.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m just not impressed, AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> it is a forgettable product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any results and the serum was very thin and watery comparing to others.  </li>
            <li> Sucks, if you ask me it dries out my face!!!</li>
            <li> She is crazy about this serum.</li>
            <li> (I was so sad after the Dr. Oz rating)- it gave me hives!</li>
            <li> It came with no info and the print on the bottle is impossible to read.</li>
            <li> Was shipped in timely manner and price wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I AM SHOCKED</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Not sure only used 1 bottle will try again and maybe will be able to give it more stars.</li>
            <li> Love it! It makes my skin feel very firm and helps diminish the wrinkles. Makes my 50+ skin feel and look healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Use this regularly.  Have noticed big improvement in texture of skin and decrease in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old I have a few wrinkles around my eyes sunspots and my face is starting to sag. This is my second time ordering the product but I have not been able to get rid of my sun spots the wrinkles are still around my eyes and I show no sign of it tightening my chin or cheeks but my skin is brighter.</li>
            <li> I have tried several anti Aging products but was presently surprised with&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C, A. D, E. Its the best! I have been&lt;br /&gt;using it now for about three weeks and I love the results</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product- does exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Made my Wife&#x27;s skin develop a rash even after following all of the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Nicci Marie gave a full refund.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my girlfriend.  She just loves it.  She said that we will have to get more when it gets empty.</li>
            <li> This will be part of my daily regimen from now on!!! I am the beauty product junkie and have tried EVERYTHING, from department stores to high end stores... I am choosing this product to be apart of my daily use... I have been offered to purchase this product at a great price and for my complete and honest opinion... And believe me, I know a whole lot about beauty products... This is an amazing serum and I love that it&#x27;s not thick and sticky feeling... I live in Hawaii, so it&#x27;s very humid here and my skin is very oily and this product does NOT leave my skin oily, I love the way my skin feels as soon as I put it on... The attention grabber on this is it consists of lots of vitamins, things your skin needs (something I just found out recently)... I have replaced this serum with my face moisturizer, not sure if everyone can do that, but that works for me because the make-up I use consists of SPF in it... I HIGHLY recommend the purchase of this product, it&#x27;s truly a great serum!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, not sure if I&#x27;ve seen any results and I&#x27;ve just started on the 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum through a great deal to share my honest and unbiased opinion This serum is  really lightweight and absorbs in quickly, and you don&#x27;t need a great amount, just a couple of pumps and is more than enough to put on your face neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;. It has a fresh smell which comes to me as the aloe in it. This viscosity is perfect and I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of weeks and noticed my skin more supple and radiant. Definitely a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Feels very good all day. Leaves skin soft and not at all oilly</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice too much of a difference</li>
            <li> Feels good on your skin but can&#x27;t see any different to my skin.  Not a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> I just expected a little more. It&#x27;s hydrating, but I need more hydration than this alone gives. I am also looking for firming. Still looking for a really good product at a reasonable price! Does that exist or am expecting too much? I&#x27;ll keep hoping. This is non-greasy, absorbable serum but I&#x27;m not sure how long any effect lasts, or if I&#x27;m showing any improvement. After a couple weeks I just don&#x27;t use it as regularly since I couldn&#x27;t tell much. Maybe I&#x27;m using too many products to isolate this but I just didn&#x27;t see a lot of difference. Maybe a little. If it works for others it may work for you!</li>
            <li> This is a really great serum. I notice my complexion is better</li>
            <li> absorbs perfectly into my skin</li>
            <li> Have used it daily and so far no difference.  It may work for others..</li>
            <li> I am still on the first bottle and am pleased with how the serum is working so far.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, really dried my skin, which is super dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles at all but I like the product, it goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I was told by my sister&#x27;s that this product worked.  However, I never ordered it until May 2015.  My sister&#x27;s have stated that their lines and fine wrinkles were diminished by this product.  So when I saw them in February 2015, my sister&#x27;s looked fantastic. I however was skeptical for the longest time, but when I saw that it worked for my sisters, I thought that I would give it a try. There are a lot of products out there, but this does in fact work and it is not expensive like the other products on the market and it has a wonderful fragrance.  I hope that this feedback has been helpful.  Please have a wonderful day!</li>
            <li> The product is amazing.  I noticed a big difference on my skin . I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Item as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It is very good. I can tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> great product. been using this for 3 months. easy to use and definitely see good result. skin looks healthier and firmer. will reorder.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It does what it claims to do and is affordable. No gimmicks no other products for you have to purchase to  &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34; it  it&#x27;s just Nicci Marie Skincare and it works ! My skin is soft and always feels so clean. I would never even try any other product. This is all I use and all I need. Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference, sorry, not worth the $$$ for me!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any result yet, i have been using for over 2 weeks,and....We see.</li>
            <li> Great product! This is my 3rd order!</li>
            <li> Did not like it as much as I had hoped, not enough moisture for my skin</li>
            <li> Really good and convient to use</li>
            <li> I have used many Hyaluroic acid serums, this is one of the better ones. After I use it I can  actually feel a tightening on my face. This tells me something is working right. I clean my face, use a few drops of serum, then a moisturizer. This combination seems to work for me.I was given the opportunity to test and try this product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This serum hasn&#x27;t seemed to have much effect on minor wrinkles, however, my skin has responded to the vitamins with improved soft and smooth texture... it feels great going on although with a slightly astringent feeling (perhaps from the witch hazel ingredient) -- not what you&#x27;d expect. I usually use a moisturizer over it. It has a very light, fresh scent (I really don&#x27;t like products with heavy smells). I will probably buy it again, and the price is reasonable compared to many.</li>
            <li> I am already seeing a difference with this hyaluronic acid serum. I have been using it on a daily basis since I received it as part of a promotion, and I love it. My skin looks better, smoother, healthier. It is much better than the lotion I previously used to moisturize. I have very sensitive skin, and this hyaluronic acid is not irritating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 4 vitamins in this serum to help your skin: Vitamin A to improve elasticity, Vitamin C to improve tone and retain moisture, Vitamin D3 to condition and moisturize your skin, and Vitamin E which is another conditioner and anti-oxidant. I can definitely tell that all 4 of these vitamins are hard at work!</li>
            <li> I have  tried (and failed) before in buying products from the net.  Finally got it right.  This is not a miracle cure, but it does hydrate, tone, and generally brighten your complexion.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the lotions, I had been using them only for a week.  But, yes I will continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> This sucks, id give it away so I feel better about wasting my money.</li>
            <li> Ok now were talking about a product I enjoy putting on my face.I spent 5 months using a L&#x27;Oreal age spot serum and had very little results so I moved on to this product getting ready to buy a second bottle I love that my laugh lines have  started to smooth out not gone but smoother like when I was in my 30s .the squint line in between my eyebrows has smoothed out as well.I just turned 50 3 months ago and have stayed out of the sun for 12 years as far as tanning and sun related activities but some how got age spots on my face.I am liking that the lines have lessened as I am single and want to put my best face forward when meeting people.I also started taking collagen tablets with hyaluronic acid in them to help my body and skin only been taking them 2 weeks time will tell but so far so good on this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit more pricier than alot of the ones I seen on amazon and im only seeing about a months use per bottle or atleast the bottle i purchased will buy another and try for a few months then come back and update my finding on what it did for my skin</li>
            <li> Keeps my lines at bay and helps with &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Can someone tell me how to use this.Do i first use this and then my day and night cream. It came with no info and the print on the bottle is impossible to read.</li>
            <li> This may be fine for some, however, it irritated my neck.</li>
            <li> Love this product - using it along with a Vitamin C w/sunscreen - get that more youthful, dewy complexion that hides those fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works but is clear, smooth liquid.. Not sticky or shiny</li>
            <li> Felt really good on my skin. I have noticed some change in my skin, but I cannot tell you exactly what that change is. I think it has evened out my skin tone and made it a bit firmer.I plan on re-ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t much difference at this time but I only been using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin feels a little tight after application but then it makes it smooth.</li>
            <li> will order again.... makes skin feel awesome and more youthful</li>
            <li> I almost finished this, the results are very fine. I am amazed at the facial tone, the bright skin color. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works for sun aged skin. I have spent years working outside and it has taken its toll. I have tried other products in the past that claim to reverse the effects of sun aged skin but nothing has worked as well or as fast as this anti aging skin care serum. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and even my husband has commented on the effects it has had on my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Good not sure still using it</li>
            <li> I got this anti aging serum for my mom for Christmas and she is extremely happy with the results. So much that I also decided to give it a try. In just a few days I noticed  that my skin looks firmer, my lines around my eyes are almost completely gone. Both me and my mom get a lot of compliments from friends and family members, they keep wondering what we did to look so good. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for younger, firmer looking skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  Haven&#x27;t had long...but seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all for me and it actually made my face dryer after each use! kept using it for over 30 days hoping it would eventually work, i know sometimes things take time, but i never seen a difference! by then it was too late to return! hope it works for others, good luck!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it really made any difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this about a week.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t see any difference yet.  Maybe I have too much damage already.  It does feel good on your face.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great. Works very well</li>
            <li> Right product for the right price</li>
            <li> My skin looks good and slow down the ageing process</li>
            <li> I still have&#x27;t notice any difference yet.  I have only using it at night.  Not how often should I use it.  Right I am in dry/cold location so have been following the instructions for dry areas.</li>
            <li> This serum smotthes and refines my complexion.  My face is brighter, clearer and younger looking.  I use it morning and night!</li>
            <li> Would recommend.. Goes on smooth.absorbs good.</li>
            <li> Did not seem to do what I wanted</li>
            <li> Been using this since I received and so far I love it.  Thanks so much for having this item.</li>
            <li> I really like this skincare product.  My skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your prompt shipment.  I look forward to ordering more of your product.</li>
            <li> So excited to get it but it made no difference at all sadly</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Do I still have wrinkles? Yes. Do I see a difference in my skin? Most definitely. I like to use a little extra on those lines around my mouth and between my eyebrows. My skin feels softer and more plump ( in a good way!). Sue Smith, who owns the company, emailed an answer to a question I had. Now, that is customer service. Much more positive experience than with the G-R &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34;. I think the product is superior, as well.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. I Would recommended it to everyone that I know. I Wish that I found it earlier</li>
            <li> Noticeable decrease in appearance in lines around my mouth and eyes.  Overall skin is tighter and smoother.  My results are truly more than I imagined.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I have tried it one time ! I just ran out of the other product .. So I haven&#x27;t used it enough to say yet!! But so far..</li>
            <li> I received this Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin A, C, D and E by Nicci Marie Skincare and I like it very much. For starters, I love the bottle that it comes in. It has a very elegant appearance that would satisfy any gift recipient. I also like that it is an easy to use pump that measures out the appropriate amount to apply to your face. The serum has a fresh, clean fragrance that dissipates fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is full of key ingredients that help to restore and rejuvenate tired, aging or sun damaged skin. I use this product right after my shower, before bed. Within minutes of putting the serum on under my eyes and around my mouth and along my forehead I could feel it tightening my skin. This product is also great for dark spots under the eyes that I like to call my &amp;#34;designer bags&amp;#34;. The serum is ultra hydrating for the skin. After applying it you can definitely feel like you are helping your skin, but the real proof comes after applying it for a few days in a row. It makes your skin LOOK healthier as well as feel healthier. As I am approaching my mid 30s I have noticed that my skin needs more care than it used to. Not getting sleep shows on my face and the long hours I work really takes a toll. I am pleased with any product that can help me fight the effects that work, age and stress are putting on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I really appreciate that this product is made here in the USA.</li>
            <li> I had purchased Peterthomasroth Instant Firm which had the Good Housekeeping Seal of approval and was satisfied. I tried this Serum and it is comparable. I use the Serum during the day and then put on a moisturizer with sun block. Everyone (even health care professionals) are surprised to find out I am in my 70&#x27;s. I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was exactly as described!! I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results but I just started using about a week ago.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face soft and fades the lines fairly well. The only negative issue would be my skin began to peel after the first use. I guess that means it is working. I just starting using it once a day instead of twice, and my skin seems to be settling down.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month &amp; so far I am very happy with it.  At my age 73 I don&#x27;t expect much but feel it is working. My face feels smooth &amp; fresh looking.  Will continue using it</li>
            <li> I use this every day after washing my face. It leaves my skin feeling very soft. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Still have the wrinkles, Haven&#x27;t worked yet</li>
            <li> Great product just started using a few weeks can tell the difference in my skin already  would recommend to others</li>
            <li> It is helping but I think too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> Only had it a few days but so far so good!  Skin seams smoother!</li>
            <li> my skin&#x27;s been getting compliments.  will buy this again.  best used 2x/day.  Lines on forehead and  side of nose softening</li>
            <li> I have been using this product morning and night for 3 weeks now.  To date, I have not found any noticeable improvement&lt;br /&gt;in the wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any skin improvement how long do i have to wait? I am following instructions. Skin is not tightning and wrinkles are the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I already see my sun spots fading, came quickly.</li>
            <li> Like the cream but the amount u get is a rip-off; plus the pump always breaks and u have to scrape out the cream. Second time I&#x27;ve bought it. There won&#x27;t be a third. Try another brand!</li>
            <li> Have went through one bottle of this stuff and I have to say I am really impressed with the results.  Haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of difference in wrinkles but I have noticed smoother skin and a decrease in the size of pores.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> My wife is using it and she says good results in the short time. It is worth for the price!! Also fast delivery.</li>
            <li> So far so good.I really Like it. My Skin feels great and looks at nicer. I have only used it a week and I see a difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It has seemed to work wonders for my wife from what she has told me . Already told me to order another! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I just got this product less than a week ago.  I do not know yet how it will work for me.  I did appreciate the email with the suggestions on how to use this serum.</li>
            <li> It will take time to see the out come, but I&#x27;ve not had any side effects, and I think it is helping .</li>
            <li> Great product; noticed visible difference in the fine lines in a matter of a couple of weeks.  Not oily or greasy.  Very fast service.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion my face feel soft and fresh&lt;br /&gt;Which is nice for this granny 😄</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it every night and morning after I&#x27;ve washed my face. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love skin care products and I&#x27;m so glad I got this. It&#x27;s perfect to help with those &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; those areas where fine lines and wrinkles might appear. Just follow the simple directions and it takes care of the &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34;! I also like that you can use on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out or leave your skin red or blotchy. Overall highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received this item for testing and review purposes! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am finding so far that Nicci Marie Skincare is showing results (minimizing wrinkles) as well as or better than Nerium, which is what I was using for a fraction of the cost!  I have used product close to two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 3 months and can certainly see a difference in my skin...</li>
            <li> The product came in good time, was very well packaged and after using it for a couple of weeks&lt;br /&gt;I have found that my skin feels firmer and looks better. At my age thought it is not a  great help&lt;br /&gt;but nothing I have found has been.  It is a good product thought and if I did not have a lot of sun&lt;br /&gt;damaged skin I&#x27;m sure it would work better.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell if this item is doing what it said it would do I took a before and after picture and notice no difference with the product maybe it takes longer on different people who knows anyway don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to reorder this product</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a short time but I think it is helping.  Feels good on face and no oily film left behind.  I am going to continue using.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month or more and haven&#x27;t seen any real results.</li>
            <li> Just started using it</li>
            <li> Though I am still fairly new to the usage of the serum, I have had no reaction to it, my skin seems to respond to it nicely, and will continue to wait and see with further use!</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel and it seems to be working! I am older, 56, so it will take a little more time for changes to show significantly. For the price, I do wish the bottle was bigger. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I think it has actually helped my frown lines and even my dark spots.I have been using it for about 2 1/2 weeks. I received my shipment quickly.</li>
            <li> We started to use it . it has been the second time. i will give a better feedback in a month o so.</li>
            <li> Wish I could afford to wear it year round.  Low income senior with wrinkles.  But great stuff.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used one of the two bottles I purchased.  I only started using it in February, so I think it needs a little more time to see if it works miracles.  It feels good on the skin, is absorbed quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> I love this serum - it is more like a gel actually.  It is lightweight, clear formula, absorbs into skin quickly and easily.  I definitely notice a &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; of my skin when I apply this.  I put it on before my moisturizer and it still feels tight after and for the rest of the day!  Not uncomfortably tight, just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my review that was deleted:&lt;br /&gt;Hylauronic Acid skincare is all the rage and this product is no exception. With high quality ingredients and sleek packaging, this is a great product. The serum is translucent, gel-like and absorbs quickly and easily into the skin. There is relatively no smell at all. A single half-pump of the easy pump bottle is all I need to target my undereyes, frown lines and forehead creases. After it absorbs, which is really fast, my skin feels tighter and refreshed. Even after applying a moisturizer on top to seal it in, I can still feel the effects and the tightening action of the product. My skin feels taut, smooth and lifted - just as described. Not sure if it is visibly noticeable, maybe over time it will be, but in the meantime it definitely FEELS that way.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is great notice the difference in the feel of my skin after first use healthy n youthful..look forward to on goin results</li>
            <li> In two weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen much on my face yet but the effect on the back of my hands has been phenomenal.  I had tons of wrinkles and dark spots from too much time in the sun in my 47 years.  In two weeks, the spots have significantly faded and the wrinkles are very reduced.  If you want to really know your results, take a photo on the first day and every 7 days later in the exact same light.  You see it every day and may not notice the change.  You really will with this stuff and the photos are the proof!</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 3 weeks and I see results.................yeh!!! just need to make sure you use a night and day moisturizer. The acid will try your skin but it&#x27;s part of the product process. The company I ordered it from was very nice to send a email on how to use it and what works best. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great product! It worked best for me when  my skin was damp before I applied it. My skin seems softer, and the lines around my eyes seem diminished since I&#x27;ve been using it (around 60 days)</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my fine lines. My skin tone is improved but I was really looking for a product to diminish the fine lines. A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> My mom LOVES this, she has had crows feet and has used it for a week and the lines are faint now. She is crazy about this serum.</li>
            <li> Love it! Feels rich and goes on nicely. Best of the products I&#x27;ve tried thus far. Will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> I am simply in love with this serum. It has rehydrated the skin on my face and best of all I have noticed the wrinkles by my eyes start to fade! This serum absorbs well and there is no greasy residue left behind. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really works. My face looks much younger and smoother. I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> great serum seriously feel it working right away its amazing</li>
            <li> I really like this product, as it seems to contain all the important ingredients in stimulating collagen and in providing other great benefits to assist in a more youthful appearance.  I use this product everyday and after the use of my Derma Roller twice a week.  Using the Derma Roller in conjunction with this serum has evened out my skin tone and has made improvements with my facial wrinkles.  Using the Derma Roller and this serum together provide amazing results.  I was using a hyaluronic acid serum from another seller on Amazon’s website, but in my opinion, this particular brand is much better.  It is not as sticky, and the applicator is easier to use.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best creams I have ever used.  Do not think it will restore as much as stop further damage.</li>
            <li> With continued use i&#x27;ve noticed definite change. My face still has natural lines but they are not nearly as deep. I have had family members notice, as well!</li>
            <li> I am 61 yrs old, there is nothing out there that will make me look 40, wish there was.  Having said that I will say this product when used with a good moisturizer seemed to fade age spots, tighten my skin, and gave it a healthier glow than another product I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;kc</li>
            <li> This product is a great value! I have been using daily and my face is much smoother.  I am anticipating seeing more results as time goes on.  Please keep this affordable.</li>
            <li> It has only been 10 days since I&#x27;ve started using this product, but I&#x27;m not seeing any dramatic results yet. Maybe in time?</li>
            <li> I have used the serum for about a week and I have noticed a difference. I live in a very dry climate where the sun shines every day. I am 65 years old and I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, mostly around my mouth and eyes. I have used many products on the market, but most of those do not work!. My skin is smoother and moisturized.My husband did ask me what I was using on my face. He said, whatever you&#x27;re using is working. Your face looks better! My husband is the quiet type, so I was surprised when he made that comment. I will be ordering more in the future! I love, love , love this product! It is the best anti aging cream I have found!</li>
            <li> wife says she is very pleased with the results after using it for about a month now</li>
            <li> Did not perform as prescribed</li>
            <li> I think it is too soon to make a review at this time. But, I do like the way it goes on and the smell. Just wish I could get a phone number to talk to a live person as some of my questions aren&#x27;t answered online.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend. The package arrived without a hitch. My friend loved it very much. I visited her this past weekend. I saw the gift on her counter. I saw that the design was very impressive and well put together. My friend has not started to use the product yet, as she wants to finish using her current batch. I will come back and add update the review about the product later on.</li>
            <li> I love this product non greasy doesnt break out my sesitive  skin very light ansorbs  fast</li>
            <li> Second time I have ordered this product and it seems&lt;br /&gt;to be working...thanks for making it so easy&lt;br /&gt;to get.</li>
            <li> It has already made an improvement i the overall quality of my skin in two weeks.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell much difference after using it for two or three weeks.</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a short while. I can tell it really won&#x27;t last very long. Seems to be doing a little good, but nothing really noticeable. I will continue looking for a better deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for one month now and I have seen no change.  I have some product left so I will continue and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I already look younger. I gave a bottle to a friend, and she loves it as well. Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about a week now and so far I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Packaging--&lt;br /&gt;The container is nice looking and the pump works well. Only a small amount shoots out with each pump, which is better than too much! I use about 2 pumps to cover my entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--How I use it--&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this serum one of three ways:&lt;br /&gt;1. After the shower when my skin is still damp before I put on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;2. After I wash my face before bed. Then wait 10 minutes and use retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;3. After I do an AHA or BHA peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--About the serum--&lt;br /&gt;Like I said previously, I have been really enjoying this serum so far. I had read about how good hyaluronic acid was for your skin but I also got a few unexpected surprises. The serum is a gel consistancy and once it soaks in it dries in a nice matte finish. This makes it a great replacement for a makeup primer! I actually like it much better than my normal &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; which sometimes makes my makeup rub off, this product does not do that! I wore it outside under my makeup on an 86 degree day and my makeup stayed put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hyaluronic acid acts as a great moisturizer. I usually would wash my face then apply a lotion based moisturizer such as cetaphil, but that sometimes left me feeling slightly greasy throughout the day. This serum moisturizes my skin perfectly without leaving it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles yet, but once you apply it to your face it has a slight tingling sensation, then after a few seconds that goes away and my skin looks more &amp;#34;plumped.&amp;#34; So I definitely can see how it makes wrinkles less noticeable when wearing it. I&#x27;m not sure how the results would be long-term, but when you are wearing the serum it should plump up your wrinkles and help make them less noticeable on a day-to-day basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my favorite way to use this product is after I do a Lactic acid or Salicylic acid peel. My skin is really sensitive after a peel and most of the time I want to moisturize it, but lotion products burn my skin. Hyaluronic acid is a very gentle moisturizer and did not burn my face post peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Final thoughts--&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer with anti-aging properties for daily use!after a peel and most of the time I want to moisturize it, but lotion products burn my skin. Hyaluronic acid is a very gentle moisturizer and did not burn my face post peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Final thoughts--&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer with anti-aging properties for daily use!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Serum! It has made a definite improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles in a short time. It absorbs quickly and has a nice texture. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I love how light and non-oily this product is once it&#x27;s on your face. It absorbs into your skin quickly. My friends agree my face looks &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34;, I have less lines and skin seems firmer. I would highly recommend this product to anyone seeking to improve the texture of their skin and reduce appearance of fine lines. I will be buying your product again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of serums and I find this as good as any of them including the most expensive.  I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results for at least a month after first using it but, to my great surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the depth of the lines around my mouth and on my cheeks within a week. I was stunned. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of moisturizers and serums (sera?) in my lifetime and this is the first one that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> This is a new product to me...but the ingredients are just what I was looking for.  I have used this serum only a few Tim&#x27;s so far...not enough to test it&#x27;s effectiveness, but I like the consistency and absorption.  My skin feels really good on days that I have used it</li>
            <li> This product I picked because it has more beneficial vitamins than most.</li>
            <li> So far, after more than a month using this, I have a noticeable positive difference in my skin texture, much softer and fewer lines. People have commented that I look &amp;#34;really good&amp;#34;, and after having some serious health problems, this means a great deal to me.  This product is a bargain at the price paid, and I looked a long time before purchasing.</li>
            <li> There has been no noticeable change in my skin I&#x27;ve used for several weeks</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I apply the product.  Silky and I feel like I am glowing</li>
            <li> have not had enough time to evaluate if its working, but the pump on the device is cheap and does not work well at all....have to turn upside down and play with it in order to work.......</li>
            <li> Certaintly less expensive than most. Have to be carefull in being out in the sun. Will see what hapens over time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Your skin is so smooth I will be buying this again.  I can&#x27;t believe how much I spent in the past on really expensive anti aging cream that never worked. This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with purchase.  I think it is more effective if you use with some type of procedure such as a derma peel, chemical peels or regular deep exfoliation.  I saw a healthy glow to my face.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have an opinion as to effectiveness  It is light and absorbs well  Shipping was great</li>
            <li> After 2 weeksvI love how this product makes my face looks and feel! Really hasn&#x27;t helped with my occasional menstrual related breakouts. Maybe I need to use it for a could more weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have only been using for two weeks and have seen significant improvement with my crows feer and wrinkles in my forehead.  I will definitely purchase again and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I do like this skincare product..It goes on so nice ,,not greasy or sticky as some that I have tried. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful. I want more. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it. Every day I automatically moisturize with it and voila my face already feels better. I love this product so much, it&#x27;s the most important product in my vanity! Thank you for the results Olay! !!</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it leaves my face smooth and refreshed. I would highly refer this to all friends and family. The cost is also a plus factor. all products from this line are great for woman of any age who like to keep their skin in great condition.</li>
            <li> Not see major improvent.</li>
            <li> Noticed a big difference in my skin,pores seen tighter and a dark spot is fading. I will be reordering this product again. Thank you for making such a great product......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two bottles of this and am reordering. This goes on smooth, is absorbed quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky at all. I use twice daily after washing my face and before moisturizing.  I feel like there is a huge difference in my skin. However I use many products.  In any case this product or using it in conjunction with others is working well for me. Just ordered more.</li>
            <li> It is light &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I can honestly report a noticeable improvement in overall skin condition based on first week trial; I recommend this product without hesitation and can finally stop searching for an effective hyraluronic acid serum with vitamin c!  Kudos to the team at Nicci Marie for delivering a top quality product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four stars becuase the container did not come in its original box. It was basically just thrown in the amazon box as is. While the seal was not broken or tempered with, I think it should not have been taking out of its original box as the box may have important information to read as well. Otherwise, so far I am pleased with the product. My face feels very smooth and just after three days of use I can see some lines being smoother. I hope my next purchase will have the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I can already feel and see a difference. My skin feels hydrated and looks more radiant and smoother.  The crows feet around my eyes aren&#x27;t as obvious. I&#x27;m so happy I decided to give this a try.  This is the only product I&#x27;m using right now and need at the moment.  I received it just a few days of ordering and it was packaged and sealed very good.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better after using it for 2 weeks. We will see what it does for my wrinkles. It is too soon to tell! I have sensitive skin and so far it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. My skin seems smoother and healthier. Almost seems brighter. It took about a week to notice but I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product, first time I have purchased this one and it feels wonderful on my skin!  It goes on great and helps with dryness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love this product, bought it, again, &amp; will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> My product arrived in a timely manner unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin with this product</li>
            <li> Wow... I just used this and actually feel it working! I love the tingling sensation that tightens my face, but doesnt feel to harsh. I like that fact that it is odorless, because I am sensitive to perfumey smells.. Non greasy too! Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month - noticed a slight difference, will give it more time</li>
            <li> To short usage to say anything about supplementing effects but so far I&#x27;m happy of choosing it.</li>
            <li> Just started using. Can&#x27;t know yet how well it works.</li>
            <li> This stuff works , it proves you don&#x27;t need to spend 100 bucks on a dept store serum to get results . We were looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my wife&#x27;s skin the last HA  serum we bought irritated her skin so we took it back . The one she bought before that was sticky and tacky . This one was perfect it absorbs well and light and smells good too  , my favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t have an insane department store mark up !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so I can&#x27;t say for sure whether it works. It seems OK.</li>
            <li> Works well but you have to use something else with it - either a facial lotion or some water, otherwise, it is too dry to spread onto face.</li>
            <li> As of yet I like the product.  I do not like the spray bottle.  It does not come out smoothly and ends it where you don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast via Prime; however, it was shipped in a large envelope with minimal padding. I&#x27;m not certain the pump is working properly as it takes A LOT of force to extract the serum. Too soon to tell if the product is working (10-days) but my face does look more &#x27;rested&#x27; after applying. Serum contains no fragrance which is a big plus. So far, so good. Packaging for ship needs improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I used every drop of this bottle and did not noticed anything.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  My skin looks renewed ... brighter and firmer. I can&#x27;t wait to try Nicci Marie moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have been to the dermatologist many times to try and find a solution without much luck. Vitamin C serum, in this product and few other products, have helped with my skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent a significant amount of money on lotions , moisturizers and other related products that haven&#x27;t had very effective or long lasting results.  I did a lot of research on vitamin C serum prior to buying a few products that include them. I haven&#x27;t come across any undesirable side effects as a result of taking these. I am pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped reverse sun damage to my skin that has occurred over the years. My skin is more flexible, softer, less wrinkled and less dry. Age, sun, and a harsh climate have damaged by skin over the years, but this item has worked to help rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have for head wrinkles that I call my thinking lines. I&#x27;ve said nothing to my kids because they always asked my why I have them and I said thinking and age. My son said today mom what is happening with your thinking lines. I said what do you mean. He said they are going away. I said are you sure he looked closer and said yes. I said I bought something and have been using it for almost a week. He said well that really works. I said I know. He said you&#x27;ve tried allot of things I see them in your bathroom you better keep using that mom!</li>
            <li> Good product with visible results but they do not last long. By midday skin seems to look just like before applying the product and after 3 weeks of use it still has the same results.</li>
            <li> Serum calmed down deep creases and smoothed out crows feet. Very pleased with product. I would purchase again. No regrets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for ten days and do see improvement.  My skin is smoother and firmet. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this for a client.  She loves it thank u.  Will pass onto others.  Have a great day. Love</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the way my skin feel!</li>
            <li> This was find.  It was a nice consistency-- it didn&#x27;t last long--small amount.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 1/2 weeks. The first day or two it seemed to really dry my skin. Then I received an email from Nicki Marie Skincare explaining the proper way to use the product based on skin type ( dry, oily) . That has made a difference and so far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this item three stars because it&#x27;s been 10 days since i&#x27;ve been using it. I&#x27;m hoping by the end of the month I will know more and can access the product better. At this time I haven&#x27;t seen much change.</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Have only used for a week, but can already tell a difference in the moisture in my face.  Also appears that the wrinkles are less visable</li>
            <li> This is like putting a multi-vitamin on your skin.  Such great ingredients in a pleasing formulation that absorbs quickly into your skin.  The price point of this product is unbelievable.  You would pay MUCH MORE for similar formulations at Murad.  Save your money and get this serum!!</li>
            <li> So far so good! I think I can see a difference already!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to produce results.</li>
            <li> my skin looks firm and soft</li>
            <li> It is fair.  Leaves skin very dry.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product for my wife. It is a great&lt;br /&gt;product she likes how it makes her skin feel. It makes her skin softer and&lt;br /&gt;healthier in both look and touch.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my face, I like it, this I don&#x27;t think I look younger.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Will buy again. you can see effects after 3 or 4 days using this</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the same as other things I have used. Don&#x27;t see any dramatic results.</li>
            <li> great delivery product as expected</li>
            <li> An excellent product... I would definitely re-order it.</li>
            <li> This is the best anti wrinkle product around. I have been using it for only 3 weeks and have been told I looked at least 10 years younger. A nicer compliment, I can&#x27;t imagine.</li>
            <li> Very good product. But I wish it were a little cheaper. Do you have any coupons or sales on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a short time.  I have seen some change, but I believe I need to use it longer to see if it&#x27;s making a true difference.</li>
            <li> I could see the difference in my skin after one week&#x27;s use.  The lines are starting to disappear.  Wonderful Product.</li>
            <li> This product does all it says it will do. My skin is noticeably smoother after only a few days&#x27; use..</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet after using for a month.  Still hoping for some improvement!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that impressed I was hoping it would be more dramatic  in my appearance. It is hard to get the liquid out of the bottle also.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, she loves it!</li>
            <li> I really love this serum as it fills in the lines. People have told me how beautiful I look, but i keep this product a secret most of the time! Give yourself the transformation you deserve!!</li>
            <li> I just received the product so have only used it twice. But I like the way it goes on smooth and it leaves no greasy feeling on my skin. A big plus that it is odorless and absorbs into the skin very well. Shipping was fast and prompt. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hualuronic Acid Serum for nearly two weeks ... It has improved the texture &amp; look of my skin greatly ... Very pleased &amp; will purchase more.</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work because it doesn&#x27;t have a tube connected to the pump.  The product doesn&#x27;t work.  There has been no change to my skin.</li>
            <li> It has not removed the bags under eyes and some lines in eye brows.  However will continue using to see if this changes.</li>
            <li> So. I&#x27;ve purchased this serum twice.&lt;br /&gt;It also had no silicone in it and that won me over.&lt;br /&gt;Now when I say this working miracles on my face no mean that my friends and family were harassing me asking me what I was using on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I suffered from really bad hyper pigmentation from acne and was looking for something to fade my dark spots and this worked amazingly right away I saw results.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the show where Dr.OZ recommended vitamin c serum with phytoceramide, I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;This serum really works.</li>
            <li> Love this product, really reduced pore size and added glow to facial skin.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels more hydrated.  I still have to use a moisturizer on top because my skin feels a little dry after I apply the serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this faithfully for about a month, and I might be seeing some smoothing effects. I&#x27;ll keep using it for at least the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> covers those little lines...will purchase again</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product no perfume delicate! Love it</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t sing this serums praises enough. I have incredibly sensitive skin which can break out with heavier creams and serums. This product is so lightweight and is absorbed quickly and isn&#x27;t at all greasy. However best of all it really works it just seems to lock in moisture and leaves my skin supple and plumped up. I use it in combination with a gel moisturiser and my skin just loves it. I live in the UK and was amazed at how quickly it was delivered and I will definitely be buying it again. A really exceptional serum at an amazing price!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this several times. I use it in combination with Jan Marini&#x27;s Anti-Oxidant Moisturizer applying the Nicci Marie Hyaluronic Acid Serum first and have been very satisfied with it. I particularly like that it is made in the US.</li>
            <li> I Need to order more !</li>
            <li> This serum is the first thing I use after I wash my face/neck. Just a 2-3 small pumps creates a perfect canvas. When I first put it on, I felt an instant tightening effect.  And as I continue to use it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has a much smoother, more supple texture. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and contains all the right ingredients to keep me looking young and ageless!</li>
            <li> Very nice, absorbs completely, no strong scents. I like putting serum with vitamins on the skin to help with pollution &amp; sun exposure. Great price for this product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy because this was a gift for my auntie and she absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;If she is happy I am happy and have to give this product an A+ based on her usage so far.</li>
            <li> meh! didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Hands down amazing product! Will be purchasing again! My skin has become more smooth and has less wrinkles in just a few weeks, and my discoloration from being in the sun too much has dramatically improved! Great product for much less than Botox! Do yourself a favor and try this product, you won&#x27;t be unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> Item received fast and was everything I expecting. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> This product does firm and plump the skin. I have also noticed that the fine lines around my mouth area have diminished slightly. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> Its hasn&#x27;t done any thing to help the lines on my face.</li>
            <li> This product feels silky when applied, and it really improves the look of your skin.  I would recommend this to friends.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and really does its job!</li>
            <li> Great Product , The only thing is I wish it had more  ounces .  The bottle is really small.</li>
            <li> this seams to just dry out my skin. have not seen any improvement, but I have been using strivectin for several years and that could be why. I really like strivectin so I will just continue with that.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a serum before so this is my first one. It is wonderful feeling and when used with moisturizing cream made by same brand my skin is so soft and not greasy at all. My skin is very dry and this has definitely helped.</li>
            <li> Best serum I&#x27;ve used and much more affordable than others.  Has helped, with a few other things, to clear up some very stubborn cystic acne.  My skin looks brighter and is instantly soft.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  I will defiantly order it again.  I wish it came in quart sizes for my whole body.  Great product.</li>
            <li> - I received the item on time the day after I ordered it it was promised to be delivered on 5 July but I got it on 4 July...a holiday!!! That was great!!also I can really see the difference in 2 days on my face even got a compliment unsolicited! I will be reordering this item!!</li>
            <li> has decreased facial lines, very pleased</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of weeks, but I can already see results. I use it twice per day on my face and under my eyes. I have some puffiness under my eyes at times, but after using this, they seem to be gone. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the fine lines near my eyes and laugh lines have diminished a lot! I also use a good face cream after the serum has dried. I use Anavita Moisturizing Creamm which is an Anti-Wrinkle Cream. So, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a combination of both products, but after I use the serum, I notice a huge difference. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this item for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Im a 39 year old male with a slight case of breakouts. Ive been searching and searching for products to help me prevent breakouts but most of the products I&#x27;ve come accross, I find out after using it that im allergic to it. Although Hyaluric Acid Serum is for aging, I decided to buy and use it and Im glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using Hyaluric Acid Serum for almost a month now and I have NOT been breaking out. Not only my face has been clear of acne but it has been smooth from wrinkles (not that I care about wrinkles) but its also a good benifit :). Great product and I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This product has improved my skin dramatically. My skin is more soft and smooth. I look younger than my age. Everyone around me has noticed this change. Luckily I got this product to try and give my honest opinion. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 4 weeks and can not see any difference, I used it morning and night. still waiting to receive any response to my complaint.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, as usual, I tried this and applied as directed.  Unfortunately, I got absolutely no results.  It may be my skin. Also, using  one or two squirts twice a day. It was gone within a month. Hopefully it works for others.</li>
            <li> Did not work!  save your money.</li>
            <li> It was too difficult to get the serum from this container so I would not order this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product - any other Anti-Aging cream I&#x27;ve purchased seems to flake once I apply foundation.  This DOES NOT - I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month and see no changes whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum a little over a month and yesterday a friend looked at me and said &amp;#34;your face doesn&#x27;t have a single wrinkle!&amp;#34; She now has my extra bottle of serum. I&#x27;m about to be 53 next month.</li>
            <li> It was ok but the line of products I usually buy are much better.This left my skin feeling dry and to tight.Sorry,but I want buy it again and would have set it back but I had used gift certificates and the value of those won&#x27;t be refunded.</li>
            <li> Excellent serum. Makes skin feel toned and tight.</li>
            <li> Dont really think it&#x27;s worth the expense, it is almost  a month since I started using it and not much change.</li>
            <li> It tightens, but when its dry, it pronounces your wrinkles when you smile or make facial movements...its okay if wearing before bed time.</li>
            <li> I love that this serum has the vitamins needed to help restore my skin. I was given this serum to try and give my honest and unbiased opinion. I have dark circles under my eyes and wrinkles forming fast and big. I started using the serum 2 weeks and already seeing a difference. The dark circles have lighten up and the wrinkles not forming anymore and disappearing. Glad this was given to me to try.</li>
            <li> I am living in a very dry climate region. I purchase the hyaluronic acid to help keep my face hydrated but my face still looks kind of dry. I am 50 years old with most people thinking that I am 15 years younger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too soon to tell but what I have noticed is how dry it makes my skin feel.  I have a 60 day guarantee so will know more by then.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the serum and the aloe helps with any redness that I have.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> really love this luxurious cream! really has smoothed out my fine lines and i look and feel younger. smoothes on easily absorbs quickly and smells really nice too! highly recommend! so happy to test free for review.</li>
            <li> I AM SHOCKED THIS DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE.I reordered.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well so far. Lightly moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t break me out. You&#x27;ll probably need another moisturizer for dryer seasons though.</li>
            <li> The best anti aging serum I ever bought. Works great and my skin looks radiant. Many compliments. Thank you</li>
            <li> So far the product is very nice</li>
            <li> Love this product! I purchased along with the anti-aging face cream and really like the duo. Only downside is that the coupon didn&#x27;t work for $10 off. Otherwise, the products are great!</li>
            <li> Got my answer thank you very much for the instructions, very easy to follow. I really appreciate the time you took to respond to my concerns.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Feels good when applying, drys fast and helps my skin look healthier.</li>
            <li> good so far feel the stretch of my face.</li>
            <li> Little change but like firmness I feel</li>
            <li> Not so sure that it did anything at all.  It kind of makes my skin really tight feeling.  Maybe thats what they mean by firming.  I have  to apply moisturizer on top to make my face feel normal and move without feeling like it might crack.  I won&#x27;t be re-buying this.  I think that Boots 7 serum from target is 100% better than this and its cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no quitter, or is it that I am that frugal, so I will use the entire bottle even though I really can&#x27;t wait to be done with it.  I would not recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t get a chance to see this product through. I broke out after one application. I did not use it again. I probably should give it to my mom and see if she doesn&#x27;t break out. I hate to waste it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I absolutely love this product. I can feel my skin tighten on my face and there is no white residue or anything. It&#x27;s perfect!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have noticed some improvements on the tone of my skin. I also can tell my skin is very soft too.</li>
            <li> No visible results yet. I&#x27;ll give it a few months, then make a more conclusive review.</li>
            <li> This serum has so many benefits that you can research and learn about.  But if you are looking for a way to help,slow your aging process you are looking in the right place. I find that I am seeing less and less wrinkles.  It absorbs very nicely without that greedy feeling.  I am using it on my face and neck.  I see much improvements.  I am happy to leave this review with my honest opinion I&#x27;d exchange for a sample to test.  Very nice product that works..</li>
            <li> I have seen absolutely no results whatsoever</li>
            <li> So far after using this product a couple weeks I  am satisfied with my results.  I like the way my face feels and looks after I use it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Satisfied with the results. My skin is softer and has fewer lines. I use it with a moisturizer and a sunscreen to protect against the sun.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff - I use it twice a day and I feel like it has made a great difference to my complexion.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars - This product is amazing! I could see a difference with the wrinkles on the of my face when I smile, you can feel your skin tighten. Great product, I definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> So far I like this product. It has helped my face feel tighter and look better. Please with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works. Its also made un USA</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, I use it twice a day and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in just a few weeks! I naturally have dark circles under my eyes and very minimal wrinkles both have improved significantly since I started using this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is a great serum and works well with my moisturizer. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Great!!!! thx for offering such a treciffic product</li>
            <li> Great product excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> Although I applied regularly as directed, I saw no effect- there are definitely better products with the same ingredients with noticeable results. I used it with  and without moisturizer to no effect. I have great skin but this product did not impress.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have tried. It has tighten where my skin was starting to sag and that has reduced the smile creases around my mouth where many other products I tried did not give me the desired results that this product has given me in such a short period of time. I plan to continue to purchase this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product and service.  Have bought before and will reorder.</li>
            <li> good product recommend!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!!!  Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried every anti-aging product and have spent thousands on med spas.  I really cannot believe the results this product gives you at this price.  This just proves you have to be smart, not rich to have great looking skin.  I never, ever run out of this product!!</li>
            <li> The ingredience were quality.  It should have had a pump opening.  The gell would not come out evenly or at all.  Carol</li>
            <li> I love trying out new beauty products. I received this anti-aging serum by Nicci Marie at a special price during a promotion the company was having; in exchange, I would test their product and give you my honest feedback. I can honestly say that I love this product. It&#x27;s a serum, which I love, because serums tend to have a more concentrated dose of active ingredients than do creams. (But that&#x27;s just my personal opinion) I also love the fact that it is a pump dispenser, this way I always get just the right amount without waste or contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this wonderful serum every morning after my shower and the results are astounding! It&#x27;s nice and light and glides on like silk and has a soft, subtle scent. It has worked wonders on minimizing those fine lines and it&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer. My skin just instantly soaks up all those wonderful vitamins and looks radiant and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my honest opinion that this anti-aging serum by Nicci Marie works very well and has become part of my skin care routine. I would definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s never too late to reverse the signs of aging by using a vitamin packed serum your skin will love!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product as I started to notice a lessening of wrinkles in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Love this  product. It feels so good on my face. Seems to make my wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle along with the same brand anti aging cream, about 3 months. I am 57 years old, tok pictures so I could keep track. There was no improvement whatsoever. Probrbly good for younger skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I have no complaints.  If I use it religiously I know I would see quicker results.  When I&#x27;m out of the serum, I will be a returning customer.  Thank y</li>
            <li> I have used this for 1 week, and notice ALOT of difference in my skin. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing! Easily and quickly absorbed, you can almost feel your skin being nourished! I have been using this daily and I have noticed a marked decrease in the redness/dryness on my cheeks and it has helped a lot with the appearance of fine lines around my moth and at the corners of my eyes... very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I do feel like my skin is better hydrated. I&#x27;m not sure I see a difference just yet but it feels good going on - light and refreshing. I think this was a good price for this - it seems like it will last me a long time and it arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> Works great! Really pleased with this product. I&#x27;ll buy more when I run out. Good price, fast shopping, good packaging.</li>
            <li> Love how this feels. My skin is definitely holding moisture better with this under my face cream.</li>
            <li> Product is GREAT!!!! I have received many comments on how healthy and youthfull my skin looks since using this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used different hyaluronic acid products and found this one to be one if the best! I love how my face feels and looks. I love this product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last but a few days, no difference on skin.  Saw no results.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product - great under lotion, or by itself for younger looking skin!</li>
            <li> I have waited three months before writing a review so I could give the product an honest chance.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen very noticeable reductions in the fine wrinkles on my 40 year old skin, it also seems to lighten the two age spots I had on my hands. The serum barely has a smell, absorbs very quickly and lasts about a month with using it on my hands, neck and decollete, and face (of course).&lt;br /&gt;I keep the serum in a dark place as Hyaluronic acid is very susceptible to degrading in light.&lt;br /&gt;My regime is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Clean with Clarisonic, mist with mineral water, lightly pad with soft towel, I use one spritz of serum for my hands, one for my neck and decollete, and one for my face. I let it absorb then apply night creme, or on alternative days a retinol A creme, (and then the night creme).&lt;br /&gt;This is a very, very reasonable price for this kind of serum.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes on time, the company sends me an email now and then, but certainly not annoyingly often, and meanwhile they have added two very worthwhile coupons.  I am very pleased with the product and the company.</li>
            <li> Amazing, Amazing, Amazing! I simple love this product and I love how it hydrates my skin and makes it feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Loved the serum. Wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> Good firming serum. Wish they would incorporate a substance to remove brown spots for those&lt;br /&gt;Of us who spend time on the golf course.</li>
            <li> So far, I feel that my skin seems softer, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in the wrinkles around my eyes, which is the reason I purchased it.  I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks so far.</li>
            <li> Great product affordable and goes a long way. I am really pleased that it works and have noticed the difference in my skin. I&#x27;m not sure how it could work so fast, but I will definitely continue to use it !! I love the way this product feels on my face. I use moisturizer afterwards. It work&#x27;s really good... its the best one yet! My skin is so soft and looks fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for two weeks now and i have gotten so many compliments about my skin and how great it looks. This serum has done wonders to my skin tone and skin texture. You will not regret purchasing this serum. I will definitely be purchasing more and I have already recommend it to friends and family. Great product. Highly recommend it to anyone wanting to rejuvenate their skin. It helped me to make my skin smooth and my crows feet are hardly noticeable . The sooner you start using it, the better.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once but I wasn&#x27;t a fan. It made my dry skin feel even more dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 4 nights now and my skin is already glowing with diminished signs of my forehead and mouth lines. I am so happy there is finally a product out there with truly great ingredients and that this company is selling it at a fair price. Nicci!! You have gained a loyal customer and a free word of mouth advertiser. I am buying this for all the moms I know for mothers day. Whoever is looking for a great nurturing serum with natural ingredients … look no further.</li>
            <li> This is Peggy Brown. I had my husband ordser this product from Amazon for me after hearing about this on the Dr. Oz show. I received my order 2 wks ago and having been using it morning and night ever since, I am now seeing a real difference  in my skin. Even my husband said he could tell that my lines and wrinkles are softening. I am 69 yrs old  and will continue using it expecting to continue to get more and more results.  I will definitely be re-ordering when i get close to running out. I had ordered 2 bottles in the first order,</li>
            <li> This product smooths out the complexion and brightens it. I have purchased this before and I make sure to reorder before I run out. I use it in the AM &amp;amp; PM. It seems to make a difference. I look more rested. It is worth a try for all of you who have a drawer full of partially used very expensive products</li>
            <li> I have only used the serum for 2 weeks, but see a difference in my overall skin tone.  I do notice that my face gets real red when out in the sun when I was using it morning and night.  Must have something in it that is sensitive to the sun..  So now I just use it at night only.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, and, I didn&#x27;t know this was possible until I tried this product; but, I&#x27;m one of the people whose skin becomes dry and tight -- as well as breaks out in pimples, when I use Hyaluronic Acid with Vitamin C. I can count the number of pimples I&#x27;ve had in my life on my hand (and I&#x27;m old) -- but within a week of using this product I had 2. It&#x27;s not a winner for me. But, it doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t be for you.</li>
            <li> it left my skin ok but for me i just didn&#x27;t care for the results. wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. maybe just me.</li>
            <li> I have been getting botox for years. I was overdue because the Dermatologist I went to told me that botox has to be done every three months. She said there was no other way and the wrinkles will come back. I was using this serum. I went back to another botox place I use to go to. They said I did not need it on my forehead. They only did a little bit on the side of the eyes. It saved me $200. I am not sure it was a need to do the eye either. They said If they did the forehead my eyebrows will droop so they could not do it their. So I might not need botox again after all.</li>
            <li> Whenever I purchase a skin care product, I &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; it by using it on one area before I use it all over. In this case, I put it on half my face. I have a few tiny pockmarks on my face from long-ago acne that are deep enough to collect lotion, primer, or foundation. Within 2 weeks, my skin plumped enough that there was no indentation. That proved it worked for me. Some tiny lines also disappeared. I&#x27;m 60, so I&#x27;ll take what I can get. Out of many fails in skin care products, this serum is a keeper. Note that I use a daily alpha hydroxy peel, which always goes on before this serum. So your mileage may vary. One star off for the pump, though. It sticks sometimes, so I end up needing to press harder. When it gives, the serum flies out, usually on my mirror.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 1 week and I don&#x27;t see any changes, perhaps it is too soon, will keep using it.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful especially in working with the OZ Naturals. Time will tell if it does what it says it will do, that is, reduce facial wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not doing anything. Shaklee has a better product. There is absolutely no evidence of any improvement since I began using it. I have always taken care of my skin, and this product does not even feel like it is doing anything. I&#x27;ll use it until the bottle is empty, but so far I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> i thought this was a natural product but unfortunately the first time I used it (I was so sad after the Dr. Oz rating)- it gave me hives!</li>
            <li> This is a hyaluronic skin product. If you have FINE lines you will see a slight improvement in your skin. I won&#x27;t however order this product from this supplier again, since they have barraged me with email for a review. Some companies might send you a request after you order the product, this one keep on sending email after email. So here&#x27;s the review - the product is OK and supplier is annoying.</li>
            <li> I have received this product before I was out of the my Joven serum.  Really happy with Joven serum but so expensive, was sure I could find equal results using same ingredients.  I bought this serum from NICCI MARIE like that it is nice and light although moisturizes and makes skin so soft, I am sure that I will be a thumbs up product. Will report again after using it.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this product because of it&#x27;s combination of hyaluronic acid and vitamin C ingredients.  I&#x27;ve seen lately where this combination is supposed to be the holy grail of youthful appearance, so I was all over this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily, morning and night.  I have very dry skin and also live in a very dry climate.  My skin forms dry patches and then gets flaky.  Once that flakiness falls off, it&#x27;ll leave a dark mark in that place.  I have tried lots of different moisturizers and skin treatments to fix the problem but it would still persist.  I even went as far as using raw cocoa butter to slather on those specific dry patches that formed.  That worked fine, but I&#x27;d have to walk around all day with a greasy smear to manage the problem areas on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicci Marie serum....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed life transforming results and I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m in my twenties after 10 days of use.  I will say, however, I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t see dry patches forming on my skin any longer.  If for no other reason, I&#x27;ll probably continue using this product (if on sale).  Now, if I see overall skin improvement with even tone and fewer fine lines....I&#x27;ll be hooked for life.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks, now and I notice a different in my skin, and fine lines seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product does make a difference, and not only will I continue to use it, but highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I bought a bottle for my friend to try in a playful exchange of one-upmanship.</li>
            <li> I have been using this during the day and have notice the skin below my eyes and along my cheekbones is smoother. Quick shipper although the pump mechanism could be better.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands of hyaluronic acid before, but this one is perhaps the only one that works.&lt;br /&gt;It does give immediate effect, soon after is used it smoothness lines on the skin and gives a very nice appearance.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quite fast and does not leave any  residues.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with this product and will for sure buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It seems to work well.  I will have a better idea of how well it works when I&#x27;ve used it for the 60 days that is suggested.</li>
            <li> Product has made very visible improvements in wrinkles and small lines around my eyes especially. Also, my skin tone is more even. My husband actually cmmented that I look&amp;#34;more rested&amp;#34; and I was not even wearing make up.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly reccommend this product</li>
            <li> Only been using for just over a week and my husband commented yesterday &amp;#34;You are looking so good, you have a glow.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am using this product inconjunction with the derma roller.  I chose it based on the reviews of the derma roller that I read. It is too soon to judge its effectiveness. I will be better able to evaluate it in 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and I love it! My face is much smoother and so radiant! I love it and have just ordered more!</li>
            <li> 5 stars, You can&#x27;t get better than that! I searched out this product and ordered for my wife who is 70 . No this isn&#x27;t the fountain of youth, but we do live in a very harsh sunshine(desert southwest) and I felt this might soften some areas on her face that have been exposed for years. She likes the product and thinks it seems to tighten those areas. We&#x27;re well pleased.</li>
            <li> Love it, face is alot more firm.</li>
            <li> Love it! I even have my husband and a few co-workers using it now.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product</li>
            <li> Product delivered as promised now to see if it helps</li>
            <li> Arrived timely as described. Too soon to tell if actually helpful</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days and already noticed a difference as to brow lines (that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called, right?) and overall firmness of my face. I&#x27;m 31 years old and recently have been noticing how much I&#x27;ve aged in the last few years...too much too quickly! This stuff already makes me feel that hope is not lost. There are certainly cheaper brands of this stuff out there but who knows what&#x27;s in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I plan to use the whole bottle, but at this point I don&#x27;t see any great results.  Further, it is not hydrating enough for my skin so I have to use another night cream over it.</li>
            <li> Sucks, if you ask me it dries out my face!!!</li>
            <li> Really great product. Can be a little drying, so I use it right before I moisturize.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my cousin&#x27;s birthday and she loved it! she said she feels her skin very soft and healthier and it really looks different. Great quality product!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It goes on really silky and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  I use it at night and in the morning.  I put my moisturizer on after using the serum day and night and it really enhances the absorption on my skin.  Nice of part of routine.  Makeup goes on much more smoothly and looks more finished.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the product was too strong for my skin.  On the positive side the company did contact me and tried to help me and had several suggestions, all of which did not help.  I just could not use the product.  however they never once suggested I return the product so beware, it is strong stuff and make my face swell for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I would recommend this product. Is very tacky and drying. Not what I expected. Will see about returning this.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I have been using it for over a year.  I believe it has helped my face tremendously with fine lines in tightening the my skin.  Moisturizer and foundation go over it this product so nicely.  I would recommend me this product to others thinking about ordering this product.    Did the job for me.</li>
            <li> Expected a 2oz bottle, but arrived as a 1oz bottle, perhaps I missed some small print on quantity, but works great</li>
            <li> Serum liquid turns YELLOW after 2 weeks. I bought 2, and while waiting for 1 to be finish, I stored another one in my cabinet, away from the sun. 2 weeks later i look at it, the liquid has turn to a weird yellow color. Tried email customer support of Nicci Marie but got no response or help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please copy &amp; paste these links into your browser to see the yellow discolor in a brand new, unopened bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://i.imgur.com/pDB9EdI.jpg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://i.imgur.com/kNWxC9n.jpg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Got a replacement bottle. Good customer service from Nicci Marie.</li>
            <li> I used for 5 days, it does not work with me. My skin is so dry and itchy. So me how to return it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for only ten days and can see the dark spots beginning to lighten and a general evening of the skin color. I will continue to use and report back in a month.</li>
            <li> Great transaction. No problems.</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This serim is very good</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  My face actually feels smoother, and softer and looks brighter and young.  I have been using for approximately one week- two times a day and my only concern is that it will finish too soon.</li>
            <li> I noticed a visible difference within days</li>
            <li> IT DRY MY SKIN OUT&lt;br /&gt;QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all with this product.  I actually ordered it by accident.  (Don&#x27;t ask me how, I still haven&#x27;t figured that one out yet!)  Anyway, I decided as long as I got it, I might as well try it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now &amp; I&#x27;m just not impressed, AT ALL.  ISN&#x27;T WORTH THE PRICE, THAT&#x27;S FOR SURE!!</li>
            <li> The product does what it says it will for a reasonable price. It is a little harsh for super sensitive skin. I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product.I did a full product review on my you tube channel. .I love the packaging of this product. .All skin types can definitely use this..I myself am doing a giveaway in my you tube channel for this product it definitely worth the price..</li>
            <li> This  is a great anti wrinkle cream it leaves you skin soft and smooth and helps to reduce wrinkles . Added bonus it has all the added vitamins in it . I would recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Did not experience appreciable difference from cheaper products.</li>
            <li> Still using to see if it works.  Have seen a slight improvement, but needs more time.</li>
            <li> i was super excited about this, what with the dr oz endorsement and all, but to be honest i really am not impressed yet. it had a decent price- affordable but not so cheap that you wonder if its any good (although price really doesnt determine effectiveness ; one of my favorite beauty products of all time, select lash, only cost 3 bucks!) but the packaging is kinda shoddy, im not crazy about the smell, and it arrived leaking or something because the bottles all gooey. and i really havent noticed any kind of change in my skin whatsoever. i realize i haven&#x27;t had it very long, but i have used products,  like the emu oil airbrush eyecream, that i literally saw instant results. i really wanted to love this, but unfortunately so far im just not a fan. fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It suits me just fine.  I feel I got a great deal on this product because other products on the market with the same ingredients are too expensive for me to buy .  No need. I found your good product and the price was right!</li>
            <li> Just started using it but am convinced it will work great.  It is loaded with things I looked for and now with things I don&#x27;t want such as toxins.  So far I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Serum arrived quickly in a nice bottle with a smooth acting pump. I use before bedtime and saw results within a week. It&#x27;s very light and non greasy. Very nice product that seems to work, especially for diminishing crow&#x27;s feet. I  have used this product for about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great Serum. I use it every morning and I can feel the slight tightness of the cream.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for my skin. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase and delivery.Even better is the product it&#x27;s self. It&#x27;s so amazing. It starts to work instantly. I literally looked ten years younger in seconds. Ordered a second bottle. Not even half empty on the first one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 11 weeks and you can definetley tell my skin is improving. I feel it was definetley worth the money paid. I first was my face, put on the serum, I then put on my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used Vitamin serums A D E and C always on my face !!! NOW I can have them all in one !!! Love it...noticed improvement in 2 DAYS ~</li>
            <li> This a great product.  People compliment me on my conplextion so I know this product works.</li>
            <li> I love face creams, and I love to weed out the good from the bad. When I got an amazing opportunity to try the Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Nicci Marie Skincare, I was more than overjoyed. I got the cream and was so excited to try it. First off this smells so good, its like a spring spa in a jar, MMMmmmmmm, and its like pure silk when you are rubbing it on your face. Within a few days I could already feel my face getting softer, I cant wait for what the next few weeks will hold for me!! Thank you for making a skin cream that stands up to what it says!</li>
            <li> it is a forgettable product.  I didn&#x27;t notice any results and the serum was very thin and watery comparing to others.  I paid over $24 which was over paid.</li>
            <li> It is proving very helpful.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Highly Recommend it.  Our skin needs Hyaluronic Acid and this serum goes on smoothly and it has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Was shipped in timely manner and price wasn&#x27;t bad but so far product doesn&#x27;t work as advertised, could just take longer then a few weeks i don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> This serum is the first thing I use after I wash my face/neck. Just a 2-3 small pumps creates a perfect canvas. When I first put it on, I felt an instant tightening effect.  And as I continue to use it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has a much smoother, more supple texture. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and contains all the right ingredients to keep me looking young and ageless!</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it after a few minutes of drying it instantly soften my face and neck.  I&#x27;m waiting to see more results with the wrinkles on my lower eyelids. But overall I would recommend this for you people that have dry skin.!</li>
            <li> I do not notice any difference to date.  It makes my skin  feel a little dry.  The amount of serum is small compared to the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m liking this serum a lot. Seems to be decreasing the  wrinkles already around my chest and allover my face😊</li>
            <li> The serum is very light, not too thick and spreads on the face easily.  After the first use I could feel my skin tightening.  Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Like most Hyaluronic Acid serum on the market, this worked as expected. What I like about this particular product is that it has a combination of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3  and Vitamin E; all works wonders on your skin to improve appearance and restore elasticity, not to mention reduce the appearance of fine lines. The Vitamin C is probably my favorite aspect of this product. It improves my skin&#x27;s tone by making it brighter and less dull. Leaves my skin looking clear, vibrant and feeling smoother. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. As product tester, I purchased this product on a promo. My reviews are based on my own personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product and will recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> This is my second order. I love this, it does wonders</li>
            <li> WOW!!this is amazing stuff...I have been using this for four days twice a day morning and night..my hubby of 12 yrs came up and says your face looks so pretty..if he noticed and comment on it..ladies you know it&#x27;s working.I just ordered two more bottles.I&#x27;m not running out of this amazing stuff..try it</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any serum out there that will work on fine lines or the &#x27;11s&#x27; between my brow.</li>
            <li> I turned 40 over the summer and was noticing wrinkles around my eyes and forehead therefore I have purchased several Anti-Wrinkle creams/serums/lotions ranging in price from $10 upwards of $100s’ of dollars and I am pleasantly surprised to notice a difference in just 2 weeks using Nicci Marie Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I recommend this product, It Works MAGIC. I can’t wait for my husband to start using it BUT unfortunately He’ll have to wait for his bottle being that I love mine so much I am not willing to share it lol He works in construction and I can’t wait to see his results…I shall keep you posted. TRY this product the only thing I’ve lost was wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is the best product i have found so far and the price is affordable.</li>
            <li> I use the skin care every night. I am nearly 70 and look 50. My pores do not exist, my skin is not wrinkled I do have a turkey neck. I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> So far this item lives up to it description.  Will report later after using it for at least one month</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if its working but feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> I live in cold, dry skin Alaska and have been relying on hyaluronic acid serums to keep my skin supple for a few years and I love this product.  Make sure to wash face, dry hands and just a quick towel pat on your face before you spread this on as you Need the moisture for the Hyaluronif acid to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unproperly cared for i have dry, sensitive, Yucky skin and thid is one of my new staples for my current supple, happy skin :D  (ps when people (Mom!) take notice of the improvement they will want to steal your bottle, but two!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference</li>
            <li> great serum at much less cost than dept. store brands</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom after reading all the rave reviews. She already has a pure Hyalurnonic Acid product but this peaked my curiosity. With all the benefits of the added ingredients plus Hyalurnonic Acid, I had to get it for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one month, she&#x27;s provided me her impressions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing she stated is that unlike her old product, she&#x27;s used this gel minus moisturizer in the daytime with no issues. As we all know Hyalurnonic Acid is NOT a moisturizer and you can wind up with an ashy. This is very common when it&#x27;s not followed up with another cream. Amazingly however, this did not occur with this product. Her makeup also goes on easily over it which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also likes the fact that a little goes a long way and the dispenser ensures you don&#x27;t waste the serum. So far, she feels it&#x27;s helping her reduce some rough spots that she has from pimples. (We have very oily skin in our family). Additionally, she states that she loves how it seems to be reducing pore size and smoothing her overall skin appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will certainly be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Product has separated due to how old it is.</li>
            <li> Outstanding moisturizer cream that really makes a difference on your skin! The combination of vitamins along with hyaluronic acid is a potent regeneration complex. A little dab goes a long way so this bottle does last. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Tried other types of serums like Neutrogena, it irritated my skin.  This is the best product for me, no irritation, no break outs.</li>
            <li> Made in the USA is a great incentive to try this product. I like the consistency- not greasy and effective. Noticed a difference in my skin- great product.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best product I have ever used.  I am 65 years old and have tried other things, including dermatologist appointments, but nothing has worked as well as this product.  My skin is fresher and younger looking.  I greatly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would not make my face red, and peeling.  But it did just that.  I am still going to use it once a week to see how my skin can cope. I hope after a couple of weeks, the reaction will be better, and my skin will look better.</li>
            <li> I have not see a difference, but I wll give it more time&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> This is the first, of many, products I have purchased that truly does what it says it will do.  I am very pleased to write that I have used for 3 weeks now and have re-ordered this product.  For once, what was written was true.  My face has definitely lifted and seems firmer than before using this product.  My jaw line has lifted and the lines have diminished.  Good product!  Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I have use it for one month. I have seen very little chance in my face. But I will try it one more month.</li>
