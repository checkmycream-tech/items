    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Happy shopping!</li>
            <li>yet they continue to market it as something wonderful.</li>
            <li>so I was impressed by</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is great mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling great and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal.</li>
            <li>Mint Pro-Health has a very nice minty taste.</li>
            <li>Good buy and great product</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health mouthwash was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>This is a pleasant, minty flavored product that does a good job and won&#x27;t leave you gagging.</li>
            <li>I think that fits all the criterion of a good mouth wash.</li>
            <li>Loved the shape of the bottle and the design</li>
            <li>I figured it would be a good idea to expand out  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>The bottle is attractive and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>you love Listerine, then this might be a good option for you.  </li>
            <li>This would be perfect for someone who wants a stronger mouthwash.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash tastes good and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not at overpowering as Listerine, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pull any kind of mint taste out of this mouthwash at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then this is absolutely the best product.</li>
            <li>While my mouth did feel good after use the taste / odor is just too strong for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>Also, the mouthwash burn sensation is very strong with this formula, and I&#x27;m guessing if my mouth wasn&#x27;t so numbed by it, the burn would probably feel even stronger.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is perfect for those who like that clean mouth feeling without too much intensity--indeed, this is a best of both worlds product that leaves the mouth feeling great for a long period of time without any burn.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, close your browser and run far away for the sake of delicious food and your tongues nerve endings.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash seems to do the job of a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice sized bottle, and once you get used to it, it works fine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn feeling that most mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it does its cleaning job.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My kids with braces love it.</li>
            <li>Preferred Mart where I know for sure they have been involved has a 50/50 chance, but again this is my experience.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it is still on the market with so many complaints.</li>
            <li>Stopped when I noticed brown stains on most of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Like it a lot more than  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>This is okay, but it didn&#x27;t change my mind.</li>
            <li>you prefer possibly fresher breath at the cost of not tasting anything, then I guess this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>and really is able to cut through the germs that cause halitosis.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, however, I know I will reap the benefits in better checkups at the dentist.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t even want to give this product a 1 star but wasn&#x27;t sure if I could write a commit if I didn&#x27;t put a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it feels like it&#x27;s workijg to make my mouth healthy.</li>
            <li>Although, this is not my favorite mouthwash.</li>
            <li>That being said, this mouthwash worked OK for me.</li>
            <li>Do you know what those &amp;#34;flying chunks&amp;#34; many reviewers describe are?</li>
            <li>I have been using the Crest Pro-Health line for a while now, both toothpaste and mouthwash in the Multi-Protection/alcohol free line, and have really liked how clean my teeth are after using the products.  </li>
            <li>uneducated bias is that alcohol based mouth rinses kill germs better than alcohol free ones.</li>
            <li>I also discovered that it keeps inside cheek bites from becoming canker sores -- you know when you accidentally bite the inside of your cheek</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced any staining but will be on the lookout.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just super strong in flavor!</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy the Listerine alcohol free mouth wash much better.</li>
            <li>This is a bit stronger than that, but not as strong as Listerine.  </li>
            <li>It does contain some alcohol, so it has a bit of a Listerine-like bite--which I happen to like--but it&#x27;s not as strong or medicinal-tasting as Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tastes OK, is not overpowering, and leaves my breath fresh, while not with a strong, medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>like it fine, and if it were on sale and my fave Listerine wasn&#x27;t available, I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
            <li>Its smooth and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It not only tastes great, but works well.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping to use it as a mouthwash, as you&#x27;d assume one would do, and experienced similar burning, numbing, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bizarre, but it seems to work</li>
            <li>It has a fresh minty taste that is refreshing.</li>
            <li>B008R7CPUQ Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint Flavor Rinse]] which seems to cause cotton mouth.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a great mouthwash, but since then have moved back to Listerine.</li>
            <li>So, if you are using an alcohol free mouthwash, you are using an antimicrobial.</li>
            <li>and that is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>Alcohol Free 18-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the astringency</li>
            <li>It just feels more intense and refreshing, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked this up elsewhere, and a lot of people have experienced these problems, as well as others who&#x27;ve experienced dramatic staining on their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>when i first started using this product i liked it because it didn&#x27;t have that intenseness like listering, but my mouth felt fresh for hours, then i took a bite of an oreo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; that come out when you spit up is either tainted saliva or plague.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so satisfying to see it haha!</li>
            <li>the alcohol free cool wintergreen mouth rinse by</li>
            <li>It is gradually getting better, but I believe this is much more than an allergic reaction to the product, as many others have had the same issues.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean and fresh after using this product!</li>
            <li>am a \\&quot;clean freak\\&quot; when it comes to my teeth</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash 500 Ml (Pack of 2)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my teeth feel clean throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>Invigorating Clean Mint is one of Crest&#x27;s stronger mouthwash products.</li>
            <li>you want your teeth to be clean after you use mouthwash?</li>
            <li>I think this has a better, though strong flavor (spearminty), though still not something I love swishing (especially not for the full 30 seconds that is recommended on the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The flavor of a minty super clean mouth lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It can be intense at times, but it is ultimately rewarding.</li>
            <li>It tastes good and seems to do its basic job of making your mouth</li>
            <li>Also note that you are supposed to swish for a full minute to get the benefits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not use more then a teaspoon, I did and it burned my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>mouth doesn&#x27;t feel fresh and clean after I use this Crest Pro Health Invigorating Clean Mint.</li>
            <li>from the obvious benefit of having very good breadth after using Crest I have noticed that this has pretty much eliminated the irksome condition referred to on tv as &#x27;morning mouth&#x27; which makes me feel like someone used Gorilla Glue to affix my tongue to the roof of my mouth when I awake in the morning.</li>
            <li>Leaves mouth feeling clean and breath fresh.</li>
            <li>Gives a fresh, clean minty sensation.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my teeth felt clean and my breath felt fresh.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really burn much, either, which is nice.</li>
            <li>However, a few days ago I (for some reason) thought it was a good idea to use as a sink cleaner, and my sink has never looked better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, I just wanted to use a product that prevented me from offending anyone, that would leave my breadth fresh, and generally left my mouth feeling good.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product in an effort to improve my oral hygiene, and I regret it tremendously.</li>
            <li>When Crest&#x27;s pro-health line first came out and was recommended heartily to my husband by his dentist because of it&#x27;s alcohol-free nature, I felt that all Pro-health products would be alcohol free, but this one is not.</li>
            <li>But this flavor is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Nor interested!</li>
            <li>This substance, while popular in dental preparations is also used in insecticides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only experienced a slight numbing of my tongue.</li>
            <li>so I can have fresh breath</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning and evening after brushing, flossing and rinsing, and it does seem to keep my breath fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li>My son and husband are the mouthwash users, they both like the product, but it would be nice if these came in a larger size.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my breadth fresh smelling and my mouth feels fresh and my mouth feels</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of religious when it comes to flossing, brushing and mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>I also had a fresh feel to it.</li>
            <li>I switched to the standard flavor which they sell at Costco and while not as nice as the Night flavor, I do like it.</li>
            <li>Unlike Listerine, this has a fresh taste and isn&#x27;t too over powering to use.</li>
            <li>The fresh taste lasts for a while</li>
            <li>Unless it kind of initially hurts, it doesn&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li>The taste is also, let me think of the right word, \\&quot;nasty\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will cost time and over $200 to fix if you want to fix right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that can cut through things like garlic and onions and leaves your breath super minty and fresh for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>if you enjoy tasting the foods you eat, then i would strongly recommend fiding a different mouthwash!</li>
            <li>It does remind me a bit of Listermint, which I&#x27;ve used in the past and been happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Crest is good, and the freshness does last a decent amount of time, but my generic is just feels like it does a better job for me.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;invigorating&#x27; aspect of this mouthwash is the alcohol, which does have that sort of tingling/burning feeling some people really like from other washes, most notably Listerine.  </li>
            <li>I really like Crest Pro Health mouthwash!  </li>
            <li>but my food tasted funny all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last time I checked, mouthwash is supposed to be refreshing and not supposed to leave numbing metallicy taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Every time I use this, I spit out chunks that don&#x27;t come out when I swig water - and they&#x27;re dyed BRIGHT GREEN.</li>
            <li>There is a definite \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling granting power to the invigorating claim, and the taste is quite respectable.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact of being able to buy a double quantity.</li>
            <li>But even though this one is better, I still prefer my Up&amp;Up Listerine generic.</li>
            <li>That is always the first thing that I think about when buying a mouthwash product is the aftertaste.</li>
            <li>However, I am pretty concerned with the warning labels.  </li>
            <li>more is used than for rinsing is swallowed, call poison control or seek medical help</li>
            <li>Of all of the Crest Pro-Health mouthwashes that I have tried, and I have tried several, this one is easily my favorite.</li>
            <li>So I tried this in the hopes of securing the same benefits in a more tasty concotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It ruined my taste buds and made my tongue feel funny for about 16 hours when I used it.</li>
            <li>All I know is that I am so glad Amazon has this on subscribe and save, so I&#x27;ll always have enough stock for an after-meal swish.</li>
            <li>This is the Crest Pro-Health product with alcohol, so it is the most similar to what I am accustomed to with Listerine.</li>
            <li>i figured that it was just because it was the first time i used it</li>
            <li>What turned me off most about this product is the flavor; after rinsing I feel like I have the taste of a rubber glove from the dentist left over.  </li>
            <li>The freshness seems to last a little better than most alcohol free mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>The next day after I used this I noticed a waxy, scratchy sensation in my mouth and wasn&#x27;t able to taste much of anything.</li>
            <li>I will most likely stick with that line as I just really didn&#x27;t like the flavor of this one and don&#x27;t always like the &#x27;invigorating&#x27; tingle this wash has.</li>
            <li>alcohol content is something I&#x27;d not seen in such a strong dosage.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is fairly strong, and definitely minty.</li>
            <li>With Listerine I always felt like the product was just so strong it masked any mouth odor with a medicinal smell, rather than actually freshened breath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The initial taste is fine when you are swishing it around your mouth</li>
            <li>What I liked about this particular mouthwash over other brands, particularly Listerine, is that the &#x27;invigorating&#x27; tingling that you get from this wash isn&#x27;t overpowering nor is it practically unbearable as those others can be.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Four days ago I purchased a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Oral Rinse and it has been an absolute nightmare</li>
            <li>swear it helps them keep their braces cleaner without so much crud building up.</li>
            <li>The cover is one of the squeeze and turn varieties and did not require a degree in advanced engineering to open.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much faith in the FDA (or any governmental agency for that matter).</li>
            <li>so my dentist really wants me to use some sort of dental rinse.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like the flavor as much as I did when I tried</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can testify to the fact that it burns when gargling with it, straight, and so it&#x27;s just like Listerine.</li>
            <li>and sometimes it develops into a sore -- and helps the bite heal fast.</li>
            <li>eat breakfast about 20 minutes after swishing with this rinse and brushing my teeth and it really throws my taste buds off.  </li>
            <li>Cleans all around and without intense burning.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if the CREST PRO-HEALTH INVIGORATING CLEAN MINT MOUTHWASH lives up to its claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The truth is my oral health is good due to frequent cleanings and standard dentist visits.</li>
            <li>This particular order arrived in time as promised.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it is still being sold because there are literally thousands of complaints out there about similar pain and/or brown staining of the teeth (which I luckily didn&#x27;t experience).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mouthwash in particular does stain your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is not permanent or harmful and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental</li>
            <li>The alcohol is what is INVIGORATING about this particular mint flavor.</li>
            <li>The flavor is fairly decent, and I can feel it working during my one-minute sloshing</li>
            <li>think the mouthwash is fine, and I don&#x27;t have any reason at all to recommend it any less or any more highly than other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>I purchased these from Amazon at a great price, almost half of what I would pay for two at a typical retail store.</li>
            <li>This is less intense than the Listerine mouthwashes, but still too strong for me.</li>
            <li>, after using this I could not taste anything, a strange feeling but not necessarily bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I usually do not like mouthwashes with alcohol content, but this one is decent.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, put it back on the shelf and run away.  </li>
            <li>While there may be some mouthwashes that are not as strong in taste, I have also found those to not work as well (on average).  </li>
            <li>This is the new trend in mouthwash.</li>
            <li>It offers fresh breath without that burning sensation you are used to from traditional brands like Listerine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of obsessed about having fresh breath.</li>
            <li>I always feel like my mouth is fresh for a really long time when I use this.</li>
            <li>I just tried Crest Pro-Health mouthwash for the first time without knowing about its extensive history of consumer complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Look at the most recent reviews of this stuff - I don&#x27;t know, maybe they changed their formula, but all the recent reviewers seem to have the same problems I have.</li>
            <li>This product is not like the Pro-Health mouthwash I usually use, this one is more like Listerine.  </li>
            <li>Something I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed it with most other versions of Crest mouthwashes, and definitely don&#x27;t recall ever having a numbing issue when using Scope.</li>
            <li>Starting having a similar problem as another reviewer, where I would be spitting out chunks of bright green stuff.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash has a stronger mint flavor than some of the other Crest mouthwashes but it still leaves a bit of an aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>For those after-meal snackers out there, this is a mouthwash that sort of &amp;#34;forces&amp;#34; you not to mindlessly snack, because of the strong mint aftertaste.</li>
            <li>True, a little bit of bug poison probably won&#x27;t cause you any permanent harm, but why risk it when there are other non-toxic alternatives available?</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t sensitive</li>
            <li>Far, far away.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re sensitive, you probably won&#x27;t like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff makes your mouth burn.</li>
            <li>The package warns of the most common side effect, to wit, browning of teeth, which they claim can be removed by additional brushing or a dental visit(for</li>
            <li>It is truly more of a tingling than a burning sensation, or was for me at least.  </li>
            <li>thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope).</li>
            <li>The taste sticks with me for the whole day which is supposed to be a good thing, except my tongue is numb and I cannot taste my food.</li>
            <li>I last used the rinse several days ago (nearly a week now I believe) and food still does not taste right, and I seem to have something almost like a chemical burn on the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li>That is paraphrased, but the awkward syntax is pretty true to the original.  </li>
            <li>I tend to like non-alcohol mouthwashes, like Listerine, since I usually find them too strong and medicinal tasting.  </li>
            <li>This version has alcohol but has the same active ingredient as the alcohol free version.</li>
            <li>despite the green coloring of this product, it is nothing like a wintergreen variation of the clean mint taste.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s powerful flavor and long lasting minty freshness.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now mostly back to normal</li>
            <li>Took about 5 days to return to normal so tried it again and found the same thing.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if I will ever get the color of my teeth back to normal.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal user of Listerine Total Care which is effective but does have an unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had any problems with the mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build in my mouth, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband, who uses it several times a day.</li>
            <li>a week later i decided to stop using it until my taste buds were back to normal, it has now been a week with no mouthwash, and i can still barely taste anything!</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of Crest Pro Health products and generally like them, but I prefer their alcohol-free formulas.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, my breath did feel fresher in the morning when using it before bed compared to using Listerine, but the weird aftertaste remained in my mouth throughout the day, even after brushing in the morning and eating two meals!</li>
            <li>Seems alright at first but after a while it will start staining your teeth dark yellow.</li>
            <li>, after having used this product twice a day for four days, there is consistent pain and slight swelling on the inside of both cheeks along with a throbbing pain in my lower left jaw.</li>
            <li>It is an antiinfective frequently used as a preservative in pharmaceutical preparations, a topical cleanser and a local anesthetic found in products such as Cepacol.</li>
            <li>The first few bites of food or sips of drink after using this product are not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I woke up my tongue was painful and swollen, the front of the top half much like what happens when you attempt to ingest freshly brewed coffee, but the bottom is a different story all together...</li>
            <li>Stay far far away from this and all other Pro-Health products!</li>
            <li>Burns mouth/tongue and days might turn tongue white and whole mouth white and the bottom of the teeth dark yellow.</li>
            <li>Except now I don&#x27;t have to, thanks to this little guy.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> yet they continue to market it as something wonderful.</li>
            <li> so I was impressed by</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is great mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling great and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Mint Pro-Health has a very nice minty taste.</li>
            <li> Good buy and great product</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health mouthwash was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> This is a pleasant, minty flavored product that does a good job and won&#x27;t leave you gagging.</li>
            <li> I think that fits all the criterion of a good mouth wash.</li>
            <li> Loved the shape of the bottle and the design</li>
            <li> I figured it would be a good idea to expand out  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> The bottle is attractive and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> you love Listerine, then this might be a good option for you.  </li>
            <li> This would be perfect for someone who wants a stronger mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash tastes good and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not at overpowering as Listerine, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pull any kind of mint taste out of this mouthwash at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then this is absolutely the best product.</li>
            <li> While my mouth did feel good after use the taste / odor is just too strong for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> Also, the mouthwash burn sensation is very strong with this formula, and I&#x27;m guessing if my mouth wasn&#x27;t so numbed by it, the burn would probably feel even stronger.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is perfect for those who like that clean mouth feeling without too much intensity--indeed, this is a best of both worlds product that leaves the mouth feeling great for a long period of time without any burn.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, close your browser and run far away for the sake of delicious food and your tongues nerve endings.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash seems to do the job of a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice sized bottle, and once you get used to it, it works fine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn feeling that most mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it does its cleaning job.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My kids with braces love it.</li>
            <li> Preferred Mart where I know for sure they have been involved has a 50/50 chance, but again this is my experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is still on the market with so many complaints.</li>
            <li> Stopped when I noticed brown stains on most of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot more than  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> This is okay, but it didn&#x27;t change my mind.</li>
            <li> you prefer possibly fresher breath at the cost of not tasting anything, then I guess this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> and really is able to cut through the germs that cause halitosis.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, however, I know I will reap the benefits in better checkups at the dentist.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t even want to give this product a 1 star but wasn&#x27;t sure if I could write a commit if I didn&#x27;t put a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it feels like it&#x27;s workijg to make my mouth healthy.</li>
            <li> Although, this is not my favorite mouthwash.</li>
            <li> That being said, this mouthwash worked OK for me.</li>
            <li> Do you know what those &amp;#34;flying chunks&amp;#34; many reviewers describe are?</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro-Health line for a while now, both toothpaste and mouthwash in the Multi-Protection/alcohol free line, and have really liked how clean my teeth are after using the products.  </li>
            <li> uneducated bias is that alcohol based mouth rinses kill germs better than alcohol free ones.</li>
            <li> I also discovered that it keeps inside cheek bites from becoming canker sores -- you know when you accidentally bite the inside of your cheek</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced any staining but will be on the lookout.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just super strong in flavor!</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy the Listerine alcohol free mouth wash much better.</li>
            <li> This is a bit stronger than that, but not as strong as Listerine.  </li>
            <li> It does contain some alcohol, so it has a bit of a Listerine-like bite--which I happen to like--but it&#x27;s not as strong or medicinal-tasting as Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tastes OK, is not overpowering, and leaves my breath fresh, while not with a strong, medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> like it fine, and if it were on sale and my fave Listerine wasn&#x27;t available, I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
            <li> Its smooth and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It not only tastes great, but works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to use it as a mouthwash, as you&#x27;d assume one would do, and experienced similar burning, numbing, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bizarre, but it seems to work</li>
            <li> It has a fresh minty taste that is refreshing.</li>
            <li> B008R7CPUQ Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint Flavor Rinse]] which seems to cause cotton mouth.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great mouthwash, but since then have moved back to Listerine.</li>
            <li> So, if you are using an alcohol free mouthwash, you are using an antimicrobial.</li>
            <li> and that is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Alcohol Free 18-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the astringency</li>
            <li> It just feels more intense and refreshing, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked this up elsewhere, and a lot of people have experienced these problems, as well as others who&#x27;ve experienced dramatic staining on their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> when i first started using this product i liked it because it didn&#x27;t have that intenseness like listering, but my mouth felt fresh for hours, then i took a bite of an oreo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; that come out when you spit up is either tainted saliva or plague.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so satisfying to see it haha!</li>
            <li> the alcohol free cool wintergreen mouth rinse by</li>
            <li> It is gradually getting better, but I believe this is much more than an allergic reaction to the product, as many others have had the same issues.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean and fresh after using this product!</li>
            <li> am a \\&quot;clean freak\\&quot; when it comes to my teeth</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash 500 Ml (Pack of 2)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my teeth feel clean throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> Invigorating Clean Mint is one of Crest&#x27;s stronger mouthwash products.</li>
            <li> you want your teeth to be clean after you use mouthwash?</li>
            <li> I think this has a better, though strong flavor (spearminty), though still not something I love swishing (especially not for the full 30 seconds that is recommended on the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The flavor of a minty super clean mouth lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It can be intense at times, but it is ultimately rewarding.</li>
            <li> It tastes good and seems to do its basic job of making your mouth</li>
            <li> Also note that you are supposed to swish for a full minute to get the benefits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not use more then a teaspoon, I did and it burned my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> mouth doesn&#x27;t feel fresh and clean after I use this Crest Pro Health Invigorating Clean Mint.</li>
            <li> from the obvious benefit of having very good breadth after using Crest I have noticed that this has pretty much eliminated the irksome condition referred to on tv as &#x27;morning mouth&#x27; which makes me feel like someone used Gorilla Glue to affix my tongue to the roof of my mouth when I awake in the morning.</li>
            <li> Leaves mouth feeling clean and breath fresh.</li>
            <li> Gives a fresh, clean minty sensation.</li>
            <li> Afterwards my teeth felt clean and my breath felt fresh.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really burn much, either, which is nice.</li>
            <li> However, a few days ago I (for some reason) thought it was a good idea to use as a sink cleaner, and my sink has never looked better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, I just wanted to use a product that prevented me from offending anyone, that would leave my breadth fresh, and generally left my mouth feeling good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in an effort to improve my oral hygiene, and I regret it tremendously.</li>
            <li> When Crest&#x27;s pro-health line first came out and was recommended heartily to my husband by his dentist because of it&#x27;s alcohol-free nature, I felt that all Pro-health products would be alcohol free, but this one is not.</li>
            <li> But this flavor is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Nor interested!</li>
            <li> This substance, while popular in dental preparations is also used in insecticides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only experienced a slight numbing of my tongue.</li>
            <li> so I can have fresh breath</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning and evening after brushing, flossing and rinsing, and it does seem to keep my breath fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My son and husband are the mouthwash users, they both like the product, but it would be nice if these came in a larger size.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my breadth fresh smelling and my mouth feels fresh and my mouth feels</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of religious when it comes to flossing, brushing and mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> I also had a fresh feel to it.</li>
            <li> I switched to the standard flavor which they sell at Costco and while not as nice as the Night flavor, I do like it.</li>
            <li> Unlike Listerine, this has a fresh taste and isn&#x27;t too over powering to use.</li>
            <li> The fresh taste lasts for a while</li>
            <li> Unless it kind of initially hurts, it doesn&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li> The taste is also, let me think of the right word, \\&quot;nasty\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will cost time and over $200 to fix if you want to fix right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that can cut through things like garlic and onions and leaves your breath super minty and fresh for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> if you enjoy tasting the foods you eat, then i would strongly recommend fiding a different mouthwash!</li>
            <li> It does remind me a bit of Listermint, which I&#x27;ve used in the past and been happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Crest is good, and the freshness does last a decent amount of time, but my generic is just feels like it does a better job for me.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;invigorating&#x27; aspect of this mouthwash is the alcohol, which does have that sort of tingling/burning feeling some people really like from other washes, most notably Listerine.  </li>
            <li> I really like Crest Pro Health mouthwash!  </li>
            <li> but my food tasted funny all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last time I checked, mouthwash is supposed to be refreshing and not supposed to leave numbing metallicy taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this, I spit out chunks that don&#x27;t come out when I swig water - and they&#x27;re dyed BRIGHT GREEN.</li>
            <li> There is a definite \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling granting power to the invigorating claim, and the taste is quite respectable.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact of being able to buy a double quantity.</li>
            <li> But even though this one is better, I still prefer my Up&amp;Up Listerine generic.</li>
            <li> That is always the first thing that I think about when buying a mouthwash product is the aftertaste.</li>
            <li> However, I am pretty concerned with the warning labels.  </li>
            <li> more is used than for rinsing is swallowed, call poison control or seek medical help</li>
            <li> Of all of the Crest Pro-Health mouthwashes that I have tried, and I have tried several, this one is easily my favorite.</li>
            <li> So I tried this in the hopes of securing the same benefits in a more tasty concotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It ruined my taste buds and made my tongue feel funny for about 16 hours when I used it.</li>
            <li> All I know is that I am so glad Amazon has this on subscribe and save, so I&#x27;ll always have enough stock for an after-meal swish.</li>
            <li> This is the Crest Pro-Health product with alcohol, so it is the most similar to what I am accustomed to with Listerine.</li>
            <li> i figured that it was just because it was the first time i used it</li>
            <li> What turned me off most about this product is the flavor; after rinsing I feel like I have the taste of a rubber glove from the dentist left over.  </li>
            <li> The freshness seems to last a little better than most alcohol free mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> The next day after I used this I noticed a waxy, scratchy sensation in my mouth and wasn&#x27;t able to taste much of anything.</li>
            <li> I will most likely stick with that line as I just really didn&#x27;t like the flavor of this one and don&#x27;t always like the &#x27;invigorating&#x27; tingle this wash has.</li>
            <li> alcohol content is something I&#x27;d not seen in such a strong dosage.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is fairly strong, and definitely minty.</li>
            <li> With Listerine I always felt like the product was just so strong it masked any mouth odor with a medicinal smell, rather than actually freshened breath.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The initial taste is fine when you are swishing it around your mouth</li>
            <li> What I liked about this particular mouthwash over other brands, particularly Listerine, is that the &#x27;invigorating&#x27; tingling that you get from this wash isn&#x27;t overpowering nor is it practically unbearable as those others can be.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Four days ago I purchased a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Oral Rinse and it has been an absolute nightmare</li>
            <li> swear it helps them keep their braces cleaner without so much crud building up.</li>
            <li> The cover is one of the squeeze and turn varieties and did not require a degree in advanced engineering to open.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much faith in the FDA (or any governmental agency for that matter).</li>
            <li> so my dentist really wants me to use some sort of dental rinse.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like the flavor as much as I did when I tried</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can testify to the fact that it burns when gargling with it, straight, and so it&#x27;s just like Listerine.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it develops into a sore -- and helps the bite heal fast.</li>
            <li> eat breakfast about 20 minutes after swishing with this rinse and brushing my teeth and it really throws my taste buds off.  </li>
            <li> Cleans all around and without intense burning.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if the CREST PRO-HEALTH INVIGORATING CLEAN MINT MOUTHWASH lives up to its claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The truth is my oral health is good due to frequent cleanings and standard dentist visits.</li>
            <li> This particular order arrived in time as promised.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it is still being sold because there are literally thousands of complaints out there about similar pain and/or brown staining of the teeth (which I luckily didn&#x27;t experience).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mouthwash in particular does stain your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is not permanent or harmful and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental</li>
            <li> The alcohol is what is INVIGORATING about this particular mint flavor.</li>
            <li> The flavor is fairly decent, and I can feel it working during my one-minute sloshing</li>
            <li> think the mouthwash is fine, and I don&#x27;t have any reason at all to recommend it any less or any more highly than other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased these from Amazon at a great price, almost half of what I would pay for two at a typical retail store.</li>
            <li> This is less intense than the Listerine mouthwashes, but still too strong for me.</li>
            <li> , after using this I could not taste anything, a strange feeling but not necessarily bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I usually do not like mouthwashes with alcohol content, but this one is decent.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, put it back on the shelf and run away.  </li>
            <li> While there may be some mouthwashes that are not as strong in taste, I have also found those to not work as well (on average).  </li>
            <li> This is the new trend in mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It offers fresh breath without that burning sensation you are used to from traditional brands like Listerine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of obsessed about having fresh breath.</li>
            <li> I always feel like my mouth is fresh for a really long time when I use this.</li>
            <li> I just tried Crest Pro-Health mouthwash for the first time without knowing about its extensive history of consumer complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Look at the most recent reviews of this stuff - I don&#x27;t know, maybe they changed their formula, but all the recent reviewers seem to have the same problems I have.</li>
            <li> This product is not like the Pro-Health mouthwash I usually use, this one is more like Listerine.  </li>
            <li> Something I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed it with most other versions of Crest mouthwashes, and definitely don&#x27;t recall ever having a numbing issue when using Scope.</li>
            <li> Starting having a similar problem as another reviewer, where I would be spitting out chunks of bright green stuff.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash has a stronger mint flavor than some of the other Crest mouthwashes but it still leaves a bit of an aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> For those after-meal snackers out there, this is a mouthwash that sort of &amp;#34;forces&amp;#34; you not to mindlessly snack, because of the strong mint aftertaste.</li>
            <li> True, a little bit of bug poison probably won&#x27;t cause you any permanent harm, but why risk it when there are other non-toxic alternatives available?</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t sensitive</li>
            <li> Far, far away.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re sensitive, you probably won&#x27;t like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff makes your mouth burn.</li>
            <li> The package warns of the most common side effect, to wit, browning of teeth, which they claim can be removed by additional brushing or a dental visit(for</li>
            <li> It is truly more of a tingling than a burning sensation, or was for me at least.  </li>
            <li> thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope).</li>
            <li> The taste sticks with me for the whole day which is supposed to be a good thing, except my tongue is numb and I cannot taste my food.</li>
            <li> I last used the rinse several days ago (nearly a week now I believe) and food still does not taste right, and I seem to have something almost like a chemical burn on the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> That is paraphrased, but the awkward syntax is pretty true to the original.  </li>
            <li> I tend to like non-alcohol mouthwashes, like Listerine, since I usually find them too strong and medicinal tasting.  </li>
            <li> This version has alcohol but has the same active ingredient as the alcohol free version.</li>
            <li> despite the green coloring of this product, it is nothing like a wintergreen variation of the clean mint taste.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s powerful flavor and long lasting minty freshness.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now mostly back to normal</li>
            <li> Took about 5 days to return to normal so tried it again and found the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if I will ever get the color of my teeth back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal user of Listerine Total Care which is effective but does have an unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any problems with the mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build in my mouth, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband, who uses it several times a day.</li>
            <li> a week later i decided to stop using it until my taste buds were back to normal, it has now been a week with no mouthwash, and i can still barely taste anything!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of Crest Pro Health products and generally like them, but I prefer their alcohol-free formulas.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, my breath did feel fresher in the morning when using it before bed compared to using Listerine, but the weird aftertaste remained in my mouth throughout the day, even after brushing in the morning and eating two meals!</li>
            <li> Seems alright at first but after a while it will start staining your teeth dark yellow.</li>
            <li> , after having used this product twice a day for four days, there is consistent pain and slight swelling on the inside of both cheeks along with a throbbing pain in my lower left jaw.</li>
            <li> It is an antiinfective frequently used as a preservative in pharmaceutical preparations, a topical cleanser and a local anesthetic found in products such as Cepacol.</li>
            <li> The first few bites of food or sips of drink after using this product are not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I woke up my tongue was painful and swollen, the front of the top half much like what happens when you attempt to ingest freshly brewed coffee, but the bottom is a different story all together...</li>
            <li> Stay far far away from this and all other Pro-Health products!</li>
            <li> Burns mouth/tongue and days might turn tongue white and whole mouth white and the bottom of the teeth dark yellow.</li>
            <li> Except now I don&#x27;t have to, thanks to this little guy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, my whole mouth goes numb - not in that clean minty way, but in an I-can&#x27;t-taste-food-for-hours way.</li>
            <li> Third day the bleeding is finally going down so far it&#x27;s been 3 hours</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m mentioning this because this particular mouthwash is one of the few in the Crest Pro-Health line that is an antiseptic (CONTAINS ALCOHOL) mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The pack of two means it will last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not generally a fan of alcohol-based mouthwashes, because I think they&#x27;re drying.</li>
            <li> try to be careful about Crest mouth rinse products touching my tongue, because of the horribly lingering effects I experienced while using the Fresh Mint variety; this one has the same effect, though not as bad...</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m sure the other reviewers did experience something, whether it was a bad batch or a personal reaction, it does raise some issues about the product that would probably set me off of getting this particular variation of Pro-Health again.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how many stars I would give for a product that is soooooooooo harmful and dangerous for any human being.</li>
            <li> I actually haven&#x27;t bought this product on Amazon, but feel that the negative reviews are really off-base.</li>
            <li> My major concern is with this product&#x27;s active ingredient, cetylpyridium chloride.</li>
            <li> How this product is still on the market I don&#x27;t know, because I can find similar complaints dating back to 2007 with other Pro-Health products.</li>
            <li> If you like the experience of having your mouth chemically burned and being unable to enjoy food after use, then by all means, rinse away.</li>
            <li> Not just minor discomfort.</li>
            <li> The next day the pain finally went down but my tongue was peeling and had cuts around it.</li>
            <li> I read on other reviews that others have had the same problem, I just can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to figure out that it was the mouthwash causing these problems!</li>
            <li> This does not exacerbate my dry mouth or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> 10% alcohol in the stuff because the regular mouth wash I use has 20% alcohol and gives me only a few seconds of burning that stops immediately as soon as I spit it out).  </li>
            <li> Not only do I have the same problem as others have mentioned (spitting out green \\&quot;chunks\\&quot; after use)</li>
            <li> It seems to me that my dentist told me a while back that this product can stain teeth, but I am thinking it was the blue Pro-Health product that people were having trouble with.</li>
            <li> I also developed a thick coating on my tongue and the entire inside of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The bottom half feels like someone is squeezing habanero pepper juice on it constantly, and because of this I can&#x27;t fall asleep because the moment the bottom of my tongue hits the bottom of my mouth, I&#x27;m in EXCRUCIATING pain.</li>
            <li> I have receding gums and have already noticed a cleaner, fresher, and less red gum line.</li>
            <li> Typical corporate greed, way to go P &amp; G!</li>
            <li> Positive reviews are likely just fake ones.</li>
            <li> I started noticing brown spots on my teeth a little while back and couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews for this product are head shakingly bad.</li>
            <li> Even after a few hours, I still feel like I just brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> so I knew it wasn&#x27;t cavities, but I never would&#x27;ve expected it was my mouthwash.</li>
            <li> For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead, to create the mouthwashes green color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My experience was that the taste is too bitter</li>
            <li> use a lot of Crest products including a few different mouthwashes, but this is one I won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> I cannot say it enough, this is a HORRIBLE mouthwash, but I&#x27;m keeping it around because it&#x27;s a damn good bathroom cleaner.</li>
            <li> Seriously: after just a 20 or 30 second swish, you&#x27;re done until the next meal.</li>
            <li> Last night I had a pretty bad tooth ache, and in my frustration I ran to the bathroom and swished some of this stuff until the feeling left.</li>
            <li> I have tried this particular Clean Mint from both the grocery (1 liter) and Amazon (500 mL) and have not experienced the numb feeling others have noted nor the lack of tastebuds.</li>
            <li> as listed in other comments.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and went back to my usual mouthwash this morning but decided to check online to see if there are any complaints about the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash.</li>
            <li> other ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I had already tried 2 other flavors of Crest Pro-Health after my dentist recommended I switch mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pro-Health, on the other hand, freshens my breath, but the tingling sensation and taste afterward is milder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wears off but frankly I am not willing to risk the other side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen that with other mouthwashes, too, but tinted whatever color the mouthwash was tinted.</li>
            <li> Later that day I was bleeding blood out of my mouth and nose small amounts 6 times every hour</li>
            <li> and I only spit 3 small drops of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stronger taste than other crest rinses.</li>
            <li> I purchased Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Mouth Wash and am extremely upset.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a little worried about putting anything into my mouth that could cause me to call a poison center.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in this situation, try sucking really hard on a piece of candy toward the back of your mouth, or gargling with some sort of carbonated soda.</li>
            <li> I have called both the phone numbers on the back of the bottle and complained to them with my symptoms.  </li>
            <li> It was not a fun experience.</li>
            <li> Performancewise it is average.</li>
            <li> Not really worth</li>
            <li> I accidentally stumbled across a new diet plan: this mouthwash is so horrible that it numbs your tastebuds for literally days and makes it so you don&#x27;t enjoy eating food.</li>
            <li> but after you spit it out it is down hill.</li>
            <li> but it all boils down to taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a few other have mentioned, there does seem to be a bit of a numbing effect to using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This delivers as advertised - and like typical mouthwash, it&#x27;s \\&quot;invigorating,\\&quot; from the alcohol.</li>
            <li> But - it&#x27;s the typical mouthwash burn, so</li>
            <li> when just used half of the recommended amount it was just too strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it anyway, and it had a slight burning sensation (not even close to Listerine) and bubbly effect.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right...when there is less chunks flying out of your mouth and it doesn&#x27;t burn as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After finding many blog cites with other horror stories from people who have used this terrible product, one person wrote that her oral surgeon told her to mix one part children&#x27;s liquid benyadryl and one part Malox (or some liquid anti-acid product), then swish it around in your mouth for as long as you can.  </li>
            <li> I was also puzzled by the dark green pieces of what looked like shavings from a pencil eraser when I spit it out.</li>
            <li> This stuff will mess your mouth up.</li>
            <li> I consider green Scope to be the average, run-of-the-mill mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> The liquid is green and flavorwise is somehwat minty and less assertive than Listerine.</li>
            <li> No fun having brown teeth!</li>
            <li> feel a little cleaner.</li>
            <li> If you are used to a burning mouthwash, this does take a little time to get used to.</li>
            <li> I like a little burn, makes it feel like its working</li>
            <li> The little floaters (whatever they&#x27;re supposed to be) didn&#x27;t bother me, but for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out what they&#x27;re supposed to be doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> used it only one time and ever since then my tongue has been burning - and I mean excruciating burning!  </li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with gingivitis a few years ago and have been having a lot of flare-ups.</li>
            <li> It takes off pieces of the skin inside your mouth; those are the green clumps you may notice spitting out in the sink.</li>
            <li> They seem to provide quite a few things for Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The burning persisted for a few hours and went away</li>
            <li> It also has alcohol and a few</li>
            <li> Green 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the Crest Pro Health products.</li>
            <li> , when you use it and spit it out, the green coloring stuff gets stuck to your tongue and comes out in chunks when you spit it out...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may be obvious since the bottle says nothing of this, but if you have a problem with tartar, do not buy this stuff because if anything, it makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the issue with green chunks, or my teeth changing color, or loss of taste, as others have had.</li>
            <li> active ingredient is cetylpryinium chloride, which kills germs that accumulate on and beneath the surface of the tongue and gums, and is a common ingredient in mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how often you&#x27;re supposed to do this, but I&#x27;ve done it three times today and will continue to use it until I can see my dentist.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will be going back to ACT mouthwash...</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that is because I did everything in my ability to keep it off my tongue, or if my tongue had become immune.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to promote whiter teeth as well, although I&#x27;m not sure how well that works.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it&#x27;s even being sold.</li>
            <li> the very least, they should put a warning on the bottle that it can cause extreme staining.  </li>
            <li> And this one is not very good at all.</li>
            <li> This is why amazon should make a negative star list it ate my tastebuds for days im having tooth pain</li>
            <li> others here have complained about green-tinted solids coming out when they spit into the sink.</li>
            <li> With the nasty after taste, it makes me think it doesn&#x27;t give me fresh breath, either.</li>
            <li> With the green color, I got the idea and was hoping it would be sort of like a spearmint flavor, but I was totally wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Listerine because I hate the burn and this one has a considerable amount of \\&quot;burn\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I was almost afraid to try this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gross but you can see what was dirty in your mouth after you spit!</li>
            <li> Simply awful, stay clear of this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe thats the weird clumpy stuff that everyone talks about?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty, but doesn&#x27;t have that over-the-top flavor</li>
            <li> I had these weird brown spots between my teeth with</li>
            <li> but also I am unable to taste food anymore.</li>
            <li> I think just the fact that others have had issues and there are some weird chemicals in the mix, may be a bit off putting.</li>
            <li> I learned that this chemical can be very caustic and can cause severe burns and sores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible mouthwash, I mean, it SUCKS.</li>
            <li> I am not a chemist, a doctor, or a pharmacist (I do not want to misrepresent myself), but I did some internet research on the active ingredient in this horrible stuff.  </li>
            <li> My tongue was numb for two days, I had flashbacks to when I got my wisdom teeth pulled out.</li>
            <li> I do wish they&#x27;d leave out the artificial colors though.  </li>
            <li> I ran to the bathroom and had to put cold water on my mouth every 20sec.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d assume dead skin, maybe food, etc in your sink which can be both disgusting and invigorating as you know you are cleaning your mouth of all things bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very expensive from here.</li>
            <li> However, if you believe that mouthwash doesn&#x27;t have to taste bad to work, then skip this one.  </li>
            <li> It tingles/burns, but not quite as bad as Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I noticed my lower front teeth had a brown discoloration along the gum line.</li>
            <li> hate this product</li>
            <li> i never had and to hear it causes brown stains is horrible ...</li>
            <li> I thought it was some sort of disease until i searched for this product online and discovered all of the terrible reviews.</li>
            <li> The taste of this one is just awful!  </li>
            <li> Horrible product, stay away if you value your teeth and mouth!</li>
            <li> It has a nasty after taste that just lingers in your mouth.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn feeling that most mouthwashes have. Its smooth and gets the job done. Recommend to all mouthwash fans.</li>
            <li> I always feel like my mouth is fresh for a really long time when I use this. Even after a few hours, I still feel like I just brushed my teeth. This doesn&#x27;t really burn much, either, which is nice. I think that fits all the criterion of a good mouth wash. I&#x27;m sure it does its cleaning job.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is great mouthwash.  The flavor of a minty super clean mouth lasts all day.  I pair this with my Crest Pro Health Toothpaste as well.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with gingivitis a few years ago and have been having a lot of flare-ups. This mouthwash has helped keep the flare-ups at bay. It not only tastes great, but works well.</li>
            <li> You should buy it from CVS or walgreen. Much cheaper there.&lt;br /&gt;It is very expensive from here. Also medicine and related products should be bought from pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My mouth feels so clean and fresh after using this product! I use it 3 times a day and it blows my mind to see what all comes out after spitting it out. A++++</li>
            <li> Good buy and great product</li>
            <li> I would prefer this to Listerine any day. I have not had a cavity since the day I started using this stuff. It can be intense at times, but it is ultimately rewarding. The pack of two means it will last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> Four days ago I purchased a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Oral Rinse and it has been an absolute nightmare ever since!&lt;br /&gt;I used it only one time and ever since then my tongue has been burning - and I mean excruciating burning!  Not just minor discomfort. I can&#x27;t even sleep. The pain wakes me up! (I knew it couldn&#x27;t be the approx. 10% alcohol in the stuff because the regular mouth wash I use has 20% alcohol and gives me only a few seconds of burning that stops immediately as soon as I spit it out).  I also developed a thick coating on my tongue and the entire inside of my mouth.  For about two days I lost my sense of taste, but that seems to be returning.  I am not a chemist, a doctor, or a pharmacist (I do not want to misrepresent myself), but I did some internet research on the active ingredient in this horrible stuff.  It is cetylpyridinium chloride 0.07%.  I learned that this chemical can be very caustic and can cause severe burns and sores (in this case, in the mouth).  After finding many blog cites with other horror stories from people who have used this terrible product, one person wrote that her oral surgeon told her to mix one part children&#x27;s liquid benyadryl and one part Malox (or some liquid anti-acid product), then swish it around in your mouth for as long as you can.  DON&#x27;T SWALLOW IT.  I did this, and found it helpful in temporarily reducing the burning. I&#x27;m not sure how often you&#x27;re supposed to do this, but I&#x27;ve done it three times today and will continue to use it until I can see my dentist. I have called both the phone numbers on the back of the bottle and complained to them with my symptoms.  I told them I felt that I had been poisoned and asked if they had an antidote for it.  All they said was they would keep a record of reported symptoms and give them to Procter and Gamble (the manufacturer of Crest products).  Do yourself a big favor and don&#x27;t buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased these from Amazon at a great price, almost half of what I would pay for two at a typical retail store. I was told by my dentist that I was starting to get gingivitis and picked this up with Crest Gum Protection toothpaste and starting flossing. This mouthwash does have alcohol in it and it can burn but, as the commercials use to say, that means it&#x27;s working. When you spit out you will probably see pieces of &#x27;stuff&#x27;.. I&#x27;d assume dead skin, maybe food, etc in your sink which can be both disgusting and invigorating as you know you are cleaning your mouth of all things bad.</li>
            <li> You may as well be rinsing your mouth out with bleach. It takes off pieces of the skin inside your mouth; those are the green clumps you may notice spitting out in the sink. Also, it numbs your taste buds for DAYS after only one use. I can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;s like if you use the stuff twice a day, as the directions recommend. If you like the experience of having your mouth chemically burned and being unable to enjoy food after use, then by all means, rinse away.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling great and doesn&#x27;t burn. This is a great deal. I put one in each bathroom so I can have fresh breath whichever one I step out of in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 6 months now, and just realized today that it has been staining my teeth. I started noticing brown spots on my teeth a little while back and couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on. They weren&#x27;t sensitive so I knew it wasn&#x27;t cavities, but I never would&#x27;ve expected it was my mouthwash. I read on other reviews that others have had the same problem, I just can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to figure out that it was the mouthwash causing these problems! I&#x27;m throwing out both my crest mouthwash and toothpaste and going to something else! Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> My kids with braces love it. swear it helps them keep their braces cleaner without so much crud building up.</li>
            <li> Last night I had a pretty bad tooth ache, and in my frustration I ran to the bathroom and swished some of this stuff until the feeling left. I had to do this several times throughout the night, but eventually got it to where I could sleep. When I woke up my tongue was painful and swollen, the front of the top half much like what happens when you attempt to ingest freshly brewed coffee, but the bottom is a different story all together... The bottom half feels like someone is squeezing habanero pepper juice on it constantly, and because of this I can&#x27;t fall asleep because the moment the bottom of my tongue hits the bottom of my mouth, I&#x27;m in EXCRUCIATING pain. Hoping I can somehow get to sleep and rest this s*** all out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, only once a day because my dentist said this product is to only be used for a short amount of time. I have receding gums and have already noticed a cleaner, fresher, and less red gum line. Also, the burning affect makes me feel like it&#x27;s getting the job done.. I&#x27;m pretty sure the &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; that come out when you spit up is either tainted saliva or plague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the staining, another reason my dentist said to use it for a short time is because of its tendency to stain the teeth. I would suggest maybe using this and then using whitening strips or something along with it?</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to use it as a mouthwash, as you&#x27;d assume one would do, and experienced similar burning, numbing, etc. as listed in other comments. It&#x27;s a terrible mouthwash, I mean, it SUCKS. My tongue was numb for two days, I had flashbacks to when I got my wisdom teeth pulled out. It was not a fun experience. However, a few days ago I (for some reason) thought it was a good idea to use as a sink cleaner, and my sink has never looked better. This sh*t made my bathroom sparkle! I cannot say it enough, this is a HORRIBLE mouthwash, but I&#x27;m keeping it around because it&#x27;s a damn good bathroom cleaner.</li>
            <li> I accidentally stumbled across a new diet plan: this mouthwash is so horrible that it numbs your tastebuds for literally days and makes it so you don&#x27;t enjoy eating food. I&#x27;m so upset. It&#x27;s been like 3 days since I stopped using it and my ability to taste is only about at 70%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I found that the lost taste/smell possibly to do with the mouthwash residue gumming up your palate.  If you&#x27;re in this situation, try sucking really hard on a piece of candy toward the back of your mouth, or gargling with some sort of carbonated soda. The bubbles and acid should work some of the residue away.  It&#x27;s bizarre, but it seems to work and I&#x27;m now mostly back to normal but I&#x27;ll never buy this stuff again.</li>
            <li> This is why amazon should make a negative star list it ate my tastebuds for days im having tooth pain i never had and to hear it causes brown stains is horrible ... I Would rather buy a off brand mouth wash than ever put this back in my mouth .Crest its time to tak this off the market Please Now You Have scared me from all your products</li>
            <li> The next day after I used this I noticed a waxy, scratchy sensation in my mouth and wasn&#x27;t able to taste much of anything. I didn&#x27;t use it again to see if/when the symptoms would go away. Took about 5 days to return to normal so tried it again and found the same thing. I&#x27;ve stopped using it and will find something else not made by Procter and Gamble. I see people have been complaining about this stuff for years yet they continue to market it as something wonderful. Typical corporate greed, way to go P &amp; G!</li>
            <li> I really like Crest Pro Health mouthwash!  While there may be some mouthwashes that are not as strong in taste, I have also found those to not work as well (on average).  This product does the job, no alcohol sting, and so I can rinse longer instead of being in a hurry to spit it out!&lt;br /&gt;  Now as to Preferred Mart...They seem to provide quite a few things for Amazon.  This particular order arrived in time as promised.  I have also had one order that was canceled with no chance for me to change or redirect my order.  Preferred Mart where I know for sure they have been involved has a 50/50 chance, but again this is my experience.</li>
            <li> I just tried Crest Pro-Health mouthwash for the first time without knowing about its extensive history of consumer complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a \\&quot;clean freak\\&quot; when it comes to my teeth, so it took me as a shock when my gums and inside of my cheeks started burning immediately after trying this product (I can use regular Listerine without even flinching). I was also puzzled by the dark green pieces of what looked like shavings from a pencil eraser when I spit it out. The burning persisted for a few hours and went away but my food tasted funny all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after having used this product twice a day for four days, there is consistent pain and slight swelling on the inside of both cheeks along with a throbbing pain in my lower left jaw. I stopped using it and went back to my usual mouthwash this morning but decided to check online to see if there are any complaints about the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash. WOW! I can&#x27;t believe it is still being sold because there are literally thousands of complaints out there about similar pain and/or brown staining of the teeth (which I luckily didn&#x27;t experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not buy this product unless you have been using it for a while and aren&#x27;t bothered by it. I don&#x27;t know why it is still on the market with so many complaints.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the size was so much smaller than the ones I get from the store. It is about a dollar cheaper per bottle to buy at Target. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this item again online.</li>
            <li> I bought this two pack on clearance at Target last week and I guess it was on clearance for a reason. The taste sticks with me for the whole day which is supposed to be a good thing, except my tongue is numb and I cannot taste my food. Last time I checked, mouthwash is supposed to be refreshing and not supposed to leave numbing metallicy taste in your mouth. Needless to say, I will be going back to ACT mouthwash... DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Look at the most recent reviews of this stuff - I don&#x27;t know, maybe they changed their formula, but all the recent reviewers seem to have the same problems I have. Every time I use this, I spit out chunks that don&#x27;t come out when I swig water - and they&#x27;re dyed BRIGHT GREEN. Also, my whole mouth goes numb - not in that clean minty way, but in an I-can&#x27;t-taste-food-for-hours way. I&#x27;ve looked this up elsewhere, and a lot of people have experienced these problems, as well as others who&#x27;ve experienced dramatic staining on their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere. This stuff will mess your mouth up.</li>
            <li> Stopped when I noticed brown stains on most of my teeth. Dentist said to watch for products with &amp;#34;stanous flouride&amp;#34;. No fun having brown teeth!</li>
            <li> I love this! Use it twice a day and my teeth do feel cleaner (pairing it with the use of a power brush)! It&#x27;s gross but you can see what was dirty in your mouth after you spit! Maybe it&#x27;s plaque or just food...but it&#x27;s so satisfying to see it haha!</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I noticed my lower front teeth had a brown discoloration along the gum line. I thought it was some sort of disease until i searched for this product online and discovered all of the terrible reviews. Also, you will feel like layers of your mouth are being burned off. Maybe thats the weird clumpy stuff that everyone talks about? Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> This review is from: Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash 500 Ml (Pack of 2) (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alcohol content is something I&#x27;d not seen in such a strong dosage. Definitely I believe it kills germs and works but not everybody is going to like the feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after using this I could not taste anything, a strange feeling but not necessarily bad.</li>
            <li> When Crest&#x27;s pro-health line first came out and was recommended heartily to my husband by his dentist because of it&#x27;s alcohol-free nature, I felt that all Pro-health products would be alcohol free, but this one is not. I have tried this particular Clean Mint from both the grocery (1 liter) and Amazon (500 mL) and have not experienced the numb feeling others have noted nor the lack of tastebuds. I actually recently tested this relatively soon before a meal and tasted my toast, yogurt, and egg whites just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m sure the other reviewers did experience something, whether it was a bad batch or a personal reaction, it does raise some issues about the product that would probably set me off of getting this particular variation of Pro-Health again. I&#x27;ll just stick with the traditional alcohol-free variety. Given the alternatives, switching away seems like the safer option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the taste: despite the green coloring of this product, it is nothing like a wintergreen variation of the clean mint taste.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is fairly strong, and definitely minty. It does remind me a bit of Listermint, which I&#x27;ve used in the past and been happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its active ingredient is cetylpryinium chloride, which kills germs that accumulate on and beneath the surface of the tongue and gums, and is a common ingredient in mouthwash. In big doses, it can cause some problems, but I think this is a fairly standard concentration and I haven&#x27;t seen any problems with it. It also has alcohol and a few other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning and evening after brushing, flossing and rinsing, and it does seem to keep my breath fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is perfect for those who like that clean mouth feeling without too much intensity--indeed, this is a best of both worlds product that leaves the mouth feeling great for a long period of time without any burn.  There is a definite \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling granting power to the invigorating claim, and the taste is quite respectable.</li>
            <li> This product is not like the Pro-Health mouthwash I usually use, this one is more like Listerine.  I&#x27;m not a fan of Listerine because I hate the burn and this one has a considerable amount of \\&quot;burn\\&quot;  The taste is also, let me think of the right word, \\&quot;nasty\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love Listerine, then this might be a good option for you.  However, if you believe that mouthwash doesn&#x27;t have to taste bad to work, then skip this one.  That&#x27;s right, put it back on the shelf and run away.  Far, far away.</li>
            <li> My son and husband are the mouthwash users, they both like the product, but it would be nice if these came in a larger size.  I do like the fact of being able to buy a double quantity.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash promises to do a lot of things. I&#x27;ve already been using it for a couple of weeks because my dentist gave me a coupon and CVS was running a sale.&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I just wanted to use a product that prevented me from offending anyone, that would leave my breadth fresh, and generally left my mouth feeling good. I also wanted a mouthwash that wouldn&#x27;t leave me gagging.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product. It has a fresh minty taste that is refreshing. It leaves my breadth fresh smelling and my mouth feels fresh and my mouth feels clean.&lt;br /&gt;I use this after I brush and floss in the morning and evening. I can&#x27;t attest to whether it is killing germs, preventing gingivitis, or reducing plaque build up. The truth is my oral health is good due to frequent cleanings and standard dentist visits. I don&#x27;t have problems with oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the obvious benefit of having very good breadth after using Crest I have noticed that this has pretty much eliminated the irksome condition referred to on tv as &#x27;morning mouth&#x27; which makes me feel like someone used Gorilla Glue to affix my tongue to the roof of my mouth when I awake in the morning. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my teeth feel clean throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;So here is my totally unscientific opinion. This is a pleasant, minty flavored product that does a good job and won&#x27;t leave you gagging.</li>
            <li> This is less intense than the Listerine mouthwashes, but still too strong for me. I have used a lot of Crest Pro Health products and generally like them, but I prefer their alcohol-free formulas. This would be perfect for someone who wants a stronger mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash tastes good and is refreshing.  Like it a lot more than  [[ASIN:B008R7CPUQ Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint Flavor Rinse]] which seems to cause cotton mouth. But even though this one is better, I still prefer my Up&amp;Up Listerine generic. It just feels more intense and refreshing, which I prefer. This Crest is good, and the freshness does last a decent amount of time, but my generic is just feels like it does a better job for me. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle, but doubt I&#x27;ll switch to it from my fave.</li>
            <li> That is always the first thing that I think about when buying a mouthwash product is the aftertaste. And this one is not very good at all. The initial taste is fine when you are swishing it around your mouth but after you spit it out it is down hill. Loved the shape of the bottle and the design but it all boils down to taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would pass next time!</li>
            <li> I started using a flouride rinse once a week at the suggestion of my dentist.  I figured it would be a good idea to expand out  to daily with the Pro-Health mouthwash.  I have to admit I have not historically used a mouthwash so I was impressed by it&#x27;s powerful flavor and long lasting minty freshness.  However, I am pretty concerned with the warning labels.  Especially the warning note \\&quot;If more is used than for rinsing is swallowed, call poison control or seek medical help immediately.\\&quot; That is paraphrased, but the awkward syntax is pretty true to the original.  Grammar aside, I&#x27;m a little worried about putting anything into my mouth that could cause me to call a poison center.  It scares me enough that I think I will keep to just brushing and flossing once this container is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I have had no issues with the product, although I am using it once a day rather than twice, and I am only using it at night.  My breath, while not perfect, is actually noticeably better in the morning after using the product.</li>
            <li> As a few other have mentioned, there does seem to be a bit of a numbing effect to using this mouthwash. Something I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed it with most other versions of Crest mouthwashes, and definitely don&#x27;t recall ever having a numbing issue when using Scope. Also, the mouthwash burn sensation is very strong with this formula, and I&#x27;m guessing if my mouth wasn&#x27;t so numbed by it, the burn would probably feel even stronger. But I&#x27;m a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn anyway. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a food allergy to Yellow #5 and can&#x27;t use or eat anything with that food coloring it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead, to create the mouthwashes green color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build in my mouth, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband, who uses it several times a day. So it seems to work well, it&#x27;s just super strong in flavor!</li>
            <li> This delivers as advertised - and like typical mouthwash, it&#x27;s \\&quot;invigorating,\\&quot; from the alcohol. But, I&#x27;ve always felt like that tells me it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews have noted a numbing sensation, which I didn&#x27;t notice. But - it&#x27;s the typical mouthwash burn, so if you&#x27;re sensitive, you probably won&#x27;t like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste. It&#x27;s minty, but doesn&#x27;t have that over-the-top flavor I&#x27;ve found in Listerine. It&#x27;s not too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it okay - but I&#x27;m not generally a fan of alcohol-based mouthwashes, because I think they&#x27;re drying. This is okay, but it didn&#x27;t change my mind.</li>
            <li> Returning it tomorrow and will never use it again. Wow, this stuff makes your mouth burn. Wish I had read review before I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of religious when it comes to flossing, brushing and mouthwash.  This mouthwash in particular does stain your teeth.  Specifically the back of my front teeth and my dentist has suggested to not use this.  Other than that I thought it was a great mouthwash, but since then have moved back to Listerine.</li>
            <li> I consider green Scope to be the average, run-of-the-mill mouthwash.  This is a bit stronger than that, but not as strong as Listerine.  It tastes good and seems to do its basic job of making your mouth feel a little cleaner.</li>
            <li> It was invigorating and cleaned my mouth well. I also had a fresh feel to it. The sent lasted for a while to</li>
            <li> I had already tried 2 other flavors of Crest Pro-Health after my dentist recommended I switch mouthwashes. But this flavor is my new favorite. The freshness seems to last a little better than most alcohol free mouthwashes. If you are used to a burning mouthwash, this does take a little time to get used to. Also note that you are supposed to swish for a full minute to get the benefits. This does not exacerbate my dry mouth or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I tend to like non-alcohol mouthwashes, like Listerine, since I usually find them too strong and medicinal tasting.  But I figured I would give Crest Pro-Health Invigorating a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not at overpowering as Listerine, which is nice.  With Listerine I always felt like the product was just so strong it masked any mouth odor with a medicinal smell, rather than actually freshened breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-Health, on the other hand, freshens my breath, but the tingling sensation and taste afterward is milder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients: Water, Alcohol (10.8 WT%), Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Flavor, Poloxamer 407, Sodium Saccharin, Yellow 6, Green 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I usually do not like mouthwashes with alcohol content, but this one is decent.  I do wish they&#x27;d leave out the artificial colors though.  I would use it again.  It tastes OK, is not overpowering, and leaves my breath fresh, while not with a strong, medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> There are two basic types of mouthwash. Antiseptic and antimicrobial (aka antibacterial). Antiseptic uses alcohol to kill germs. So, if you are using an alcohol free mouthwash, you are using an antimicrobial. This is the new trend in mouthwash. It offers fresh breath without that burning sensation you are used to from traditional brands like Listerine. Like any mouthwash of this type, this comes with a warning, \\&quot;In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mentioning this because this particular mouthwash is one of the few in the Crest Pro-Health line that is an antiseptic (CONTAINS ALCOHOL) mouthwash. Of all of the Crest Pro-Health mouthwashes that I have tried, and I have tried several, this one is easily my favorite. I like the antiseptic alcohol burn. The alcohol is what is INVIGORATING about this particular mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal user of Listerine Total Care which is effective but does have an unpleasant taste. So I tried this in the hopes of securing the same benefits in a more tasty concotion. The bottle is attractive and easy to handle. The cover is one of the squeeze and turn varieties and did not require a degree in advanced engineering to open. The liquid is green and flavorwise is somehwat minty and less assertive than Listerine. Performancewise it is average. My mouth feels cleaner with the Listerine, despite the gnarly flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My major concern is with this product&#x27;s active ingredient, cetylpyridium chloride. It is an antiinfective frequently used as a preservative in pharmaceutical preparations, a topical cleanser and a local anesthetic found in products such as Cepacol. The package warns of the most common side effect, to wit, browning of teeth, which they claim can be removed by additional brushing or a dental visit(for which there is no mention of reimbursement). The anesthetic effect can impact your sense of taste. This substance, while popular in dental preparations is also used in insecticides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only experienced a slight numbing of my tongue. It wears off but frankly I am not willing to risk the other side effects. I don&#x27;t have much faith in the FDA (or any governmental agency for that matter). True, a little bit of bug poison probably won&#x27;t cause you any permanent harm, but why risk it when there are other non-toxic alternatives available?</li>
            <li> Invigorating Clean Mint is one of Crest&#x27;s stronger mouthwash products. The flavor is fairly decent, and I can feel it working during my one-minute sloshing about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to be careful about Crest mouth rinse products touching my tongue, because of the horribly lingering effects I experienced while using the Fresh Mint variety; this one has the same effect, though not as bad...I am not sure if that is because I did everything in my ability to keep it off my tongue, or if my tongue had become immune. I did wake up with it all up in the interior of my cheeks and on my lips, though. I can&#x27;t stand this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have problems with my teeth so my dentist really wants me to use some sort of dental rinse. I have tried a few of the Crest Pro Health products. This version has alcohol but has the same active ingredient as the alcohol free version. It does not have fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My uneducated bias is that alcohol based mouth rinses kill germs better than alcohol free ones. I figure alcohol kills germs.  I do taste the alcohol though and I don&#x27;t like the flavor as much as I did when I tried the alcohol free cool wintergreen mouth rinse by Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could have something to with the invigorating mint flavor. Crest has an invigorating mint toothpaste and I was not a fan of that flavor as well and that is alcohol free. It does make my breath smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I choose a mouth rinse I look at the ingredients and taste. I like alcohol part to help kill germs and not the taste part so I gave this four stars.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if the CREST PRO-HEALTH INVIGORATING CLEAN MINT MOUTHWASH lives up to its claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can testify to the fact that it burns when gargling with it, straight, and so it&#x27;s just like Listerine. There&#x27;s a lot of alcohol in it (though it&#x27;s listed as one of the inactive ingredients), which causes that burning sensation in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it is strengthening my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use this after brushing and it does freshen breath. I also discovered that it keeps inside cheek bites from becoming canker sores -- you know when you accidentally bite the inside of your cheek and sometimes it develops into a sore -- and helps the bite heal fast.</li>
            <li> I use to use the Night flavor but it&#x27;s been discontinued.  The taste of this one is just awful!  I switched to the standard flavor which they sell at Costco and while not as nice as the Night flavor, I do like it.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff exclusively months ago. I switched mouthwashes a while back, just to test some others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Listerine Ultraclean (which has double the alcohol content, by the way) for quite some time and I decided to pick some of this up once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It ruined my taste buds and made my tongue feel funny for about 16 hours when I used it. I guess I never noticed it before. On the bright side, my breath did feel fresher in the morning when using it before bed compared to using Listerine, but the weird aftertaste remained in my mouth throughout the day, even after brushing in the morning and eating two meals! Not really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when you use it and spit it out, the green coloring stuff gets stuck to your tongue and comes out in chunks when you spit it out... I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s a side effect or a feature, but I think it&#x27;s gross. This was also a problem with the no-alcohol version of this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be obvious since the bottle says nothing of this, but if you have a problem with tartar, do not buy this stuff because if anything, it makes it worse. I had these weird brown spots between my teeth with I used it, regardless of how much I brushed (with a Sonicare Toothbrush) and flossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer possibly fresher breath at the cost of not tasting anything, then I guess this is perfect for you. Otherwise, close your browser and run far away for the sake of delicious food and your tongues nerve endings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of obsessed about having fresh breath. As in, I&#x27;m one of those who would take my toothbrush to work so I could brush after every meal. Except now I don&#x27;t have to, thanks to this little guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am such a fan of this mouth rinse. It&#x27;s the only one that can cut through things like garlic and onions and leaves your breath super minty and fresh for more than 2 minutes. For those after-meal snackers out there, this is a mouthwash that sort of &amp;#34;forces&amp;#34; you not to mindlessly snack, because of the strong mint aftertaste. Seriously: after just a 20 or 30 second swish, you&#x27;re done until the next meal. (And sometimes beyond.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it has that effect because it&#x27;s antibacterial - and a star for no triclosan! - and really is able to cut through the germs that cause halitosis.  It&#x27;s supposed to promote whiter teeth as well, although I&#x27;m not sure how well that works. All I know is that I am so glad Amazon has this on subscribe and save, so I&#x27;ll always have enough stock for an after-meal swish.</li>
            <li> While my mouth did feel good after use the taste / odor is just too strong for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;Even when just used half of the recommended amount it was just too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it might not have all the benefits of this product I still prefer [[ASIN:B0012S4T8S ACT Anticavity Fluoride Rinse, Cinnamon, Alcohol Free 18-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> This is the Crest Pro-Health product with alcohol, so it is the most similar to what I am accustomed to with Listerine. I think this has a better, though strong flavor (spearminty), though still not something I love swishing (especially not for the full 30 seconds that is recommended on the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eat breakfast about 20 minutes after swishing with this rinse and brushing my teeth and it really throws my taste buds off.  The first few bites of food or sips of drink after using this product are not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, however, I know I will reap the benefits in better checkups at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash seems to do the job of a good mouthwash. It does contain some alcohol, so it has a bit of a Listerine-like bite--which I happen to like--but it&#x27;s not as strong or medicinal-tasting as Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some others here have complained about green-tinted solids coming out when they spit into the sink. I&#x27;ve seen that with other mouthwashes, too, but tinted whatever color the mouthwash was tinted. I always thought it was gunk from inside my mouth that was released by the alcohol or cleansers that were contained in the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the mouthwash is fine, and I don&#x27;t have any reason at all to recommend it any less or any more highly than other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in an effort to improve my oral hygiene, and I regret it tremendously. Not only do I have the same problem as others have mentioned (spitting out green \\&quot;chunks\\&quot; after use) but also I am unable to taste food anymore. I last used the rinse several days ago (nearly a week now I believe) and food still does not taste right, and I seem to have something almost like a chemical burn on the inside of my mouth. It is gradually getting better, but I believe this is much more than an allergic reaction to the product, as many others have had the same issues. How this product is still on the market I don&#x27;t know, because I can find similar complaints dating back to 2007 with other Pro-Health products. Stay far far away from this and all other Pro-Health products!</li>
            <li> Horrible product, stay away if you value your teeth and mouth! Burns mouth/tongue and days might turn tongue white and whole mouth white and the bottom of the teeth dark yellow. It will cost time and over $200 to fix if you want to fix right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use more then a teaspoon, I did and it burned my whole mouth. I ran to the bathroom and had to put cold water on my mouth every 20sec. I couldn&#x27;t sleep for 28hours. The next day the pain finally went down but my tongue was peeling and had cuts around it. Later that day I was bleeding blood out of my mouth and nose small amounts 6 times every hour I was bleeding spit amounts of blood. Third day the bleeding is finally going down so far it&#x27;s been 3 hours and I only spit 3 small drops of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate this product so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even want to give this product a 1 star but wasn&#x27;t sure if I could write a commit if I didn&#x27;t put a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZERO that&#x27;s how many stars I would give for a product that is soooooooooo harmful and dangerous for any human being.</li>
            <li> I like it feels like it&#x27;s workijg to make my mouth healthy. Leaves mouth feeling clean and breath fresh. Stronger taste than other crest rinses.</li>
            <li> I stopped using that after reading reviews about staining teeth to a yellow color. Nor interested! My experience was that the taste is too bitter and I don&#x27;t like the taste of alcohol. I actually enjoy the Listerine alcohol free mouth wash much better.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash has a stronger mint flavor than some of the other Crest mouthwashes but it still leaves a bit of an aftertaste.  It does have alcohol and I enjoy the astringency but it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride which helps strengthen enamel and reduce sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I do not like this mouthwash at all. It was rather disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think it has any mint flavor to it. It has a nasty after taste that just lingers in your mouth. It tingles/burns, but not quite as bad as Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel fresh and clean after I use this Crest Pro Health Invigorating Clean Mint. With the nasty after taste, it makes me think it doesn&#x27;t give me fresh breath, either. With the green color, I got the idea and was hoping it would be sort of like a spearmint flavor, but I was totally wrong. I can&#x27;t pull any kind of mint taste out of this mouthwash at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of Crest products including a few different mouthwashes, but this is one I won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> Cleans all around and without intense burning. Gives a fresh, clean minty sensation. I like a little burn, makes it feel like its working</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I was almost afraid to try this mouthwash. I tried it anyway, and it had a slight burning sensation (not even close to Listerine) and bubbly effect. Afterwards my teeth felt clean and my breath felt fresh. I didn&#x27;t have the issue with green chunks, or my teeth changing color, or loss of taste, as others have had. Although, this is not my favorite mouthwash. I think just the fact that others have had issues and there are some weird chemicals in the mix, may be a bit off putting. That being said, this mouthwash worked OK for me.</li>
            <li> Mint Pro-Health has a very nice minty taste. I like that it kills germs and can help the overall health of your teeth and gums. Unlike Listerine, this has a fresh taste and isn&#x27;t too over powering to use. I have always trusted the Crest brand and I feel as though using this kills bacteria that brushing can&#x27;t. The fresh taste lasts for a while and you can use this to freshen your breath anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the taste and use it in conjunction with brushing a couple times a day. It seems to me that my dentist told me a while back that this product can stain teeth, but I am thinking it was the blue Pro-Health product that people were having trouble with. So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced any staining but will be on the lookout.</li>
            <li> I actually haven&#x27;t bought this product on Amazon, but feel that the negative reviews are really off-base. Let me explain. Do you know what those &amp;#34;flying chunks&amp;#34; many reviewers describe are? It&#x27;s plaque. You know...the stuff you are using the mouthwash to remove? Yeah, that&#x27;s it. &amp;#60;rolls eyes&amp;#62; ..And as for the &amp;#34;burning sensation&amp;#34;? Ummm...that means it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how to know when your teeth are cleaner? That&#x27;s right...when there is less chunks flying out of your mouth and it doesn&#x27;t burn as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want your teeth to be clean after you use mouthwash? Then this is absolutely the best product. Most of the reviews for this product are head shakingly bad.</li>
            <li> Seems alright at first but after a while it will start staining your teeth dark yellow. Starting having a similar problem as another reviewer, where I would be spitting out chunks of bright green stuff. Simply awful, stay clear of this product. Not sure how it&#x27;s even being sold. Positive reviews are likely just fake ones.</li>
            <li> when i first started using this product i liked it because it didn&#x27;t have that intenseness like listering, but my mouth felt fresh for hours, then i took a bite of an oreo and i couldnt taste it! i figured that it was just because it was the first time i used it and it was temporary so i kept using it. a week later i decided to stop using it until my taste buds were back to normal, it has now been a week with no mouthwash, and i can still barely taste anything! if you enjoy tasting the foods you eat, then i would strongly recommend fiding a different mouthwash!</li>
            <li> The &#x27;invigorating&#x27; aspect of this mouthwash is the alcohol, which does have that sort of tingling/burning feeling some people really like from other washes, most notably Listerine.  What I liked about this particular mouthwash over other brands, particularly Listerine, is that the &#x27;invigorating&#x27; tingling that you get from this wash isn&#x27;t overpowering nor is it practically unbearable as those others can be.  It is truly more of a tingling than a burning sensation, or was for me at least.  What turned me off most about this product is the flavor; after rinsing I feel like I have the taste of a rubber glove from the dentist left over.  I have been using the Crest Pro-Health line for a while now, both toothpaste and mouthwash in the Multi-Protection/alcohol free line, and have really liked how clean my teeth are after using the products.  I will most likely stick with that line as I just really didn&#x27;t like the flavor of this one and don&#x27;t always like the &#x27;invigorating&#x27; tingle this wash has.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health mouthwash was a pleasant surprise. I like mouthwashes that feel like they&#x27;re doing something (i.e., alcohol in them.) Unless it kind of initially hurts, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s killing germs and plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice sized bottle, and once you get used to it, it works fine. The little floaters (whatever they&#x27;re supposed to be) didn&#x27;t bother me, but for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out what they&#x27;re supposed to be doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it fine, and if it were on sale and my fave Listerine wasn&#x27;t available, I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Mouth Wash and am extremely upset.  I noticed my teeth getting yellow and brown spots on them after about a week of using this. I searched the Internet for all the products that  I use and discovered that I am not the only person who has had this happen.  Is that their marketing strategy?  Create something that stains your teeth so that we buy their whitening products?  Shame on them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very least, they should put a warning on the bottle that it can cause extreme staining.  I have no idea if I will ever get the color of my teeth back to normal.</li>
