            <li>He loves the cute snail on the front from Turbo.  </li>
            <li>Delivery has been right on time and price has been good.</li>
            <li>love that I can order it from Amazon, makes life easy.</li>
            <li>One bottle arrived with a dragon from a movie he has never seen and he still thought it was very cool.</li>
            <li>It is just great, and must be PH balanced, because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and lathers very well.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a strong, fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for little hands</li>
            <li>NOT TEAR FREE.</li>
            <li>Plus it is tear free</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great and the kids actually like using it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shampoo/conditioner combo for my 6 year old son.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells good and makes my daughters hair soft without conditioner</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t very economical for hers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo for kids that doesn&#x27;t have a mix of conditioner as well, so I was happy when I found this one from L&#x27;Oreal (love the brand).</li>
            <li>This stuff is super concentrated.  </li>
            <li>Great price, soft on my scalp for an adult.</li>
            <li>It made the bath mor fun and no complaints about soap in their eyes.</li>
            <li>Better value, and he appreciates that it looks a little more grown up</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>My daughter has lots of hair (long, but very fine) and it tangles a lot, so I need to purchase conditioner separately.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo, makes the kids hair smell yummy for a long time, I tried all variations and I like this and the strawberry one</li>
            <li>The bottle says it&#x27;s extra gentle and tear free</li>
            <li>Much easier on the skin and fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the whole reason why we bought it...</li>
            <li>I cant comment if this is really &amp;#34;no-tears&amp;#34;, but I have yet to hear any complaints.</li>
            <li>smell and gentle on the eyes</li>
            <li>After using this I was surprised that his hair was much softer!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t mind getting a little soap in their eye and &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; is a favorite movie of theirs.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t quite ready to use the adult shampoos and conditioners but they also don&#x27;t want to use the shampoos and conditioners labeled for a \\&quot;baby\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>normal quility</li>
            <li>but still can&#x27;t use adult shampoos and conditioners, get this!</li>
            <li>My 4 year old grandson has used this for 2 years.  </li>
            <li>My children are now five and eight years old.  </li>
            <li>So if you have young children who aren&#x27;t \\&quot;babies\\&quot; anymore</li>
            <li>my child in big delight, thanks</li>
            <li>this shampoo will leave you astonished, it leaves your childs hair so soft and manageble, and the scent will please you so, that you are not want to want to switch again</li>
            <li>I will be very lost when it is discontinued, as I haven&#x27;t found a close second choice for my family.</li>
            <li>Come on guys the ENTIRE reason i purchased this particular type of this shampoo was because my son loves turbo the movie, not how to train your dragon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not happy, my sons favorite character is mater</li>
            <li>This does not dry out his hair and he loves the smell.</li>

            <li> When it arrives, I pour it into a decent looking bottle, since I can&#x27;t bear the ugly cartoons, but it works very well, and I live with it!  </li>
            <li> If you use too much, you may have a hard time rinsing it all out.  </li>
            <li> I like that it conditions my daughter&#x27;s long hair although I still prefer to use the detangling spray in addition.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my kids hair soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t explain my sons rapid screaming and crying when he got a tiny dab in the eyeball.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to lather up the kids hair.  </li>
            <li> My missing star is because I would like it to have some conditioner/detailer to be used for hair.</li>
            <li> too small of bottle for my daughter&#x27;s long thick hair-</li>
            <li> It works, but the size and price are silly considering what you spend for it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>

            <li> I ordered L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids Mango Orange Mater Shampoo and I got a 1/2 spilled Panguins from Madagasscar Shampoo... I&#x27;m not happy, my sons favorite character is mater it&#x27;s the whole reason why we bought it... Now I have a 1/2 bottle of shampoo bc it leaked wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and very soothing for hair</li>
            <li> Ok i know it says&amp;#34; packaging may vary&amp;#34; HOWEVER do not advertise it as Turbo if ya&#x27;ll are going to send how to train your dragon! I thought it meant we may not get turbo but burn, skidmark, chet, ect. Come on guys the ENTIRE reason i purchased this particular type of this shampoo was because my son loves turbo the movie, not how to train your dragon. Very unhappy. Will not do this again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, cleans the kids hair perfectly.</li>

            <li> I am on auto subscribe for this shampoo.  My grandsons love it and I get it at a good price to boot!</li>
            <li> nice kids shampoo with lots of suds.</li>
            <li> I was using California Baby shampoo &amp; body wash on my toddler, which I&#x27;d been using since he was a baby. I figured it was time for something more fitting for his age. After using this I was surprised that his hair was much softer! The smell is nice too. Mine came with a picture of How to Train Your Dragon 2, is just &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; (not orange mango), and says &amp;#34;2 in 1 shampoo&amp;#34; on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and the kids actually like using it!  Win-win!  I cant comment if this is really &amp;#34;no-tears&amp;#34;, but I have yet to hear any complaints.</li>
            <li> Very good item, good price, good character for my son. this is best.</li>
            <li> My son loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell and gentle on the eyes</li>
            <li> This is a great all-around shampoo.  I use it on grandchildren, but also keep it in the guest bathroom for guests of all ages.  I use it myself, and it is what I fill my travel vials with, because you never need a conditioner with it.  It is just great, and must be PH balanced, because I have sensitive skin.  When it arrives, I pour it into a decent looking bottle, since I can&#x27;t bear the ugly cartoons, but it works very well, and I live with it!  I will be very lost when it is discontinued, as I haven&#x27;t found a close second choice for my family.</li>
            <li> It is a gift.My friend&#x27;s daughter like it.</li>
            <li> It works, but the size and price are silly considering what you spend for it elsewhere. I ended up buying shampoo for my son from bath and body on sale. Better value, and he appreciates that it looks a little more grown up (10 y/o).</li>
            <li> Great price, soft on my scalp for an adult.</li>
            <li> perfect for kids. smells nice and lathers well</li>
            <li> My kids love it and the smell.  They don&#x27;t mind getting a little soap in their eye and &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; is a favorite movie of theirs.  Might be nice to try this on my hair!</li>
            <li> I adore how this smells in my son&#x27;s hair :)  He loves the cute snail on the front from Turbo.  One bottle arrived with a dragon from a movie he has never seen and he still thought it was very cool.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells good and makes my daughters hair soft without conditioner</li>
