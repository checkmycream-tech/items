    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This would be a wonderful color to shave your legs with.</li>
            <li>The packaging was awesome and the color went on so well.</li>
            <li>LOVE Pravana !!!</li>
            <li>and it took beautifully.</li>
            <li>This is a great brand of hair color</li>
            <li>Quite happy with the results, I recommend reading the instructions if you&#x27;ve never used Pravana before though.</li>
            <li>so it was great for me in a pinch.</li>
            <li>bright color, lasts about 3 weeks after bleach</li>
            <li>After a couple of washes it seems to have good staying power as well.</li>
            <li>it is  good product, but lighter than i would have liked.</li>
            <li>Manic panic is way better!</li>
            <li>I purchased a tube of purple sold by Quick E Mart and loved it!</li>
            <li>Love how it smelled, but it was not as bright as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It basically made my bleached hair take on a rose gold look.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain your hands or anything it touches and this might sound like a good thing</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, service was great.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be a top notch brand</li>
            <li>This stuff feels more like a conditioner than a hair dye, and didn&#x27;t give me the color advertised at all.</li>
            <li>I wonder if it would work better with Prravana&#x27;s vivids line as a color enhancer, but it just doesn&#x27;t work on</li>
            <li>Love the color but it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>The color line is hands down the BEST and it doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair.</li>
            <li>but I used the chroma silk vivids in my hair and it took just fine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a bright dye that matches the advertised color, I&#x27;d go with the vivid rather than the neon line.</li>
            <li>It was so rich and bold in color that it took a week to wash off of my skin.</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair to a bright yellow-white, as the instructions suggest for best results, but wound up with a very pale, almost pastel, faded pink.</li>
            <li>So I guess that if you a semi temporary color then this is right for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty economical that way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really love to have my money back.</li>
            <li>With my hair the first two months after bleaching my hair does not like to grab on to the color.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and I love that it is straight deposit color</li>
            <li>So the seller is fast.</li>
            <li>So I had to put the whole tube too cover my hair.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing to prelightened hair, even with heat.</li>
            <li>However, when I ordered an additional tube in hot pink, it came from The Neighborhood Market and clearly was not the original product!</li>
            <li>Box arrived damaged and tube leaked, but the main carrier box wasn&#x27;t damaged at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty certain this is mixed with something or not Pravana at all.</li>
            <li>And after two washes it was down to the  yucky pastel pink that does not look good on me.</li>
            <li>The dye comes right out of the tube like a translucent color, as if it was mixed with conditioner.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use unless your hair is pretty much white.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched numerous videos of this exact color</li>
            <li>chromasilk vivid color</li>
            <li>Barely turned out to a light pink.</li>
            <li>The darker parts of my hair came out a salmon color and the blondest parts were only a light cotton candy pink.</li>
            <li>and now my hair looks like a 10 year old with a packet of kool-aid.</li>
            <li>, I used the magenta (I think it&#x27;s called wild orchid)</li>
            <li>So when I saw the neon collection I got the pink right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I got ripped off and that this is fake Pravana dye altogether.</li>
            <li>This pink actually came out a very light pink and salmon color.  </li>
            <li>It was light enough to get a deep fuschia/hot pink color but the darkest it showed up was nothing compared to the hair swatch in the photo.</li>
            <li>and I got NOT PINK.</li>
            <li>Not pink.</li>
            <li>I only need about a half teaspoon of this stuff and a little more than a teaspoon of the magenta to make this work.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed professional with limited access in my area</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown naturally but at least half is bleached light blonde, highlights and what not.</li>
            <li> I use a 1:3 ratio of neon pink to magenta on my bleached and un-toned hair for a relatively long-lasting brightness.</li>
            <li> But you are planning to have a dark cotton candy for the next year like I am, then just stick to the magenta</li>
            <li> Was no neon pink.</li>
            <li> As one reviewer put it, it&#x27;s like pink conditioner</li>
            <li> I wanted Neon Pink</li>
            <li> I dilute it to get the shade of pink that I like.</li>
            <li> The dye itself looks like a translucent pink (does that make sense? ).  </li>
            <li> Does that look like a cotton candy pink?</li>
            <li> This product IS NOT like other Pravana products.  </li>
            <li> and you will have the prettiest pink ever!</li>
            <li> The color that came out of the tube was extremely runny.</li>
            <li> Beware buying this or any other color.</li>
            <li> This dye barely colored even the lightest parts of my hair, it was left a weird orang-ish color, and not even a hint of color on the dark parts.</li>
            <li> Which would mean that I was going to be using less with it lasting longer.</li>
            <li> Even the packaging looks slightly sketchy.</li>
            <li> It was so thin and watery that it barely even showed on my skin at all!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The trick is to mix a few squirts of the magenta in with it, leave it on bleached hair</li>
            <li> So I knew that if I diluted it it was going to be too pale and would not show up in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Pravana in the past and based on those results</li>
            <li> It appeared to already be diluted and after my usual processing time on pre-bleached hair, there was no change to the color.</li>
            <li> well I usually use the pravana chromasilk magenta.  </li>
            <li> So I may try it it again in the future just to see if it&#x27;s my hair that&#x27;s being stupid or if the product is just not pigmented enough.  </li>
            <li> If you are a dirty blonde its going to make your hair the color of a scrotum.</li>
            <li> at least 45 min.</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT PINK HAIR!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Dye it about once or twice a week to keep the color that I like is getting to be a bit expensive (compared to the violet or the green)</li>
            <li> Was not happy with color turn out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out that way.</li>
            <li> disappointed</li>
            <li> But the product was CRAP.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair punk colors for 20 years now and this is one of the worst.</li>
            <li> My experience with this line had been terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> bright color, lasts about 3 weeks after bleach</li>
            <li> If an albino when outside to get the mail without a hat, that is the color achieved. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair punk colors for 20 years now and this is one of the worst. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; pravana, I just think their neons line is the same as their pastels line. Go for pravana vivids. This would be a wonderful color to shave your legs with. It&#x27;s conditioning. If you are a dirty blonde its going to make your hair the color of a scrotum. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is a great brand of hair color but I think the seller is a con artist! I purchased a tube of purple sold by Quick E Mart and loved it! It was so rich and bold in color that it took a week to wash off of my skin. However, when I ordered an additional tube in hot pink, it came from The Neighborhood Market and clearly was not the original product! It had obviously been diluted with something like conditioner probably. It was so thin and watery that it barely even showed on my skin at all! I would definitely recommend this product but if it&#x27;s coming from The Neighborhood Market you should probably expect to be 100% DISsatisfied with what you receive!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use unless your hair is pretty much white. My hair is dark brown naturally but at least half is bleached light blonde, highlights and what not. This dye barely colored even the lightest parts of my hair, it was left a weird orang-ish color, and not even a hint of color on the dark parts.</li>
            <li> This pink actually came out a very light pink and salmon color.  It was put over bleach blonde hair.  I would not recommend it!  Manic panic is way better!</li>
            <li> Was not happy with color turn out. Was no neon pink. Barely turned out to a light pink.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, service was great. But the product was CRAP. It did not take at all in my hair and I followed the directions verbatim. Maybe it was my hair but I used the chroma silk vivids in my hair and it took just fine.</li>
            <li> Was used when I had opened the package!&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT PINK HAIR!!!!!  I have used Pravana in the past and based on those results, I did not look at the reviews.  I wish I had.  This product IS NOT like other Pravana products.  As one reviewer put it, it&#x27;s like pink conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t take to you hair.  It basically made my bleached hair take on a rose gold look.  NOT attractive...not on trend.  I wanted Neon Pink and I got NOT PINK.</li>
            <li> it is  good product, but lighter than i would have liked. The trick is to mix a few squirts of the magenta in with it, leave it on bleached hair at least 45 min. and you will have the prettiest pink ever!</li>
            <li> This is not Pravana quality. The color that came out of the tube was extremely runny. It appeared to already be diluted and after my usual processing time on pre-bleached hair, there was no change to the color. Save yourself time and money and don&#x27;t order this product. It&#x27;s a shame there isn&#x27;t an option for zero stars. I&#x27;d really love to have my money back.</li>
            <li> Received it earlier then I thought I would. So the seller is fast. But the product. ... well I usually use the pravana chromasilk magenta.  I dilute it to get the shade of pink that I like. Dye it about once or twice a week to keep the color that I like is getting to be a bit expensive (compared to the violet or the green) So when I saw the neon collection I got the pink right away. I thought that with it being neon it was going to be brighter.  Which would mean that I was going to be using less with it lasting longer. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out that way. The dye itself looks like a translucent pink (does that make sense? ).  So I knew that if I diluted it it was going to be too pale and would not show up in my hair. So I had to put the whole tube too cover my hair. I left it on for two hours. It came out lighter then what I wanted. And after two washes it was down to the  yucky pastel pink that does not look good on me. I think that the color didn&#x27;t take to my hair because I had bleached my hair about two weeks before. With my hair the first two months after bleaching my hair does not like to grab on to the color. After that it stops fighting me and the color does not wash out at all. So I may try it it again in the future just to see if it&#x27;s my hair that&#x27;s being stupid or if the product is just not pigmented enough.  So I guess that if you a semi temporary color then this is right for you. But you are planning to have a dark cotton candy for the next year like I am, then just stick to the magenta</li>
            <li> The packaging was awesome and the color went on so well. Quite happy with the results, I recommend reading the instructions if you&#x27;ve never used Pravana before though. I&#x27;m a licensed professional with limited access in my area so it was great for me in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> Deserves no stars. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This didn&#x27;t show up AT.ALL. The dye comes right out of the tube like a translucent color, as if it was mixed with conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t stain your hands or anything it touches and this might sound like a good thing but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s dye. It&#x27;s SUPPOSED to stain. I slathered it in my hair and it washes out completely white. Not pink. I left it in for 3 hours. The darker parts of my hair came out a salmon color and the blondest parts were only a light cotton candy pink. Please look at the swatch... Does that look like a cotton candy pink? No. Now before you think my hair is to blame please know that I bleached it twice and toned it. It was light enough to get a deep fuschia/hot pink color but the darkest it showed up was nothing compared to the hair swatch in the photo. I&#x27;m pretty certain this is mixed with something or not Pravana at all. I&#x27;m pretty sure I got ripped off and that this is fake Pravana dye altogether. Even the packaging looks slightly sketchy. I&#x27;ve watched numerous videos of this exact color and it never shows up like it did on my hair. This is supposed to be a top notch brand and now my hair looks like a 10 year old with a packet of kool-aid. Beware buying this or any other color.</li>
            <li> My experience with this line had been terrible. Did absolutely nothing to prelightened hair, even with heat.</li>
            <li> Box arrived damaged and tube leaked, but the main carrier box wasn&#x27;t damaged at all</li>
            <li> I use this product to temper the color of the magenta vivids, which is a bit too purply for my taste. I use a 1:3 ratio of neon pink to magenta on my bleached and un-toned hair for a relatively long-lasting brightness. I like the shine and depth it adds to the magenta mix. Never tried it alone. I also add it (mixed with the magenta) to my conditioner for a once a week pick-me-up. I let it sit for five minutes then rinse. I only need about a half teaspoon of this stuff and a little more than a teaspoon of the magenta to make this work. It&#x27;s pretty economical that way.</li>
            <li> Love how it smelled, but it was not as bright as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels more like a conditioner than a hair dye, and didn&#x27;t give me the color advertised at all. I bleached my hair to a bright yellow-white, as the instructions suggest for best results, but wound up with a very pale, almost pastel, faded pink. I wonder if it would work better with Prravana&#x27;s vivids line as a color enhancer, but it just doesn&#x27;t work on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By contrast, I used the magenta (I think it&#x27;s called wild orchid) chromasilk vivid color and it took beautifully. After a couple of washes it seems to have good staying power as well. If you&#x27;re looking for a bright dye that matches the advertised color, I&#x27;d go with the vivid rather than the neon line.</li>
            <li> Love the color but it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> LOVE Pravana !!! The color line is hands down the BEST and it doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair. It lasts a long time and I love that it is straight deposit color</li>
