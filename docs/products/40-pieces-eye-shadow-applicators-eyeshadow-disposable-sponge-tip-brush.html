    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>And great bargain!!</li>
            <li>these are ideal for the makeup diva that plans for every situation...</li>
            <li>These work great.  </li>
            <li>The 24 count eye shadow applicators were a good price.</li>
            <li>I love it and so does my family!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for handling them, but trying to put them into the containers that I&#x27;m replacing the applicators for becomes an exercise in creative packing.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for some that will spread nicely, these will work but not as easily as some.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any sponge tips come off yet :)</li>
            <li>As described, hopfully these hold u better Than the ones included in eye makeup packages.</li>
            <li>Most of my eye shadow applicators have fallen apart over the years</li>
            <li>Made cheap can use each one maybe once.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap which is what I wanted</li>
            <li>These were fairly inexpensive, so I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised at its negatives, but just so you</li>
            <li>Pretty flimsy applicators,</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>These applicators work fine, but the white spongy tip is coming off (not on all of them, but it&#x27;s happening).  </li>
            <li>Nice for when you&#x27;re desperate for some of these suckers but not the best.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, seriously - better</li>
            <li>Cheap, not worth the money at all.  </li>
            <li>buy 5 normal quality sponges for same money than 24, I&#x27;ll just have to throw away these.</li>
            <li>It makes applying makeup a little more painful than it would be with thicker bulb-things, but presumably it also means the padding won&#x27;t separate from the wand part as easily, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I used them with my Estee Lauder eyeshadow compact and they work as well as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The padding on these is very thin.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst quality sponges I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Pretty flimsy applicators, but I guess they do the job.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> These work great.  Haven&#x27;t had any sponge tips come off yet :)</li>
            <li> The 24 count eye shadow applicators were a good price. They only have the sponge on one end instead of both ends.  They served the purpose</li>
            <li> She looked like granny on the tv show about the clampets before this , and now she looks like their dog , , ark ark . . .</li>
            <li> Nice for when you&#x27;re desperate for some of these suckers but not the best. So if you&#x27;re looking for some that will spread nicely, these will work but not as easily as some.</li>
            <li> Perfect! And great bargain!!</li>
            <li> Made cheap can use each one maybe once. Thought it  would get me through one thing of eye shadow def not</li>
            <li> Product works as I expected.</li>
            <li> Cheap, not worth the money at all.  Could get at Dollar Tree for a buck... don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> these are ideal for the makeup diva that plans for every situation...a must have in your purse...for the on-the-go girl!</li>
            <li> This is the worst quality sponges I&#x27;ve ever seen. Don&#x27;t waste your money, seriously - better buy 5 normal quality sponges for same money than 24, I&#x27;ll just have to throw away these. I just can&#x27;t tell you how poor the quality is</li>
            <li> These were fairly inexpensive, so I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised at its negatives, but just so you know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The padding on these is very thin.  It makes applying makeup a little more painful than it would be with thicker bulb-things, but presumably it also means the padding won&#x27;t separate from the wand part as easily, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the wand thing is a lot longer than I think it needs to be.  It&#x27;s nice for handling them, but trying to put them into the containers that I&#x27;m replacing the applicators for becomes an exercise in creative packing.</li>
            <li> These applicators work fine, but the white spongy tip is coming off (not on all of them, but it&#x27;s happening).  They&#x27;re cheap which is what I wanted and I would order them again.</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my family! I would recommend this item to any and everyone that I know!</li>
            <li> As described, hopfully these hold u better Than the ones included in eye makeup packages.</li>
            <li> Most of my eye shadow applicators have fallen apart over the years so I got these inexpensive replacements.  I used them with my Estee Lauder eyeshadow compact and they work as well as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> What can one say about these? They are just as I expected them to be. Purchased for Granddaughters&#x27; stocking stuffers.</li>
