            <li>B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]]  Excellent shaver, have been using Norelco shavers for many years,  (I am 84).</li>
            <li>AND THE BEST PART IS THAT IT CLEANS EASILY..</li>
            <li>After 30 years of Norelco shavers, I can easily  say that this is their best product yet.</li>
            <li>1)Light blinks to brightly at night.  </li>
            <li>Philips company did as a usually good job.</li>
            <li>The rubber grips give it a good feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, a good value.</li>
            <li>Though it is good.</li>
            <li>I received the item in a timely manner, in good condition, and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I would say it is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>I rate this five stars since it is a good price for what you get.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if you want a good battery electric shaver and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot for features you might not need or want, this will do the job.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Although Philips has cheapend up the razor substantialy, it does provide a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li>My youngest son loved his \\&quot;First\\&quot; electric razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 3 weeks and feel it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s good value for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>While it shaves good, there are two problems.</li>
            <li>This product shipped promptly and seemed to be in good condition.</li>
            <li>everything looks good except the using time</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It gives him a good shave with no razor burns and he loves the fact he can wash it out.</li>
            <li>Good price for a good shaver.</li>
            <li>DOES A GOOD JOB,EASY</li>

            <li>Very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li>It is better looking, lighter and feels great in your hands.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very happy smile.</li>
            <li>Shaver fits nicely in my hand and is surprisingly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver is awesome, cuts very well good charge</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>For the money - I&#x27;m extremely pleased!</li>
            <li>Being able to clean the head under the faucet is great!</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and works good in any direction.</li>
            <li>If you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>And, yes, it would be nice if it came with a pouch of some kind.</li>
            <li>After many years of good service, my Norelco 5841 XL gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li>Nice razor for the price.  </li>
            <li>It does an OK job but does not feel like it does a good job.    </li>
            <li>One thing to note: it does not come with a case of any kind; just a plastic blade protector.    </li>
            <li>and he is thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>As nice perk</li>
            <li>It effectively gets at the troublesome neck area and chin.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave and can be used with or without a cord.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor as a nice replacement</li>
            <li>For one thing, it&#x27;s whisper-quiet, which is nice in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them all, Braun, Panasonic, and Norelco and this particular model is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>gives a good clean close cut Very Very satisfied</li>
            <li>Holds a good charge been using it every day for over a week and still going strong.</li>
            <li>it seems very easy.</li>
            <li>i find the cleaning very easy. .</li>
            <li>Being able to rinse it out after shaving is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse out the head under running water.     </li>
            <li>Upgraded to this razor after my old Remington died, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The shaver feels good in the hand,and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great shaver for a great price compared to the stores, no lie.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my husband for our anniversary, and he said it&#x27;s a great razor for a first timer using electric razors.</li>
            <li>That reinforced my feeling that I made a good choice for the price - performance sweet spot.</li>
            <li>The shave is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for many years.  </li>
            <li>And, yes, it would be better if it used NiMH batteries instead of NiCAD.</li>
            <li>It took more than 20 days before getting satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is much better.</li>
            <li>this razor works great and cuts very close.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s OK for 2 years of use.</li>
            <li>i could and would get more</li>
            <li>well you get more from this razor in my opinion</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a month, but I feel I made an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>I get more than 10 days per charge</li>
            <li>this shaver gave at such an excellent price.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is more efficient.</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself and then 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>but I love this razor now that my skin seems to have adjusted well to it.</li>
            <li>so this was a confident purchase I thought.  </li>
            <li>It took a bit more effort to get a close shave, but I enjoyed the process more.     </li>
            <li>I AM PLEASED WITH</li>
            <li>(mostly the fact you can rinse it out).  </li>
            <li>I have never purchased from this seller prior to this , but the item was great!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great buy for the price!</li>
            <li>I have to go over areas many times.</li>
            <li>I have a lite beard but still need to shave every day and this shaver leaves my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>wish surface area was greater. . .</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my husband isn&#x27;t using it 30 hours every two weeks.</li>
            <li>We got the 1 day shipping &amp; he got it the very next day, very impressive.</li>
            <li>he had a philips razor before for many years, so we knew the brand would be reliable.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to give it more of an effort and hope it goes as well as I hope it will</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>This was a good deal at Amazon, but right after I purchased it, both Wally World and Target had them on sale for about $40.</li>
            <li>The price was right at $49, and I feel it is a good product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Battery still holds pretty good charge and with every day use i can get almost 2 weeks of shaving out of it.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it best to use before wiskers get too long.    </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have this machine in 2008 and it is working as good as the first day</li>
            <li>Gives a good shave, but the charge is good for only 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>This shaver is producing excellent results, it is light weight and works silently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean by running a tap over it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers for more than 40 years, so it was no surprise that this one works fine, too.  </li>
            <li>The blades probably need replacement by now since i&#x27;ve noticed that it takes a bit more time to get a sort of smooth shave not</li>
            <li>Wow ....what a great shave ,and with no irritation to mention.  </li>
            <li>There is more sound from shaving than the motor itself.    </li>
            <li>would highly reccommend this shaver to anyone looking for a high quality shaver at a Great Price!!!</li>
            <li>Like the easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>I selected this unit for it&#x27;s easy cleaning (the easiest cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had)</li>
            <li>The last one was great, wondering what they would do to top it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to charge too.</li>
            <li>We needed to get this to our son very quickly, as he was going on a trip.</li>
            <li>it is really easy as it is waterproof and you can just rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>I like the floating head, and the fact that it can be rinsed with water easily.  </li>
            <li>and this is an easy to use shaver that does it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RVrsRUS</li>
            <li>Naturally, I wanted something as good or even better than the Norelco as a replacement.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is my first electric shaver and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it gives a clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure there are shavers with more bells and whistles for which you can pay a higher price.</li>
            <li>In general, this is a very nice shaver.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my Norelco 7775X Cool Skin Shaver, but gives a decent shave for the price.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t all that accurate, but it let you know if you needed to charge the thing before going on a trip.</li>
            <li>A huge difference is the sound/noise level.  </li>
            <li>Cheap Plastic  </li>
            <li>When I received the razor, I thought:  It look cools, but felt like a cheap knockoff in my hand.    </li>
            <li>Overall i&#x27;m happy with my purchase and</li>
            <li>The unit feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco is a breath of fresh air: it shaves very well, is nicely balanced in the hand, and is stylishly designed.  </li>
            <li>like under the nose and around the adam&#x27;s apple--effortlessly and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>So fully discharging the batteries before recharging may not be that important.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>PRO&#x27;s - It is designed to fit the hand well and the flip-type head simplifies cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Close shave, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t cut you, but it won&#x27;t easily make a clean edge for your sideburns, either.</li>
            <li>He couldn&#x27;t get over how quiet this razor was and what a great job it does.  </li>
            <li>The shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>shaver has cheap (plastic) feel to it</li>
            <li>This is extremely important since I use it every day</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>smooth and comfy shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>I wonder if Philips is joining the stampede of manufacturers going for cheap and substandard?  </li>
            <li>IT IS LIGHT</li>
            <li>The battery light starts blinking when it&#x27;s fuly charged, by the way.    </li>
            <li>The inside is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The unit is light and travels well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s comfortable and gets a close shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth cut.</li>
            <li>Easy to brush clean.</li>
            <li>I would pass on this razor unless you have a light beard.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the old Norelco 5801XL and it gave a good shave.  </li>
            <li>As far as shaving goes, it&#x27;s good, but not a miracle worker.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco died after a couple of years of good service</li>
            <li>A positive of the razor, though, is that once I&#x27;m done shaving I can just run it under warm water and clean it out.  </li>
            <li>Clean of the shaver is also very easy, all you need is hot running water.  </li>
            <li>This has been a very pleasant surprise, as I&#x27;m getting close shaves with less fuss and no irritation; I beginning to get the hang of this and even the neck area is doing well.    </li>
            <li>Some reviewers thought it wasn&#x27;t very powerful.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is this shaver is very smooth and is not noisey.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Each time I get a new one they get better and better.  </li>
            <li>it feels very refreshing and is soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>As usual this unit provides an excellent shave, close without irritation.  </li>
            <li>For me, this is a noticeable and moderately significant disadvantage.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still running on the original charge.  </li>
            <li>or so my original Norelco Chargable Razor gave up the ghost.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, smooth running, does a great job, replacement head cheaper than the new model and does better than the 8000 series.</li>
            <li>If I go a day or two without shaving, I have to shave three to four times to clean up areas it misses.      </li>
            <li>Rinse in water to clean and thats all.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Battery performance is best if you recharge only when the batteries are (almost) completely empty.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>After each use I just flip open the top and run some warm water over it.    </li>
            <li>like the way you can just rinse the head under water to clean .</li>
            <li>The product is just as described, clean shave and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Can  clean under the faucet</li>
            <li>Now you can clean it under the faucet, too.</li>
            <li>You can clean it under a faucet.  </li>
            <li>However, for the first time I am less impressed with the build quality.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is what I need, specially for travelling.</li>
            <li>I really like being able to rinse it clean with water after each shave.</li>
            <li>This 7140XL is very quiet and almost seems like it isn&#x27;t running very fast, but yet it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I still own my old 90&#x27;s vintage Norelco.  </li>
            <li>The shaver gives me a close, clean shave and does so remarkably quickly.  </li>
            <li>&quot; was the psychedelic school bus Ken Kesey created for Neal Cassady&#x27;s travels, celebrated by Tom Wolfe in \\&quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\&quot; (like Norelco electric shavers, still selling quite briskly on Amazon after all these years.  </li>
            <li>A shaver is only as good as its shaving head.</li>
            <li>I note that a \\&quot;leading consumer mag\\&quot; gave it a good middle of the road rating in this month&#x27;s issue.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good razor.  </li>
            <li>It gave me years of good service but finally died.</li>
            <li>Does a good job if I use it daily.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to try it on a full charge.</li>
            <li>I purchased this back to 2007 and still using it, this is good one</li>
            <li>This particular model is OK for light shaving (I only keep it in my motorhome)but does not have the better motor or shaving heads as top line models.</li>
            <li>and i found that dry worked better but still not as well as i would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>It would seem to me that the cost of replacement blades should be reduced, so that shavers might continue to be useful after the original blades are gone.</li>
            <li>He loves it, even though it took almost a day to charge the first time, he thinks it works fine.</li>
            <li>Not the best shaver in the world, but it&#x27;s also not the most expensive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery of this thing lasts for weeks and charging is fairly quick.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty glamorous shaver, but as I write, Amazon has it priced 20-30% higher than the more \\&quot;efficient and advanced\\</li>
            <li>I am so far very satisfied with this feature, and consider it one reason the shaver delivers consistently close shaves.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Those with steady hands and fingers can do better.  </li>
            <li>The shave is quick and close with no nicks.  </li>
            <li>so I can shave quickly and have a cut-free face.</li>
            <li>I am unaware of a car charger cord being available, but it would be nice.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this shaver, the second that I have had.  </li>
            <li>The first is that the \\&quot;charged\\&quot; light does not go on when fully charged.  </li>
            <li>However, the blade lasted a long time and it was good for touchup or when in a rush.</li>
            <li>In my eighty years as a consumer I have learned that new is not always better, but this experience was a plesant surprize.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a shaver that would give me a close shave without disrupting the skin on my face, be easy to take care of and reasonable in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I switched to this shaver after giving up a very old Norelco shaver and have been just as pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li>Again, my previous Norelco had much better design/placement for the trimmer in addition to being far more powerful and effective.</li>
            <li>Shaving heads have cushioning and the floating mechanism allows for a very close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Many equate power and performance with loud noise.</li>
            <li>Upgraded from an old Norelco to this and just love it.</li>
            <li>The old one felt better.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s wireless also makes it worth a buy.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers since 1960, and expected this one to be as good.</li>
            <li>IS BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS,,,,THIS SHAVER IS WORTH</li>
            <li>Still, it would have been better if the battery was made of NiMH or some technology that&#x27;s not 15 years old.</li>
            <li>this is a none issue for me, but is worth mentioning here.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco, which still worked OK, but was tricky to charge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything my old Norelco was, but better.  </li>
            <li>but the shave is okay to good; the absence of a low battery warning is a deficit</li>
            <li>The interesting bit is that I had gone to them about a month ago to buy a new shaving unit and they told me the HQ9 heads would work fine with these models, not just the HQ8; the HQ9 feel even better, so much so that I would definitely buy the 8xxx series which use the HQ9...</li>
            <li>But if I were to replace it right now I would get another one just like it.</li>
            <li>The battery last a week, while the quick charge is great when it does finally run out.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is just okay -- exactly like the old one.</li>
            <li>After several years of use from my previous Norelco which I was very happy with, I purchased the 7140.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, but it works great, is much quieter than my old razor, and does a descent job.</li>
            <li>My latest Norelco seemed to last only about 5 years but it is amazing how each generation of shavers is quieter.  </li>
            <li>His face seems smooth and he has not complained of razorburn not ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Very quiet operation, long charge, easy to clean, and most important - the closest shave</li>
            <li>The shave is better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used, though of course not as good as a regular blade.  </li>
            <li>This was the exact case, The razor shave most of the hair off my face easily, the battery is fantastic so far, and the only thing that sucked was my face became really irritated the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quiet, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several electric shavers and this one has the closest shave I have ever experienced outside hand shavers.</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend the razor after seeing what a good job it did with my 4 day old scruff.  </li>
            <li>TURNS AT MUCH SLOWER RATE THAN MY OLD NORELCO.A BETTER BATTERY IS NEEDED.</li>
            <li>but my first shave with it was as good as any from my previous electric razors.</li>
            <li>This thing is incredibly under powered and for me very hard to get a close shave.    </li>
            <li>Extremely quiet and very light weight.  </li>
            <li>This shaver cuts closer and runs very much quieter than the Remington that it replaced.</li>
            <li>This model is only passable if you have a very light beard</li>
            <li>Another company that doesn&#x27;t stand by its products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because my husband likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>Good Shaver, takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>Consistent close shaves, runs long on one charge, and cleans very easily.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>Initially the shaver performed better</li>
            <li>once this shaver is done I&#x27;ll most likely replace it with another Norelco.</li>
            <li>This time maybe something from a higher shelf.</li>
            <li>My first charge went 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>its not expensive</li>
            <li>The first lasted 9 years.  </li>
            <li>The next day with a charge even better.</li>
            <li>This is my first Norelco with a washable shave head.  </li>
            <li>First of this product is priced under 50 dollars so it is an entry level product.</li>
            <li>At first you will feel skin irritation however after you get used to it there should be none.</li>
            <li>Having reviewed a number of current models, the 7140 seemed most cost-effective.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first charge</li>
            <li>With this one, I&#x27;ve had two nicks in the first three weeks.</li>
            <li>I would have paid more, but Phillips just doesn&#x27;t make the shaver that I want, which would be similar to the old one -- no base, but with a charge meter.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy, but replacing my old one, for a dead battery, was way too much hassle and the result is a shaver that isn&#x27;t quite as nice as the one it replaced.    </li>
            <li>- who shaves first?</li>
            <li>This model cuts my beard closely and comfortably without needing frequent recharging.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this razor last week and I am extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is even better than my last.</li>
            <li>There are so many Norelco models and versions that I simply fell to leaning on Amazon buyer experience.</li>
            <li>With my first copy, I could not get the top lock back on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone over 2 weeks on the first charge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco products since I first started shaving 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li>If I wait a day, it will be spotty on getting all of my growth off on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>holds charge pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>My beard isn&#x27;t particularly thick, so this does the job just great.</li>
            <li>It cut a bit close, which irritated my skin at first, but I think that was just me getting used to the \\&quot;Lift &amp; cut.\\</li>
            <li>Just turn it on and you can feel that it&#x27;s a pretty wimpy motor inside.</li>
            <li>Personally quite pleased with my 7140XL.  </li>
            <li>Will likely stick with the brand for many years.</li>
            <li>I explained that I had followed the manual to the letter, cleaning the shaving heads and the hair chamber with hot running water.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It has a decent battery life, durable, and quick..</li>
            <li>I have had good success with Norelco in the past, and I would purchase another Norelco to replace this shaver when it dies.</li>
            <li>I was amazed to see the improvements, not only in the features of the razor and its maintence program, but also in the quality of the shave I am now enjoying.</li>
            <li>Since I am still using the first charge on it, there is nothing to report on durability, length of recharge life, etc.  </li>
            <li>but it is not my first choice.  </li>
            <li>not too heavy too hold, feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>Other than rinsing with hot water, one must remove the top lock and then clean each head.  </li>
            <li>My father had a Philips shaver (15 years old) that I tried 5 years ago and that machine did more thorough job than this new technology thing.</li>
            <li>I felt kind of dumb for awhile about mailing in my old razor&#x27;s rechardging cord, but not any more!  </li>
            <li>actually got this new  in box for $15 cuts great and rinses with water,have used it 3 weeks on  the same charge and still going strong.wish</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and clean shave</li>
            <li>Looked through many on Amazon, liked the Norelco name, and the fact that he could use it wet or dry, and that it was rechargeble.</li>
            <li>His old, cheap, noisy, corded one was getting too much for him to handle.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too satisfied the first month because it missed hairs and took really long</li>
            <li>Cuts better than my old one (the batteries would no longer take a charge - 7 yrs old).</li>
            <li>Good shave with less skin irritation vs. my older foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>I previously owned a very cheap electric razor and that was my very first razor.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because its results can be improved by following up with a blade (just as with every other electric I&#x27;ve tried), but it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for a long time and have always been satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>It shaves clean, but is kind of slow and gutless.</li>
            <li>- Cord is significantly shorter, so you&#x27;ll end up placing the razor right next to your outlet to charge or use.</li>
            <li>With the 7140, it&#x27;s easy enough to do after every shave.    </li>
            <li>Battery management is not as good as my previous one (as other reviewers noted) but I can easily get 10 days out of it before recharging.</li>
            <li>I generally replace the blades once a year, and don&#x27;t disassemble and clean them as often</li>
            <li>Very quiet unit and charges up just fine.  </li>
            <li>The cut is smooth and very close and also its very quiet...</li>
            <li>But that really gives a close shave.      </li>
            <li>The motor doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power.  </li>
            <li>It has given me the closest shave ever with an electric razor (which is all I use) with absolutely zero skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Your face and neck are left completely smooth.</li>
            <li>And this is much more convenient for me as I do not have to wet my face and shave for couple minutes.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re Hopalong Cassidy, the 7140 designer blue is your defense against the enemy of errant forestry; if you&#x27;re Neal Cassady, the 7240 is your \\&quot;Further\\&quot; for flying across the free and flagrant fields of stubble and heath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor gives a close shave and is very practical.</li>
            <li>it had a low charge indicator light.</li>
            <li>this shaver is quiet, efficient, comfortable, and I find that it minimizes the nuisance factor.</li>
            <li>I will stick with a real razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is much quieter also.</li>
            <li>A replacement cutter head set costs nearly as much as the whole razor costs, so</li>
            <li>(1)Shaving time is too much  </li>
            <li>(3)Even after spending so much time</li>
            <li>The design of the head is slightly different and it doesn&#x27;t move as smoothly over my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;gently used&#x27; one for 30 bucks plus 10 bucks shipping.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I do really like the ability to pop up the head and rinse it with water.</li>
            <li>Also, this model does not feature a low battery warning light</li>
            <li>it does not hold a charge very</li>
            <li>This razor works very well</li>
            <li>Every couple of days I use a disposable straight razor to get that even closer shave though.    </li>
            <li>got my razor straight out of the box and used it.</li>
            <li>The shaver works really well - just need to remember to keep it charged.  </li>
            <li>Takes about the same time but shave is comfortable and close.  </li>
            <li>The battery&#x27;s first run lasted for 4 days, but I may be taking a lot longer than normal while I learn.</li>
            <li>it is very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet, the charge lasts a couple of weeks, but the shaver takes 3 to 4 swipes over a 1-day growth stubble to fully cut it to a somewhat smooth level.</li>
            <li>my husband really likes this razor.</li>
            <li>The 7140XL shaves closer and is much quieter and lighter.  </li>
            <li>very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, shaves closer and smoother than my previous shaver, and the water cleaning and corded operation make it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a very useful and convenient device to have in your grooming kit.</li>
            <li>This is certainly much improved over my older Norelco Razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s essentially waterproof and easy to wash it one out under the tap (the instructions encourage you to do it this way) and get it squeaky clean after every single shave.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work to well, and I wondered if a spent a little more would the result be better.</li>
            <li>After a year and a half of good service my HQ7140 would not start even with the cord plugged in, unless I left it connected for a couple of hours...</li>
            <li>Holds a good charge, going on past 10 days now since the first initial charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li>It is pretty simple, but pretty much does everything I need a shaver to do without getting in the way.  </li>
            <li>I have since ordered a pair of NiCad batteries for about $8 and repaired my old Norelco - what I should have done in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Previous Norelcos that I have owned ran at much higher speeds and cut far more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a month now, and find its performance to be somewhat better than my previous Norelco shaver (5822) at this price point.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about being able just to rinse it under hot water, but that works just fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the most expensive one out there either, but preforms better than the 8000 series from Norelco.</li>
            <li>The big difference I love is that it is so quiet.  </li>
            <li>Better than expected and 100% improvement in shaving ease over my  10 year old one.       </li>
            <li>AND IS AT A DECENT PRICE</li>
            <li>I paid 1/2 of what I paid for his older one.</li>
            <li>I prefer the older model.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace an older model Norelco--a cordless \\&quot;black\\&quot; one.  </li>
            <li>so I pulled out my even older Braun to fill in for it--</li>
            <li>The 7140 is hell on the neck, particularly with a 2 day growth and tends to pull hairs rather than cut them.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is OUTSTANDING (at least right out of the box).  </li>
            <li>If your looking for a gift for a high school Grad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues with irritation with this model.. highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHAVER TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone that needs to take a break from the razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>May get a little irritation first week or so, after that fine.</li>
            <li>very sharp and quiet and light...very easy to clean with water...</li>
            <li>This one is much quieter and shaves much closer than the old one when it was new.</li>
            <li>It seems that with the amazing performance of some other types of batteries in items like digital cameras and cell phones</li>
            <li>They suggested taking the shaving unit off when I rinse it, use only warm (not hot) water, and *not* cleaning the hair chamber with water...</li>
            <li>Shopped little more and found this one for $45 from an Amazon seller for $45 and change, shipping included.  </li>
            <li>, it is a lot quicker than useing the little brush they furnish and does a better job of removing the wiskers.</li>
            <li>In the beginning it used to dry my skin out a lot and it used to take me a good half hour to shave my face.  </li>
            <li>The electric motor seems to spin much slower than my old shaver, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the performance.</li>
            <li>smooth close shave with absolutely no yanked whiskers.  </li>
            <li>The old one told me how much of a charge I had.</li>
            <li>I was happy to throw my expensive Braun in the garbage can.</li>
            <li>and I worry that if I drop it there won&#x27;t be much to salvage, as far as function</li>
            <li>Only comment is that it requires recharging more frequently that its claims but not enough of a problem to offset the quality of shave.  </li>
            <li>I was not comfortable buying one of these rotary-type shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li>Is this normal?  </li>
            <li>It cuts nicely with no pulling, but just seems to run too slowly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to people that have a need for a new razor.</li>
            <li>This particular unit seems to be too cheap vs. other models.  </li>
            <li>Charge time is 8+ hours for only 30 minutes of battery life, you&#x27;ve got to be kidding right.    </li>
            <li>I ordered this product one day and received it in the mail a couple of days later right on schedule.  </li>
            <li>They essentially sold me a brand new Philips HQ7120 as a replacement to use with my existing shaving unit for a reasonable price; it looks exactly the same except it has a \\&quot;Low\\&quot; red light.    </li>
            <li>When it stops shaving well, it makes more economic sense to just replace the entire unit every few years, as opposed to the shave head which costs almost as much.</li>
            <li>This razor does provide a decently close shave, but I have pretty thick and strong beard hairs.</li>
            <li>I am tempted to buy it new blades and use it over this razor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the new power cord arrangement.</li>
            <li>Bought a new cell phone that didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>so we end up either giving the new shaver away or throwing it away.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this product to any one needing a new razor.</li>
            <li>Not living in the stone age anymore with my new,  Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll keep this new one as a backup</li>
            <li>If it is not fully charged or plugged in, the razor is hopeless to get a clean shave on a partial charge.</li>
            <li>I am still using the same blades, and find no reason to change them (it would be better to buy a new shaver, due to the cost of the blades).  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed with the 7140XL is how quiet it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quiet that at first it seemed like it must need charging</li>
            <li>This razor is 10 times the razor my old one was!  </li>
            <li>I have been a Norelco user all my life and this was the first time encountering such a problem.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know who these caveman beards are, but i can tell you my beard is pretty dense, especially around my chin and my neck and this razor</li>
            <li>but if if proves to be reliable over the long haul I would recommend this razor to anyone considering switching to or upgrading an electric.</li>
            <li>The fact that it will run while plugged into the wall makes this a much better choice for me than its more expensive cousins as I can still shave when the battery is low</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks to see if I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I had the 5885 repaired at a Philips authorized place, but it still didn&#x27;t take much of a charge, so I went back again and, in the end, still didn&#x27;t have a razor that I could use for more than a few days.</li>
            <li>But I consider this a waste of $50, and I wish I had spent more to get something that&#x27;s actually useful to me.</li>
            <li>Sure, blades get dull and all that, but this seems to have happened very quickly compared to previous Norelcos I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>but again i&#x27;m suspecting that it&#x27;s a problem that will be fixed once i get new blades.     </li>
            <li>I had to purchase a new electric razor because my charger for my old Norelco was damaged in an electrical storm.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and have only positive feedback to report.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is pretty useless, but I haven&#x27;t had a good trimmer on an electric shaver in the last 25 years, so I don&#x27;t expect it.</li>
            <li>I have had NO other issues with this model and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The floating heads do a great job positioning the cutting surfaces on your face.</li>
            <li>2)Shaver head swings away instead of coming clear off shaver body.  </li>
            <li>I am 74 years old, retired M.D.</li>
            <li>time will tell if it lasts as long as the first.</li>
            <li>So far, it meets my needs.  </li>
            <li>This one replaced a 3 year old Remington triple head that&#x27;s battery would no longer take a charge.</li>
            <li>Shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip.</li>
            <li>I have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart, but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave, and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face.  </li>
            <li>I mailed in the recharging cord to my old Norelco razor instead of the phone&#x27;s cord by mistake.  </li>
            <li>Well, they don&#x27;t make my old razor anymore, but I could buy a</li>
            <li>It shaves way, way smoother and faster and gentler than my old one did.  </li>
            <li>I also have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This lasted me about two years of in frequent use.</li>
            <li>He ends up with his old one.  </li>
            <li>THIS RAZOR IS SO QUIET AND SHAVES REAL CLOSE.</li>
            <li>I find myself pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Graet shaver for the price pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>- far quieter  - waterproof (don&#x27;t plan on bringing it into the shower, though)  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t know why I bothered to replace batteries and blades in the old one.  </li>
            <li>One difference from the old to this one:  Weight.  </li>
            <li>The old one you could tell the difference from when it was fully charged versus when it was near the end of it&#x27;s charge.  </li>
            <li>This price is the same as those cheep imitations at WalMart and Walgreen&#x27;s which are really under powered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for a couple weeks now and can say that it&#x27;s worked well so far.  </li>
            <li>I forgot how deafeningly loud the Braun is.  </li>
            <li>It shaves close without tearing up my face, and it takes far fewer passes than the Braun to get my face fuzz-free.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am quite pleased and have to wonder if I&#x27;m missing something by not buying one of the $150 models.  </li>
            <li>It was worth every penny I spent for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a great fan of electric shavers, but this one does a really nice job.</li>
            <li>This razor does not get the stubborn more thick hairs like my old 35$ norelco used to-which I had used for 4 years.</li>
            <li>Its price is very reasonable, I purchased it even though I was actually looking to purchase replacement blades for another shaver, but found that the price of a new one was not much above the cost of replacement blades.</li>
            <li>The new one, you can barely tell that it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>This model gives an extremely close and comfortable shave, and is quiet.</li>
            <li>Owning more expensive models, I received an average of ten years economical service from each on my elderly face with a fairly light beard.  </li>
            <li>the long run, this razor is cheap enough and I expect the battery to last for years.  </li>
            <li>The new features I am experiencing with this model are light weight, quiet, rinsable, and the way the whole razor head pivots inward (I&#x27;m not sure if this is their Precision Cutting System, Superior Lift &amp; Cut Technology, or Patented Reflex Action Shaving System)when</li>
            <li>In general, Phillips makes way too many models and it&#x27;s awfully confusing trying to sort out the differences.    </li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t give a clean shave..leave a few hair here</li>
            <li>You still have to make a few passes over an area to get all of it clean.    </li>
            <li>A quick shave takes less than a minute</li>
            <li>The main problem is the low speed at which this razor runs.  </li>
            <li>Decent cut but takes several passes to get a close cut.  </li>
            <li>The pros of my new 7140XL and my old model are:  - new razor seems to need less passes for a very close shave  </li>
            <li>I mean, it sounds very anemic, like it&#x27;s already running out of charge, and I gave it a full overnight 8 hour charge.    </li>
            <li>If the new razor doesn&#x27;t measure up to the old 90&#x27;s era razor, then I will try buying a different brand.</li>
            <li>] I need a new electric shaver after my old one finally died.</li>
            <li>It has no power whatsoever compared to my previous Norelco, and I can go over light stubble several times and still feel plenty that it has missed.</li>
            <li>quiet, quick and extremely close shave.</li>
            <li>This is a new Norelco, and I have been using that product for several years.    </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to any person wanting to switch to a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>He was using a similar razor but needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Major cons ::  </li>
            <li>major problem involves cleaning this razor.</li>
            <li>The unit is only six months old!</li>
            <li>plain and simple cut it smooth with just one pass.</li>
            <li>I must say the new model is much lighter, however the quality of the shave and the harshness on my face is less than acceptible.  </li>
            <li>Not having a low battery indicator is the most serious deficiency of the 7140.    </li>
            <li>is a little bit short after a full charge.</li>
            <li>Blades start to dull in about a month and have to repeat shaving strokes way to many times and takes too long to get a close shave...</li>
            <li>So did two wires that fit delicately into plastic parts on the lock.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I could definitely recommend this product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it may knock the old saying you only get what you pay for...</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised at the performance of this razor, especially at the price.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after my 10 year old Norelco&#x27;s battery didn&#x27;t last anymore.</li>
            <li>Anyhow... I&#x27;m going back to old way.</li>
            <li>Ordered this shaver after my old unit suddenly quit.  </li>
            <li>You will also have to buy a replacement eventually, apparently there is a known issue with the on/off button.  </li>
            <li>I passed my 3 year old and more expensive Norelco off to my 90 year old father-in-law</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better, but I&#x27;ve also had a lot worse.  </li>
            <li>My old razor was due for some new blades anyway</li>
            <li>This really has been one of the most disappointing things I&#x27;ve purchased through amazon.</li>
            <li>I would have deducted two stars for the lack of a low battery indicator, were it not for the apparent use of NiMH batteries and the effectiveness of wash-through cleaning of the shave head.  </li>
            <li>and it holds a charge longer then what the manual suggests...1 full charge {8 hrs} on this razor and you will get at least</li>
            <li>It was everything the hype claimed it would be and cost less than I could have bought it in town at at a large discount store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer works very well, even for \\&quot;down there\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I would usually spray water right into the unit and then swab some gunk away with a q-tip.  </li>
            <li>The head protector cap is a bit chintzy as it does not cover the whole head assembly as my previous Norelco&#x27;s did-</li>
            <li>Of course I do not have that much hair to shave on my face like the previous reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning is much easier than with the previous razor because I can do it with running water instead of a brush.  </li>
            <li>However it seems to run much slower than previous models I have used.</li>
            <li>The charge last a long time as far as I can see.</li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery in the 7140 is the old \\&quot;memory\\&quot; type which won&#x27;t last you all that long.  </li>
            <li>Since my husband has had a norelco shaver forever, I was a little hesitant  about purchasing this one as he compares all his new shavers to his old  one and always complains that they don&#x27;t give as close a shave</li>
            <li>Hopalong Cassidy (aka William Boyd), on the other hand, was a screen cowboy--a contemporary of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, distinguished from them by his white hair matched to his white horse (whereas Trigger and Champion were colored).  </li>
            <li>On average it takes 15+ minutes to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>when someone wants to leave a little stubble).</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver with high expectations, but honestly I&#x27;ve been disappointed by the results.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]]  Excellent shaver, have been using Norelco shavers for many years,  (I am 84).</li>

            <li> Nice razor for the price.  </li>

            <li> One thing to note: it does not come with a case of any kind; just a plastic blade protector.    </li>
            <li> and he is thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> As nice perk</li>
            <li> It effectively gets at the troublesome neck area and chin.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave and can be used with or without a cord.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor as a nice replacement</li>
            <li> For one thing, it&#x27;s whisper-quiet, which is nice in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them all, Braun, Panasonic, and Norelco and this particular model is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> gives a good clean close cut Very Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Holds a good charge been using it every day for over a week and still going strong.</li>
            <li> it seems very easy.</li>
            <li> i find the cleaning very easy. .</li>
            <li> Being able to rinse it out after shaving is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse out the head under running water.     </li>
            <li> Upgraded to this razor after my old Remington died, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The shaver feels good in the hand,and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great shaver for a great price compared to the stores, no lie.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for our anniversary, and he said it&#x27;s a great razor for a first timer using electric razors.</li>
            <li> That reinforced my feeling that I made a good choice for the price - performance sweet spot.</li>
            <li> The shave is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for many years.  </li>
            <li> And, yes, it would be better if it used NiMH batteries instead of NiCAD.</li>
            <li> It took more than 20 days before getting satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is much better.</li>
            <li> this razor works great and cuts very close.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s OK for 2 years of use.</li>
            <li> i could and would get more</li>
            <li> well you get more from this razor in my opinion</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a month, but I feel I made an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I get more than 10 days per charge</li>
            <li> this shaver gave at such an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is more efficient.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and then 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> but I love this razor now that my skin seems to have adjusted well to it.</li>
            <li> so this was a confident purchase I thought.  </li>
            <li> It took a bit more effort to get a close shave, but I enjoyed the process more.     </li>
            <li> I AM PLEASED WITH</li>
            <li> (mostly the fact you can rinse it out).  </li>
            <li> I have never purchased from this seller prior to this , but the item was great!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> I have to go over areas many times.</li>
            <li> I have a lite beard but still need to shave every day and this shaver leaves my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> wish surface area was greater. . .</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my husband isn&#x27;t using it 30 hours every two weeks.</li>
            <li> We got the 1 day shipping &amp; he got it the very next day, very impressive.</li>
            <li> he had a philips razor before for many years, so we knew the brand would be reliable.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to give it more of an effort and hope it goes as well as I hope it will</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> This was a good deal at Amazon, but right after I purchased it, both Wally World and Target had them on sale for about $40.</li>
            <li> The price was right at $49, and I feel it is a good product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Battery still holds pretty good charge and with every day use i can get almost 2 weeks of shaving out of it.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it best to use before wiskers get too long.    </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have this machine in 2008 and it is working as good as the first day</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave, but the charge is good for only 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This shaver is producing excellent results, it is light weight and works silently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean by running a tap over it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers for more than 40 years, so it was no surprise that this one works fine, too.  </li>
            <li> The blades probably need replacement by now since i&#x27;ve noticed that it takes a bit more time to get a sort of smooth shave not</li>
            <li> Wow ....what a great shave ,and with no irritation to mention.  </li>
            <li> There is more sound from shaving than the motor itself.    </li>
            <li> would highly reccommend this shaver to anyone looking for a high quality shaver at a Great Price!!!</li>
            <li> Like the easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I selected this unit for it&#x27;s easy cleaning (the easiest cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had)</li>
            <li> The last one was great, wondering what they would do to top it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge too.</li>
            <li> We needed to get this to our son very quickly, as he was going on a trip.</li>
            <li> it is really easy as it is waterproof and you can just rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> I like the floating head, and the fact that it can be rinsed with water easily.  </li>
            <li> and this is an easy to use shaver that does it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RVrsRUS</li>
            <li> Naturally, I wanted something as good or even better than the Norelco as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is my first electric shaver and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it gives a clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure there are shavers with more bells and whistles for which you can pay a higher price.</li>
            <li> In general, this is a very nice shaver.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my Norelco 7775X Cool Skin Shaver, but gives a decent shave for the price.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t all that accurate, but it let you know if you needed to charge the thing before going on a trip.</li>
            <li> A huge difference is the sound/noise level.  </li>
            <li> Cheap Plastic  </li>
            <li> When I received the razor, I thought:  It look cools, but felt like a cheap knockoff in my hand.    </li>
            <li> Overall i&#x27;m happy with my purchase and</li>
            <li> The unit feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco is a breath of fresh air: it shaves very well, is nicely balanced in the hand, and is stylishly designed.  </li>
            <li> like under the nose and around the adam&#x27;s apple--effortlessly and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> So fully discharging the batteries before recharging may not be that important.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> PRO&#x27;s - It is designed to fit the hand well and the flip-type head simplifies cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Close shave, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cut you, but it won&#x27;t easily make a clean edge for your sideburns, either.</li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t get over how quiet this razor was and what a great job it does.  </li>
            <li> The shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> shaver has cheap (plastic) feel to it</li>
            <li> This is extremely important since I use it every day</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> smooth and comfy shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> I wonder if Philips is joining the stampede of manufacturers going for cheap and substandard?  </li>
            <li> IT IS LIGHT</li>
            <li> The battery light starts blinking when it&#x27;s fuly charged, by the way.    </li>
            <li> The inside is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The unit is light and travels well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comfortable and gets a close shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth cut.</li>
            <li> Easy to brush clean.</li>
            <li> I would pass on this razor unless you have a light beard.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the old Norelco 5801XL and it gave a good shave.  </li>
            <li> As far as shaving goes, it&#x27;s good, but not a miracle worker.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco died after a couple of years of good service</li>
            <li> A positive of the razor, though, is that once I&#x27;m done shaving I can just run it under warm water and clean it out.  </li>
            <li> Clean of the shaver is also very easy, all you need is hot running water.  </li>
            <li> This has been a very pleasant surprise, as I&#x27;m getting close shaves with less fuss and no irritation; I beginning to get the hang of this and even the neck area is doing well.    </li>
            <li> Some reviewers thought it wasn&#x27;t very powerful.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is this shaver is very smooth and is not noisey.</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Each time I get a new one they get better and better.  </li>
            <li> it feels very refreshing and is soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> As usual this unit provides an excellent shave, close without irritation.  </li>
            <li> For me, this is a noticeable and moderately significant disadvantage.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still running on the original charge.  </li>
            <li> or so my original Norelco Chargable Razor gave up the ghost.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, smooth running, does a great job, replacement head cheaper than the new model and does better than the 8000 series.</li>
            <li> If I go a day or two without shaving, I have to shave three to four times to clean up areas it misses.      </li>
            <li> Rinse in water to clean and thats all.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Battery performance is best if you recharge only when the batteries are (almost) completely empty.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> After each use I just flip open the top and run some warm water over it.    </li>
            <li> like the way you can just rinse the head under water to clean .</li>
            <li> The product is just as described, clean shave and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Can  clean under the faucet</li>
            <li> Now you can clean it under the faucet, too.</li>
            <li> You can clean it under a faucet.  </li>
            <li> However, for the first time I am less impressed with the build quality.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is what I need, specially for travelling.</li>
            <li> I really like being able to rinse it clean with water after each shave.</li>
            <li> This 7140XL is very quiet and almost seems like it isn&#x27;t running very fast, but yet it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I still own my old 90&#x27;s vintage Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The shaver gives me a close, clean shave and does so remarkably quickly.  </li>
            <li> &quot; was the psychedelic school bus Ken Kesey created for Neal Cassady&#x27;s travels, celebrated by Tom Wolfe in \\&quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\&quot; (like Norelco electric shavers, still selling quite briskly on Amazon after all these years.  </li>
            <li> A shaver is only as good as its shaving head.</li>
            <li> I note that a \\&quot;leading consumer mag\\&quot; gave it a good middle of the road rating in this month&#x27;s issue.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good razor.  </li>
            <li> It gave me years of good service but finally died.</li>
            <li> Does a good job if I use it daily.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to try it on a full charge.</li>
            <li> I purchased this back to 2007 and still using it, this is good one</li>
            <li> This particular model is OK for light shaving (I only keep it in my motorhome)but does not have the better motor or shaving heads as top line models.</li>
            <li> and i found that dry worked better but still not as well as i would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> It would seem to me that the cost of replacement blades should be reduced, so that shavers might continue to be useful after the original blades are gone.</li>
            <li> He loves it, even though it took almost a day to charge the first time, he thinks it works fine.</li>
            <li> Not the best shaver in the world, but it&#x27;s also not the most expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery of this thing lasts for weeks and charging is fairly quick.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty glamorous shaver, but as I write, Amazon has it priced 20-30% higher than the more \\&quot;efficient and advanced\\</li>
            <li> I am so far very satisfied with this feature, and consider it one reason the shaver delivers consistently close shaves.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Those with steady hands and fingers can do better.  </li>
            <li> The shave is quick and close with no nicks.  </li>
            <li> so I can shave quickly and have a cut-free face.</li>
            <li> I am unaware of a car charger cord being available, but it would be nice.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this shaver, the second that I have had.  </li>
            <li> The first is that the \\&quot;charged\\&quot; light does not go on when fully charged.  </li>
            <li> However, the blade lasted a long time and it was good for touchup or when in a rush.</li>
            <li> In my eighty years as a consumer I have learned that new is not always better, but this experience was a plesant surprize.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a shaver that would give me a close shave without disrupting the skin on my face, be easy to take care of and reasonable in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I switched to this shaver after giving up a very old Norelco shaver and have been just as pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li> Again, my previous Norelco had much better design/placement for the trimmer in addition to being far more powerful and effective.</li>
            <li> Shaving heads have cushioning and the floating mechanism allows for a very close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Many equate power and performance with loud noise.</li>
            <li> Upgraded from an old Norelco to this and just love it.</li>
            <li> The old one felt better.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s wireless also makes it worth a buy.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers since 1960, and expected this one to be as good.</li>
            <li> IS BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS,,,,THIS SHAVER IS WORTH</li>
            <li> Still, it would have been better if the battery was made of NiMH or some technology that&#x27;s not 15 years old.</li>
            <li> this is a none issue for me, but is worth mentioning here.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco, which still worked OK, but was tricky to charge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything my old Norelco was, but better.  </li>
            <li> but the shave is okay to good; the absence of a low battery warning is a deficit</li>
            <li> The interesting bit is that I had gone to them about a month ago to buy a new shaving unit and they told me the HQ9 heads would work fine with these models, not just the HQ8; the HQ9 feel even better, so much so that I would definitely buy the 8xxx series which use the HQ9...</li>
            <li> But if I were to replace it right now I would get another one just like it.</li>
            <li> The battery last a week, while the quick charge is great when it does finally run out.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is just okay -- exactly like the old one.</li>
            <li> After several years of use from my previous Norelco which I was very happy with, I purchased the 7140.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, but it works great, is much quieter than my old razor, and does a descent job.</li>
            <li> My latest Norelco seemed to last only about 5 years but it is amazing how each generation of shavers is quieter.  </li>
            <li> His face seems smooth and he has not complained of razorburn not ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Very quiet operation, long charge, easy to clean, and most important - the closest shave</li>
            <li> The shave is better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used, though of course not as good as a regular blade.  </li>
            <li> This was the exact case, The razor shave most of the hair off my face easily, the battery is fantastic so far, and the only thing that sucked was my face became really irritated the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quiet, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several electric shavers and this one has the closest shave I have ever experienced outside hand shavers.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend the razor after seeing what a good job it did with my 4 day old scruff.  </li>
            <li> TURNS AT MUCH SLOWER RATE THAN MY OLD NORELCO.A BETTER BATTERY IS NEEDED.</li>
            <li> but my first shave with it was as good as any from my previous electric razors.</li>
            <li> This thing is incredibly under powered and for me very hard to get a close shave.    </li>
            <li> Extremely quiet and very light weight.  </li>
            <li> This shaver cuts closer and runs very much quieter than the Remington that it replaced.</li>
            <li> This model is only passable if you have a very light beard</li>
            <li> Another company that doesn&#x27;t stand by its products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because my husband likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> Good Shaver, takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Consistent close shaves, runs long on one charge, and cleans very easily.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> Initially the shaver performed better</li>
            <li> once this shaver is done I&#x27;ll most likely replace it with another Norelco.</li>
            <li> This time maybe something from a higher shelf.</li>
            <li> My first charge went 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> its not expensive</li>
            <li> The first lasted 9 years.  </li>
            <li> The next day with a charge even better.</li>
            <li> This is my first Norelco with a washable shave head.  </li>
            <li> First of this product is priced under 50 dollars so it is an entry level product.</li>
            <li> At first you will feel skin irritation however after you get used to it there should be none.</li>
            <li> Having reviewed a number of current models, the 7140 seemed most cost-effective.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on the first charge</li>
            <li> With this one, I&#x27;ve had two nicks in the first three weeks.</li>
            <li> I would have paid more, but Phillips just doesn&#x27;t make the shaver that I want, which would be similar to the old one -- no base, but with a charge meter.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy, but replacing my old one, for a dead battery, was way too much hassle and the result is a shaver that isn&#x27;t quite as nice as the one it replaced.    </li>
            <li> - who shaves first?</li>
            <li> This model cuts my beard closely and comfortably without needing frequent recharging.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this razor last week and I am extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is even better than my last.</li>
            <li> There are so many Norelco models and versions that I simply fell to leaning on Amazon buyer experience.</li>
            <li> With my first copy, I could not get the top lock back on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone over 2 weeks on the first charge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco products since I first started shaving 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li> If I wait a day, it will be spotty on getting all of my growth off on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> holds charge pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> My beard isn&#x27;t particularly thick, so this does the job just great.</li>
            <li> It cut a bit close, which irritated my skin at first, but I think that was just me getting used to the \\&quot;Lift &amp; cut.\\</li>
            <li> Just turn it on and you can feel that it&#x27;s a pretty wimpy motor inside.</li>
            <li> Personally quite pleased with my 7140XL.  </li>
            <li> Will likely stick with the brand for many years.</li>
            <li> I explained that I had followed the manual to the letter, cleaning the shaving heads and the hair chamber with hot running water.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It has a decent battery life, durable, and quick..</li>
            <li> I have had good success with Norelco in the past, and I would purchase another Norelco to replace this shaver when it dies.</li>
            <li> I was amazed to see the improvements, not only in the features of the razor and its maintence program, but also in the quality of the shave I am now enjoying.</li>
            <li> Since I am still using the first charge on it, there is nothing to report on durability, length of recharge life, etc.  </li>
            <li> but it is not my first choice.  </li>
            <li> not too heavy too hold, feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Other than rinsing with hot water, one must remove the top lock and then clean each head.  </li>
            <li> My father had a Philips shaver (15 years old) that I tried 5 years ago and that machine did more thorough job than this new technology thing.</li>
            <li> I felt kind of dumb for awhile about mailing in my old razor&#x27;s rechardging cord, but not any more!  </li>
            <li> actually got this new  in box for $15 cuts great and rinses with water,have used it 3 weeks on  the same charge and still going strong.wish</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and clean shave</li>
            <li> Looked through many on Amazon, liked the Norelco name, and the fact that he could use it wet or dry, and that it was rechargeble.</li>
            <li> His old, cheap, noisy, corded one was getting too much for him to handle.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too satisfied the first month because it missed hairs and took really long</li>
            <li> Cuts better than my old one (the batteries would no longer take a charge - 7 yrs old).</li>
            <li> Good shave with less skin irritation vs. my older foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned a very cheap electric razor and that was my very first razor.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because its results can be improved by following up with a blade (just as with every other electric I&#x27;ve tried), but it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for a long time and have always been satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It shaves clean, but is kind of slow and gutless.</li>
            <li> - Cord is significantly shorter, so you&#x27;ll end up placing the razor right next to your outlet to charge or use.</li>
            <li> With the 7140, it&#x27;s easy enough to do after every shave.    </li>
            <li> Battery management is not as good as my previous one (as other reviewers noted) but I can easily get 10 days out of it before recharging.</li>
            <li> I generally replace the blades once a year, and don&#x27;t disassemble and clean them as often</li>
            <li> Very quiet unit and charges up just fine.  </li>
            <li> The cut is smooth and very close and also its very quiet...</li>
            <li> But that really gives a close shave.      </li>
            <li> The motor doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power.  </li>
            <li> It has given me the closest shave ever with an electric razor (which is all I use) with absolutely zero skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Your face and neck are left completely smooth.</li>
            <li> And this is much more convenient for me as I do not have to wet my face and shave for couple minutes.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re Hopalong Cassidy, the 7140 designer blue is your defense against the enemy of errant forestry; if you&#x27;re Neal Cassady, the 7240 is your \\&quot;Further\\&quot; for flying across the free and flagrant fields of stubble and heath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor gives a close shave and is very practical.</li>
            <li> it had a low charge indicator light.</li>
            <li> this shaver is quiet, efficient, comfortable, and I find that it minimizes the nuisance factor.</li>
            <li> I will stick with a real razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is much quieter also.</li>
            <li> A replacement cutter head set costs nearly as much as the whole razor costs, so</li>
            <li> (1)Shaving time is too much  </li>
            <li> (3)Even after spending so much time</li>
            <li> The design of the head is slightly different and it doesn&#x27;t move as smoothly over my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;gently used&#x27; one for 30 bucks plus 10 bucks shipping.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I do really like the ability to pop up the head and rinse it with water.</li>
            <li> Also, this model does not feature a low battery warning light</li>
            <li> it does not hold a charge very</li>
            <li> This razor works very well</li>
            <li> Every couple of days I use a disposable straight razor to get that even closer shave though.    </li>
            <li> got my razor straight out of the box and used it.</li>
            <li> The shaver works really well - just need to remember to keep it charged.  </li>
            <li> Takes about the same time but shave is comfortable and close.  </li>
            <li> The battery&#x27;s first run lasted for 4 days, but I may be taking a lot longer than normal while I learn.</li>
            <li> it is very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet, the charge lasts a couple of weeks, but the shaver takes 3 to 4 swipes over a 1-day growth stubble to fully cut it to a somewhat smooth level.</li>
            <li> my husband really likes this razor.</li>
            <li> The 7140XL shaves closer and is much quieter and lighter.  </li>
            <li> very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, shaves closer and smoother than my previous shaver, and the water cleaning and corded operation make it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a very useful and convenient device to have in your grooming kit.</li>
            <li> This is certainly much improved over my older Norelco Razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially waterproof and easy to wash it one out under the tap (the instructions encourage you to do it this way) and get it squeaky clean after every single shave.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work to well, and I wondered if a spent a little more would the result be better.</li>
            <li> After a year and a half of good service my HQ7140 would not start even with the cord plugged in, unless I left it connected for a couple of hours...</li>
            <li> Holds a good charge, going on past 10 days now since the first initial charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li> It is pretty simple, but pretty much does everything I need a shaver to do without getting in the way.  </li>
            <li> I have since ordered a pair of NiCad batteries for about $8 and repaired my old Norelco - what I should have done in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Previous Norelcos that I have owned ran at much higher speeds and cut far more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a month now, and find its performance to be somewhat better than my previous Norelco shaver (5822) at this price point.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about being able just to rinse it under hot water, but that works just fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the most expensive one out there either, but preforms better than the 8000 series from Norelco.</li>
            <li> The big difference I love is that it is so quiet.  </li>
            <li> Better than expected and 100% improvement in shaving ease over my  10 year old one.       </li>
            <li> AND IS AT A DECENT PRICE</li>
            <li> I paid 1/2 of what I paid for his older one.</li>
            <li> I prefer the older model.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace an older model Norelco--a cordless \\&quot;black\\&quot; one.  </li>
            <li> so I pulled out my even older Braun to fill in for it--</li>
            <li> The 7140 is hell on the neck, particularly with a 2 day growth and tends to pull hairs rather than cut them.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is OUTSTANDING (at least right out of the box).  </li>
            <li> If your looking for a gift for a high school Grad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with irritation with this model.. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHAVER TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone that needs to take a break from the razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> May get a little irritation first week or so, after that fine.</li>
            <li> very sharp and quiet and light...very easy to clean with water...</li>
            <li> This one is much quieter and shaves much closer than the old one when it was new.</li>
            <li> It seems that with the amazing performance of some other types of batteries in items like digital cameras and cell phones</li>
            <li> They suggested taking the shaving unit off when I rinse it, use only warm (not hot) water, and *not* cleaning the hair chamber with water...</li>
            <li> Shopped little more and found this one for $45 from an Amazon seller for $45 and change, shipping included.  </li>
            <li> , it is a lot quicker than useing the little brush they furnish and does a better job of removing the wiskers.</li>
            <li> In the beginning it used to dry my skin out a lot and it used to take me a good half hour to shave my face.  </li>
            <li> The electric motor seems to spin much slower than my old shaver, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the performance.</li>
            <li> smooth close shave with absolutely no yanked whiskers.  </li>
            <li> The old one told me how much of a charge I had.</li>
            <li> I was happy to throw my expensive Braun in the garbage can.</li>
            <li> and I worry that if I drop it there won&#x27;t be much to salvage, as far as function</li>
            <li> Only comment is that it requires recharging more frequently that its claims but not enough of a problem to offset the quality of shave.  </li>
            <li> I was not comfortable buying one of these rotary-type shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li> Is this normal?  </li>
            <li> It cuts nicely with no pulling, but just seems to run too slowly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to people that have a need for a new razor.</li>
            <li> This particular unit seems to be too cheap vs. other models.  </li>
            <li> Charge time is 8+ hours for only 30 minutes of battery life, you&#x27;ve got to be kidding right.    </li>
            <li> I ordered this product one day and received it in the mail a couple of days later right on schedule.  </li>
            <li> They essentially sold me a brand new Philips HQ7120 as a replacement to use with my existing shaving unit for a reasonable price; it looks exactly the same except it has a \\&quot;Low\\&quot; red light.    </li>
            <li> When it stops shaving well, it makes more economic sense to just replace the entire unit every few years, as opposed to the shave head which costs almost as much.</li>
            <li> This razor does provide a decently close shave, but I have pretty thick and strong beard hairs.</li>
            <li> I am tempted to buy it new blades and use it over this razor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the new power cord arrangement.</li>
            <li> Bought a new cell phone that didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> so we end up either giving the new shaver away or throwing it away.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to any one needing a new razor.</li>
            <li> Not living in the stone age anymore with my new,  Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll keep this new one as a backup</li>
            <li> If it is not fully charged or plugged in, the razor is hopeless to get a clean shave on a partial charge.</li>
            <li> I am still using the same blades, and find no reason to change them (it would be better to buy a new shaver, due to the cost of the blades).  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed with the 7140XL is how quiet it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quiet that at first it seemed like it must need charging</li>
            <li> This razor is 10 times the razor my old one was!  </li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user all my life and this was the first time encountering such a problem.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know who these caveman beards are, but i can tell you my beard is pretty dense, especially around my chin and my neck and this razor</li>
            <li> but if if proves to be reliable over the long haul I would recommend this razor to anyone considering switching to or upgrading an electric.</li>
            <li> The fact that it will run while plugged into the wall makes this a much better choice for me than its more expensive cousins as I can still shave when the battery is low</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks to see if I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I had the 5885 repaired at a Philips authorized place, but it still didn&#x27;t take much of a charge, so I went back again and, in the end, still didn&#x27;t have a razor that I could use for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> But I consider this a waste of $50, and I wish I had spent more to get something that&#x27;s actually useful to me.</li>
            <li> Sure, blades get dull and all that, but this seems to have happened very quickly compared to previous Norelcos I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> but again i&#x27;m suspecting that it&#x27;s a problem that will be fixed once i get new blades.     </li>
            <li> I had to purchase a new electric razor because my charger for my old Norelco was damaged in an electrical storm.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and have only positive feedback to report.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is pretty useless, but I haven&#x27;t had a good trimmer on an electric shaver in the last 25 years, so I don&#x27;t expect it.</li>
            <li> I have had NO other issues with this model and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The floating heads do a great job positioning the cutting surfaces on your face.</li>
            <li> 2)Shaver head swings away instead of coming clear off shaver body.  </li>
            <li> I am 74 years old, retired M.D.</li>
            <li> time will tell if it lasts as long as the first.</li>
            <li> So far, it meets my needs.  </li>
            <li> This one replaced a 3 year old Remington triple head that&#x27;s battery would no longer take a charge.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip.</li>
            <li> I have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart, but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave, and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face.  </li>
            <li> I mailed in the recharging cord to my old Norelco razor instead of the phone&#x27;s cord by mistake.  </li>
            <li> Well, they don&#x27;t make my old razor anymore, but I could buy a</li>
            <li> It shaves way, way smoother and faster and gentler than my old one did.  </li>
            <li> I also have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This lasted me about two years of in frequent use.</li>
            <li> He ends up with his old one.  </li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS SO QUIET AND SHAVES REAL CLOSE.</li>
            <li> I find myself pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Graet shaver for the price pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> - far quieter  - waterproof (don&#x27;t plan on bringing it into the shower, though)  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t know why I bothered to replace batteries and blades in the old one.  </li>
            <li> One difference from the old to this one:  Weight.  </li>
            <li> The old one you could tell the difference from when it was fully charged versus when it was near the end of it&#x27;s charge.  </li>
            <li> This price is the same as those cheep imitations at WalMart and Walgreen&#x27;s which are really under powered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a couple weeks now and can say that it&#x27;s worked well so far.  </li>
            <li> I forgot how deafeningly loud the Braun is.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close without tearing up my face, and it takes far fewer passes than the Braun to get my face fuzz-free.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am quite pleased and have to wonder if I&#x27;m missing something by not buying one of the $150 models.  </li>
            <li> It was worth every penny I spent for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a great fan of electric shavers, but this one does a really nice job.</li>
            <li> This razor does not get the stubborn more thick hairs like my old 35$ norelco used to-which I had used for 4 years.</li>
            <li> Its price is very reasonable, I purchased it even though I was actually looking to purchase replacement blades for another shaver, but found that the price of a new one was not much above the cost of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> The new one, you can barely tell that it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> This model gives an extremely close and comfortable shave, and is quiet.</li>
            <li> Owning more expensive models, I received an average of ten years economical service from each on my elderly face with a fairly light beard.  </li>
            <li> the long run, this razor is cheap enough and I expect the battery to last for years.  </li>
            <li> The new features I am experiencing with this model are light weight, quiet, rinsable, and the way the whole razor head pivots inward (I&#x27;m not sure if this is their Precision Cutting System, Superior Lift &amp; Cut Technology, or Patented Reflex Action Shaving System)when</li>
            <li> In general, Phillips makes way too many models and it&#x27;s awfully confusing trying to sort out the differences.    </li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t give a clean shave..leave a few hair here</li>
            <li> You still have to make a few passes over an area to get all of it clean.    </li>
            <li> A quick shave takes less than a minute</li>
            <li> The main problem is the low speed at which this razor runs.  </li>
            <li> Decent cut but takes several passes to get a close cut.  </li>
            <li> The pros of my new 7140XL and my old model are:  - new razor seems to need less passes for a very close shave  </li>
            <li> I mean, it sounds very anemic, like it&#x27;s already running out of charge, and I gave it a full overnight 8 hour charge.    </li>
            <li> If the new razor doesn&#x27;t measure up to the old 90&#x27;s era razor, then I will try buying a different brand.</li>
            <li> ] I need a new electric shaver after my old one finally died.</li>
            <li> It has no power whatsoever compared to my previous Norelco, and I can go over light stubble several times and still feel plenty that it has missed.</li>
            <li> quiet, quick and extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a new Norelco, and I have been using that product for several years.    </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to any person wanting to switch to a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> He was using a similar razor but needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Major cons ::  </li>
            <li> major problem involves cleaning this razor.</li>
            <li> The unit is only six months old!</li>
            <li> plain and simple cut it smooth with just one pass.</li>
            <li> I must say the new model is much lighter, however the quality of the shave and the harshness on my face is less than acceptible.  </li>
            <li> Not having a low battery indicator is the most serious deficiency of the 7140.    </li>
            <li> is a little bit short after a full charge.</li>
            <li> Blades start to dull in about a month and have to repeat shaving strokes way to many times and takes too long to get a close shave...</li>
            <li> So did two wires that fit delicately into plastic parts on the lock.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I could definitely recommend this product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it may knock the old saying you only get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at the performance of this razor, especially at the price.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after my 10 year old Norelco&#x27;s battery didn&#x27;t last anymore.</li>
            <li> Anyhow... I&#x27;m going back to old way.</li>
            <li> Ordered this shaver after my old unit suddenly quit.  </li>
            <li> You will also have to buy a replacement eventually, apparently there is a known issue with the on/off button.  </li>
            <li> I passed my 3 year old and more expensive Norelco off to my 90 year old father-in-law</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better, but I&#x27;ve also had a lot worse.  </li>
            <li> My old razor was due for some new blades anyway</li>
            <li> This really has been one of the most disappointing things I&#x27;ve purchased through amazon.</li>
            <li> I would have deducted two stars for the lack of a low battery indicator, were it not for the apparent use of NiMH batteries and the effectiveness of wash-through cleaning of the shave head.  </li>
            <li> and it holds a charge longer then what the manual suggests...1 full charge {8 hrs} on this razor and you will get at least</li>
            <li> It was everything the hype claimed it would be and cost less than I could have bought it in town at at a large discount store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer works very well, even for \\&quot;down there\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would usually spray water right into the unit and then swab some gunk away with a q-tip.  </li>
            <li> The head protector cap is a bit chintzy as it does not cover the whole head assembly as my previous Norelco&#x27;s did-</li>
            <li> Of course I do not have that much hair to shave on my face like the previous reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning is much easier than with the previous razor because I can do it with running water instead of a brush.  </li>
            <li> However it seems to run much slower than previous models I have used.</li>
            <li> The charge last a long time as far as I can see.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery in the 7140 is the old \\&quot;memory\\&quot; type which won&#x27;t last you all that long.  </li>
            <li> Since my husband has had a norelco shaver forever, I was a little hesitant  about purchasing this one as he compares all his new shavers to his old  one and always complains that they don&#x27;t give as close a shave</li>
            <li> Hopalong Cassidy (aka William Boyd), on the other hand, was a screen cowboy--a contemporary of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, distinguished from them by his white hair matched to his white horse (whereas Trigger and Champion were colored).  </li>
            <li> On average it takes 15+ minutes to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> when someone wants to leave a little stubble).</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver with high expectations, but honestly I&#x27;ve been disappointed by the results.</li>
            <li> There is no warning when the battery dies, the razor does not slow down, or beep, or any such thing -</li>
            <li> Switched from a Braun 5884 (which is more expensive) and while the Braun gets a deeper shave and gave me a lot of irritation afterwards, this gives a decent shave but little irritation.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if they come out with an improved model for the same price a year from now, I can buy that instead of the heads for the same money (maybe sell the old one on E-bay?)</li>
            <li> Also, the back side of the razor is no longer flat.  </li>
            <li> only cons are relatively minor.</li>
            <li> The 7140 is blue, the 7240 is grey; the 7140 has a catch-as-catch-can grip, the 7240 has an ergonomic pistol grip.  </li>
            <li> The only con I see is the 8 hour charge time, which has been the norm for Norelcos in this class for a long time.</li>
            <li> - the 3 shaving circles tilt and contour to your face instead of being 1 flat shaving surface    </li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for several years now, no complaints, just change the heads/blades every once in a long while.  </li>
            <li> has a long life, it is very quiet and can be cleaned  with water in seconds.   </li>
            <li> All in all, not bad but not great.</li>
            <li> My neck is fairly sensitive and this shaver results in only a little irritation.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty mad right now.</li>
            <li> My old one had a charge that lasted me for close to a month, and the charging was done in less than 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I was about to order another one, already cursing for having to go back to blades even if only temporarily; but before that I took it to a specialized shop; they opened it and showed me it was wet on the inside and told me the \\&quot;circuit\\&quot; was fried.</li>
            <li> There is now a small wall wart instead of a normal plug.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> But the battery lasts a long time -- I&#x27;ve had it for three weeks</li>
            <li> I suspect my skill will improve, but at this point shaving to an acceptable closeness takes about 3 times as long as I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> David Strange</li>
            <li> Not that the old one was that heavy, but there is a difference.  </li>
            <li> As a wet shaving refugee I didn&#x27;t know what to expect; I was just tired of getting cuts everyday, and paying an exhuberant tax to the wet shaver companies; I didn&#x27;t want to buy a top of the line model in case</li>
            <li> All my previous Norelco&#x27;s had a plain straight power cord</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s third set of heads and probably due for another set.</li>
            <li> The charge time is very long, though.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another Norelco shaver that was a few years old and needed new heads (HQ55 Heads, which I was never very happy with).</li>
            <li> My previous Norelco did not last as long as I would have wished.</li>
            <li> but I suspect that this is due to the fact that I came from the standard manual 3 blade Gillette so this electric razor actually was upgrade in terms of being less aggressive on my face skin.     </li>
            <li> razors since I was a kid, so thought I would buy my first one..got tired of spenidn time razor</li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;down side\\&quot; I can think of is that it doesn&#x27;t display the remaining time of the battery.</li>
            <li> The battery still hasn&#x27;t run down after a month of daily shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just bought a replacement Norelco, and if this one goes the same route, after 20-30 years of Norelcos, it&#x27;s on to some other model of shaver!</li>
            <li> With my earlier Norelco&#x27;s the process was daunting enough to make me lazy.</li>
            <li> I tried both wet and dry shaving</li>
            <li> second razor is less than five months old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially like the ability to clean it under the facuet without having to buy expensive cleaning solvent!</li>
            <li> However, if I go more than a couple days without shaving, I \\&quot;pay for it\\&quot; when the electric razor has trouble with relatively long whiskers - a lot of pulling along with the cutting.  </li>
            <li> It was only when the 7140 failed that I realized just how much I depend on it and how well it has worked out - my technique still needs to improve and shaving still seems to take too long</li>
            <li> With his last razor, I could always see a little stubble even if he shaved that morning.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Corded operation is a real plus, because in my experience the rechargable battery will be just about useless by the time the second set of replacement heads wears out.</li>
            <li> He has an old Remington he was using and complained every time he used it, so I bought him this razor for Christmas.</li>
            <li> , it is what I expected with respect to operating noise, weight, trimmer, etc.  </li>
            <li> This razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it.  </li>
            <li> But still, this thing does what&#x27;s expected.  </li>
            <li> But, I knew that going in and since it also functions as a corded razor - that&#x27;s really not an issue.</li>
            <li> The battery still holds a charge; however, recently, I noticed that if the battery is dead, then I have to charge it some before I can use the shaver</li>
            <li> And the shave is not very close as I expected to be.</li>
            <li> One thing I will say is be careful if you have a gotee.  </li>
            <li> Shaves really close without irritating my skin .Faster and easier than a wet shave too.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do like this razor, especially for the relatively small price I paid for it!</li>
            <li> Only real down side would be if you are going to use this cordless.  </li>
            <li> The motor is extremely quiet and has sufficient power to not bog down when handling a two or three day growth of heavy beard.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the battery does not seem to hold a charge for no more than a week.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> read some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Gives an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> every other day</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It shaves a tad closer and needs less pressure to do so, and it seems to take a few less passes over the same area to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The only way to get a close shave is by pressing hard into the skin with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> 3)Pop-up eyebrow trimmer is hard to use in precision demanding applications (such as eye brow trimming).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it may not have been too hard to impress me, since I&#x27;ve been using the same corded Norelco forever.  </li>
            <li> Average to below average shaver.</li>
            <li> At least the AC adapter bypasses the battery charger when using it corded, so this will not further degrade the battery.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the price of the replacement heads is almost what I paid for the razor.</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint, I don&#x27;t like wall warts and would prefer that it be built into the shaver</li>
            <li> Much too expensive.</li>
            <li> and it never runs down.</li>
            <li> It did not give me a very close shave unless i pushed very hard, and when i pushed hard it tended to cut me.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 10 minutes now because my skin got used to it</li>
            <li> Using less pressure may help.    </li>
            <li> I tried to find a duplicate, the razor I choose is the subject of these comments.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a battery that was less prone to memory problems</li>
            <li> It rattles, the plastics feel inferior and the clipper doesn&#x27;t retract tightly into the housing.</li>
            <li> This one is lighter than the past 3 I&#x27;ve owned and the floating heads are tilted a little which makes it harder for me to get the shave</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy a shaver for him without him picking it out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for a little over 3 months now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months.</li>
            <li> It did take my skin a few weeks to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> The life for this thing is about two weeks if you use it everyday</li>
            <li> and my shaver&#x27;s battery is dead.</li>
            <li> Does require going over the face a few times to get all the stubble, but does the job eventually.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in another review, it is annoying that you can&#x27;t tell how much of the battery is left</li>
            <li> If you follow this advice, it means you&#x27;ll have a bad shave or two as the battery runs down, and then have to use it as a corded razor on the day it really slows down.  </li>
            <li> and i mean at least 4 or 5 shaves and then just to charge it back up</li>
            <li> This one seems to cut closer with less irritation but is somewhat small for my hands....</li>
            <li> I used my previous Norelco cordless for the past 7+ years with no complaints.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned by other reviewers, this shaver is very quiet- disturbingly so.</li>
            <li> None of it&#x27;s previous heads had become dull, they just locked up and quit moving.</li>
            <li> But lately it seems to take forever to get shaved, and when I finally give up, I&#x27;m not happy with the result.  </li>
            <li> but this one has a small wall wart at the 110v end.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave my electric razor plugged into the wall, which is the reason I picked the 7140XL over the cheaper 7110X (which doesn&#x27;t allow for corded-shaving).    </li>
            <li> (that wasn&#x27;t always the case; in the past, I could just plug it in and use it...</li>
            <li> I bought this over the more expensive Norelcos because I didn&#x27;t want to carry a charging base on trips</li>
            <li> It even works well on the hard to get close areas, like the chinline.</li>
            <li> Hard to stop using a blade after fifty years.</li>
            <li> I figure the blades are getting dull and had to put something on my wish list</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace a clunky Remington which had been a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> and lately I have been getting a lot of irritation and pimples.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a secondary shaver</li>
            <li> Wow, I am shocked that</li>
            <li> Runs at a relatively slow speed with slower shaving time.</li>
            <li> I did not find it slow to use as some had mentioned.</li>
            <li> No more shaving with razor blades!</li>
            <li> In doing so, two of the protective plastic circles again fell off as did one thin small wire clip.</li>
            <li> Plus the trimming blade is set at such an angle that it&#x27;s very difficult to use without it closing on me all the time.</li>
            <li> I have shaky hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> you have shaky hands or fingers, think twice.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been disappointed with the results of foil shavers and price increases over the past several years so decided to give Norelco a try.  </li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d like sometimes and the worst thing is that for ME personally when I try to shave under my chin/neck, It irritates my skin red and itches...</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as a manual razor though.  </li>
            <li> It shaves tough spots--</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s tough to say how well it would work if I used it as I should.  </li>
            <li> Poor Performance    </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a guessing game as to when charging is needed.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the life of the battery will slowly shorten until the battery is useless.</li>
            <li> Do not leave this razor in the car over a cold night, or the battery will go dead.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical on the performance</li>
            <li> I have a difficult beard and have used Philips Norelco products on it for over 40 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to decide who my worst enemy is and present it to them as a gift.</li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer is useless - have to use a razor there.  </li>
            <li> However, I would DHL delivery service as very poor.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know anything about electric shavers, but my boyfriend kept cutting himself with the disposalbles he keeps at my place.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair and you break out with irritation badly.</li>
            <li> Despite the bad reviews about the product I bought it, and I don&#x27;t regret about.</li>
            <li> Was easier to get under nose and trim sideburns with a foil but not too bad with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed in this razor and continue to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I used to use disposable razors and used to always cut myself, which gets really annoying.  </li>
            <li> After one particularly gruesome looking bloody knicks, I decided to get him an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Six months is pathetic.    </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had been using the old Norelco 5801XL and it gave a good shave.  Unfortunately, after many years - the battery is giving out and  lasts about 15-20 minutes.  So after reading the reviews here I initially bought the Philips Norelco 6940LC - unaware it is a corded shaver.  But that really gives a close shave.      Even when you turn it on - you can hear the 7140 is turning slower than the 6940 or 5801.  The only way to get a close shave is by pressing hard into the skin with the shaver.  And if you are sweaty - forget it.  The 6940 or 5801 gave an 80% shave when sweaty whereas the 7140 gives a 50% shave - and I need to go over it later to get a proper close shave.</li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed in this razor and continue to be disappointed.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for many years.  This one doesn&#x27;t stack up to the others I had owned.    Reasons why:  Cheap Plastic  Poor Performance    When I received the razor, I thought:  It look cools, but felt like a cheap knockoff in my hand.    The motor doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power.  If I go a day or two without shaving, I have to shave three to four times to clean up areas it misses.      I still own my old 90&#x27;s vintage Norelco.  I am tempted to buy it new blades and use it over this razor.  Before I do that, I will buy an upgraded Norelco and try it.  If the new razor doesn&#x27;t measure up to the old 90&#x27;s era razor, then I will try buying a different brand.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I bought as a gift.Philips company did as a usually good job.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another Norelco shaver that was a few years old and needed new heads (HQ55 Heads, which I was never very happy with). This shaver has the HQ8 heads, which I think are Norelco&#x27;s best design. As mentioned by other reviewers, this shaver is very quiet- disturbingly so. You think it can&#x27;t possibly be doing anything. It has given me the closest shave ever with an electric razor (which is all I use) with absolutely zero skin irritation. It even works well on the hard to get close areas, like the chinline. Neck was no problem at all. The rubber grips give it a good feel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only cons are relatively minor. The head protector cap is a bit chintzy as it does not cover the whole head assembly as my previous Norelco&#x27;s did- it just covers the heads themselves. The trimmer is pretty useless, but I haven&#x27;t had a good trimmer on an electric shaver in the last 25 years, so I don&#x27;t expect it. And, yes, it would be nice if it came with a pouch of some kind. I don&#x27;t mind the new power cord arrangement. There is now a small wall wart instead of a normal plug. And, yes, it would be better if it used NiMH batteries instead of NiCAD. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, a good value. Definitely 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver. So cannot say how great it is. Though it is good. It took more than 20 days before getting satisfactory results.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a great fan of electric shavers, but this one does a really nice job. Hard to stop using a blade after fifty years.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this Norelco shaver.  I recently had purchased a different brand electric razor which did not do the job.  This shaver is much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for a gift for my husband.  I was a little hesitant to buy a shaver for him without him picking it out but he is very pleased with it and it&#x27;s features.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FAPQG8 Norelco Shaver- 7140XL]]  Purchased this shaver for my husband for Christmas.  Received it as promised and before Christmas. My husband absolutely loves it!  No more shaving with razor blades!</li>
            <li> this razor works great and cuts very close. it feels very refreshing and is soft on the skin. I could definitely recommend this product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am 74 years old, retired M.D. This is the finest electric shaver I have ever owned.  Extremely quiet and very light weight.  The shaver heads adjust toe your face, chin and neck. No skin irritation whatsoever. Your face and neck are left completely smooth. What a joy. The price is unbelievably low.  Thank you Philips Norelco. Don&#x27;t even hesitate...just get it now !!!!!  Armand Auger, M.D., retired.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is this shaver is very smooth and is not noisey.For the price it cuts very good.I got it to replace my travel shaver and I am happy with it.JN Simons Sr</li>
            <li> El producto es bueno. Es de facil manejo y comoda. Sin embargo, considero que la velocidad de rotacion se hace lenta a medida que se desgastan las baterias, lo cual dificulta y hace tedioso el afeitado, alargando el tiempo requerido para una buena afeitada.    Ademas, no tiene indicador de la vida de la bateria.</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave, but the charge is good for only 30 minutes. According to the manual you have to charge it for 8 hours. My old one had a charge that lasted me for close to a month, and the charging was done in less than 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I received the item in a timely manner, in good condition, and as advertised.  The shaver gives me a close, clean shave and does so remarkably quickly.  I am a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that give a very good shave. The only drawback is the battery does not seem to hold a charge for no more than a week. Like the easy cleaning. I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Average to below average shaver.Blades start to dull in about a month and have to repeat shaving strokes way to many times and takes too long to get a close shave...just have plenty of skin bracer handy after shaving,you will need it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost 2 years now. The blades probably need replacement by now since i&#x27;ve noticed that it takes a bit more time to get a sort of smooth shave not but that&#x27;s OK for 2 years of use. Battery still holds pretty good charge and with every day use i can get almost 2 weeks of shaving out of it.   Initially the shaver performed better but again i&#x27;m suspecting that it&#x27;s a problem that will be fixed once i get new blades.     Never had a problem with it and always used the battery to the last drop before charging. I only disassembled the blades once in 2 years to do the recommended cleaning/lubrication.   Never had the rash or any irritation but I suspect that this is due to the fact that I came from the standard manual 3 blade Gillette so this electric razor actually was upgrade in terms of being less aggressive on my face skin.     Overall i&#x27;m happy with my purchase and once this shaver is done I&#x27;ll most likely replace it with another Norelco. This time maybe something from a higher shelf.</li>
            <li> Not the best shaver in the world, but it&#x27;s also not the most expensive.  It gives a reasonable-quality shave for what it cost.  I&#x27;ve had better, but I&#x27;ve also had a lot worse.  The battery life is OUTSTANDING (at least right out of the box).  My first charge went 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Gotta say this is a Great electric Razor!!  its not expensive and it holds a charge longer then what the manual suggests...1 full charge {8 hrs} on this razor and you will get at least and i mean at least 4 or 5 shaves and then just to charge it back up i will... but its NOT NEEDED....i could and would get more shaves i just charge it because for no reason.... The cut is smooth and very close and also its very quiet... Everybody its a very nice Razor for the money... and it may knock the old saying you only get what you pay for...well you get more from this razor in my opinion</li>
            <li> After many years of good service, my Norelco 5841 XL gave up the ghost. Naturally, I wanted something as good or even better than the Norelco as a replacement. The first thing I noticed with the 7140XL is how quiet it is. I have only been using it for a month, but I feel I made an excellent choice. I really like being able to rinse it clean with water after each shave. If there is a way to be informed when the battery is low, I haven&#x27;t discovered it. A charge will last me about a week to ten days.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco rotary style shaver.  The first lasted 9 years.  This one seems to cut closer with less irritation but is somewhat small for my hands....time will tell if it lasts as long as the first.</li>
            <li> I was a Mach 3 turbo user until I got this shaver.  I never knew that the the electronic shaver can shave almost as good as the best razor can do.  And this is much more convenient for me as I do not have to wet my face and shave for couple minutes.  Of course I do not have that much hair to shave on my face like the previous reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works very well, even for \\&quot;down there\\&quot;, now I can keep all my body hair trimmed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery of this thing lasts for weeks and charging is fairly quick.  Clean of the shaver is also very easy, all you need is hot running water.  Entire shaver is water proof.</li>
            <li> This is a new Norelco, and I have been using that product for several years.    So far, it meets my needs.  My previous Norelco did not last as long as I would have wished.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty glamorous shaver, but as I write, Amazon has it priced 20-30% higher than the more \\&quot;efficient and advanced\\&quot;  Norelco 7240XL.  Not that this one is expensive, but the 7240XL is an outstanding deal at present.  Basically, the differences are purely external and cosmetic.  The 7140 is blue, the 7240 is grey; the 7140 has a catch-as-catch-can grip, the 7240 has an ergonomic pistol grip.  If you&#x27;re Hopalong Cassidy, the 7140 designer blue is your defense against the enemy of errant forestry; if you&#x27;re Neal Cassady, the 7240 is your \\&quot;Further\\&quot; for flying across the free and flagrant fields of stubble and heath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Footnote to the grandchildren of the boomers: \\&quot;Further\\&quot; was the psychedelic school bus Ken Kesey created for Neal Cassady&#x27;s travels, celebrated by Tom Wolfe in \\&quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\&quot; (like Norelco electric shavers, still selling quite briskly on Amazon after all these years.  Moreover, unlike the hippies of the sixties, the Beatnik generation from whence Cassady came actually shaved!).  Hopalong Cassidy (aka William Boyd), on the other hand, was a screen cowboy--a contemporary of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, distinguished from them by his white hair matched to his white horse (whereas Trigger and Champion were colored).  Also, unlike Roy and Gene, Hopalong didn&#x27;t sing.]</li>
            <li> Nice razor for the price.  Seems to hold a charge for a long time.  The flip-up head makes it kind of awkward for cleaning.  I like the corded/cordless option.</li>
            <li> Wow ....what a great shave ,and with no irritation to mention.  The shaver feels good in the hand,and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am going from the Braun 7526 electric to this. This thing is incredibly under powered and for me very hard to get a close shave.    Charge time is 8+ hours for only 30 minutes of battery life, you&#x27;ve got to be kidding right.    I am returning this thing (although amazon does not have a very good return policy) and ordering the Braun.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. Highly recommend to people that have a need for a new razor. This razor gives a close shave and is very practical. Rinse in water to clean and thats all. Great razor</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at the performance of this razor, especially at the price.  I get more than 10 days per charge, it&#x27;s quiet, easy to clean.  For me, perfect.</li>
            <li> actually got this new  in box for $15 cuts great and rinses with water,have used it 3 weeks on  the same charge and still going strong.wish it had a low charge indicator light.</li>
            <li> Shaving is a daily nusisance, vut this shaver is quiet, efficient, comfortable, and I find that it minimizes the nuisance factor.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on the performance but I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and clean shave this shaver gave at such an excellent price. It beat out a more expensive remington shaver which I sent back.</li>
            <li> My husband truly loves shaving with this shaver; he says it is the best one he has had to date!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months. It does an OK job but does not feel like it does a good job.    The shave does not feel close or neat.</li>
            <li> Big improvement over the last electric razor that my husband&#x27;s been using for 15 years, once or twice a week.  He&#x27;s always prefered a razor and shaving cream but I think he might give that up, he&#x27;s so impressed with this one.  It&#x27;s so quiet!</li>
            <li> It does not work like I thought it would. It leaves hair and you break out with irritation badly. I would not buy again. I will stick with a real razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 30+ years and have had this one for about 30 days.  As usual this unit provides an excellent shave, close without irritation.  However, for the first time I am less impressed with the build quality.  The unit feels cheap.  It rattles, the plastics feel inferior and the clipper doesn&#x27;t retract tightly into the housing. Only time will tell as to how well it holds up.  Battery life has been excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace a clunky Remington which had been a big disappointment.  The Norelco is a breath of fresh air: it shaves very well, is nicely balanced in the hand, and is stylishly designed.  It shaves tough spots-- like under the nose and around the adam&#x27;s apple--effortlessly and comfortably.  Being able to rinse it out after shaving is a nice bonus.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my Remington shaver with the Norelco 7140XL. After three  days of not shaving I took this shaver from the box and used it without even fully charging it and got a great shave. The next day with a charge even better. It is much quieter also. I would say it is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, but it works great, is much quieter than my old razor, and does a descent job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a month now, and find its performance to be somewhat better than my previous Norelco shaver (5822) at this price point.  Not having a low battery indicator is the most serious deficiency of the 7140.    The instructions state:  \\&quot;Battery performance is best if you recharge only when the batteries are (almost) completely empty.\\&quot;    If you follow this advice, it means you&#x27;ll have a bad shave or two as the battery runs down, and then have to use it as a corded razor on the day it really slows down.  At least the AC adapter bypasses the battery charger when using it corded, so this will not further degrade the battery.  Another reviewer commented Norelco&#x27;s web site says the battery is NiMH, which is supported by the fact there is no NiCd warning on the outside of the 7140 (like there is on the 5822).  So fully discharging the batteries before recharging may not be that important.    This is my first Norelco with a washable shave head.  I am so far very satisfied with this feature, and consider it one reason the shaver delivers consistently close shaves.     I would have deducted two stars for the lack of a low battery indicator, were it not for the apparent use of NiMH batteries and the effectiveness of wash-through cleaning of the shave head.  Other than that, it is what I expected with respect to operating noise, weight, trimmer, etc.  One thing to note: it does not come with a case of any kind; just a plastic blade protector.    About me:  I have been shaving with electric razors for about 30 years.  I started with Norelco rotary, tried Remington foil, Braun foil, and then eventually back to Norelco rotary probably 15 years ago.  Therefore my face is well conditioned for this shaver.  However, if I go more than a couple days without shaving, I \\&quot;pay for it\\&quot; when the electric razor has trouble with relatively long whiskers - a lot of pulling along with the cutting.  I generally replace the blades once a year, and don&#x27;t disassemble and clean them as often as I should (instructions recommend montly).</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this shaver. Have had several different shavers over several years. This is by far the most satisfactory. Shaves really close without irritating my skin .Faster and easier than a wet shave too.Recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is Great! However, I would DHL delivery service as very poor. To their credit Amazon refunded my three day delivery charge. Next time I hope they ship via UPS!    Thank you,  Charles P Kopera</li>
            <li> La afeitadora Philips Norelco 7140XL es un excelente producto. Es liviana, fácil de manipular, fácil de limpiar y lo más importante, no tiene cables que entorpezcan su manipulación. En el primer uso, no presenté ningún tipo de irritación en la piel y el afeitado queda totalemnte al ras. Lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He is very pleased with the razor. I would buy this as a gift for someone else, also.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Norelco shaver and it is the best yet.     It is an exceptionally quiet shaver. There is more sound from shaving than the motor itself.    The shave is very comfortable. Shaving heads have cushioning and the floating mechanism allows for a very close and comfortable shave. It&#x27;s also easy to clean. With my earlier Norelco&#x27;s the process was daunting enough to make me lazy. With the 7140, it&#x27;s easy enough to do after every shave.    I have been using it for a month and have not had to charge it.</li>
            <li> This model gives an extremely close and comfortable shave, and is quiet. The electric motor seems to spin much slower than my old shaver, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the performance. It&#x27;s great. I personally did not want a shaver that has a charging or cleaning stand which must be left on the counter. I prefer this type, because I can keep it out of sight, in a drawer. The charge last a long time as far as I can see.I also like the design and blue color of the shaver. Let&#x27;s face it. A shaver is only as good as its shaving head. That is why I always stick with a mid-priced unit. When it stops shaving well, it makes more economic sense to just replace the entire unit every few years, as opposed to the shave head which costs almost as much. Also, the clipping feature works wonderfully on sideburns and beard. Tom</li>
            <li> I rate this five stars since it is a good price for what you get. Some reviewers thought it wasn&#x27;t very powerful. I suggest it is quiet. Many equate power and performance with loud noise. Perhaps it is more efficient. It does the job just fine. I have a difficult beard and have used Philips Norelco products on it for over 40 years. I passed my 3 year old and more expensive Norelco off to my 90 year old father-in-law and he is thrilled with it. His old, cheap, noisy, corded one was getting too much for him to handle. I bought this as a personal replacement. I was skeptical about being able just to rinse it under hot water, but that works just fine. Battery management is not as good as my previous one (as other reviewers noted) but I can easily get 10 days out of it before recharging. Bottom line, if you want a good battery electric shaver and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot for features you might not need or want, this will do the job. I note that a \\&quot;leading consumer mag\\&quot; gave it a good middle of the road rating in this month&#x27;s issue. That reinforced my feeling that I made a good choice for the price - performance sweet spot. A replacement cutter head set costs nearly as much as the whole razor costs, so when it comes time to replace the heads, I tend to replace the razor with one in that price range.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quiet that at first it seemed like it must need charging but my first shave with it was as good as any from my previous electric razors. This one replaced a 3 year old Remington triple head that&#x27;s battery would no longer take a charge. The Remington was on it&#x27;s third set of heads and probably due for another set. None of it&#x27;s previous heads had become dull, they just locked up and quit moving. I selected this unit for it&#x27;s easy cleaning (the easiest cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had) and it&#x27;s corded capability. Instead of ruining it&#x27;s battery by constant recharging, I charge it, get about twenty shaves before it quits, plug it in to finish the shave, recharge it for another 20 shaves.</li>
            <li> This really has been one of the most disappointing things I&#x27;ve purchased through amazon. Major cons ::  (1)Shaving time is too much  (2)Shaves from the root(bad when someone wants to leave a little stubble). Doesn&#x27;t have any level setting for leaving a bit stubble.  (3)Even after spending so much time, doesn&#x27;t give a clean shave..leave a few hair here n there.  I bought this shaver with high expectations, but honestly I&#x27;ve been disappointed by the results. Not value for money.</li>
            <li> First of this product is priced under 50 dollars so it is an entry level product. It is my first electric shaver and it works amazingly. At first you will feel skin irritation however after you get used to it there should be none. It shaves closes than the Phenom. After shaving with this you will never switch back to a razor. The battery last a week, while the quick charge is great when it does finally run out. If your looking for a gift for a high school Grad this is what they need. Especially in the dorms take it from me, Nothing helps achieve those grades like a close shave.    I bought one for myself and then 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Despues de mas de 10 anios con una norelco la estoy remplazando, las navajas nuevas costaban 10 dolares menos que una rasuradora nueva.</li>
            <li> My experience with Norelco shavers extends over thirty years.  Owning more expensive models, I received an average of ten years economical service from each on my elderly face with a fairly light beard.  Having reviewed a number of current models, the 7140 seemed most cost-effective.  After using it for a month, I have determined the following:  PRO&#x27;s - It is designed to fit the hand well and the flip-type head simplifies cleaning.  CON&#x27;s - No sliding scale indicator to show state of charge.  Runs at a relatively slow speed with slower shaving time. Bulky external transformer at end of charging cord.  No storage case or pouch.</li>
            <li> Good product. Great Shave.  Minuses:  1)Light blinks to brightly at night.  2)Shaver head swings away instead of coming clear off shaver body.  3)Pop-up eyebrow trimmer is hard to use in precision demanding applications (such as eye brow trimming).  Pluses:  1)Holds great charge.  2)Provides smooth close shave with absolutely no yanked whiskers.  3)Have not had any ingrown hairs on my neck since using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I used to use disposable razors and used to always cut myself, which gets really annoying.  I eliminated that problem by buying this electric razor.  It did take my skin a few weeks to get used to it.  In the beginning it used to dry my skin out a lot and it used to take me a good half hour to shave my face.  It takes less than 10 minutes now because my skin got used to it and I don&#x27;t miss hairs now.  As mentioned in another review, it is annoying that you can&#x27;t tell how much of the battery is left so sometimes it dies on you but you can just plug it in and then continue shaving.  I end up having to charge my razor once a week and I shave every two days.  A positive of the razor, though, is that once I&#x27;m done shaving I can just run it under warm water and clean it out.  I wasn&#x27;t too satisfied the first month because it missed hairs and took really long but I love this razor now that my skin seems to have adjusted well to it.</li>
            <li> Bought this 5 weeks ago. Charge it once a week and it never runs down. Close shave, easy to clean. Only complaint is that the price of the replacement heads is almost what I paid for the razor. On the other hand, if they come out with an improved model for the same price a year from now, I can buy that instead of the heads for the same money (maybe sell the old one on E-bay?)</li>
            <li> Upgraded from an old Norelco to this and just love it. Shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip. The only con I see is the 8 hour charge time, which has been the norm for Norelcos in this class for a long time. If you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product one day and received it in the mail a couple of days later right on schedule.  It was everything the hype claimed it would be and cost less than I could have bought it in town at at a large discount store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my shaveer for about a week and have given it several opportunities to do well.  I&#x27;ve worn out 3 Norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase I thought.  This razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it.  I have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart, but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave, and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face.  I&#x27;m going to decide who my worst enemy is and present it to them as a gift.</li>
            <li> JUST GOT THE RAZOR. WHAT  A GREAT SHAVE, COMPARED TO MY OLE REMINGTON AND ANOTHER PLUS, A GREAT PRICE. 5 ATTA BOYS TO AMAZON</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Norelco 5885 XL after the battery stopped taking a charge. I had the 5885 repaired at a Philips authorized place, but it still didn&#x27;t take much of a charge, so I went back again and, in the end, still didn&#x27;t have a razor that I could use for more than a few days. I finally decided to give up and get this. I paid about $40 for it (the price has since gone up) and the repair was $30, so I figured this was a faster way to get something that worked.    In general, this is a very nice shaver. It&#x27;s super-quiet, noticeably quieter than the 5885. It shaves a tad closer and needs less pressure to do so, and it seems to take a few less passes over the same area to get a close shave. The trimmer is just okay -- exactly like the old one. It won&#x27;t cut you, but it won&#x27;t easily make a clean edge for your sideburns, either. It&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse out the head under running water.     There are a couple of caveats, though. The design of the head is slightly different and it doesn&#x27;t move as smoothly over my skin. For me, this is a noticeable and moderately significant disadvantage. The old one felt better. It took a bit more effort to get a close shave, but I enjoyed the process more.     There&#x27;s no battery meter. The old one told me how much of a charge I had. It wasn&#x27;t all that accurate, but it let you know if you needed to charge the thing before going on a trip. But the battery lasts a long time -- I&#x27;ve had it for three weeks and I&#x27;m still on the first charge (I don&#x27;t necessarily shave every day, though).    I never cut myself with the 5885. With this one, I&#x27;ve had two nicks in the first three weeks. Using less pressure may help.    I bought this over the more expensive Norelcos because I didn&#x27;t want to carry a charging base on trips -- I just wanted a cord. I would have paid more, but Phillips just doesn&#x27;t make the shaver that I want, which would be similar to the old one -- no base, but with a charge meter. In general, Phillips makes way too many models and it&#x27;s awfully confusing trying to sort out the differences.    Overall, I&#x27;m happy, but replacing my old one, for a dead battery, was way too much hassle and the result is a shaver that isn&#x27;t quite as nice as the one it replaced.    A note for those of you who&#x27;ve never used one of these: you&#x27;ll get a close shave, but a blade will always be closer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my elderly father.  He couldn&#x27;t get over how quiet this razor was and what a great job it does.  He said this definitely deserves 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Although Philips has cheapend up the razor substantialy, it does provide a fairly close shave. Not nearly as good as a manual razor though.  The downside is I get razor burn on my neck from this razor.</li>
            <li> I AM PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT----IT DOES THE JOB I BOUGHT IT FOR.    Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver (Purchased on 09/06/2007)</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  I&#x27;ll admit it may not have been too hard to impress me, since I&#x27;ve been using the same corded Norelco forever.  But still, this thing does what&#x27;s expected.  Gives a close shave with the convenience of being cordless (mostly the fact you can rinse it out).  Battery lasts for a lot of shaves.  I have no idea how rugged it is, because I haven&#x27;t dropped it yet.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased from this seller prior to this , but the item was great!</li>
            <li> Despite the bad reviews about the product I bought it, and I don&#x27;t regret about. This shaver is what I need, specially for travelling.</li>
            <li> My youngest son loved his \\&quot;First\\&quot; electric razor. This one stays charges for weeks and he can take on his beach/camping trips where their is no power.</li>
            <li> As always, Amazon delivered the product in record time.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 3 weeks and feel it was a good buy. It&#x27;s extremely quiet which was not something I was accustomed too. It does an excellent job and I&#x27;m pleased with it. I especially like the ability to clean it under the facuet without having to buy expensive cleaning solvent! Plus, it can be used as a \\&quot;corded shaver\\&quot; that my old one was not capable of. At this point, I would have to say that I&#x27;d buy it again. The only \\&quot;down side\\&quot; I can think of is that it doesn&#x27;t display the remaining time of the battery. But, I knew that going in and since it also functions as a corded razor - that&#x27;s really not an issue. Excellent razor for the price!</li>
            <li> Bought a new cell phone that didn&#x27;t work so I had to send it back it.  I mailed in the recharging cord to my old Norelco razor instead of the phone&#x27;s cord by mistake.  My old razor was due for some new blades anyway so I got on Amazon to see about buying another one just like it.  Well, they don&#x27;t make my old razor anymore, but I could buy a &#x27;gently used&#x27; one for 30 bucks plus 10 bucks shipping.  Shopped little more and found this one for $45 from an Amazon seller for $45 and change, shipping included.  Got to tell you I felt kind of dumb for awhile about mailing in my old razor&#x27;s rechardging cord, but not any more!  This razor is 10 times the razor my old one was!  I love it!  It shaves way, way smoother and faster and gentler than my old one did.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My husband thinks that this shaver is great. He says that it shaves him as close a blade razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them all, Braun, Panasonic, and Norelco and this particular model is the best of the bunch. As nice perk it&#x27;s not the most expensive one out there either, but preforms better than the 8000 series from Norelco. It effectively gets at the troublesome neck area and chin. The floating heads do a great job positioning the cutting surfaces on your face. I&#x27;ve had no issues with irritation with this model.. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a \\&quot;norelco\\&quot; three-head style razor for 25 years.  This one is lighter than the past 3 I&#x27;ve owned and the floating heads are tilted a little which makes it harder for me to get the shave I&#x27;m used to.  I suspect my skill will improve, but at this point shaving to an acceptable closeness takes about 3 times as long as I&#x27;m used to.  I do really like the ability to pop up the head and rinse it with water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Norelco for years with very good performance. This particular model is OK for light shaving (I only keep it in my motorhome)but does not have the better motor or shaving heads as top line models.Also, this model does not feature a low battery warning light so it&#x27;s a guessing game as to when charging is needed. However, it&#x27;s good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Seems like I&#x27;ve only owned about 3 or 4 shavers throughout my shaving career of 30+ years but I still remember an earlier Norelco whose ni-cad batteries never died.  My latest Norelco seemed to last only about 5 years but it is amazing how each generation of shavers is quieter.  This 7140XL is very quiet and almost seems like it isn&#x27;t running very fast, but yet it does a great job.  I&#x27;ve had it about 3+ weeks and I&#x27;m still running on the original charge.  All my previous Norelco&#x27;s had a plain straight power cord but this one has a small wall wart at the 110v end.  That is my only complaint, I don&#x27;t like wall warts and would prefer that it be built into the shaver (of course that would add some weight).  Overall I am quite pleased and have to wonder if I&#x27;m missing something by not buying one of the $150 models.  This was a good deal at Amazon, but right after I purchased it, both Wally World and Target had them on sale for about $40.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good razor.  It functions and it&#x27;s very quiet.  Sometimes I need to plug it in for extra juice when the battery is low (there is no indicator, you just feel it).  It&#x27;s also very blue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive shavers over the years, and this one yields as close a shave as any of them.  It&#x27;s also very easy to clean by running a tap over it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Corded operation is a real plus, because in my experience the rechargable battery will be just about useless by the time the second set of replacement heads wears out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because its results can be improved by following up with a blade (just as with every other electric I&#x27;ve tried), but it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this shaver.  Very quiet operation, long charge, easy to clean, and most important - the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric!    My neck is fairly sensitive and this shaver results in only a little irritation.  For the money - I&#x27;m extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]]  Excellent shaver, have been using Norelco shavers for many years,  (I am 84). The last one was great, wondering what they would do to top it. They have. The 7140 is extremely Quiet. Doesn&#x27;t wake the family when you go out fishing at four AM. I know,who fishes? - who shaves first? - who gets up at four AM? Have it your way. It&#x27;s quiet! Being able to clean the head under the faucet is great! On top of that, it gives a clean, smooth shave. I like it.  R.C.J.P.</li>
            <li> This model cuts my beard closely and comfortably without needing frequent recharging. The sideburn trimmer works well too. It&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this razor last week and I am extremely pleased with the results.  I have been a blade shaver for about 18 years but wanted to switch for convenience.  I do find myself going over spots a couple of times, but I have had no problems with razor burn or anything.  I also have fairly sensitive skin so I was very happy to have no irritation from switching over.  Very quiet unit and charges up just fine.  I would definitely recommend this product to any person wanting to switch to a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for a long time and have always been satisfied with the product. This shaver is even better than my last. The shave is close and comfortable. I like how quiet it is. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is certainly much improved over my older Norelco Razor.  It is better looking, lighter and feels great in your hands.  The big difference I love is that it is so quiet.  I no longer wake-up the entire house when shaving, and sometimes I have to double-check that it&#x27;s working.  Cleaning it seems very easy.</li>
            <li> Switched from a Braun 5884 (which is more expensive) and while the Braun gets a deeper shave and gave me a lot of irritation afterwards, this gives a decent shave but little irritation. Recommended. The fact that it&#x27;s wireless also makes it worth a buy. The charge time is very long, though.</li>
            <li> Better than expected and 100% improvement in shaving ease over my  10 year old one.       Philips  Norelco 7149 cordelss shaver</li>
            <li> shaver has cheap (plastic) feel to it but the shave is okay to good; the absence of a low battery warning is a deficit</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for our anniversary, and he said it&#x27;s a great razor for a first timer using electric razors. However, the process of shaving is longer than using a regular razor. Overall, a great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> There are so many Norelco models and versions that I simply fell to leaning on Amazon buyer experience. The bulk of them were 5-star, and the Norelco 7140 measured up to the ratings. Manufacturing quality is excellent, instructions very good, performace, superb. Consistent close shaves, runs long on one charge, and cleans very easily.</li>
            <li> I wanted an electric for my legs for between razor shaves, and this works well for that. The price was right at $49, and I feel it is a good product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for 2 months and lately I have been getting a lot of irritation and pimples. This razor does not get the stubborn more thick hairs like my old 35$ norelco used to-which I had used for 4 years. If it is not fully charged or plugged in, the razor is hopeless to get a clean shave on a partial charge. I have to go over areas many times.</li>
            <li> Have had several Norelco razors over the years.  This is the closest shave I have ever gotten from any electric razor - and it is also the quietest.  Only comment is that it requires recharging more frequently that its claims but not enough of a problem to offset the quality of shave.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this shaver, the second that I have had.  Of the 2 Norelcos, this is the best.  It gets my neck and jaw bone whereas before I had hair on neck and stubble on jaw bone.  Cleaning is much easier than with the previous razor because I can do it with running water instead of a brush.  Shaver fits nicely in my hand and is surprisingly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there are shavers with more bells and whistles for which you can pay a higher price. But if you just want a close shave with an electric razor, this is definitely one you should consider.</li>
            <li> This lasted me about two years of in frequent use. It did not give me a very close shave unless i pushed very hard, and when i pushed hard it tended to cut me. I tried both wet and dry shaving and i found that dry worked better but still not as well as i would&#x27;ve liked. It also had severe problems shaving the neck/adam&#x27;s apple area.  However, the blade lasted a long time and it was good for touchup or when in a rush.</li>
            <li> I have just \\&quot;had it\\&quot; with my second 7140XL.  I bought both for $29.95 on sale at CVS.  While it shaves good, there are two problems. The first is that the \\&quot;charged\\&quot; light does not go on when fully charged.  Morever it does not hold a charge very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major problem involves cleaning this razor. I have shaky hands and fingers. Other than rinsing with hot water, one must remove the top lock and then clean each head.  With my first copy, I could not get the top lock back on. Moreover two of the plastic circles about the heads fell off. So did two wires that fit delicately into plastic parts on the lock.&lt;br /&gt;I finally threw it away.  I have been a Norelco user all my life and this was the first time encountering such a problem. My friends could not put it together again.  On Sat. Dec. 29, I turned the lock to release it. In doing so, two of the protective plastic circles again fell off as did one thin small wire clip. I could not put the razor together again.&lt;br /&gt;The second razor is less than five months old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those with steady hands and fingers can do better.  This particular unit seems to be too cheap vs. other models.  There are no Norelco shops within 150 miles.  I am going to try and get CVS to give me a refund. Then I will look at a different brand.  The basic Braun unit has the heads&lt;br /&gt;on so only the metal cover needs to be lifted off, a simple process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have shaky hands or fingers, think twice. Also, the indicator when the razor is fully charged should go on.  In such cases, Buyer Beware!</li>
            <li> Quiet, smooth running, does a great job, replacement head cheaper than the new model and does better than the 8000 series.</li>
            <li> This razor does provide a decently close shave, but I have pretty thick and strong beard hairs. This razor works very well and I use it on a daily basis. Every couple of days I use a disposable straight razor to get that even closer shave though.    The best part of this razor is that it can be used on battery or even while charging. This is extremely important since I use it every day and it does not warn you when it is getting low, although you can notice the motor getting slower as the battery dies.    This unit is washable so cleaning it is a breeze. After each use I just flip open the top and run some warm water over it.    Overall this is a very useful and convenient device to have in your grooming kit.</li>
            <li> I bought the same one before for myself. This time I buy it again for my father. When I was using it, I just have to recharge it 4 times a year. It is so convinient.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor.  I was happy to throw my expensive Braun in the garbage can.</li>
            <li> This shaver cuts closer and runs very much quieter than the Remington that it replaced. Chargeing requirement of once a week is a plus.</li>
            <li> It works well.  I&#x27;ve found it best to use before wiskers get too long.    I&#x27;ve gone over 2 weeks on the first charge.  A quick shave takes less than a minute and I&#x27;ve had no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco 7140 about a year ago. I LOVE IT!!! I tend to not shave on my days off, but the 7140 still does a great job even with 3 days of growth. The only drawback with this model; even though a charge will last for about 3wks you never know when the battery will run out. I have had NO other issues with this model and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product shipped promptly and seemed to be in good condition. However it seems to run much slower than previous models I have used.I charged it for 10 hours before using. I have used Norelco shavers since 1960, and expected this one to be as good. It cuts nicely with no pulling, but just seems to run too slowly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, shaves closer and smoother than my previous shaver, and the water cleaning and corded operation make it very easy to use. I did not find it slow to use as some had mentioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco products since I first started shaving 20 years ago.  Each time I get a new one they get better and better.  The Norelco 7140XL is no exception.  The new features I am experiencing with this model are light weight, quiet, rinsable, and the way the whole razor head pivots inward (I&#x27;m not sure if this is their Precision Cutting System, Superior Lift &amp; Cut Technology, or Patented Reflex Action Shaving System)when you press it to your face.  Great product.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a Great razor,my wife gave me one for Father&#x27;s Day and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  After a four hour charge,per the directions, I got to use it.  Wonderfully close and pleasant shave.  What a treat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  June, 2007</li>
            <li> I previously owned a very cheap electric razor and that was my very first razor.  It didn&#x27;t work to well, and I wondered if a spent a little more would the result be better. This was the exact case, The razor shave most of the hair off my face easily, the battery is fantastic so far, and the only thing that sucked was my face became really irritated the first couple of weeks.  Just keep using it and your face will adjust.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric shavers and this one has the closest shave I have ever experienced outside hand shavers. The battery lasted 18 days and 7 shaves before recharging. I think that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a while. everything looks good except the using time is a little bit short after a full charge.</li>
            <li> Very nice thing, stylish and comfortable, doing job perfectly and bought by amazing price.</li>
            <li> Good Shaver, takes a little getting used to. May get a little irritation first week or so, after that fine.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Good price. Easy to clean. Easy to use. Shaves almost as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> I had a rechargeable Norelco that I bought at a garage sale for a buck. It gave me years of good service but finally died. I decided to give this one a try and I am very pleased. I have a lite beard but still need to shave every day and this shaver leaves my face nice and smooth. The battery charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]]...THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS,,,,THIS SHAVER IS WORTH THE MONEY AND IT WORKS AND IS QUITE AND THE BEST PART IS THAT IT CLEANS EASILY..JUST SNAP OPEN AND RINSE,,,,,IT WILL LAST ABOUT 10 SHAVES BUT COMES WITH A COILED CORD THAT STAYS OUT OF THE WAY....IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT WORKS GREAT AND IS AT A DECENT PRICE THEN THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU</li>
            <li> This shaver works great. I have had it for a month and am impressed by the shave I have been getting.</li>
            <li> Been seing the Norelco brand elect. razors since I was a kid, so thought I would buy my first one..got tired of spenidn time razor shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far..so good! Holds a good charge, going on past 10 days now since the first initial charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice smooth and comfy shave.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Does a good job if I use it daily.  If I wait a day, it will be spotty on getting all of my growth off on the first pass.  Easy to clean, I have not run it thru water yet, but bounce it against the trash can and remove about 90% inside.  Cuts better than my old one (the batteries would no longer take a charge - 7 yrs old).</li>
            <li> Great Shaver. . wish surface area was greater. . . i find the cleaning very easy. . holds charge pretty well.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and was very happy with it for quite a while (maybe a year or two.) But lately it seems to take forever to get shaved, and when I finally give up, I&#x27;m not happy with the result.  Sure, blades get dull and all that, but this seems to have happened very quickly compared to previous Norelcos I&#x27;ve owned.  I wonder if Philips is joining the stampede of manufacturers going for cheap and substandard?  I&#x27;ve just bought a replacement Norelco, and if this one goes the same route, after 20-30 years of Norelcos, it&#x27;s on to some other model of shaver!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.  It is quick and easy.  My beard isn&#x27;t particularly thick, so this does the job just great.</li>
            <li> Since my husband has had a norelco shaver forever, I was a little hesitant  about purchasing this one as he compares all his new shavers to his old  one and always complains that they don&#x27;t give as close a shave so we end up either giving the new shaver away or throwing it away.  He ends up with his old one.  I purchased this as a secondary shaver so he could keep it at our vacation home.  He just loves it, so  now this is the shaver that travels back and forth.  I may have to purchase another. Thumbs up.  Product is great and so is the price.  I paid 1/2 of what I paid for his older one.</li>
            <li> Upgraded to this razor after my old Remington died, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  It cut a bit close, which irritated my skin at first, but I think that was just me getting used to the \\&quot;Lift &amp; cut.\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This would be an excellent razor if it wasn&#x27;t for two features (or lack thereof) that make it a pain to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  The internal battery is NiCd.  This type of battery has \\&quot;memory\\&quot; to it, which means for optimal performance, the battery should be fully drained before you recharge it.  Otherwise, the life of the battery will slowly shorten until the battery is useless. &lt;br /&gt;2.  There isn&#x27;t a low battery indicator. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By itself, either of these features wouldn&#x27;t pose a problem.  Combined, you&#x27;re left wondering when you&#x27;ll have to charge the shaver, or when you&#x27;re off on that business trip, if you&#x27;ll need to bring the charger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the long run, this razor is cheap enough and I expect the battery to last for years.  Still, it would have been better if the battery was made of NiMH or some technology that&#x27;s not 15 years old. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Not as good as my Norelco 7775X Cool Skin Shaver, but gives a decent shave for the price.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE NORELCO 7140XL AND I LOVE IT. I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO SHAVE EACH DAY. THIS RAZOR IS SO QUIET AND SHAVES REAL CLOSE. I DO USE ELECTRIC SHAVE. IT IS LIGHT AND I LIKE THE COLOR AND DESIGN. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHAVER TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> got my razor straight out of the box and used it. WOW! quiet, quick and extremely close shave. can&#x27;t wait to try it on a full charge. read some of the other reviews. don&#x27;t know who these caveman beards are, but i can tell you my beard is pretty dense, especially around my chin and my neck and this razor plain and simple cut it smooth with just one pass. can&#x27;t say enough about the razor, the price and my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Wow, I am shocked that so many people like this shaver, since it has proved utterly useless for me. It has no power whatsoever compared to my previous Norelco, and I can go over light stubble several times and still feel plenty that it has missed. Just turn it on and you can feel that it&#x27;s a pretty wimpy motor inside. Plus the trimming blade is set at such an angle that it&#x27;s very difficult to use without it closing on me all the time. Again, my previous Norelco had much better design/placement for the trimmer in addition to being far more powerful and effective. This model is only passable if you have a very light beard and/or you use it every day. But I consider this a waste of $50, and I wish I had spent more to get something that&#x27;s actually useful to me.</li>
            <li> The shaver works really well - just need to remember to keep it charged.  Highly recommended for anyone that needs to take a break from the razor.</li>
            <li> I was not comfortable buying one of these rotary-type shavers for many years.  However, I&#x27;ve been disappointed with the results of foil shavers and price increases over the past several years so decided to give Norelco a try.  I find myself pleasantly surprised.  Good shave with less skin irritation vs. my older foil shaver.  Takes about the same time but shave is comfortable and close.  Was easier to get under nose and trim sideburns with a foil but not too bad with the Norelco.  Only real down side would be if you are going to use this cordless.  The rechargeable battery in the 7140 is the old \\&quot;memory\\&quot; type which won&#x27;t last you all that long.  Since I use mine corded this is a none issue for me, but is worth mentioning here.  Personally quite pleased with my 7140XL.  Will likely stick with the brand for many years.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase a new electric razor because my charger for my old Norelco was damaged in an electrical storm.    I must say the new model is much lighter, however the quality of the shave and the harshness on my face is less than acceptible.  I prefer the older model.</li>
            <li> Graet shaver for the price pleasantly surprised. Runs very quiet, gives agood close shave. Holds a good charge been using it every day for over a week and still going strong. like the way you can just rinse the head under water to clean . not too heavy too hold, feels good in the hand. gives a good clean close cut Very Very satisfied would highly reccommend this shaver to anyone looking for a high quality shaver at a Great Price!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He loves it.  Does what it says it is suppose to.  Likes the fact that you can use the cord or use it cordless.  Easy to charge too.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my 10 year old Norelco&#x27;s battery didn&#x27;t last anymore. I usually leave my electric razor plugged into the wall, which is the reason I picked the 7140XL over the cheaper 7110X (which doesn&#x27;t allow for corded-shaving).    The pros of my new 7140XL and my old model are:  - new razor seems to need less passes for a very close shave  - far quieter  - waterproof (don&#x27;t plan on bringing it into the shower, though)  - the 3 shaving circles tilt and contour to your face instead of being 1 flat shaving surface    Cons:  - Cord is significantly shorter, so you&#x27;ll end up placing the razor right next to your outlet to charge or use. It is about 1 foot in length coiled up (it&#x27;s like a coiled telephone cord).    I would recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Update 20/02/10    After a year and a half of good service my HQ7140 would not start even with the cord plugged in, unless I left it connected for a couple of hours...Obviously not an option when you&#x27;re trying to get to work. I was about to order another one, already cursing for having to go back to blades even if only temporarily; but before that I took it to a specialized shop; they opened it and showed me it was wet on the inside and told me the \\&quot;circuit\\&quot; was fried. I explained that I had followed the manual to the letter, cleaning the shaving heads and the hair chamber with hot running water. They suggested taking the shaving unit off when I rinse it, use only warm (not hot) water, and *not* cleaning the hair chamber with water... They essentially sold me a brand new Philips HQ7120 as a replacement to use with my existing shaving unit for a reasonable price; it looks exactly the same except it has a \\&quot;Low\\&quot; red light.    The interesting bit is that I had gone to them about a month ago to buy a new shaving unit and they told me the HQ9 heads would work fine with these models, not just the HQ8; the HQ9 feel even better, so much so that I would definitely buy the 8xxx series which use the HQ9... It was only when the 7140 failed that I realized just how much I depend on it and how well it has worked out - my technique still needs to improve and shaving still seems to take too long but no going back to blades for me!        -----------------    As a wet shaving refugee I didn&#x27;t know what to expect; I was just tired of getting cuts everyday, and paying an exhuberant tax to the wet shaver companies; I didn&#x27;t want to buy a top of the line model in case things didn&#x27;t work out.    This has been a very pleasant surprise, as I&#x27;m getting close shaves with less fuss and no irritation; I beginning to get the hang of this and even the neck area is doing well.    The battery&#x27;s first run lasted for 4 days, but I may be taking a lot longer than normal while I learn. The battery light starts blinking when it&#x27;s fuly charged, by the way.    I have the Philips branded verion of this and it still says Made in Holland...</li>
            <li> I want to know the Voltage Adjustment of 7140.  Is it suit for 100V to 240V?  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It only took my husband 3 or 4 days to get used to the Phillips Norelco 7140 even though the directions suggested it would take 21 days.  The shave is quick and close with no nicks.  The only drawback is that the battery charge only lasts 2 weeks.  The directions said the battery would hold a charge for 30 hours.  I&#x27;m sure my husband isn&#x27;t using it 30 hours every two weeks.</li>
            <li> This razor is the lightest weight Norelco I have ever used and I worry that if I drop it there won&#x27;t be much to salvage, as far as function it is very quiet and smooth. The battery still hasn&#x27;t run down after a month of daily shaves. I like the fact you can rinse the head under the faucet, it is a lot quicker than useing the little brush they furnish and does a better job of removing the wiskers.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I can shave quickly and have a cut-free face. This thing is great for that! The life for this thing is about two weeks if you use it everyday and then you have to charge it, or if you want you use it with the wire on and don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery. Overall, this is a great shaver for a great price compared to the stores, no lie. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Amazon on June 30th of 2008. It is now January 20th of 2009 and my shaver&#x27;s battery is dead. It won&#x27;t start, even when plugged in. The unit is only six months old! My last Norelco unit with a rechargeable battery lasted TEN YEARS.    Six months is pathetic.    You have been warned.</li>
            <li> Pros- It has a decent battery life, durable, and quick..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- The shave isn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d like sometimes and the worst thing is that for ME personally when I try to shave under my chin/neck, It irritates my skin red and itches...</li>
            <li> The shaver has worked well since January 2007. It gets used 3-4 times a week. When cleaning it, I don&#x27;t rinse it under water...just brush it out instead.  The battery still holds a charge; however, recently, I noticed that if the battery is dead, then I have to charge it some before I can use the shaver (that wasn&#x27;t always the case; in the past, I could just plug it in and use it...even if the battery was not charged).  I am still using the same blades, and find no reason to change them (it would be better to buy a new shaver, due to the cost of the blades).  I have had good success with Norelco in the past, and I would purchase another Norelco to replace this shaver when it dies.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for several years now, no complaints, just change the heads/blades every once in a long while.  The inside is easy to clean.  I would usually spray water right into the unit and then swab some gunk away with a q-tip.  The unit is light and travels well.</li>
            <li> After ten years or so my original Norelco Chargable Razor gave up the ghost.  I tried to find a duplicate, the razor I choose is the subject of these comments.  I was amazed to see the improvements, not only in the features of the razor and its maintence program, but also in the quality of the shave I am now enjoying. In my eighty years as a consumer I have learned that new is not always better, but this experience was a plesant surprize.</li>
            <li> My husband is taking a bood thinner so he has to use an electric razor. He has an old Remington he was using and complained every time he used it, so I bought him this razor for Christmas. My husband loves it. It gives him a good shave with no razor burns and he loves the fact he can wash it out.It was worth every penny I spent for it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]]  This shaver is producing excellent results, it is light weight and works silently. Its price is very reasonable, I purchased it even though I was actually looking to purchase replacement blades for another shaver, but found that the price of a new one was not much above the cost of replacement blades. It would seem to me that the cost of replacement blades should be reduced, so that shavers might continue to be useful after the original blades are gone.</li>
            <li> We needed to get this to our son very quickly, as he was going on a trip. We got the 1 day shipping &amp; he got it the very next day, very impressive. He also said it was a very good shaver.   M.M. Schaefer   Sioux Falls S.D.</li>
            <li> Purchase of this product was as simple as could be. The service was great and the razor does everything as claimed. Great razor.    David Strange</li>
            <li> I have been using various models of Norelco triple head rotary razors for over 25 years and this model is giving me the closest shaves that I have had to date. I also appreciate the ease of cleaning the heads under running water. The motor is extremely quiet and has sufficient power to not bog down when handling a two or three day growth of heavy beard. I have only been using this razor for about a month but if if proves to be reliable over the long haul I would recommend this razor to anyone considering switching to or upgrading an electric.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for a little over 3 months now.  It&#x27;s very quiet, the charge lasts a couple of weeks, but the shaver takes 3 to 4 swipes over a 1-day growth stubble to fully cut it to a somewhat smooth level. The sideburn trimmer is useless - have to use a razor there.  Also have to use a razor for errant neck hairs.  All in all, not bad but not great.</li>
            <li> His face felt like he just shaved it. And he was all worried because we were headed for church. With his last razor, I could always see a little stubble even if he shaved that morning. A great product for a great price!     LBP-Sunnyvale, TX</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace an older model Norelco--a cordless \\&quot;black\\&quot; one.  Now I don&#x27;t know why I bothered to replace batteries and blades in the old one.  This one is much quieter and shaves much closer than the old one when it was new. Since I am still using the first charge on it, there is nothing to report on durability, length of recharge life, etc.  But if I were to replace it right now I would get another one just like it.</li>
            <li> I switched to this shaver after giving up a very old Norelco shaver and have been just as pleased with this one.  It is pretty simple, but pretty much does everything I need a shaver to do without getting in the way.  The shave is better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used, though of course not as good as a regular blade.  Cleaning it is really easy as it is waterproof and you can just rinse it out.  The fact that it will run while plugged into the wall makes this a much better choice for me than its more expensive cousins as I can still shave when the battery is low and I don&#x27;t have time to charge.</li>
            <li> very sharp and quiet and light...very easy to clean with water...you can use it for 3 or 4 times after you charge it.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my Son in Law for Christmas.  He loves it.  It gives a nice close shave and can be used with or without a cord.</li>
            <li> The product is just as described, clean shave and convenient to use. Can  clean under the faucet</li>
            <li> my husband really likes this razor. he had a philips razor before for many years, so we knew the brand would be reliable. it&#x27;s comfortable and gets a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers for more than 40 years, so it was no surprise that this one works fine, too.  Now you can clean it under the faucet, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor so I could shave during my morning commute.  I have used a Norelco triple headed razor for over 35 years, and this one shaves me well.  I like the floating head, and the fact that it can be rinsed with water easily.  I wish it had a battery that was less prone to memory problems so I could leave it plugged in every day.  There is no meter to let you know when the battery is low, or when it will give out.  The battery giving out while on the road is unaccceptable.  I am unaware of a car charger cord being available, but it would be nice.  Do not leave this razor in the car over a cold night, or the battery will go dead.  There is no warning when the battery dies, the razor does not slow down, or beep, or any such thing - it just stops!  It seems that with the amazing performance of some other types of batteries in items like digital cameras and cell phones Norelco could have improved this aspect of their product.  Overall, I do like this razor, especially for the relatively small price I paid for it!</li>
            <li> I received this for Xmas (it was on my wishlist).  I used my previous Norelco cordless for the past 7+ years with no complaints.  I figure the blades are getting dull and had to put something on my wish list so........    One difference from the old to this one:  Weight.  The actual razor is quite a bit lighter.  Not that the old one was that heavy, but there is a difference.  Also, the back side of the razor is no longer flat.  Must be for ergonomic reasons.    A huge difference is the sound/noise level.  The old one you could tell the difference from when it was fully charged versus when it was near the end of it&#x27;s charge.  There was a definite slow-down.  The new one, you can barely tell that it&#x27;s on.  Is this normal?  I mean, it sounds very anemic, like it&#x27;s already running out of charge, and I gave it a full overnight 8 hour charge.    As far as shaving goes, it&#x27;s good, but not a miracle worker.  You still have to make a few passes over an area to get all of it clean.    Overall, I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks to see if I really like it.  I will withhold giving it 5 stars until then.  I think this was $40 or something at Target.</li>
            <li> The problem I have with this shaver is that it does not do a thorough job. It&#x27;s been now 2 months that I bought it. Some times I have to go over a spot over and over and over again... And the shave is not very close as I expected to be. My father had a Philips shaver (15 years old) that I tried 5 years ago and that machine did more thorough job than this new technology thing. Anyhow... I&#x27;m going back to old way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. He was using a similar razor but needed a new one. His face seems smooth and he has not complained of razorburn not ingrown hairs. He likes the ease of cleaning &amp; the charge has held for some time now. I would recommend this razor as a nice replacement</li>
            <li> Gives an extremely close shave. Can be washed.  Can be used with shaving foam for easier closer shave.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco, which still worked OK, but was tricky to charge.  The 7140XL shaves closer and is much quieter and lighter.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and have only positive feedback to report.  Time will tell if the design will hold up.  I also like that the blades hinge up when opened for cleaning.</li>
            <li> After 30 years of Norelco shavers, I can easily  say that this is their best product yet. It&#x27;s battery  has a long life, it is very quiet and can be cleaned  with water in seconds.   I can&#x27;t think of a feature that would improve it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]] I need a new electric shaver after my old one finally died. this out of the box shaves just as close as any blade i have used. I do recommend this product to any one needing a new razor. This price is the same as those cheep imitations at WalMart and Walgreen&#x27;s which are really under powered. Pat in Rhode island</li>
            <li> Not living in the stone age anymore with my new,  Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver. Very happy smile.</li>
            <li> Very quiet. Smooth cut. Does require going over the face a few times to get all the stubble, but does the job eventually. Easy to brush clean. Good price for a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a couple weeks now and can say that it&#x27;s worked well so far.  I haven&#x27;t been as dedicated as I need to be in using it every day/every other day so it&#x27;s tough to say how well it would work if I used it as I should.  From what I&#x27;ve read it takes around a month for your face to get accustomed to the razor to get the cleanest shave so I&#x27;m going to give it more of an effort and hope it goes as well as I hope it will :)  Overall I would recommend the razor after seeing what a good job it did with my 4 day old scruff.  One thing I will say is be careful if you have a gotee.  Mine got caught and it hurt a TON!</li>
            <li> After several years of use from my previous Norelco which I was very happy with, I purchased the 7140. Was looking for a shaver that would give me a close shave without disrupting the skin on my face, be easy to take care of and reasonable in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had it a month now and this is an easy to use shaver that does it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RVrsRUS</li>
            <li> This shaver is the perfect one for shaving my HEAD!!!! It is very comfortable and works good in any direction. I shave my entire head every day and the battery lasts for 8 days usage. I may buy another for travel.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great.  I can&#x27;t believe the price.  You can clean it under a faucet.  I like that feature......</li>
            <li> DOES A GOOD JOB,EASY TO CLEAN.THE 7140 TURNS AT MUCH SLOWER RATE THAN MY OLD NORELCO.A BETTER BATTERY IS NEEDED.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco died after a couple of years of good service so I pulled out my even older Braun to fill in for it--big mistake.  I forgot how deafeningly loud the Braun is.  So I went out and got this 7140.  It&#x27;s everything my old Norelco was, but better.  For one thing, it&#x27;s whisper-quiet, which is nice in the mornings.  It shaves close without tearing up my face, and it takes far fewer passes than the Braun to get my face fuzz-free.  It&#x27;s essentially waterproof and easy to wash it one out under the tap (the instructions encourage you to do it this way) and get it squeaky clean after every single shave.</li>
            <li> Ordered this shaver after my old unit suddenly quit.  Should have heeded the previous review that this unit lacks the power (and I think speed) of the older Norelco&#x27;s.  I have since ordered a pair of NiCad batteries for about $8 and repaired my old Norelco - what I should have done in the first place.  I guess I&#x27;ll keep this new one as a backup but it is not my first choice.  It shaves clean, but is kind of slow and gutless.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome, cuts very well good charge and you can use it with cable.&lt;br /&gt;You can wash it with water. very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Espa&amp;ntilde;ol:&lt;br /&gt;Esta afeiatodar es maravillosa, corta al raz y se puede usar con o sin cable de corriente, se puede lavar con agua. Muy buena.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for perhaps 6 months and wish I would have had the sense to return it within the 30 days allowed.  The main problem is the low speed at which this razor runs.  Previous Norelcos that I have owned ran at much higher speeds and cut far more efficiently.  The 7140 is hell on the neck, particularly with a 2 day growth and tends to pull hairs rather than cut them.  I would pass on this razor unless you have a light beard.  Don&#x27;t ignore the 30 day return policy if you do decide to try this razor.</li>
            <li> You will also have to buy a replacement eventually, apparently there is a known issue with the on/off button.  It stops working.  Don&#x27;t expect support from company...they will only offer a paltry 15% off a replacement.  Another company that doesn&#x27;t stand by its products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because my husband likes it very much.  Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty mad right now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know anything about electric shavers, but my boyfriend kept cutting himself with the disposalbles he keeps at my place. After one particularly gruesome looking bloody knicks, I decided to get him an electric shaver. Not knowing if he&#x27;d like it, I didn&#x27;t want to spend alot. Looked through many on Amazon, liked the Norelco name, and the fact that he could use it wet or dry, and that it was rechargeble. He loves it, even though it took almost a day to charge the first time, he thinks it works fine. I think it shaves almost as well as a razor, and no blood!</li>
            <li> I purchased this back to 2007 and still using it, this is good one</li>
            <li> Decent cut but takes several passes to get a close cut.  On average it takes 15+ minutes to get a decent shave.  Much too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have this machine in 2008 and it is working as good as the first day I tried it.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
