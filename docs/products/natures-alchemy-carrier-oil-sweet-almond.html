            <li>Applying the oil was as easy as can be and had a great smell to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li>It is so amazing I cannot tell you.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it before, and liked it.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to rub into the skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after-film. ..  </li>
            <li>smell is not as nice as kamasutra.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is suitable for use in cooking too, or in salad dressing.  </li>
            <li>and it is a good light oil for massage.</li>
            <li>Nice for so many things....</li>
            <li>smells great and very smooth mixture.  very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Most importantly (to me), is that it has a neutral smell (the almond is nice &amp; pleasant) - no fluffy flower smells here which is great.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>It was a great purchase and worked very well.  </li>

            <li>I am sure.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast service.</li>
            <li>One word of advice though, whoever packaged this could definitely do a much better job.</li>
            <li>The bottle top was not sealed well at all</li>
            <li>I love this oil, I use in on my skin, hair, nails and even a bit on my pomeranian after I am done grooming him to softern his tail.</li>
            <li>I love it and will always order it from Amazon</li>
            <li>many wrinkles are either gone or diminished substantially.</li>
            <li>My overall skin looks the best it has in years..</li>
            <li>I will never buy this brand again and will make sure to check each and every bottle of EVERYTHING before I use it on my kids.</li>
            <li>Oil arrived on time, but company is still using PVC 3 packaging which is one of the more toxic varieties of plastic and one which can leak into the contents of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>a lovely almond-scented almond oil that I used to use. .</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s allergic to many bath oils/lotions but not this.</li>
            <li>As soon as I realized this I put it into a food safe container.</li>
            <li>I Love this Almond oil.</li>
            <li>My favorite massage oil.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>The oil itself was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Just perfect for dry skin anywhere on your body including face.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect massage oil...not greasy, absorbs well, not too slippery, not too dry!  </li>
            <li>It also last along time which allows for a very good massage.  </li>
            <li>shipping was food and fast, the product no so good ,smell expired.</li>
            <li>Works great as a massage oil and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild.  </li>
            <li>If you are out to get a good product for a decent price.. you found it.</li>
            <li>High quality natural oils are the way to go for healthy beautiful hair and skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and lasts.</li>
            <li>The oil is smooth, I found it stored well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally free of anything artifical.</li>
            <li>Diet is also important but castor oil works wonders.</li>
            <li>You want a smooth skin, get it.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I got this because it was 100% pure, and the price was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Very lovely light color and soft aroma.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Sweet Almond Oil\\&quot; bottle breaks; and the two books packaged with it (INCREDIBLE BOOKS AND OIL TOGETHER); got wet also one of them is destroyed.    </li>
            <li>First time I bought two bottle - one for myself and one for my sister and mom to share - they fell in love with it too</li>
            <li>and when I got myself a second bottle I also bought 2 more (1 for my mom and 1 for my sister because both wanted their own bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbed very quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This massage oil is good - it simply does what it&#x27;s advertised to do, really - it works great, goes on smooth and spreads out easily when giving back massages for example.</li>
            <li>I found article after article on the many benefits of 100% pure sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be a sweet smelling almond?  </li>
            <li>love it so much.</li>
            <li>maybe that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad but the oil absorbed too quickly into the skin, and I have to keep applying quite often as I massage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better than the normal lotion I think for the skin</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be making good use out of it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>Smooth and moisturises very well.</li>
            <li>I will buy again simply because i can add my own scent.</li>
            <li>Not much is needed to achieve a good scent.</li>
            <li>but I like it ok so far.</li>
            <li>It was economical for the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be dealing with this company again due to their great customer service as well as the quality of their products.</li>
            <li>It is very nice, clean, clear, and minimal scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought this last year after reading that Jackie O used sweet almond oil on her skin every day:)  </li>
            <li>this product was very well worth the money, i  have use sweet almond oils in my hair since i was a child</li>
            <li>Nothing like the pure Sweet Almond Oil purchased in Dominican Republic.</li>
            <li>This oil has a great feel and very little to no scent.</li>
            <li>The product worked good, but when I turned the bottle upside down the plastic rating in the triangle was a 3.</li>
            <li>This is 100% pure almond oil!  </li>
            <li>The whole purpose of making my own perfumes was to stay away from carcinogens in commercial brand perfumes.</li>
            <li>So I bought a bottle of this product during my first pregnancy and applied it nightly.  </li>
            <li>Overall satisfied of course wish it was a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>If the company corrects this issue, I would most definitely use the product again.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I&#x27;ve finished up with this bottle.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Ive have received many compliments asking what im doing with my facial skin.</li>
            <li>Blended well w essential oils and sea salt to make a scrub that I enjoy!</li>
            <li>I ordered another type of almond oil which arrived in a PETE 1 plastic bottle (much less prone to leakage) and felt much more comfortable using that version.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful as a base to add to essential oils...works so nice and its very healthy, not only for hubby and I but for our doggie when he gets the itchies...</li>
            <li>Non sticky, clean and natural oil to be used for massages.</li>
            <li>Safe for children as long as there are no nut allergies.</li>
            <li>we mix it with other essential oils and rub him down lightly and its wonderful!!</li>
            <li>This product is great for dry skin and dry hair.</li>
            <li>Not super greasy and makes a nice addition to the bathwater.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it says that it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li>(*100% pure - or -almond oil*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this product</li>
            <li>Seems to be pure and works for the intended purpose of adding spearmint and peppermint and using for oil pulling.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much of this stuff in the bottle</li>
            <li>I do not have much knowledge.</li>
            <li>I used it the very 1st day</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It does not take much so the bottle lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the reviewers who pointed this out.  </li>
            <li>totally fragrant free</li>
            <li>so you are free to use any essential oils for fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t lost much but was irritated.</li>
            <li>The packaging not so much.</li>
            <li>Gentle for around eyes and makeup removal.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I use this in my homemade lotion recipe, or just straight from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>this oil make your skin very smooth, and help with some dark area of your skin.</li>
            <li>(Aromatherapy Top 6 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Basic Sampler Essential Oil Gift Set).  </li>
            <li>It is a huge bottle and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>bottle I bought has a lid that slightly leaks, so if you do buy this, be sure to keep it upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few drops of this makes the whole room smell like almonds, my favorite extract for cooking.  </li>
            <li>The oil had leaked out a decent bit when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and unfortunately I don&#x27;t know THAT much about oils if you are, but for all others who are interested in something that works well.. have a good time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this for being green trainings I do for early childhood educators and childcare providers; it&#x27;s helped people see the fun scents they can use in their own cleaning products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>if your into making other natural things ... even makes a great refresher for your eyes if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li>glides on, feels luxurious, and soothes dry skin all over but more importantly it is helping with our extremely dry, cracked and red patches of skin that all three of us have.  </li>
            <li>I like to apply it directly to my skin and also use it to create my own essential oils by adding citrus peels and other herbs.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned ordering this initially since I&#x27;ve never purchased this kind of stuff before</li>
            <li>None worked so great and some actually made my face worse.</li>
            <li>top it off, the plastic bottle was low grade plastic, not really meant to hold a product like this.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and switched from baby oil to this Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li>This product completely exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li>You know the saying, 2 4 5 you&#x27;ll stay alive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a distribution problem with Amazon  (old oil) or a problem with Nature&#x27;s Alchemy, but either way this oil should be pulled.</li>
            <li>And it is all natural.</li>
            <li>So far have used the three bottles over a period of four months and have no gripes on the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>You will not need much of this oil to take care of your massaging needs and therefore this bottle might last quite a while.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you were hoping to use this professionally</li>
            <li>One day i decided to research  natural ways to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft..</li>
            <li>It smells rancid like its old or out dated.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my natural hair</li>
            <li>I like it so much that i wanted something bigger and cheaper.</li>
            <li>I put it on my body after the shower and it feels so soft afterwards&lt;</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars even though I was happy about the product, because unfortunately it is not a good practice to subject your customers to carcinogens.</li>
            <li>This is the third time I have purchased this particular oil.  </li>
            <li>But, I just received the bottle and on the back label every time it mentions that is 100% pure, there is an asterisk next to it.</li>
            <li>My only concern is really questioning the quality as at times it can feel gritty</li>
            <li>I make a sea salt, almond oil, unscented hand lotion adding 5 or 6 drops of essential oil (tangerine) to make a lovely hand softening product with a delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li>Will be better if seller specified the container too with product information as I always buy in glass bottle and expected same, but the container for this oil is plastic, that causes the almond oil to break down and smell bad/pubgent.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil so I could make perfume out of natural essential oils.</li>
            <li>A natural product that comes in such a harmful material?!?</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t soak in or evaporate too quickly, but doesn&#x27;t leave behind a sticky mess so that the  person receiving the massage can easily just turn over afterwards and go to sleep (without overly slicking up the sheets).</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old and my face now looks ten years younger.</li>
            <li>I am regular user of  Kamasutra Sweet Almond which cost almost $20 for small bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it on recent scars, but they are barely visible.</li>
            <li>This is a very large bottle and is an unbelievable price.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This oil is wonderful!</li>
            <li> wonderful massage oil.. binder</li>
            <li> and I realized its best if you mix it with something else.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s great for people who want it unscented.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m also buy a Kamasutra Oil of Love, and this item arrive just perfect, so I believe that here the problem is the packaging or the quality of bottles.    </li>

            <li> know i am using it in my daughters hair very healthy for the scalp.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great value, and the delivery is quick.</li>
            <li> Applying the oil was as easy as can be and had a great smell to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li> It is so amazing I cannot tell you.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it before, and liked it.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to rub into the skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after-film. ..  </li>
            <li> smell is not as nice as kamasutra.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is suitable for use in cooking too, or in salad dressing.  </li>
            <li> and it is a good light oil for massage.</li>
            <li> Nice for so many things....</li>
            <li> smells great and very smooth mixture.  very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Most importantly (to me), is that it has a neutral smell (the almond is nice &amp; pleasant) - no fluffy flower smells here which is great.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> It was a great purchase and worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I added some essential oil and it worked great!</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> and i think it is OK.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> I am sure.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast service.</li>
            <li> One word of advice though, whoever packaged this could definitely do a much better job.</li>
            <li> The bottle top was not sealed well at all</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I use in on my skin, hair, nails and even a bit on my pomeranian after I am done grooming him to softern his tail.</li>
            <li> I love it and will always order it from Amazon</li>
            <li> many wrinkles are either gone or diminished substantially.</li>
            <li> My overall skin looks the best it has in years..</li>
            <li> I will never buy this brand again and will make sure to check each and every bottle of EVERYTHING before I use it on my kids.</li>
            <li> Oil arrived on time, but company is still using PVC 3 packaging which is one of the more toxic varieties of plastic and one which can leak into the contents of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> a lovely almond-scented almond oil that I used to use. .</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s allergic to many bath oils/lotions but not this.</li>
            <li> As soon as I realized this I put it into a food safe container.</li>
            <li> I Love this Almond oil.</li>
            <li> My favorite massage oil.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> The oil itself was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for dry skin anywhere on your body including face.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect massage oil...not greasy, absorbs well, not too slippery, not too dry!  </li>
            <li> It also last along time which allows for a very good massage.  </li>
            <li> shipping was food and fast, the product no so good ,smell expired.</li>
            <li> Works great as a massage oil and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild.  </li>
            <li> If you are out to get a good product for a decent price.. you found it.</li>
            <li> High quality natural oils are the way to go for healthy beautiful hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and lasts.</li>
            <li> The oil is smooth, I found it stored well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally free of anything artifical.</li>
            <li> Diet is also important but castor oil works wonders.</li>
            <li> You want a smooth skin, get it.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I got this because it was 100% pure, and the price was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Very lovely light color and soft aroma.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Sweet Almond Oil\\&quot; bottle breaks; and the two books packaged with it (INCREDIBLE BOOKS AND OIL TOGETHER); got wet also one of them is destroyed.    </li>
            <li> First time I bought two bottle - one for myself and one for my sister and mom to share - they fell in love with it too</li>
            <li> and when I got myself a second bottle I also bought 2 more (1 for my mom and 1 for my sister because both wanted their own bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbed very quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This massage oil is good - it simply does what it&#x27;s advertised to do, really - it works great, goes on smooth and spreads out easily when giving back massages for example.</li>
            <li> I found article after article on the many benefits of 100% pure sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a sweet smelling almond?  </li>
            <li> love it so much.</li>
            <li> maybe that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but the oil absorbed too quickly into the skin, and I have to keep applying quite often as I massage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s better than the normal lotion I think for the skin</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be making good use out of it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Smooth and moisturises very well.</li>
            <li> I will buy again simply because i can add my own scent.</li>
            <li> Not much is needed to achieve a good scent.</li>
            <li> but I like it ok so far.</li>
            <li> It was economical for the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be dealing with this company again due to their great customer service as well as the quality of their products.</li>
            <li> It is very nice, clean, clear, and minimal scent.  </li>
            <li> I bought this last year after reading that Jackie O used sweet almond oil on her skin every day:)  </li>
            <li> this product was very well worth the money, i  have use sweet almond oils in my hair since i was a child</li>
            <li> Nothing like the pure Sweet Almond Oil purchased in Dominican Republic.</li>
            <li> This oil has a great feel and very little to no scent.</li>
            <li> The product worked good, but when I turned the bottle upside down the plastic rating in the triangle was a 3.</li>
            <li> This is 100% pure almond oil!  </li>
            <li> The whole purpose of making my own perfumes was to stay away from carcinogens in commercial brand perfumes.</li>
            <li> So I bought a bottle of this product during my first pregnancy and applied it nightly.  </li>
            <li> Overall satisfied of course wish it was a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> If the company corrects this issue, I would most definitely use the product again.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when I&#x27;ve finished up with this bottle.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Ive have received many compliments asking what im doing with my facial skin.</li>
            <li> Blended well w essential oils and sea salt to make a scrub that I enjoy!</li>
            <li> I ordered another type of almond oil which arrived in a PETE 1 plastic bottle (much less prone to leakage) and felt much more comfortable using that version.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful as a base to add to essential oils...works so nice and its very healthy, not only for hubby and I but for our doggie when he gets the itchies...</li>
            <li> Non sticky, clean and natural oil to be used for massages.</li>
            <li> Safe for children as long as there are no nut allergies.</li>
            <li> we mix it with other essential oils and rub him down lightly and its wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry skin and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Not super greasy and makes a nice addition to the bathwater.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it says that it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li> (*100% pure - or -almond oil*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this product</li>
            <li> Seems to be pure and works for the intended purpose of adding spearmint and peppermint and using for oil pulling.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much of this stuff in the bottle</li>
            <li> I do not have much knowledge.</li>
            <li> I used it the very 1st day</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It does not take much so the bottle lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviewers who pointed this out.  </li>
            <li> totally fragrant free</li>
            <li> so you are free to use any essential oils for fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t lost much but was irritated.</li>
            <li> The packaging not so much.</li>
            <li> Gentle for around eyes and makeup removal.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade lotion recipe, or just straight from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> this oil make your skin very smooth, and help with some dark area of your skin.</li>
            <li> (Aromatherapy Top 6 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Basic Sampler Essential Oil Gift Set).  </li>
            <li> It is a huge bottle and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> bottle I bought has a lid that slightly leaks, so if you do buy this, be sure to keep it upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few drops of this makes the whole room smell like almonds, my favorite extract for cooking.  </li>
            <li> The oil had leaked out a decent bit when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I don&#x27;t know THAT much about oils if you are, but for all others who are interested in something that works well.. have a good time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for being green trainings I do for early childhood educators and childcare providers; it&#x27;s helped people see the fun scents they can use in their own cleaning products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and 100% pure.  </li>
            <li> if your into making other natural things ... even makes a great refresher for your eyes if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> glides on, feels luxurious, and soothes dry skin all over but more importantly it is helping with our extremely dry, cracked and red patches of skin that all three of us have.  </li>
            <li> I like to apply it directly to my skin and also use it to create my own essential oils by adding citrus peels and other herbs.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned ordering this initially since I&#x27;ve never purchased this kind of stuff before</li>
            <li> None worked so great and some actually made my face worse.</li>
            <li> top it off, the plastic bottle was low grade plastic, not really meant to hold a product like this.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and switched from baby oil to this Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li> This product completely exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li> You know the saying, 2 4 5 you&#x27;ll stay alive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a distribution problem with Amazon  (old oil) or a problem with Nature&#x27;s Alchemy, but either way this oil should be pulled.</li>
            <li> And it is all natural.</li>
            <li> So far have used the three bottles over a period of four months and have no gripes on the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> You will not need much of this oil to take care of your massaging needs and therefore this bottle might last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you were hoping to use this professionally</li>
            <li> One day i decided to research  natural ways to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft..</li>
            <li> It smells rancid like its old or out dated.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my natural hair</li>
            <li> I like it so much that i wanted something bigger and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I put it on my body after the shower and it feels so soft afterwards&lt;</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars even though I was happy about the product, because unfortunately it is not a good practice to subject your customers to carcinogens.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have purchased this particular oil.  </li>
            <li> But, I just received the bottle and on the back label every time it mentions that is 100% pure, there is an asterisk next to it.</li>
            <li> My only concern is really questioning the quality as at times it can feel gritty</li>
            <li> I make a sea salt, almond oil, unscented hand lotion adding 5 or 6 drops of essential oil (tangerine) to make a lovely hand softening product with a delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li> Will be better if seller specified the container too with product information as I always buy in glass bottle and expected same, but the container for this oil is plastic, that causes the almond oil to break down and smell bad/pubgent.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil so I could make perfume out of natural essential oils.</li>
            <li> A natural product that comes in such a harmful material?!?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak in or evaporate too quickly, but doesn&#x27;t leave behind a sticky mess so that the  person receiving the massage can easily just turn over afterwards and go to sleep (without overly slicking up the sheets).</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and my face now looks ten years younger.</li>
            <li> I am regular user of  Kamasutra Sweet Almond which cost almost $20 for small bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it on recent scars, but they are barely visible.</li>
            <li> This is a very large bottle and is an unbelievable price.  </li>
            <li> I use this product to soothe my skin, sometimes mixing it with other recommended oils and sometimes even to use an essential oil to give it a pleasant odor (not that it is unpleasant by itself).</li>
            <li> It will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but not great.</li>
            <li> The weather here isn&#x27;t dry enough for me to judge its effectiveness ..</li>
            <li> did receive the other 2 products that i ordered on same invoice.  </li>
            <li> This oil smells like regular cooking oil, no almond smell like other oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who is battling dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Bought to help with dry lips -</li>
            <li> I put this on my face every single night and it has worked miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years now and are barely down half a bottle with fairly frequent use.</li>
            <li> I use this for daily use especially in the winter for the past 10 months.</li>
            <li> Should have went with my first pick that had higher ratings :(</li>
            <li> It has a slightly rancid  smell when you open the bottle</li>
            <li> Be careful though as the oil does have a tendency to get everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no problem.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> I use it after a shower while still wet, leaves my skin hydrated and</li>
            <li> that oil and does not readily absorb into the skin making you feel oily.</li>
            <li> After using this, I don&#x27;t think I would ever use any other type of oil again.</li>
            <li> I never used this product due to the recycle code 3, also know as the poison plastic.  </li>
            <li> It worked well in combination with the other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I am going to experiment with the almond oil in other home made products.</li>
            <li> I bought other brands and did not smell like that at all.</li>
            <li> I also use it as under eye moisturizer instead of chemically laden super expensive stuff, and works just as well, if not better.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I read it helps with dark circles.</li>
            <li> It did not have the sweet almond smell, in fact, it smelled very stale.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying one after the other of facial moisturizering creams.</li>
            <li> I did however stain my sheets a little so beware of that.  </li>
            <li> Just a word of caution, when initially applying the oil, be careful not to get it on clothes because it&#x27;s difficult to get out at that point.  </li>
            <li> I had to hurry and transfer it to another container before it wasted everywhere.</li>
            <li> This oil was not at all sticky or messy.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money don´t buy it.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this rip off</li>
            <li> it takes very little at a time.</li>
            <li> I would imagine it might make them sick if they got a large quantity of it.</li>
            <li> I have used it in the past.</li>
            <li> Do not buy in plastic bottle as the Oil in this plastic bottle has broken down and is pungent and offensive smelling.</li>
            <li> And to think I have been using this on my kids&#x27; delicate skin...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they sell me an older bottle or what did I do wrong!!</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean .</li>
            <li> I then read all the reviews and was pretty unhappy to read that the company uses dangerous PVC plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> and    If you know the plastic bottle is not very good, increase the package security!</li>
            <li> This oil is not too thin or thick</li>
            <li> unfortunately it went bad, the smell was terrible after 2 months of use and keep it in the dark closet obviously I didn&#x27;t use it anymore</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s MUCH less expensive than the crazy, fake, chemical laden massage oils!  </li>
            <li> would have given 5 stars, but there was a faint cooking smell from the oil.  </li>
            <li> It works like a dream and does not have a weird smell.  </li>
            <li> And stop wasting money on expensive cosmetics that do not work.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t remember the manufacturer&#x27;s name!&lt;br /&gt;However, unfortunately for me, this oil has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Slathering my face with castor oil in the shower and then rinsing it off the glare is controlled without expensive makeup!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product in an unpleasant contition (ie: it had leaked).</li>
            <li> Frustrated.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the oil was rancid when I opened it, making it unusable.</li>
            <li> The smell was so bad that after just sniffing it I had that nasty odor in my nostrils all day.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with the packaging of this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the smell.</li>
            <li> The worst part about having it in a massage oil is the chemicals will be massaged into the skin and enter the bloodstream unfiltered.  </li>
            <li> I am outraged!    </li>
            <li> but the stuff we received was horribly rancid.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is horrible.  </li>

            <li> This item is odorless?  Thought it would be a sweet smelling almond?  I guess these almonds don&#x27;t have an odor?</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned ordering this initially since I&#x27;ve never purchased this kind of stuff before but I&#x27;m glad that I did.  It was a great purchase and worked very well.  Applying the oil was as easy as can be and had a great smell to it.  The oil wasn&#x27;t very oily or messy at all.  Just a word of caution, when initially applying the oil, be careful not to get it on clothes because it&#x27;s difficult to get out at that point.  After it&#x27;s been applied to skin, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off on clothing or whatever.  There&#x27;s so much of this stuff in the bottle so I&#x27;ll be making good use out of it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> smells great and very smooth mixture.  very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Non sticky, clean and natural oil to be used for massages. After using this, I don&#x27;t think I would ever use any other type of oil again. Goes on smooth and lasts. Be careful though as the oil does have a tendency to get everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this oil twice - and plan on re-ordering as often as needed.  First time I bought two bottle - one for myself and one for my sister and mom to share - they fell in love with it too and when I got myself a second bottle I also bought 2 more (1 for my mom and 1 for my sister because both wanted their own bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glides on, feels luxurious, and soothes dry skin all over but more importantly it is helping with our extremely dry, cracked and red patches of skin that all three of us have.  There is no smell.  It feels wonderful on the skin.  Great product for a great value, and the delivery is quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with the packaging of this product. The \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Sweet Almond Oil\\&quot; bottle breaks; and the two books packaged with it (INCREDIBLE BOOKS AND OIL TOGETHER); got wet also one of them is destroyed.    I will ask for a refund, or resend of damage items.    I&#x27;m also buy a Kamasutra Oil of Love, and this item arrive just perfect, so I believe that here the problem is the packaging or the quality of bottles.    How do you package fluids and books together? and    If you know the plastic bottle is not very good, increase the package security!</li>
            <li> Works great as a massage oil and shipping was super fast. would have given 5 stars, but there was a faint cooking smell from the oil.  I added some essential oil and it worked great! I will buy again simply because i can add my own scent.</li>
            <li> never received product.  says it was delivered,but never received.  did receive the other 2 products that i ordered on same invoice.  could not find the \\&quot;contact seller\\&quot; link that \\&quot;help\\&quot; suggested.</li>
            <li> I use this for daily use especially in the winter for the past 10 months. I do not have much knowledge. It serves the purpose. Happy about the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil so I could make perfume out of natural essential oils. The product worked good, but when I turned the bottle upside down the plastic rating in the triangle was a 3. You know the saying, 2 4 5 you&#x27;ll stay alive. Well when plastic is given a 3 that means that the plastic was treated with pvc which can leak into foods and is a known carcinogen. The whole purpose of making my own perfumes was to stay away from carcinogens in commercial brand perfumes. I was very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the oil was rancid when I opened it, making it unusable. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a distribution problem with Amazon  (old oil) or a problem with Nature&#x27;s Alchemy, but either way this oil should be pulled.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this oil to anyone that enjoys a good massage.  The oil is not scented, which I like.  It also last along time which allows for a very good massage.  And it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Pros- 1st thing it is almond. Good for health. I used it the very 1st day and i love it. It is really really good massaging oil. Some people are worried about plastic. Initially i also gave a thought but Com&#x27;on. It is used just for massaging purpose and i think it is OK.  Your skin looks shiny and glowing.  Cons- None as of now. It would be great in glass bottles though.  I recommend for adults as well as babies. I have absolutely no problem.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have very dry skin and switched from baby oil to this Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Sweet Almond Oil. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Great price too!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have purchased this particular oil.  It is very nice, clean, clear, and minimal scent.  I will purchase again I am sure.</li>
            <li> I got this because I read it helps with dark circles. It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything. It&#x27;s not bad, but not great.</li>
            <li> A Spanish friend recommended using almond oil to prevent stretch marks.  So I bought a bottle of this product during my first pregnancy and applied it nightly.  I can&#x27;t say whether or not this product deserves the credit, but I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  So I&#x27;ve purchased another for my second pregnancy and at 32 weeks, no stretch marks yet.      The oil is smooth, I found it stored well and it&#x27;s a good value for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Have been using this to massage our babies every morning to get blood circulation and also to prevent drying of skin during the winters. So far have used the three bottles over a period of four months and have no gripes on the quality of this product. Overall satisfied of course wish it was a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> I replaced my body lotion with this product. It is not sticky. My skin is looking good. My feets are softer. I am using almond oil in my face as welI. I notice a big difference in my skin. I will buy this product again. Thanks</li>
            <li> I use this as both body oil as well as to massage my head and it is a great product. My skin and hair retain moisture after its use, and I don&#x27;t need a body-lotion anymore!</li>
            <li> I found that this oil has a very good texture - not too greasy and it absorbs well.  I have not noticed any problems with it staining or leaving marks on fabrics.  The scent is very mild.  It feels great for massages and seems to be a good value.  My pets (cats and dog) seem to like it a lot - they try to lick it off my hands - so I would recommend keeping the bottle away from pets.  I would imagine it might make them sick if they got a large quantity of it.</li>
            <li> This oil is light and smells great! I like to apply it directly to my skin and also use it to create my own essential oils by adding citrus peels and other herbs.</li>
            <li> I never used this product due to the recycle code 3, also know as the poison plastic.  I can&#x27;t believe anyone would use a recycle code 3 plastic associated with any food/skin care item.  The worst part about having it in a massage oil is the chemicals will be massaged into the skin and enter the bloodstream unfiltered.  The chemicals accelerate into the almond oil when the plastic is heated via shipping/storage.  I will be requesting a refund, as well as writing a very critical message to this company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but the oil absorbed too quickly into the skin, and I have to keep applying quite often as I massage.</li>
            <li> If you are out to get a good product for a decent price.. you found it. You will not need much of this oil to take care of your massaging needs and therefore this bottle might last quite a while. I don&#x27;t know if you were hoping to use this professionally and unfortunately I don&#x27;t know THAT much about oils if you are, but for all others who are interested in something that works well.. have a good time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I bought has a lid that slightly leaks, so if you do buy this, be sure to keep it upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not find this review helpful, please comment as to why. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast service. Thank you</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry skin and dry hair. It is good for giving massages as well.  It does not take much so the bottle lasts a while. This is a great product and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year after reading that Jackie O used sweet almond oil on her skin every day:)  I got this because it was 100% pure, and the price was pretty good. It works like a dream and does not have a weird smell.  I then read all the reviews and was pretty unhappy to read that the company uses dangerous PVC plastic bottles. I would like to know whether the company has rectified this issue before purchasing this again. Does anyone have an update on this??? Thanks to the reviewers who pointed this out.  If the company corrects this issue, I would most definitely use the product again. I gave it 3 stars even though I was happy about the product, because unfortunately it is not a good practice to subject your customers to carcinogens.</li>
            <li> I bought this product since my kids have eczema it helps a lot unfortunately it went bad, the smell was terrible after 2 months of use and keep it in the dark closet obviously I didn&#x27;t use it anymore and I purchase another brand. I don&#x27;t know if they sell me an older bottle or what did I do wrong!!</li>
            <li> It is def a good product. Its just that I received mine leaking everywhere. I had to hurry and transfer it to another container before it wasted everywhere.</li>
            <li> Works awesome on the skin. It&#x27;s really smooth and smells great. I use it for &amp;#34;special time&amp;#34;..... if you know what I mean . Ummmm hmm</li>
            <li> This oil was not at all sticky or messy. It absorbed very quickly into the skin. I will definitely buy more when I&#x27;ve finished up with this bottle. One word of advice though, whoever packaged this could definitely do a much better job. The bottle top was not sealed well at all and it leaked through the cardboard box it was mailed it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it before, and liked it.  We use it for massage.  Has a wonderful consistency.  It&#x27;s still a great product!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for being green trainings I do for early childhood educators and childcare providers; it&#x27;s helped people see the fun scents they can use in their own cleaning products.  A few drops of this makes the whole room smell like almonds, my favorite extract for cooking.  It makes me happy and the attendees love it, too.</li>
            <li> I got this oil so my husband can give me massages!  It is quality stuff, and does not irritate my skin.  I did however stain my sheets a little so beware of that.  It is a huge bottle and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> i use this in a flea spray for my dogs! great buy for the cost and size. will purchase again</li>
            <li> This massage oil is good - it simply does what it&#x27;s advertised to do, really - it works great, goes on smooth and spreads out easily when giving back massages for example. It doesn&#x27;t soak in or evaporate too quickly, but doesn&#x27;t leave behind a sticky mess so that the  person receiving the massage can easily just turn over afterwards and go to sleep (without overly slicking up the sheets). Most importantly (to me), is that it has a neutral smell (the almond is nice &amp; pleasant) - no fluffy flower smells here which is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use as an eye makeup remover, and it is great.  It doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes and also feels good as a body oil.  It&#x27;s all natural and 100% pure.  This is a very large bottle and is an unbelievable price.  This is suitable for use in cooking too, or in salad dressing.  It&#x27;s totally free of anything artifical.</li>
            <li> This oil smells like regular cooking oil, no almond smell like other oils I&#x27;ve used. Should have went with my first pick that had higher ratings :(</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time yesterday.  It is exactly as described.  Very lovely light color and soft aroma.  I used this in a magnesium lotion I was making as gifts.  It worked well in combination with the other ingredients.  I will definitely order again.  I am going to experiment with the almond oil in other home made products.</li>
            <li> love it so much. i put in my hair sleep with it in then wash out in the am. use it for my skin. i also use it as a makeup remover around the eyes then wash my face when im done</li>
            <li> This is wonderful as a base to add to essential oils...works so nice and its very healthy, not only for hubby and I but for our doggie when he gets the itchies...we mix it with other essential oils and rub him down lightly and its wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy in plastic bottle as the Oil in this plastic bottle has broken down and is pungent and offensive smelling. Will be better if seller specified the container too with product information as I always buy in glass bottle and expected same, but the container for this oil is plastic, that causes the almond oil to break down and smell bad/pubgent.</li>
            <li> shipping was food and fast, the product no so good ,smell expired. I bought other brands and did not smell like that at all.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I use in on my skin, hair, nails and even a bit on my pomeranian after I am done grooming him to softern his tail. Really good oil.</li>
            <li> I love it and will always order it from Amazon</li>
            <li> This product completely exceeded my expectations!  I&#x27;d been paying a lot of attention to the chemicals I was putting in my body via food by buying organic, etc. and then I read an article about how the chemicals in lotions, etc. go into our bodies via skin!  This is 100% pure almond oil!  And IT WORKS GREAT!  It is the perfect massage oil...not greasy, absorbs well, not too slippery, not too dry!  Plus ounce for ounce it&#x27;s MUCH less expensive than the crazy, fake, chemical laden massage oils!  VERY SATISFIED!  Give it a try...you never go back!</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying one after the other of facial moisturizering creams. None worked so great and some actually made my face worse. One day i decided to research  natural ways to moisturize my face. I found article after article on the many benefits of 100% pure sweet almond oil. It helps with the deep wrinkles as well as tiny ones. It helps repair sun dmanage. I put this on my face every single night and it has worked miracles on my skin. My skin is soft..many wrinkles are either gone or diminished substantially. My overall skin looks the best it has in years..ten years off my face. Ive have received many compliments asking what im doing with my facial skin. I am 58 years old and my face now looks ten years younger. I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> It smells great. We used it in a crafting project and we loved it. Not much is needed to achieve a good scent.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time!  Smells great.  My only concern is really questioning the quality as at times it can feel gritty but since I&#x27;m no expert, it gets a 4.  Nice product!</li>
            <li> This oil is not too thin or thick it is well balanced</li>
            <li> I like this and it is a good light oil for massage. That said, I have moved on to castor oil as my go to oil for skin and hair in the shower. Try castor oil for skin and hair. It is so amazing I cannot tell you. A friend recently asked if I had plastic surgery. And stop wasting money on expensive cosmetics that do not work. High quality natural oils are the way to go for healthy beautiful hair and skin. The rest is a bunch of hype designed to separate you from your money. I am an actor and with castor oil I do not even wear makeup for auditions anymore. I used to matte my skin before a film audition to prevent glare. Well guess what? Slathering my face with castor oil in the shower and then rinsing it off the glare is controlled without expensive makeup! Diet is also important but castor oil works wonders. Again, almond oil like this I would recommend for massage.</li>
            <li> this product was very well worth the money, i  have use sweet almond oils in my hair since i was a child know i am using it in my daughters hair very healthy for the scalp.</li>
            <li> I find that when i apply on my zits it reduces its size. If left applied on my hair for 1-2 days it makes them silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> this oil make your skin very smooth, and help with some dark area of your skin. Of course the change of the darkness would not change from day to night. it requires daily use. You want a smooth skin, get it. You wont regret</li>
            <li> I was happy with this massage oil... until my son discovered it comes in a bottle made of PVC!!! A natural product that comes in such a harmful material?!? And to think I have been using this on my kids&#x27; delicate skin... I am outraged!    I will never buy this brand again and will make sure to check each and every bottle of EVERYTHING before I use it on my kids.</li>
            <li> Very good carrier oil. I use it for mixing several different essential oils. It will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> Oil arrived on time, but company is still using PVC 3 packaging which is one of the more toxic varieties of plastic and one which can leak into the contents of the bottle.  I ordered another type of almond oil which arrived in a PETE 1 plastic bottle (much less prone to leakage) and felt much more comfortable using that version.</li>
            <li> I like it.  totally fragrant free so you are free to use any essential oils for fragrance.  Personally, I was hoping it smelled like almonds!</li>
            <li> Odorless, good quality product.</li>
            <li> I read reviews, but no one seemed to mention fragrance, so I took a chance.  I was actually looking for something I&#x27;d had before .. a lovely almond-scented almond oil that I used to use. . . but I can&#x27;t remember the manufacturer&#x27;s name!&lt;br /&gt;However, unfortunately for me, this oil has no fragrance. .. .&lt;br /&gt;Then I stopped and thought. . hmm. maybe that&#x27;s not a bad thing. .I can use it when I&#x27;m using perfume elsewhere, so there&#x27;s no clash.  It does seem to rub into the skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after-film. ..  The weather here isn&#x27;t dry enough for me to judge its effectiveness .. but I like it ok so far. .. I gave it two stars for not having fragrance. . and for not SAYING so in its description.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s great for people who want it unscented.</li>
            <li> The Almond Oil works well and does what I purchased it for.  It has a slightly rancid  smell when you open the bottle but when you rub it on the body, that smell isn&#x27;t noticeable.  But I have given (and received) some great massages since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This oil has a great feel and very little to no scent. I am using it to hopefully prevent stretch marks from pregnancy. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the smell. It smells rancid like its old or out dated. Nothing like the pure Sweet Almond Oil purchased in Dominican Republic. Having problems printing the provided return label. Frustrated.</li>
            <li> I do not know if we received a defective bottle but the stuff we received was horribly rancid.  The smell was so bad that after just sniffing it I had that nasty odor in my nostrils all day.  You put this on your body and I suspect no one will dare come close to you for days.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product in an unpleasant contition (ie: it had leaked). I hadn&#x27;t lost much but was irritated. When the Company found out about it, they sent me 2 bottles. I tell you this company is concerned about their customers and is great to deal with. The Almond Oil smells good and smooths on very nicely. I will certainly be dealing with this company again due to their great customer service as well as the quality of their products. Thank you, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> I use this product to soothe my skin, sometimes mixing it with other recommended oils and sometimes even to use an essential oil to give it a pleasant odor (not that it is unpleasant by itself).</li>
            <li> A great base for mixing essential oils. Safe for children as long as there are no nut allergies. Not super greasy and makes a nice addition to the bathwater.</li>
            <li> Low-scent and it takes very little at a time. We&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years now and are barely down half a bottle with fairly frequent use. She&#x27;s allergic to many bath oils/lotions but not this.</li>
            <li> It was economical for the price. Blended well w essential oils and sea salt to make a scrub that I enjoy!</li>
            <li> The oil itself was pretty good. The packaging not so much. The oil had leaked out a decent bit when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, the plastic bottle was low grade plastic, not really meant to hold a product like this. From what I read, it is entirely possible that the plastic could bleed chemicals into the oil which would then be applied to your skin. No thanks. As soon as I realized this I put it into a food safe container.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful! Absorbs quickly into the skin. I use it after a shower while still wet, leaves my skin hydrated and&lt;br /&gt;soft. I would recommend this product for anyone who is battling dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I Love this Almond oil. It is not greasy. My skin has greatly improved since I started using this almond oil.</li>
            <li> really good product and arrived on time</li>
            <li> It did not have the sweet almond smell, in fact, it smelled very stale. I used it to make homemade body butter - added essential oils, cocoa butter, coconut oil, etc., - all these ingredients were able to counteract the stale smell - I did not feel like going through the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> My favorite massage oil.</li>
            <li> I have used it in the past. Love it.</li>
            <li> Nice for so many things.... wonderful massage oil.. binder if your into making other natural things ... even makes a great refresher for your eyes if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my natural hair and I realized its best if you mix it with something else. I used shea butter as well as coconut oil which i purchased on amazon as well.</li>
            <li> Awesome, just fabulous quality! Smooth and moisturises very well. Gentle for around eyes and makeup removal. Just perfect for dry skin anywhere on your body including face. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I make a sea salt, almond oil, unscented hand lotion adding 5 or 6 drops of essential oil (tangerine) to make a lovely hand softening product with a delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am regular user of  Kamasutra Sweet Almond which cost almost $20 for small bottle.I like it so much that i wanted something bigger and cheaper. So I bought Alchemy Almond, But the skin does not absorb it well and left me greasy .The smell is not as nice as kamasutra. Beware not all oil is the same, it will vary in quality dempending of the brand. This is a waste of money don´t buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It&#x27;s great to use as a moisturizer and helps reduce surgical scars. I&#x27;ve only used it on recent scars, but they are barely visible.</li>
            <li> I put it on my body after the shower and it feels so soft afterwards&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than the normal lotion I think for the skin&lt;br /&gt;Good product</li>
            <li> Good at removing makeup.  Also a good moisturizing oil.  I put some this product into smaller bottles and added essential oils to it (Aromatherapy Top 6 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Basic Sampler Essential Oil Gift Set).  Worked great!</li>
            <li> this stuff is horrible.  No scent to it.  Could be vegetable oil for all i know!!  Dont waste your money on this rip off</li>
            <li> Great oil to mix or use alone. Great moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my hair! it&#x27;s been healthier.. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to every girl with dyed hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Bought to help with dry lips - I prefer how my skins reacts to coconut oil. Almond oil is just that oil and does not readily absorb into the skin making you feel oily. Also it does not have the anti-bacterial aspects of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it says that it&#x27;s 100% pure. But, I just received the bottle and on the back label every time it mentions that is 100% pure, there is an asterisk next to it. (*100% pure - or -almond oil*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this product</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade lotion recipe, or just straight from the bottle.  Either way, works great. I don&#x27;t find it to be too greasy, either.  I also use it as under eye moisturizer instead of chemically laden super expensive stuff, and works just as well, if not better.  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Seems to be pure and works for the intended purpose of adding spearmint and peppermint and using for oil pulling.</li>
