            <li>Really recommend this perfume smells great on anyone and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Hot Couture.  </li>
            <li>This is an older perfume, but there are a lot of people like myself, that love it!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted!!</li>
            <li>The scent is so unique i get complemented all the time for it</li>
            <li>difiere del aroma original, parece una fragancia diferente y su duración no es buena.</li>
            <li>Bottle was full.  </li>
            <li>Product came quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>It gets here quick.</li>
            <li>Love it thanks for a great product for half the price</li>
            <li>, while it isn&#x27;t cheap, this paid dividends ;)</li>
            <li>and I ordered it right away.</li>
            <li>I found the price very reasonable and the item was recieved pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Best blind pick I&#x27;ve made with a perfume.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Hot Couture EDT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic!</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So, needlesstosay, I am very dissapointed........</li>
            <li>I guess I would describe the smell as fresh, classy and tempting.</li>
            <li>It does not smell the same as the original.</li>
            <li>I started wearing this HOT COTURE when I was 15 years old</li>
            <li>Basically it starts to break down and smells more like alcohol than anything else.</li>
            <li>less is more in the summer months of course.</li>
            <li>I ordered this in the punk label and got two bottles of the older version which was the darker spray.</li>
            <li>But she seems pleasantly surprised the scent is the same familiar one</li>
            <li>I have been told it&#x27;s mesmerizing, just today actually.  </li>
            <li>Came brand new in box.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very classy smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>However, upon further examination, I received Hot Couture EDP.</li>
            <li>This is a totally different fragance from what I ordered, Hot Couture EDT.</li>
            <li>This is has a soft but spicy smell to it.</li>
            <li>EDP smells like an old woman.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, and for half the price.</li>

            <li> I Highly Recommend It, Only Thing Is Hard To Find In Department Stores</li>
            <li> its hard to find in the mall and costs twice as much.</li>
            <li> Crazy not to search for other Amazon items available!</li>
            <li> Its not very overpowering and doesn&#x27;t linger as long though.</li>
            <li> My wife was concerned the pink color vs the darker tone</li>
            <li> Only Takes A Few Squirts</li>
            <li> Came in mail as expected.</li>
            <li> In fact, she found an almost empty bottle somewhere and specifically requested it.  </li>
            <li> Compliments are endless every time.</li>
            <li> There are two kinds and they give you a picture of the pink one and send the amber color one!</li>
            <li> Oh and I bought it here because it was cheaper than other sites too.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for having my perfume, at $30 less than department stores.</li>
            <li> Still drives him crazy after 7 years ;)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t realize it would be so difficult to find and was heartbroken when she couldn&#x27;t track any down locally.  </li>
            <li> If anyone has ever Had a fragrance past two years then you understand.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find these days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so annoyed I wasted 60bucks on this and cannot even return it.</li>
            <li> and i was disappointed because it smells old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not sure!!!</li>
            <li> I almost hate when people ask for the fragrance since it&#x27;s my hidden secret!</li>
            <li> Needless to say</li>
            <li> It smelled just the way I remember,  was cheaper on Amazon, and there was nothing wrong with it when it came.</li>
            <li> so guys have always hit on me but this perfume drives them CRAZY !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this perfume.  Compliments are endless every time. Best blind pick I&#x27;ve made with a perfume.  I would consider this a warm scent but I wear all year.  Somewhat gourmand/sweet, somewhat musky and very sexy and unique! I almost hate when people ask for the fragrance since it&#x27;s my hidden secret! Staying power is great also...less is more in the summer months of course.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal that went very smoothly without any kind of interruptions whatsoever.  Shipped well and didn&#x27;t dig into my pocketbook.  Crazy not to search for other Amazon items available!</li>
            <li> will repurchase again and again - one of my favorite perfumes &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Hot Couture is a fun happy fragrance! It was a great price for the size of the bottle!</li>
            <li> I shopped online for hours looking not only for this type of perfume but also this cheapest price.  I purchased this perfume as a birthday gift.  They loved it!  Came brand new in box.  Bottle was full.  Perfect smell.  Would purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> My wife was concerned the pink color vs the darker tone it was before may have altered the scent. But she seems pleasantly surprised the scent is the same familiar one she&#x27;s always been fon of. Its not very overpowering and doesn&#x27;t linger as long though. But she&#x27;s happy with it and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Hot Couture.  It is hard to find these days and I was so happy to get this.</li>
            <li> Is a hard item to get right. This is an older perfume, but there are a lot of people like myself, that love it! Your. Price was great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It does not smell the same as the original. I only got it from amazon because I wanted a bigger bottle for a cheaper price. The smell is definitely different. Does not last long and has an alcohol smell to it. I&#x27;m so annoyed I wasted 60bucks on this and cannot even return it. NEVER AGAIN. The feedbacks were very misleading. !!!!! don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and as described. I love the smell and get compliments all the time. Was a great deal and would purchase again</li>
            <li> This is has a soft but spicy smell to it. It lasts all day and I get tons of compliments on it. Love getting from Amazon bc It gets here quick. Really recommend this perfume smells great on anyone and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in the punk label and got two bottles of the older version which was the darker spray. Not what I ordered. There are two kinds and they give you a picture of the pink one and send the amber color one! I&#x27;m ticked! They are two different smells!</li>
            <li> Hot Couture Is The Best Smelling Perfume I Have Ever Purchased! Only Takes A Few Squirts It Stays With You Through Out The Day! I Highly Recommend It, Only Thing Is Hard To Find In Department Stores Think It May Have Been Discontinued But With Any Luck Hopefully They Will Bring It Back!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance and i was disappointed because it smells old. If anyone has ever Had a fragrance past two years then you understand. Basically it starts to break down and smells more like alcohol than anything else. I haven&#x27;t contacted the company but i plan to.</li>
            <li> it smells delicious, great for the summer. I would recommend this fragrance to any one. fast shipping. I love it</li>
            <li> The scent is so unique i get complemented all the time for it, it stays for hours.My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> My wife was so tickled when I gave her this for Christmas.  She didn&#x27;t realize it would be so difficult to find and was heartbroken when she couldn&#x27;t track any down locally.  Needless to say, while it isn&#x27;t cheap, this paid dividends ;)</li>
            <li> El aroma del perfume difiere del aroma original, parece una fragancia diferente y su duración no es buena.</li>
            <li> Love it thanks for a great product for half the price</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time finding this perfume at major department stores, but I have found it several times on Amazon at a reasonable price.  I am very pleased with the service I always receive from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. It smelled just the way I remember,  was cheaper on Amazon, and there was nothing wrong with it when it came. Thank you Amazon for having my perfume, at $30 less than department stores.</li>
            <li> My favorite!  Love this smell and so do the people around me EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Was gift for daughter. Came in mail as expected. Was awesome deal. Bought this six years ago double the price. I would have like to keep for myself. But was Xmas gift for my baby.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  Also had to get for my daughter.  Smells even better in her. Saved a lot of money by shopping on amazon!</li>
            <li> She loved it.  So I would recommend this as a gift too. In fact, she found an almost empty bottle somewhere and specifically requested it.  Oh and I bought it here because it was cheaper than other sites too.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance! People tell me how wonderful it smells.</li>
            <li> my nora loves this stuff. its hard to find in the mall and costs twice as much. she ended up leaving me over an led lighting cost dispute but while she was here, it smelled real nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered Hot Couture EDT. I found the price very reasonable and the item was recieved pretty quickly. However, upon further examination, I received Hot Couture EDP. This is a totally different fragance from what I ordered, Hot Couture EDT. I informed the vendor of the mix up and was told that they would arrange for me to get the correct item. I have yet to recieve a return label or the correct item. So, needlesstosay, I am very dissapointed........</li>
            <li> My good friend wore this one day and I ordered it right away. It&#x27;s a very classy smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. It&#x27;s a classic!</li>
            <li> I loves this sent. I have been told it&#x27;s mesmerizing, just today actually.  Many men complement me on it. What could be better then that.</li>
            <li> I started wearing this HOT COTURE when I was 15 years old and I am 28 now. I am a tall blonde so guys have always hit on me but this perfume drives them CRAZY ! Not to mention the fact I LOVE IT ! Heaven HAS to smell like this stuff. I guess I would describe the smell as fresh, classy and tempting. I can spray it on a shirt and it will still smell WONDERFUL 2 weeks later. My husband says he can smell me before he sees me and he LOVES it. Still drives him crazy after 7 years ;)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, and for half the price. In-store this bottle is $120. This is the Eau de Toilette which smells way better than the Eau de Parfume in my opinion. EDP smells like an old woman.</li>
            <li> It is my daughter in law favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume was discontinued out of the stores. A friend told us to look on amazon and I found it, and it was perfect! It was exactly what she wanted!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not sure!!! It could be a knockoff bc it didnt smell as sweet as my old LEGIT one; however it still smells great and ppl are still complimenting me on it!</li>
