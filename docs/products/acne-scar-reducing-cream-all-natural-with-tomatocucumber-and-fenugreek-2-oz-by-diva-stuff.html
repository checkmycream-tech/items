            <li>, it seems like a good preventative at least.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product smells good g</li>
            <li>I also use emu oil or Rose hips and Carrot seed oil to moisturize my skin, it feels great and is wonderful for after the peel, I use on clean skin at night, doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>

            <li>Absolutely LOVE Diva stuff acne scar cream!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Acne Scar Reducing Cream for about two weeks and am already seeing amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer  </li>
            <li>this honestly did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearing and spots are fading and my skin has a nice bronze glow.</li>
            <li>One more good thing</li>
            <li>Have to say, I am so happy with the quick results of this product.  </li>
            <li>I love love it!</li>
            <li>Super grateful!!</li>
            <li>But then I figured with it being a good price and having all natural ingredients that are proven to be good for skin, that there was no harm in giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so very happy, and would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>And for some reason, my freckles are now more visible (maybe I just stopped noticing them?</li>
            <li>But this cream really works great for acne scars/dark spots.</li>
            <li>so whatever product you use should work better.</li>
            <li>and it works better than anything I got from dermatologist.</li>
            <li>A homeopath would diagnose me as a sufur person which is why I respond so well to it, you may respond better to the minerals in sea salts or mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a skin bleach combo that does work for most people but you can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t use it for extended periods and can have some side effects(also is carcinogenic).</li>

            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more diva stuff products.</li>
            <li>Its ok....</li>
            <li>It produce me more acne</li>
            <li>I have had it for more than a week</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Hey, if anyone has found an awesome product, especially one that reduces pore size or helps with fine lines please let me know.</li>

            <li>In Japan lotion is more like what we would consider a hydrating toner, a light liquid.</li>
            <li>So far, they all smell great</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my face feeling so smooth and soft !</li>
            <li>Excited to see more results after longer use</li>
            <li>so I get acne scars really easy..</li>
            <li>The product does not have a strong smell, it is very light and penetrates the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>Also retinoic acid seems to cause fine lines on me.</li>

            <li>Then pat your serum on or a light lotion to seal in the moisture, but you can skip this part.</li>
            <li>, I was fortunate.</li>
            <li>, I was fortunate.</li>
            <li>The skin feels moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>Diva stuff seems to offer some unique products</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this cream is really awesome.</li>
            <li>Really have seen a difference in my face scars very quickly!</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>Add to that the gentle and clean lemon-tomato scent - I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t turn bright red now.</li>
            <li>Drink more water and do gentle face and neck lymph massage to keep the fluids from being retained in your face and remove toxins from skin.</li>

            <li>While I don&#x27;t have deep acne scars I do have pigmentation, I thought this would be a good product to try.  </li>
            <li>So when I found this I had to get it especially with all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>smells kind all the natural ingrediants</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything on Amazon before, but I really had to with this one.</li>
            <li>I woke up in the morning and SWEET MAMA JAMA</li>
            <li>So, full disclosure: I&#x27;d purchased another skin product on Amazon some time ago, this was also suggested, and I went ahead and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>(That is If you don&#x27;t have a systemic imbalance, also hormone bumps cannot really be prevented but the severity can be reduced and healed more quickly)</li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s mild and goes away.</li>
            <li>It fades my scar quickly and moisturize my skin as well..</li>
            <li>Received it so quickly and have been using it day 1</li>
            <li>I was practically jumping up and down with joy.</li>
            <li>But I have to say their acne products are amazing and the only thing that has ever cleared my acne.  </li>
            <li>It smells like fresh ingredindents have been placed in the serum.</li>
            <li>If you do not have success with just this lotion please take these suggestions, I am giving them because I know the heartbreak of acne and hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I wet my face, rub in a good amount of the sulfur soap than brush my teeth, by the time I am done</li>
            <li>I am African American with a light complexion which was in really good condition, I was fortunate.</li>

            <li>I am African American with a light complexion which was in really good condition, I was fortunate.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>and I love that they&#x27;re so natural.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too as it smells like the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I did not see results right away but after about 3 weeks there was progress made.</li>
            <li>I have also read good things about mandelic acid when it comes to brightening skin and removing dark marks</li>
            <li>When I apply my makeup it goes on a lot more smooth due to the tightening effect this stuff has on my pores.</li>
            <li>My face is starting to look a lot better.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I started using it was that as soon as I applied it to my face</li>
            <li>This stuff is really a miracle for my skin!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s how I got the 30% reduction, in the first week.</li>
            <li>, I found this really balances my combination skin and makes it feel plump and moist and fresh.</li>
            <li>but really I didn&#x27;t have much acne, started to get more in my early 30s</li>
            <li>but really I didn&#x27;t have much acne, started to get more in my early 30s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not heavy feeling so you can put it on under makeup.</li>
            <li>This product reduced my acne scars by so much!</li>
            <li>Oh and the way it smells is an abomination, so if you end up buying/using this, make sure you don&#x27;t interact with human beings after applying it to your face.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, I was initially concerned when I felt this very emollient cream, but it provides perfectly balanced moisturization - never too heavy.</li>
            <li>He screamed, &amp;#34;It works!&amp;#34; when the first time he used it.</li>
            <li>It is not oily but it is moisturizing, yes it makes my face sweat first couple minutes</li>
            <li>Most importantly though is that after 3 weeks I am definitely starting to see a major improvement in my acne scars!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, natural and works fine under make-up.</li>
            <li>First let me say this worked really well for me, this reduced my acne hyperpigmentation by 40% and reduced the size of the acne scar by 30%.</li>
            <li>Acne, acne scars, oily skin, large pores, ect.</li>
            <li>Go to your derm if you really can&#x27;t get relief from my suggestions or natural products, get a Jessner peel or lactic acid peel for acne scars, you could get TCA but that stuff is strong and has a lot of downtime while you are all burnt up and crispity and can&#x27;t go out side, but it does totally sandblast your face so it might be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;About</li>

            <li>My skin texture is still a little uneven, so I am still searching for the best product for that.</li>
            <li>I used this product for a couple months and didn&#x27;t see any visible results, it really didn&#x27;t do anything for my scars.</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t really do anything for my scars.</li>
            <li>thanks for the smaples that came with it to.</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>and it did not bleach the skin around it, which I was very grateful for.</li>
            <li>I am a REAL person look at my reviews and comments.</li>
            <li>But be careful if you mix too many acids</li>
            <li>Basically fast your skin one day a week, no make up, no lotion</li>
            <li>Your skin is really hydrated not oily</li>
            <li>, It really reduces my break outs and shortens the length of break out.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions about what I did please ask, I won&#x27;t post pictures of my before and after because I really don&#x27;t want that floating on the internet forever, but I am considering cropping it and attaching a jpeg if I can figure out how (I see where to upload a vid but not a pic).</li>

            <li>you will have to put it on twice a day to really get results.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works at lightening acne scars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>really helped my acne scars.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m very self-conscious about my skin.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommended this product!</li>
            <li>havent really seen a change in my acne scars, wish it didnt smell like tomatoes probably wont buy again</li>
            <li>Again, I really wish I had taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and then how much the scars have cleared after using this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is affordable and it really works.</li>
            <li>Also, my face was normally so oily I would have to reapply makeup 3+ times a day and since using this I haven&#x27;t had to worry about my face getting as oily!</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products, but sometimes they just aren&#x27;t fast enough, or strong</li>
            <li>Lactic acid peel felt like thousands of little needles in my face but didn&#x27;t really hurt, a salicylic acid peel I did at 20% burned and hurt my skin much more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not overly sensitive to smells, but this was too much for me.</li>
            <li>your skin will be too sensitive and could really weaken your skin&#x27;s protective barrier.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say for the price this is DEFINITELY worth trying if you have even the slightest scarring from acne.</li>
            <li>my reviews if you want to know the products)&lt;br /&gt;2)After all these treatments I use Arbutin face masks made in Korea on my face, I use them while I am breaking out to help prevent the acne bumps from turning into dark hyperpigment, I also use them as sort of an upkeep after the peels and acids, they are moisturizing and smell good, but I am not sure how much they actually help, I haven&#x27;t done a controlled experiment, but I think they help (and the masks scare my boyfriend which is fun;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a week of diligent use, I can honestly say that the scar appears less deep, and a bonus -</li>
            <li>I get stubborn dark marks just from a mosquito bite, that&#x27;s how easily I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it maybe 3 weeks now and let me just say... WOW!</li>
            <li>I did 2 light peels, the second one, I literally peeled the dark skin off my face where the scar was and clear light skin was left.</li>
            <li>Have already finished my first bottle and now purchasing a second.</li>
            <li>There is a slight smell depending on how sensitive your nose is, but after so many uses you will barely notice it.</li>
            <li>My old acne scars are almost completely gone now!</li>
            <li>I learned the hard way do you don&#x27;t have to, less is more, you can always do the peel again, wait weeks between peels not days!!</li>
            <li>my large pores instantly tightened and shrank!</li>
            <li>and so far there has been no change in my skin.</li>
            <li>However, if you have deep pockmarks, I don&#x27;t think it would help much.</li>
            <li>And stop using any acid lotions or exfoliators at least three days before you do an acid peel, please, or you will make more scars or pigmentation.&lt;br /</li>

            <li>The only con is the bottle goes really fast</li>
            <li>it was like my acne scars had nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li>and they claim it&#x27;s all natural, so why not?)</li>
            <li>The retinoic acid helps it penetrate and is supposed to be good for wrinkles but cortisone and hyrdroquinone can permanently thin the skin, the opposite of what I want.</li>

            <li>-- it&#x27;s a little off-putting and strong enough for my husband to notice.</li>
            <li>, I swear it, however I did this on NEW acne scars only a month old, it did not change my freckles.</li>
            <li>I bought a ton of little individually wrapped cotton masks really cheap, soak it quickly with a little water and Hado Labo hyaluronic acid lotion, put it on my face and take it off in under five minutes</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t go back to normal the next day either, I really think this stuff is actually improving my pores!</li>
            <li>I have been trying several new products offered by Diva Stuff.  </li>
            <li>I do a few drops of rosehip/carrot seed oil in morning after cleansing and it soaks in quickly, its feels nourishing</li>
            <li>I use a sulfur soap every other day, it is a little drying it works much better than salicylic acid soaps for me.</li>

            <li>I have been using this twice daily for nearly two months</li>
            <li>the first time i used it i felt my skin was tighter, less oily, and softer.</li>
            <li>I have also ordered a bunch of other diva stuff products and am really looking forward to using them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African-American with sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a product (free of harsh, hyperpigmentation-causing additives) that could fade my dark acne marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first tried this product it stinged my face a little bit, eventually my skin got used to it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure half of the reviews are probably made up and fake.</li>

            <li> Super grateful!!</li>
            <li> But then I figured with it being a good price and having all natural ingredients that are proven to be good for skin, that there was no harm in giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so very happy, and would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> And for some reason, my freckles are now more visible (maybe I just stopped noticing them?</li>
            <li> But this cream really works great for acne scars/dark spots.</li>
            <li> so whatever product you use should work better.</li>
            <li> and it works better than anything I got from dermatologist.</li>
            <li> A homeopath would diagnose me as a sufur person which is why I respond so well to it, you may respond better to the minerals in sea salts or mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a skin bleach combo that does work for most people but you can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t use it for extended periods and can have some side effects(also is carcinogenic).</li>

            <li> I have had it for more than a week</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Hey, if anyone has found an awesome product, especially one that reduces pore size or helps with fine lines please let me know.</li>

            <li> In Japan lotion is more like what we would consider a hydrating toner, a light liquid.</li>
            <li> So far, they all smell great</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my face feeling so smooth and soft !</li>
            <li> Excited to see more results after longer use</li>
            <li> so I get acne scars really easy..</li>
            <li> The product does not have a strong smell, it is very light and penetrates the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> Also retinoic acid seems to cause fine lines on me.</li>

            <li> Then pat your serum on or a light lotion to seal in the moisture, but you can skip this part.</li>
            <li> , I was fortunate.</li>
            <li> , I was fortunate.</li>
            <li> The skin feels moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> Diva stuff seems to offer some unique products</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this cream is really awesome.</li>
            <li> Really have seen a difference in my face scars very quickly!</li>
            <li> nothing special</li>
            <li> Add to that the gentle and clean lemon-tomato scent - I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t turn bright red now.</li>
            <li> Drink more water and do gentle face and neck lymph massage to keep the fluids from being retained in your face and remove toxins from skin.</li>

            <li> While I don&#x27;t have deep acne scars I do have pigmentation, I thought this would be a good product to try.  </li>
            <li> So when I found this I had to get it especially with all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> smells kind all the natural ingrediants</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything on Amazon before, but I really had to with this one.</li>
            <li> I woke up in the morning and SWEET MAMA JAMA</li>
            <li> So, full disclosure: I&#x27;d purchased another skin product on Amazon some time ago, this was also suggested, and I went ahead and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> (That is If you don&#x27;t have a systemic imbalance, also hormone bumps cannot really be prevented but the severity can be reduced and healed more quickly)</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s mild and goes away.</li>
            <li> It fades my scar quickly and moisturize my skin as well..</li>
            <li> Received it so quickly and have been using it day 1</li>
            <li> I was practically jumping up and down with joy.</li>
            <li> But I have to say their acne products are amazing and the only thing that has ever cleared my acne.  </li>
            <li> It smells like fresh ingredindents have been placed in the serum.</li>
            <li> If you do not have success with just this lotion please take these suggestions, I am giving them because I know the heartbreak of acne and hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I wet my face, rub in a good amount of the sulfur soap than brush my teeth, by the time I am done</li>
            <li> I am African American with a light complexion which was in really good condition, I was fortunate.</li>

            <li> I am African American with a light complexion which was in really good condition, I was fortunate.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> and I love that they&#x27;re so natural.</li>
            <li> I love the smell too as it smells like the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I did not see results right away but after about 3 weeks there was progress made.</li>
            <li> I have also read good things about mandelic acid when it comes to brightening skin and removing dark marks</li>
            <li> When I apply my makeup it goes on a lot more smooth due to the tightening effect this stuff has on my pores.</li>
            <li> My face is starting to look a lot better.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I started using it was that as soon as I applied it to my face</li>
            <li> This stuff is really a miracle for my skin!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s how I got the 30% reduction, in the first week.</li>
            <li> , I found this really balances my combination skin and makes it feel plump and moist and fresh.</li>
            <li> but really I didn&#x27;t have much acne, started to get more in my early 30s</li>
            <li> but really I didn&#x27;t have much acne, started to get more in my early 30s</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not heavy feeling so you can put it on under makeup.</li>
            <li> This product reduced my acne scars by so much!</li>
            <li> Oh and the way it smells is an abomination, so if you end up buying/using this, make sure you don&#x27;t interact with human beings after applying it to your face.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, I was initially concerned when I felt this very emollient cream, but it provides perfectly balanced moisturization - never too heavy.</li>
            <li> He screamed, &amp;#34;It works!&amp;#34; when the first time he used it.</li>
            <li> It is not oily but it is moisturizing, yes it makes my face sweat first couple minutes</li>
            <li> Most importantly though is that after 3 weeks I am definitely starting to see a major improvement in my acne scars!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, natural and works fine under make-up.</li>
            <li> First let me say this worked really well for me, this reduced my acne hyperpigmentation by 40% and reduced the size of the acne scar by 30%.</li>
            <li> Acne, acne scars, oily skin, large pores, ect.</li>
            <li> Go to your derm if you really can&#x27;t get relief from my suggestions or natural products, get a Jessner peel or lactic acid peel for acne scars, you could get TCA but that stuff is strong and has a lot of downtime while you are all burnt up and crispity and can&#x27;t go out side, but it does totally sandblast your face so it might be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;About</li>

            <li> My skin texture is still a little uneven, so I am still searching for the best product for that.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a couple months and didn&#x27;t see any visible results, it really didn&#x27;t do anything for my scars.</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t really do anything for my scars.</li>
            <li> thanks for the smaples that came with it to.</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> and it did not bleach the skin around it, which I was very grateful for.</li>
            <li> I am a REAL person look at my reviews and comments.</li>
            <li> But be careful if you mix too many acids</li>
            <li> Basically fast your skin one day a week, no make up, no lotion</li>
            <li> Your skin is really hydrated not oily</li>
            <li> , It really reduces my break outs and shortens the length of break out.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions about what I did please ask, I won&#x27;t post pictures of my before and after because I really don&#x27;t want that floating on the internet forever, but I am considering cropping it and attaching a jpeg if I can figure out how (I see where to upload a vid but not a pic).</li>

            <li> you will have to put it on twice a day to really get results.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works at lightening acne scars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> really helped my acne scars.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m very self-conscious about my skin.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommended this product!</li>
            <li> havent really seen a change in my acne scars, wish it didnt smell like tomatoes probably wont buy again</li>
            <li> Again, I really wish I had taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and then how much the scars have cleared after using this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is affordable and it really works.</li>
            <li> Also, my face was normally so oily I would have to reapply makeup 3+ times a day and since using this I haven&#x27;t had to worry about my face getting as oily!</li>
            <li> I prefer natural products, but sometimes they just aren&#x27;t fast enough, or strong</li>
            <li> Lactic acid peel felt like thousands of little needles in my face but didn&#x27;t really hurt, a salicylic acid peel I did at 20% burned and hurt my skin much more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overly sensitive to smells, but this was too much for me.</li>
            <li> your skin will be too sensitive and could really weaken your skin&#x27;s protective barrier.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say for the price this is DEFINITELY worth trying if you have even the slightest scarring from acne.</li>
            <li> my reviews if you want to know the products)&lt;br /&gt;2)After all these treatments I use Arbutin face masks made in Korea on my face, I use them while I am breaking out to help prevent the acne bumps from turning into dark hyperpigment, I also use them as sort of an upkeep after the peels and acids, they are moisturizing and smell good, but I am not sure how much they actually help, I haven&#x27;t done a controlled experiment, but I think they help (and the masks scare my boyfriend which is fun;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week of diligent use, I can honestly say that the scar appears less deep, and a bonus -</li>
            <li> I get stubborn dark marks just from a mosquito bite, that&#x27;s how easily I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it maybe 3 weeks now and let me just say... WOW!</li>
            <li> I did 2 light peels, the second one, I literally peeled the dark skin off my face where the scar was and clear light skin was left.</li>
            <li> Have already finished my first bottle and now purchasing a second.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell depending on how sensitive your nose is, but after so many uses you will barely notice it.</li>
            <li> My old acne scars are almost completely gone now!</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way do you don&#x27;t have to, less is more, you can always do the peel again, wait weeks between peels not days!!</li>
            <li> my large pores instantly tightened and shrank!</li>
            <li> and so far there has been no change in my skin.</li>
            <li> However, if you have deep pockmarks, I don&#x27;t think it would help much.</li>
            <li> And stop using any acid lotions or exfoliators at least three days before you do an acid peel, please, or you will make more scars or pigmentation.&lt;br /</li>

            <li> it was like my acne scars had nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li> and they claim it&#x27;s all natural, so why not?)</li>
            <li> The retinoic acid helps it penetrate and is supposed to be good for wrinkles but cortisone and hyrdroquinone can permanently thin the skin, the opposite of what I want.</li>

            <li> -- it&#x27;s a little off-putting and strong enough for my husband to notice.</li>
            <li> , I swear it, however I did this on NEW acne scars only a month old, it did not change my freckles.</li>
            <li> I bought a ton of little individually wrapped cotton masks really cheap, soak it quickly with a little water and Hado Labo hyaluronic acid lotion, put it on my face and take it off in under five minutes</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t go back to normal the next day either, I really think this stuff is actually improving my pores!</li>
            <li> I have been trying several new products offered by Diva Stuff.  </li>
            <li> I do a few drops of rosehip/carrot seed oil in morning after cleansing and it soaks in quickly, its feels nourishing</li>
            <li> I use a sulfur soap every other day, it is a little drying it works much better than salicylic acid soaps for me.</li>

            <li> I have been using this twice daily for nearly two months</li>
            <li> the first time i used it i felt my skin was tighter, less oily, and softer.</li>
            <li> I have also ordered a bunch of other diva stuff products and am really looking forward to using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American with sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a product (free of harsh, hyperpigmentation-causing additives) that could fade my dark acne marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product it stinged my face a little bit, eventually my skin got used to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure half of the reviews are probably made up and fake.</li>
            <li> Seeing this product, I was a little skeptical to try it since it doesn&#x27;t have very many reviews and what not.</li>
            <li> I purchased one bottle, the cream will last long time.</li>
            <li> it is not a quick clear acne scar treatment cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one who really cares about natural products; heck I&#x27;d poor bleach on my skin if I thought it would eliminate my acne.  </li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t let it dry out on your face or you will suck the moisture back out of your skin!</li>
            <li> I actually have a very old scar on my face from a small burn that looks like a chickenpox scar.</li>
            <li> Everytime you leave the house, even if it is only to run to the car, the new delicate skin will darken tremendously and look even worse if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it is almost dry</li>
            <li> it is almost dry</li>
            <li> , It got rid of the last dark marks.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and has helped to improve my existing acne!</li>
            <li> I still have half of it left.</li>
            <li> Okay, admittedly it&#x27;s not THAT bad</li>
            <li> The smell is gross, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this roughly a month and the spots continue to fade.</li>
            <li> My face used to be extremely red and blotchy from my scars because of my pale complexion and now it&#x27;s not as red and a lot of the spots have gotten much less noticeable!</li>
            <li> Choose one or the other, acid exfoliation or scrub don&#x27;t do both if you have a tendency to hyper pigment.</li>
            <li> This scar cream made a big difference within just a few days of using it!</li>
            <li> it comes with 2 sample of other products.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and I&#x27;ve been troubled with chest and back acne.</li>
            <li> So of course I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and methods to cure all of my skin issues and have had no success.</li>
            <li> It helped to fade the dark marks on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> For stubborn dark marks from Acne</li>
            <li> I was looking for acne scar cream, I am like one of those people who got crazy finding the right product for acne.</li>
            <li> It has been about 2-3 weeks for me and my scars are significantly reduced and they were really bad.  </li>
            <li> It was like the acid pushed the dark pigmentation to the surface into little dark patches and when the skin peeled the marks were gone.</li>
            <li> Again not a quick cure</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s maybe half gone?</li>
            <li> Put on a hat too, don&#x27;t just rely on the SPF use a physical blocker, sunscreen can go bad and/or lose its potency like any make-up.&lt;br /&gt;5)Choose your exfoliants wisely, physical exfoliants like dermabrasion crystals, whether they are aluminum or apricot kernel make tiny little tears in your skin, do not use acids if you are using microdermabrasion</li>
            <li> When I received the cream it came with two little samples for skincare and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out...</li>
            <li> I have lighter toned skin, so when I get a pimple, darker little scars plague my face.</li>
            <li> nothing but a splash of cold water or gentle cleanse</li>
            <li> After a few applications, the pigmentation seemed lighter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks on my bikini line because I have a few scars from shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in customer service reviews.</li>
            <li> The free samples aren&#x27;t bad, either!</li>

            <li> I used this product about ten times. I don&#x27;t know if it helped me or not, but I could not take the smell. I&#x27;m not overly sensitive to smells, but this was too much for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results. When I first tried this product it stinged my face a little bit, eventually my skin got used to it and it didn&#x27;t sting anymore. I used this product for a couple months and didn&#x27;t see any visible results, it really didn&#x27;t do anything for my scars. Even though it didn&#x27;t work for me, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer  but didn&#x27;t really do anything for my scars. Also good to put under foundation</li>
            <li> This serum has been a lifesaver. My acne scars are starting to fade. My face is starting to look a lot better. It smells like fresh ingredindents have been placed in the serum. Its great. thanks for the smaples that came with it to.</li>
            <li> Great product! Have bought twice now! Had a problem and they answered me within minutes to help me solve the issue! Really have seen a difference in my face scars very quickly! They have also made the smell much better!</li>
            <li> So I have a lot of skin problems. You name it, I have it. Acne, acne scars, oily skin, large pores, ect. So of course I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and methods to cure all of my skin issues and have had no success. Seeing this product, I was a little skeptical to try it since it doesn&#x27;t have very many reviews and what not. But then I figured with it being a good price and having all natural ingredients that are proven to be good for skin, that there was no harm in giving it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it maybe 3 weeks now and let me just say... WOW! The first thing I noticed when I started using it was that as soon as I applied it to my face my large pores instantly tightened and shrank! They didn&#x27;t go back to normal the next day either, I really think this stuff is actually improving my pores! I use it at night before bed and in the morning before applying makeup. When I apply my makeup it goes on a lot more smooth due to the tightening effect this stuff has on my pores. Also, my face was normally so oily I would have to reapply makeup 3+ times a day and since using this I haven&#x27;t had to worry about my face getting as oily! Most importantly though is that after 3 weeks I am definitely starting to see a major improvement in my acne scars! My face used to be extremely red and blotchy from my scars because of my pale complexion and now it&#x27;s not as red and a lot of the spots have gotten much less noticeable! This stuff is really a miracle for my skin! It has helped with almost all of my skin problems! It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and has helped to improve my existing acne! I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and see how much more it can do to improve my skin! I&#x27;m just so very happy, and would definitely recommend this product to anyone! It may not work for everyone of course because everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I am so relieved to finally have found something that has not only improved my skin but has improved it drastically!! So if there&#x27;s others like me that have triedliterally EVERYTHING, don&#x27;t give up hope! Give this a try and maybe you&#x27;ll see results too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Acne Scar Reducing Cream for about two weeks and am already seeing amazing results.  I&#x27;m not one who really cares about natural products; heck I&#x27;d poor bleach on my skin if I thought it would eliminate my acne.  But I have to say their acne products are amazing and the only thing that has ever cleared my acne.  It stinks, but I don&#x27;t care.  My skin is looking amazing!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this ! Smells great and leaves my face feeling so smooth and soft ! My acne scars have lightened a bit and I&#x27;ve only been using it for over a week. I will definitely repurchase this after I finish this bottle. Excited to see more results after longer use</li>
            <li> I give it one start because it smells great, I have been using it for over 2 weeks and so far there has been no change in my skin. I will continue to use it and keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the awesome side, Amazon delivery is awesome as always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> praying this works wonders for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;smells great :)</li>
            <li> It helped to fade the dark marks on my cheeks. My old acne scars are almost completely gone now! And for some reason, my freckles are now more visible (maybe I just stopped noticing them? haha) However, if you have deep pockmarks, I don&#x27;t think it would help much. My skin texture is still a little uneven, so I am still searching for the best product for that. But this cream really works great for acne scars/dark spots.</li>
            <li> First let me say this worked really well for me, this reduced my acne hyperpigmentation by 40% and reduced the size of the acne scar by 30%. It lightened the scar by 40% and made it smaller and it did not bleach the skin around it, which I was very grateful for. It also did not break me out. I am a REAL person look at my reviews and comments. If you do not have success with just this lotion please take these suggestions, I am giving them because I know the heartbreak of acne and hyper pigmentation. I would like to add that I am using glycolic acid wipes with this product, I use the glycolic skin wipes after cleansing, let my face adjust, about an hour and then I apply acne lotion. I applied the acne scar lotion 2-3 times a day and I got results in a week, I swear it, however I did this on NEW acne scars only a month old, it did not change my freckles. For stubborn dark marks from Acne this is what I did that finished the job. I prefer natural products, but sometimes they just aren&#x27;t fast enough, or strong enough.&lt;br /&gt; 1) I used a lactic acid peel 50% with kojic and bearberry, It got rid of the last dark marks. I did 2 light peels, the second one, I literally peeled the dark skin off my face where the scar was and clear light skin was left. I was practically jumping up and down with joy.It was like the acid pushed the dark pigmentation to the surface into little dark patches and when the skin peeled the marks were gone. My mother saw me three days later and before I could say anything she was like,&amp;#34;What did you do?&amp;#34;, I told her and she made me order her a bottle that day. Lactic acid peel felt like thousands of little needles in my face but didn&#x27;t really hurt, a salicylic acid peel I did at 20% burned and hurt my skin much more. but everyone is different(check my reviews if you want to know the products)&lt;br /&gt;2)After all these treatments I use Arbutin face masks made in Korea on my face, I use them while I am breaking out to help prevent the acne bumps from turning into dark hyperpigment, I also use them as sort of an upkeep after the peels and acids, they are moisturizing and smell good, but I am not sure how much they actually help, I haven&#x27;t done a controlled experiment, but I think they help (and the masks scare my boyfriend which is fun;) I use the masks twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;3)I am using Alpha Hydroxy glycolic acid lotion10% and 14% wipes, this does not remove scars but it does keep your skin cells renewing and exfoliating so whatever product you use should work better. I did the lotion every night and the wipe twice a week, my face eventually built up a tolerance so I don&#x27;t turn bright red now. But be careful if you mix too many acids you will burn your skin, how do I know, because I am a dummy and I did! I learned the hard way do you don&#x27;t have to, less is more, you can always do the peel again, wait weeks between peels not days!! I have read it takes a month for your skin to totally heal and for your collagen to have reproduced and repaired itself enough. And stop using any acid lotions or exfoliators at least three days before you do an acid peel, please, or you will make more scars or pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt; I also use emu oil or Rose hips and Carrot seed oil to moisturize my skin, it feels great and is wonderful for after the peel, I use on clean skin at night, doesn&#x27;t break me out. I do a few drops of rosehip/carrot seed oil in morning after cleansing and it soaks in quickly, its feels nourishing but I don&#x27;t know if it is helping with lines, it seems like a good preventative at least.&lt;br /&gt;4)Absolutely wear sunscreen!! Everytime you leave the house, even if it is only to run to the car, the new delicate skin will darken tremendously and look even worse if you don&#x27;t. Put on a hat too, don&#x27;t just rely on the SPF use a physical blocker, sunscreen can go bad and/or lose its potency like any make-up.&lt;br /&gt;5)Choose your exfoliants wisely, physical exfoliants like dermabrasion crystals, whether they are aluminum or apricot kernel make tiny little tears in your skin, do not use acids if you are using microdermabrasion your skin will be too sensitive and could really weaken your skin&#x27;s protective barrier. Choose one or the other, acid exfoliation or scrub don&#x27;t do both if you have a tendency to hyper pigment. I get stubborn dark marks just from a mosquito bite, that&#x27;s how easily I hyperpigment.&lt;br /&gt;Initially I did the Acne Scar cream with the Tumeric Face scrub from diva and that&#x27;s how I got the 30% reduction, in the first week. I switched into glycolic acid on the third week, because I felt like my scar fading progress had plateaued, and I wanted to work on reducing my pore size, my pores are clearer but not much smaller. I think switching to the glycolic acid with the scar cream got me that extra 10% reduction. I have also read good things about mandelic acid when it comes to brightening skin and removing dark marks but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet myself.&lt;br /&gt;6) Check out the suggestions in the book Japanese skin care revolution, you don&#x27;t have to buy it. This is what I took from it.Basically fast your skin one day a week, no make up, no lotion nothing but a splash of cold water or gentle cleanse, I use the dhc olive oil cleanser. Also do the 3 minute lotion mask, during the week, even if you have oily skin! In Japan lotion is more like what we would consider a hydrating toner, a light liquid. I bought a ton of little individually wrapped cotton masks really cheap, soak it quickly with a little water and Hado Labo hyaluronic acid lotion, put it on my face and take it off in under five minutes, don&#x27;t let it dry out on your face or you will suck the moisture back out of your skin! Then pat your serum on or a light lotion to seal in the moisture, but you can skip this part. Your skin is really hydrated not oily which is what you need, I found this really balances my combination skin and makes it feel plump and moist and fresh. It is supposed to help reduce pore size, but I think that&#x27;s just temporary, your skin does look brighter though! Drink more water and do gentle face and neck lymph massage to keep the fluids from being retained in your face and remove toxins from skin. You can look this all up in the Google and you tube, but you might want the book anyway. Hado labo has a Arbutin Lotion but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;7) For me to prevent and reduce acne bumps I use a sulfur soap every other day, it is a little drying it works much better than salicylic acid soaps for me. I wet my face, rub in a good amount of the sulfur soap than brush my teeth, by the time I am done it is almost dry and I wash it off, It really reduces my break outs and shortens the length of break out. This soap is 6$ and it works better than anything I got from dermatologist. People have different skin types but usually one of these 3 works for people for maintaining healthy skin and lessening break outs. (That is If you don&#x27;t have a systemic imbalance, also hormone bumps cannot really be prevented but the severity can be reduced and healed more quickly) Sea Salt soap/cleansing, Mud soap/cleansing, or Sulfur Soap/Cleansing-depends on your body/skin type. A homeopath would diagnose me as a sufur person which is why I respond so well to it, you may respond better to the minerals in sea salts or mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist had written me a prescription for hydroquinone with retinoic acid and cortisone. That&#x27;s a skin bleach combo that does work for most people but you can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t use it for extended periods and can have some side effects(also is carcinogenic). The retinoic acid helps it penetrate and is supposed to be good for wrinkles but cortisone and hyrdroquinone can permanently thin the skin, the opposite of what I want. Also retinoic acid seems to cause fine lines on me. Go to your derm if you really can&#x27;t get relief from my suggestions or natural products, get a Jessner peel or lactic acid peel for acne scars, you could get TCA but that stuff is strong and has a lot of downtime while you are all burnt up and crispity and can&#x27;t go out side, but it does totally sandblast your face so it might be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;About me- I am African American with a light complexion which was in really good condition, I was fortunate. I hyperpigment bad but really I didn&#x27;t have much acne, started to get more in my early 30s and my dermatologist had me control it with low dose doxycycline.(Oracea brand name) I always looked younger than my years, I was fortunate. Then, bam!, it was like my warranty expired, broke out horribly on side of my face (rosacea) fine lines where none were before, and hormone bumps on chin, I was ready to cry because I knew how bad I scar from acne.  I have been desperately trying to repair my skin, I used to just use whatever soap was in the bathroom, even body soap on my face and just run out the door. I was so spoiled, I realize that now.&lt;br /&gt;I completely empathize with everyone struggling with their skin. It can really make you depressed and even not want to socialize when your face is in bad shape. If you have any questions about what I did please ask, I won&#x27;t post pictures of my before and after because I really don&#x27;t want that floating on the internet forever, but I am considering cropping it and attaching a jpeg if I can figure out how (I see where to upload a vid but not a pic). Hey, if anyone has found an awesome product, especially one that reduces pore size or helps with fine lines please let me know. I wish all of you beauty and health.&lt;br /&gt;Sheez, I wrote a novel here, I hope this helps someone!just temporary, your skin does look brighter though!

            <li> Repeat customer...  I have been trying several new products offered by Diva Stuff.  While I don&#x27;t have deep acne scars I do have pigmentation, I thought this would be a good product to try.  After a few applications, the pigmentation seemed lighter.  The product does not have a strong smell, it is very light and penetrates the skin quickly.  I would definitely purchase again.  Diva stuff seems to offer some unique products and I have not been disappointed in anything I have purchased from them.</li>
            <li> This product smells good g</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, it lightened up my scaring and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> this honestly did not work for me at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and I followed all the instructions. I have seen no change. I&#x27;m pretty sure half of the reviews are probably made up and fake. But this did not work for me and i am really upset that i have wasted my money on something that smells nasty and does nothing. I do not recommend this at all</li>
            <li> I like some diva stuff products but this one does not work for me. The smell is gross, a waste of money. I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more diva stuff products.</li>
            <li> So let me start off by saying this stuff actually works!.. I&#x27;ve had dermatologist prescribe me bleaching cream for my acne scars and not only was it expensive but it hardly worked. I also couldn&#x27;t wear in it the sun because it would make my scars darker! I have a tan complexion so I get acne scars really easy..So when I found this I had to get it especially with all the good reviews. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and it definitely made my acne scars lighter and I can wear it in the sun and under my make up. When I received the cream it came with two little samples for skincare and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out...The only thing is that the cream smells like celery juice but it&#x27;s mild and goes away. If You Don&#x27;t mind the smell and are looking for results then I would definitely recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks on my bikini line because I have a few scars from shaving. The scars have definitely become lighter. The only con is the bottle goes really fast I&#x27;m almost out. But I&#x27;ll definitely order again</li>
            <li> This product truly does work. I&#x27;m a firm believer in customer service reviews. And after doing a lot of reading, I decided to give DivaStuff and this Acne Scar Reducing Cream a chance. Absolutely worth it. I have lighter toned skin, so when I get a pimple, darker little scars plague my face. But this cream has helped me to avoid that. It&#x27;s gentle, natural and works fine under make-up. If you face the same issue, give this a shot. You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> This review is written with 30 days of use putting it on twice a day. it is not a quick clear acne scar treatment cream. you will have to put it on twice a day to really get results. I did not see results right away but after about 3 weeks there was progress made. There is a slight smell depending on how sensitive your nose is, but after so many uses you will barely notice it. Again not a quick cure but is helpful if you give it time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works at lightening acne scars. I put it on a couple times a day. It&#x27;s light and not heavy feeling so you can put it on under makeup. If you have acne marks this is a must have!</li>
            <li> This product reduced my acne scars by so much! I don&#x27;t really like the smell but, the product is great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Simple as that. Oh and the way it smells is an abomination, so if you end up buying/using this, make sure you don&#x27;t interact with human beings after applying it to your face. Actually, don&#x27;t interact with any living being at all. I hate giving bad reviews, but wow.</li>
            <li> Has a wierd smell and didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Its ok....nothing special</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to my acne scars. Dissapointed .</li>
            <li> Finding this product was one of the best thing that has ever happened to me. It fades my scar quickly and moisturize my skin as well.. I couldn&#x27;t leave without this.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST have! And all I have to say about this is that it WORKS! Point blank! I love love it!</li>
            <li> It produce me more acne</li>
            <li> Have to say, I am so happy with the quick results of this product.  Received it so quickly and have been using it day 1 and I am already seeing results.  Totally recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for reducing acne marks. I can&#x27;t believe the low price. Diva Stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> really helped my acne scars. the first time i used it i felt my skin was tighter, less oily, and softer. smells kind all the natural ingrediants so you know theres no perfumes.</li>
            <li> Used twice a day for a month nothing.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything on Amazon before, but I really had to with this one. I am 26 and have had acne for probably 10 years and nothing has helped. I&#x27;ve been on a variety of birth control pills and shots, antibiotics, dermatologist prescribed creams and lotions and all I&#x27;ve gotten out of it are a lot of uncomfortable side effects and some bad scarring. Okay, admittedly it&#x27;s not THAT bad but i&#x27;m very self-conscious about my skin. I was considering talking to my dermatologist about laser treatments, but those are very, very expensive. I figured I&#x27;d try this for a bit before going to the doc.This stuff arrived in the mail one afternoon and I put some on immediately. I put it on again when I washed my face before bed. I woke up in the morning and SWEET MAMA JAMA it was like my acne scars had nearly disappeared. Overnight. Whaaaaat? I have been using this twice daily for nearly two months and it&#x27;s maybe half gone? My acne scars have all but disappeared and my confidence is through the roof. I have also ordered a bunch of other diva stuff products and am really looking forward to using them. So far, they all smell great and I love that they&#x27;re so natural. The free samples aren&#x27;t bad, either! Overall, I&#x27;d say for the price this is DEFINITELY worth trying if you have even the slightest scarring from acne.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE Diva stuff acne scar cream! I had horrible acne scars, deep ones! This scar cream made a big difference within just a few days of using it! It&#x27;s the holy grail of acne scar creams! I HIGHLY recommended this product!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s made with naturel ingredients, but the company should do sth about the fenugreek smell. It was giving me headaches</li>
            <li> I have had it for more than a week and I absolutely love it. The skin feels moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> So, full disclosure: I&#x27;d purchased another skin product on Amazon some time ago, this was also suggested, and I went ahead and gave it a try. (I had a gift card balance to spend and they claim it&#x27;s all natural, so why not?) I&#x27;m African-American with sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a product (free of harsh, hyperpigmentation-causing additives) that could fade my dark acne marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have oily skin, I was initially concerned when I felt this very emollient cream, but it provides perfectly balanced moisturization - never too heavy. I&#x27;ve been using this roughly a month and the spots continue to fade. I&#x27;ve also noticed my skin is softer and brighter. Add to that the gentle and clean lemon-tomato scent - I&#x27;m in love. I use this every day, morning and night, after a ph-balanced cosmeceutical facial cleanser. I&#x27;m so happy with the results!</li>
            <li> It is for my teenager son. He is have to have it. He screamed, &amp;#34;It works!&amp;#34; when the first time he used it.</li>
            <li> havent really seen a change in my acne scars, wish it didnt smell like tomatoes probably wont buy again</li>
            <li> Another winner from Diva Stuff! I actually have a very old scar on my face from a small burn that looks like a chickenpox scar. It&#x27;s been bothering me for years. I purchased this cream in hopes that it would help plump the indentation of the scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of diligent use, I can honestly say that the scar appears less deep, and a bonus - the pores inside the scar were enlarged and appear to be getting smaller. With this in mind, I have begun using this product on the enlarged pores elsewhere on my cheeks in hopes that it will have a similar effect. Again, I really wish I had taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; selfie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to take away one star for the scent -- it&#x27;s a little off-putting and strong enough for my husband to notice.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It has been about 2-3 weeks for me and my scars are significantly reduced and they were really bad.  I love the smell too as it smells like the natural ingredients.  I will definitely buy it again when it runs out.  If you want to see pictures and you have an acne.org account look up RacingheartZ and look at my forum results titled &amp;#34;plan B plus acne story&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll see the progression of my acne and then how much the scars have cleared after using this product.  Super grateful!!</li>
            <li> I love this cream! My skin is extremely sensitive and I&#x27;ve been troubled with chest and back acne. I use this in combination with prescribed clindamycin. My skin is clearing and spots are fading and my skin has a nice bronze glow. Have already finished my first bottle and now purchasing a second.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this cream is really awesome. I was looking for acne scar cream, I am like one of those people who got crazy finding the right product for acne. You name it I bought it, finally found some products that works and my acne is totally gone. I have small acnes here and there but that&#x27;s it. Since I started using this product my acne scar reduced 70% I have been using it over 3 months. I purchased one bottle, the cream will last long time. I use 2 times a day I still have half of it left. It is not oily but it is moisturizing, yes it makes my face sweat first couple minutes but then it doesn&#x27;t sweat anymore. I will recommend this cream to the people who has scars. This product is affordable and it really works. I am very happy with my purchase. One more good thing it comes with 2 sample of other products.</li>
