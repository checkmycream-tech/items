            <li>And that it stands up all on its own!</li>
            <li>Great price and good product.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist has been impressed by the quality of tooth cleaning with these inexpensive brushes - so save money and not get carried away with the exotic brushes.</li>
            <li>To top it all off, the price is the best out there.</li>
            <li>I keep this one in my desk at work, and it&#x27;s perfect for mid-day refreshing.</li>
            <li>Great product for a good price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Good price, and the quality is ok, but nothing very impressive.</li>
            <li>It came with Duracell batteries which was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>very good toothbrush, i love it.</li>
            <li>impressed me to the point that I gifted both of my daughters and our son-in-law with their own.</li>
            <li>It was so good for me</li>
            <li>Good tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Good for massaging gums as well.</li>
            <li>otherwise its a good brush.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t need to worry about voltage differences and AA batteries are available even in the remotest parts of the world, so it is perfect for us!</li>
            <li>I thought this toothbrush would be like my Sonicare electric toothbrush and be good for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I put 2 rechargeable AA (2000 MA) and the thing kept  going and going without a noticeable lack  of power for a good 2 months.</li>
            <li>I thought of using my teeth as gripper, but doubted that would be good for my dental health.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to work almost as good Asa sonicare.</li>
            <li>my son loved and i recommend any one to buy it</li>
            <li>The brush head does extremely good job, cleaning teeth and space between them.</li>
            <li>We got a good price on these from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>seem to make for a fair amount of drooling while I brush.</li>
            <li>it is good one .</li>
            <li>Good alternatives.</li>
            <li>I had an Oral-B (non-rechargeable) that I loved and used about a year.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>good compromise ...  </li>
            <li>I had one of these before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>good and practical</li>
            <li>Good one.</li>
            <li>It does use up even good quality alkaline batteries within 3-4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Brush and battery life are good.  </li>
            <li>Good toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li>Was initially delighted with this one.  </li>
            <li>It is a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Good product - no complaints</li>
            <li>By using good rechargeable batteries you can get max performance all the time.</li>
            <li>You might as well buy the battery operated one because it&#x27;s just as good as the $100 version.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and works well.</li>
            <li>durability, good company&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a lot of good reviews, so I guess I got unlucky.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>This is good value and works well.</li>
            <li>It feels good against my gums also.  </li>
            <li>My Rayovak batteries fit in perfect.</li>
            <li>and I made a good choice.</li>
            <li>This one does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>It has good power, and I like the timer/pause feature.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, does a good job on our teeth and is quite inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as the plug in electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>It is as good as the ones i&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>As we  do a lot of traveling she needed a good toothbrush to pack.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush is a good one.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value and well made product.  </li>
            <li>I use 2-AA rechargeable batteries and good to go.</li>
            <li>This is a good indication to replace your battery.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>Works good,  </li>
            <li>So so good for travel</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Really good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>Good price for performance.</li>
            <li>Good value, oral b is a good brand.</li>
            <li>The battery compartment seemed like a good design to me.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good product and</li>
            <li>I was amazed on how good this product is.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because, when the toothbrush worked, it did a good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately , there are no instructions on how to replace the batteries; in fact, no instructions at all, though it&#x27;s fairly intuitive.</li>
            <li>For the price, the quality is good.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend if you are looking for something affordable, but of good quality.</li>
            <li>loved it but couldnt get replacement heads from amazon...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality brush for the price.</li>
            <li>Comparing to the rechargeable Oral-B model this is as good for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>Good as non-battery Oral B</li>
            <li>All in all, this has been a good investment.</li>
            <li>Consider if you need a good toothbrush that lasts</li>
            <li>Have rechargeable eneloop AA batteries so good to go.</li>
            <li>Feels good on your gums.</li>
            <li>Or just good regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I travel a good deal and used to carry an electric toothbrush with its plug-in stand.</li>
            <li>Its good for perhaps a month or so</li>
            <li>I think this one works just as good as the 89.00 one.  </li>
            <li>The price is so good that I bought two, one as a spare.</li>
            <li>i hope it&#x27;s keep working in good condition</li>
            <li>We use good quality rechargeable batteries, and we change the heads about every 4 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and think it&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>So fa so good on this product.  </li>
            <li>Good brush.</li>
            <li>I loved the battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>this might be a good thing as you dont want your mouth ripped apart.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as my Oral-B one that plugs into the electric socket at home</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>It works as good as the rechargeable.</li>
            <li>and I think for a battery operated toothbrush it is quite good.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Good:</li>
            <li>All in all good stuff</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, excellent for anyone with arthritis because the grip is so comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good, durable product.</li>
            <li>Handles nicely, good balance and weight.  </li>

            <li>I have tried all the toothbrushes out there and the Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Powdered toothbrush is the best.</li>
            <li>its exceptional value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To get the full 2 minutes of brushing time now takes 8-10 minutes or more!!!  </li>

            <li>Oral-B is easy to use and does a great job of cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>Cheap and fine, very good!</li>
            <li>it is very good for my teeth cleaning,it worth the price I  paid.</li>
            <li>First electric I&#x27;ve owned...does a wonderful job of cleaning while being very easy to hold and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cheap way to have a electric (battery) tooth brush for travel.  </li>
            <li>It is simply AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It did a great job of maintaining my teeth and gums - a statement confirmed by my dentist and oral hygienist.  </li>
            <li>Works great... can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re so cheap.  </li>
            <li>And the price was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price is amazing compared to store prices.</li>
            <li>The timer is a nice touch, it&#x27;s starts pulsating when you&#x27;ve been brushing for two minutes.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, nice product for the money.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s nice since I will need it for a trip now.</li>
            <li>I wished these portable toothbruses came with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li>The sonic kind hurts my gum and it tickles a lot as well.</li>

            <li>It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The plug in model is outstanding and this is talmost as good.  </li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they provided a switch to control vibration.  </li>
            <li>except I would have liked it to vibrate faster.</li>
            <li>When I called Amazon they were nice enought to credit my account and send me another one.  </li>
            <li>So , I bought a garbage for my own money.</li>
            <li>Honestly, when I bought it I set it aside for months before I got the courage to try it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the Oral-B brushes for my daughter, since she is handicapped and can&#x27;t brush her own teeth.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as good or better..</li>
            <li>Nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It is a good started toothbrush for someone who isn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>I have owned Braun electric toothbrushes for years (the kind you plug into the wall) and all were excellent.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>as i have many aaa batteries around my home, so i have a good gadget to use them now.</li>
            <li>Electric vibration highly effective and when used for cleaning it  </li>
            <li>well i have one of oral-B tooth brush but honestly compare to this one</li>
            <li>2-minute timer is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I own 2 rechargeable electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>This one works great and the rotating head spins better than most.</li>
            <li>The 2 minute notification feature is nice, too.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is one of a kind.</li>
            <li>This is a nice toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li>UNLESS YOU OWN A BATTERY CHARGER.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product, it keeps my mouth feeling much cleaner than it ever did with a manual brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product, it keeps my mouth feeling much cleaner than it ever did with a manual brush</li>
            <li>To me, this is a nice deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li>I have a nice Panasonic battery operated electric toothbrush at home, and decided to get another one for the office use.  </li>
            <li>This really is the best option for those that are considering ordering another Oral B with the charging station.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Nice pressure on the brush</li>
            <li>Nice thing about them is that I can travel anywhere with these and not have to worry about whether my plug will work or if I need a charger converter.</li>
            <li>what can i say about this nice Battery Tooth Brush</li>
            <li>Needed a good electric toothbrush to take better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is nice and portable</li>
            <li>Although it burns through batteries, and the head wears out kind of rapidly</li>
            <li>Waaaay cheaper than the built-in battery kind, as are the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>nice item, works well and no hassle packaging, plus it came on time, and I got to use a 3 buck off coupon...</li>
            <li>and it is really an effective toothbrush that cleans your teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>But it does have gr8 power and works nicely.  </li>
            <li>Gets good power to the head for a good clean.</li>
            <li>I swapped out the brush that came with the unit for the Dual Clean type, and it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>The good thing about it is you want to brush your teeth many times a day  because it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush&amp;#34; works great in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>it does a great clean like never before..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless - for the price it&#x27;s a great clean, just don&#x27;t buy it for the timer feature.</li>
            <li>And for the first 58 days that I had it, I loved the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean best of all.</li>
            <li>you run this brush on your teeth the FULL 2 minutes, it will work great for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Great Amazon customer service returned for full refund</li>
            <li>really amazing , very cheep , very good ,</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is very good and easy to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li>I loved this toothbrush until I got a sonic one (which I now love more).</li>
            <li>Great item, price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Great price and arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li>It does everything I need it to do, travels well, AND is very easy on batteries.  </li>
            <li>Then it is very easy to close the battery cover.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy for me, and I don&#x27;t have a lot of strength in my fingers!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>great keeps teeth clean and healthy</li>
            <li>My dentist is happy and I feel like they clean my teeth better then before.</li>
            <li>Receive product very please a very good price.</li>
            <li>Works great for my elementary age child.  </li>
            <li>The product is light and portable, so it is also good for travel.  </li>
            <li>I went with this because it cheap and has good ratings.</li>
            <li>cheap and good version of e-brush.</li>
            <li>Perfect for introducing brushing to  3-5 years old kids.</li>
            <li>Great stuff worth the money.</li>
            <li>This one requires two batteries and takes up more space; however, it is highly effective.</li>
            <li>Even using a worn 2 year old brush head it does the best job cleaning my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to use rechargeable batteries with this.  </li>
            <li>I also ended up getting this one for travel, but found that I actually liked it better, and started using it every day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been six months now, and so far it has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li>This was by far the best deal I found anywhere.</li>
            <li>So far, excellent.</li>
            <li>It is also nice not to have a unit on your bathroom sink top taking up space.  </li>
            <li>No problems with shipping, received early, best price I could find.</li>
            <li>We change batteries frequently, but brush works sporadically at best.</li>
            <li>Panasonic slim electric toothbrush is also nice, but cost more.  </li>
            <li>Wow its awesome it</li>
            <li>cheap and good to use</li>
            <li>It cleaned the best as far as battery powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It has a timer to help you brush the right amount of time &amp; does a great job.</li>
            <li>Very good, very like, satisfied.</li>
            <li>With this one, the charge lasts a lot longer because the batteries are the best kind and last a lot longer too.  </li>
            <li>My kids love these and the sensitive precision heads are perfect for their 1st set of teeth.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush seems to do a good job in keeping our daughter’s teeth clean as she has no cavities to date.  </li>
            <li>It works great with eneloop rechargeable batteries (more powerful than the expired alkaline batteries it comes with).</li>
            <li>great for traveling without fear of running out of gas.&lt;br /&gt;the speed is substantially slower than the regular rechargeable, and also substantially louder, but it&#x27;s a great backup for travel.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush did a great job and has a great life with regular batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking this will clean as good as a Soniccare vibrating rechargeable brush priced four times this</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with this and am even brushing more.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t for those two major flaws, it would still be a perfect brush.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Excellent product, very reasonable price, quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Very nice productbwith good quality and performance, it is a good choice for anyone wants to get an effective toothbrush with reasonable price</li>
            <li>Great at first, but started replacing batteries every 10 days or so.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it and not as great since.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for the first couple of months.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning and performs consistently even when the batteries are low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a very functional product!  </li>
            <li>Teeth is very important for us</li>
            <li>Not to mention you can clean your toddlers or your own teeth more effectively.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pack and handy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very good and sensitive.</li>
            <li>But it was a huge mistake!  </li>
            <li>It will keep going unless you hit the button if you want to keep brushing for more.  </li>
            <li>Cleans better than sonic.</li>
            <li>more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My kids love them.......</li>
            <li>and my Dentist is glad I started using as it does more strokes than manual brushing.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace my plug in Oral-B toothbrush because it was no longer able to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a satisfied Oral-B electric toothbrush user for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I do hope sincerely they will continue to make this battery-powered Toothbrush because I also have a pacemaker and can&#x27;t use the electric because they put magnets in both the charger and the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>There must be better battery powered brushes out there.</li>
            <li>I hung in there and found my dental check-ups were getting better and better.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>I love the brush, and the battery convenance.</li>
            <li>Brush heads are cheaper on ebay but saty way from the  cheap kind.</li>
            <li>but this is so much better than any</li>
            <li>I am ordering more.  </li>
            <li>I think everyone should be using this product to better take care of teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I found this product and that there are companies which make these type of products.</li>
            <li>My love with this product continues...</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much more cleaner</li>
            <li>Had this in the rechargeable style for years and was most satisfied.</li>
            <li>After a month of use, can&#x27;t imagine spending more for the wall plug type.</li>
            <li>Before this brush I had a $30 sonicare which was 10 times better and</li>
            <li>I have used Oral-B&#x27;s electric brushes for almost 10 years and the results have been phenomenal.</li>
            <li>The cleaning action is brilliant.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>One of the best features is the circuitry that boosts the voltage of your batteries as they age in order to keep the motor speed constant.</li>
            <li>There Is nothing better than brushing your teeth with the oral b toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad another reviewer gave me the idea of getting an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love the way my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>This brush is better than the one&lt;</li>
            <li>I purcahsed the \\&quot;Oral-B Pro-Health Battery Tootbrush \\&quot;  and charged it over night (more than 12 hours).  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare (Philips HX3631/06) vibrates much more, but it hurts when it hits your teeth (and you WILL hit your teeth, because it designed like a manual tooth brush head!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel but would not recommend for daily home use.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it uses rechargeable batteries and have had no problems at all.  </li>
            <li>Even best Duracell alkaline batteries can not last more than 3 weeks with 4-6 mins usage per day.</li>
            <li>This one is even better with the timer and easier to handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a re-chargeable oral-b toothbrush for many years and this product works just as well or better with 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>If mine ever breaks I would not hesitate go and buy a couple more.</li>
            <li>For the price it is being offered, it is perfect tool to have with you, especially when you traveling.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush of all time</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied by this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how that one could  be 10 times better for the money.  </li>
            <li>and I think this one is better than what they make.</li>
            <li>This looked perfect because it used the same heads I already had</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I started with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but eventually it stopped recharging - like most devices you don&#x27;t get unlimited battery life.</li>
            <li>I have had this battery operated toothbrush for more than a year.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>So now I make sure I rinse the inside of the brush and wipe the metal thingy.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself some time and dental bills and get a Sonicare :-)</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush but find myself throwing it out every month or so.  </li>
            <li>This was a significantly more than the Vitality line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it can be cheaper as you&#x27;ll have to pay much more money on those brush heads.</li>
            <li>I love the awesome 2-minute timer that lets you know that you&#x27;ve been brushing for 2 minutes with a slightly different &#x27;vibration&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and its a phenomenal buy for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly impressed by the build quality and no-hassle usage since the last 4 years.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>so I love that it&#x27;s battery operated</li>
            <li>I have bought many Braun products over the years, and most are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, my tooth brush does a better job.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I think this toothbrush and NiMH rechargeable batteries (purchased separately) are a much better value.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about this.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Love the timer.  </li>
            <li>We use this on our toddler and it has made teeth brushing more efficient easier.</li>
            <li>Replaceable batteries are definitely the best choice -- for me.  </li>
            <li>Replaceable batteries are definitely the best choice -- for me.  </li>
            <li>I think everyone should be using this product to better take care of teeth health.</li>
            <li>Oral-B, you have just made a customer for life :)</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush that really works well.  </li>
            <li>This vibrates three times to basically say \\&quot;OK freaky, wrap it up!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but I thought I was getting a better product.  </li>
            <li>My suggestion is to either purchase a better electric toothbrush or buy a cheaper one that works just as well.</li>
            <li>Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I think it does a better job.</li>
            <li>Just barely okay.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>However, I think the sonic toothbrushes are better in cleaning</li>
            <li>It rotates like the home version just not as powerful and the price was good.</li>
            <li>If you have an outlet and don&#x27;t mind the cord and stand taking up some space in your bathroom, the corded option may be a better choice for some people.</li>
            <li>and we both love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel so much more cleaner than a manual brush would.</li>
            <li>I was glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is excellent and I went online to buy the specific head I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush..</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love these battery operated toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Spend money on something better.</li>
            <li>My dentist says ANY electric toothbrush is better than a manual.</li>
            <li>For what the price is, this deserves more than 5 stars considering what your getting:&lt;br /&gt;-great</li>
            <li>I love no longer having a cord getting in the way.  </li>
            <li>makes the kissing process quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I have had it almost a month now and still love it.  </li>
            <li>after 5 years wore out-- had one love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li>One set of AA batteries lasted me more than three months.  </li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll be able to have it replaced more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one is much more way better</li>
            <li>i love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Much better than Crest Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>You can pay couple more dollar to get the one (also from Oral-B) with the timer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Glad it came with a battery</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>features of exchangeable heads make it more versatile as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find this a better option that trying to move the charging station everywhere</li>
            <li>I also find that I brush my teeth more often with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I shall be ordering more, just in case these are phased out and replaced by inferior \\&quot;updated versions\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I do a much better job at brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>and I do a more uniform cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I would love to use this brush if someone could tell me how to turn the stinking thing on.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fact that I can just switch out the batteries with another set of rechargeable AA batteries.</li>
            <li>This is a good product at an economical price.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better for children than adults.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get two more and use them for my daughters.</li>
            <li>It could have more speed.</li>
            <li>I would shell out some more money for one that covers all throughout its head.</li>
            <li>We love them and nothing we know cleans like they do.</li>
            <li>Save your money on this one and put it towards the top end Oral B.</li>
            <li>Well, its ok.</li>
            <li>I just started brushing with it, but it feels like it&#x27;s polished better in a shorter amount of time than my manual.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about picking up some more for my family members.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I got this one.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>They were okay, but they weren&#x27;t Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Also, many of the strictly battery-operated toothbrushes have the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; brush heads.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>love this spinning brushh</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Better dentist checkups now that I am using this and not a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is better than rechargable ones.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t so sure when I bought it but even after 9 months it&#x27;s still going on strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Items as describe and its more affordable to buy in Amazon.</li>
            <li>Spend 20 more dollars for a spin brush or for one at target that plugs in and charges.</li>
            <li>I just love it  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>At home I use an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush, which I love.  </li>
            <li>I love this Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves this model as she can throw it into a bag for a trip and not have to worry about taking a charger with her to make sure that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great tooth brush and it really works well.  </li>
            <li>The product was as advertised, shipping was fast-very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Hope to be able to cheaper.</li>
            <li>Yes, I am reasonably satisfied with those products.</li>
            <li>I love this item...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the rechargeable Braun Oral-B brushes for many years.</li>
            <li>also found it to be better if you use the gum massaging brush.</li>
            <li>The Braun rechargeable device use a nickel metal hydride, which is better for storage and use with motors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suspect it would do better with NiCad rechargeable AA.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift, and the love it.</li>
            <li>There are probably better battery toothbrushes out there, but they cost a lot more than this one.  </li>
            <li>u speed more money</li>
            <li>As many reviewers already mentioned, I bought this because of the replaceable batteries.</li>
            <li>Like the competitive price, but expect better durability than this, going elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the handle which has a better grip than my electronic Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Price was better than the market</li>
            <li>and I love Prime.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush solved it--and I love the timer feature.</li>
            <li>I have heard that sonic brush heads are much more prone to being a breeding ground for bacteria.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your battery has juice before you take it with you. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>It seems to work even better (more power/rotations) than the rechargeable one I have.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be sure to dispose of them correctly.</li>
            <li>Circular motion gives you better results.  </li>
            <li>Great fast service</li>
            <li>The ones that come with it are Duracell AA&#x27;s, but you might be able to use rechargeable NiMH batteries, which I have not tried (yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I would have paid a bit more for that feature.)</li>
            <li>It would make using the brush a much better experience for first-time users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s more of a marketing tool to get you to buy replacement brush heads more often, but you can use that as a reminder if you prefer.</li>
            <li>It also probably does a better job without brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>These toothbrushes really work great.  </li>
            <li>Love their electric toothbrush heads and the job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for 11 or 12 years and love it.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for many months and it still works like the day I opened it.  </li>
            <li>The rechargeable version has much more umph, but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>My dentist suggested I purchase this device, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>However, this one really works and it comes at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth much better than manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed love it.</li>
            <li>I love that i don;t have to plug this in to charge it.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Have had better.</li>
            <li>The power seems even better with the two AA batteries that come with the brush.</li>
            <li>a side note: If you are trying to move towards more holistic cleansing, you can try Burt&#x27;s Bees All-natural Toothpaste</li>
            <li>Love the portability (no charger required) and the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li>Feels much much better than reg tooth brush</li>
            <li>and my kids love them.</li>
            <li>Also love that it has a 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li>I love the built-in 2 minute timer</li>
            <li>Affordable, and easily able to change heads every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>these are more the quality of a kid&#x27;s toy IMHO.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral B electric toothbrush and always missed it while traveling.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>they love it as well.</li>
            <li>OralB brushheads fit  it nicely.</li>
            <li>battery works better than cordless</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to everyone. :)</li>
            <li>I have a rechargable Oral B Vitality toothbrush that I use for every day use, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>You can spend much more, but why?</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But it is infinitely better than the defective $25 Braun Oral B Replacement Power Handle</li>
            <li>I totally love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>but now I have one that is battery operated for travel, buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love it, it makes me brush my teath longer</li>
            <li>we BOTH love it.  </li>
            <li>So glad I took the chance on it</li>
            <li>Pop the top off, rinse, and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>Have used the Oral-B electric toothbrush for several months and it has performed flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>The battery cover seems to better than the ones I have used before.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I now spend more time cleaning our teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have a pair of adjustable pliers with which I was finally able to twist it off.  </li>
            <li>For me this design works better than the larger/longer brush design.  </li>
            <li>more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if it was able to indicate 30-second time intervals along with the two-minute indication that it does provide.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>i wish the instruction and having better + and - on the battery compartment would help align the batteries correctly..  </li>
            <li>I look forward to brushing my teeth now more than I used to.</li>
            <li>I love this one for traveling as I don&#x27;t have to worry about bringing a charging stand/charging it.</li>
            <li>wished this one came in more color choices...</li>
            <li>I would buy them for my children as well if there were more colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a cheap toothbrush this should be your choice!</li>
            <li>It is more appealing for my daughter..</li>
            <li>This is simpler, lighter-weight, easier to keep clean, and has so far run perfectly for more than three weeks without a battery change.</li>
            <li>these are very good tooth brushes, the first one lasted 10yrs and was still usable, battery cap split not allowing batteries to make good contact on the old one</li>
            <li>this was for my son and it seems to get his teeth very clean and we love the 2 minute timer on it.</li>
            <li>Very useful!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>far so good!</li>
            <li>It cleans better than the original tooth brush !</li>
            <li>My dentist knew when I first started using the battery Oral B toothbrush, because my teeth were cleaner, my gums were in excellent shape, and the plaque I always get on my lower teeth was much diminished.</li>
            <li>I really liked the feeling it leaves of clean mouth.</li>
            <li>nicely designed for travel wish it had a cover for the brush head to keep it clean when travel.</li>
            <li>The battery gives you about medium power for a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The batteries are amazing and while it costs more money to get started they quickly pay for themselves and the charger many times over their life span.  </li>
            <li>Teeth are nice and clean, battery lasts about 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li>as they always have them on-sale for between $9-$14per toothbrush, and while it&#x27;s really good to be able to find them here, consistently like this, on Amazon and</li>
            <li>But for now this is great and highly recommended if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li>it is good ,and easy useful.</li>
            <li>Needed an electric toothbrush for my extensive travelling, this was perfect not as strong as the one I have at home</li>
            <li>Wow is this perfect for travel, quick delivery as well</li>
            <li>It leaves teeth very clean and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oscillating bristles thoroughly cleans and massages the tooth, tongue and gum areas of the mouth and leave the areas feeling very clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my teeth feel polished and very clean compared to a manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It was very comfortable on the teeth and gums, as well as easy to hold with the ergonomic grip.  </li>
            <li>and I always thought I did a pretty good job until I got this one.</li>
            <li>Pretty good after a week of use.</li>
            <li>My first oral-b (which I loved) battery died.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Loved this toothbrush when I first received it - a gift from a dentist.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this little toothbrush gives great bang for the buck (a great buy)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this little toothbrush gives great bang for the buck (a great buy)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this product, my teeth are significantly whiter and NO CAVITIES!</li>
            <li>Even my hygienist is happy about my new brush!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>toothbrush does a great job on my teeth and gums, and it feels more like using my old one than the Pro 1000.</li>
            <li>Fully charged batteries can easily get you three or four weeks of use, so you would have to use the toothbrush for more than 50 years before the batteries wore out, anyway.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish the batteries came out more easily.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much &amp; that I brought 3 more for the rest of family.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush isn&#x27;t as good as my regular Oral-B electric toothbrush, but it is a good option for when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li>Honestly that&#x27;s kind of frighteningly fast.</li>
            <li>Works well as a daily toothbrush, definitely better than a manual brush, would be ideal for travel as well.</li>
            <li>nice to know you are really cleaning your teeth, the right way ... this toothbrush does a great and easy job</li>
            <li>Working great so far!  </li>
            <li>To prevent water to leak into battery  cell, i have wraped it up with sticky tape and all seems to work fine :-)</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else to clean my teeth!</li>
            <li>Gets my teeth really clean!</li>
            <li>I like the shape better too; it&#x27;s more hand friendly.</li>
            <li>This newly designed version is great; access to the batteries is easy.  </li>
            <li>I got it because I wanted to be able to experience that after-the-dentist visit clean more than just twice a year.</li>
            <li>It definitely feels as if it gives me an excellent brush &amp; my teeth &amp; mouth feel really clean afterward.</li>
            <li>the price is very cheap, very worth buying</li>
            <li>It is a very cool product.</li>
            <li>I got very good price of these heads from my local Sam&#x27;s Club.&lt;br /&gt;(5)</li>
            <li>It does a very good job cleaning my teeth, and the batteries last quite a while.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very good ,especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a more comfortable grip and a lower pitch \\&quot;whine\\&quot; than the electric one.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the most important.</li>
            <li>so it is much more cleaning and comfortable for him</li>
            <li>best $11 I&#x27;ve ever spent..</li>
            <li>was surprised to find that it included a 3 min timer - a great way to shame you into brushing your teeth for the recommended amount of time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>; electric brushes yet more substantial than the cheap ones ...</li>
            <li>As an aside, we wouldn&#x27;t use a toothbrush this small on our own teeth, but it&#x27;s perfect for our needs.</li>
            <li>So far, working great.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived early &amp; what seems to be great shape.</li>
            <li>We were surprised to discover when we received this one that there was no plastic cover for the head, greatly reducing the usefulness of the brush for traveling.</li>
            <li>So far this is great for work travel.</li>
            <li>But I think the product has gotten more cheaply made over the years.</li>
            <li>Well designed, feels great in the hand, this is a perfect low priced battery operated toothbrush that improves  upon the earlier models at this price point.</li>
            <li>Works well and ideal for packing for extended international travel.</li>
            <li>So far, everything is great.</li>
            <li>So far this toothbrush is working great for us.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it targets my teeth</li>
            <li>and i am happy so far with it.</li>
            <li>I liked the rotating action and effective cleaning as opposed to the Sonicare models I had used for many years.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery good product.</li>
            <li>After cleaning the parts the real fun begins.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more economic and more effective to use this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This product really cleans the stain off my teeth, good product.</li>
            <li>Good price, works very well.</li>
            <li>FOR GOOD HEALTH.THE HEADS FOR THIS TOOTHBRUSH ARE QUITE REASONABLE</li>
            <li>No problems at all - though I do miss the Oral-B, which seemed to fit my hand better and was more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>It really does a good job for the price.</li>
            <li>you can clean your teeth better because you can apply more pressure but this unit did work just fine for the price.</li>
            <li>What is interesting about this one is that it tells me when to stop brushing, after two minutes it sends a pulsed signal that you are done, convenient and very useful.</li>
            <li>Works nicely and the price is right</li>
            <li>the two minute timer is excellent and it really cleans your teeth when used properly, which is very easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Just like with people, it helps keep their mouths clean, their teeth from getting cavities, their gums from becoming inflamed, and their bodies healthy.</li>
            <li>Good little toothbrush for great price.</li>
            <li>My dentist even comments on how clean my teeth :)  </li>
            <li>I love the Oral B electric toothbrush line, my teeth get really clean.  </li>
            <li>So far both work perfectly and get my teeth much cleaner than manuals.</li>
            <li>Good price, strong action, convenient for travel, no wires to tangle or display on counter top.</li>
            <li>my dentist jokes that she makes really easy $$$ off me</li>

            <li>Uses AA battery and easy to replace.  </li>

            <li>Greater power and really clean teeth.</li>

            <li>The batteries are easy to install.</li>
            <li>The cap at the bottom is easy to break when replacing your battery.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to stick in a pair of rechargeable AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Takes AA batteries which makes it easy for travelling abroad, so you can take it anywhere in the world and not worry about recharging it or bringing a charger.  </li>
            <li>Also, the brush head can be easily detached for cleaning.</li>
            <li>love how clean my teeth feels after brushing!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will list the Amazon links below so you can find them easily.  </li>

            <li>and it is still going strong.  </li>

            <li>But the strength of the brush rotating is not as strong as the rechargeable versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the efficiency of the toothbrush in getting to all cavities in the mouth, gentle yet effective.  </li>

            <li>Needed a new electric toothbrush and Oral B is always a good bet.</li>
            <li>A brand new brush is always good.</li>
            <li>really good for a new user as me.</li>
            <li>This is the best powered toothbrush for less than $20 period.</li>

            <li>you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works fine, as described, stops every 2 mins to signalize about time to change the sides.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s version works fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s work fine &amp; Help me to protect My Teeth</li>
            <li>The timer keeps us honest! :) Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t eat battery power too quickly!</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, but it performs well and cleans my teeth better than adequately.</li>
            <li>Super value!</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is easy to clean, and the batteries are easy to access and change.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is incredibly inexpensive and works better than my previous rechargable Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, yet very comfortable on my teeth.</li>
            <li>In my equipment, Duracell Alkaline fit perfectly and the compartment closes tight.</li>
            <li>so you can take the ones you use at home and still use this wonderful little brush.  </li>
            <li>The power is nice and strong which I love, other folks may not be so thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable, quiet and does a great job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I bought cheap foil stickers for my daughter to decorate it with and she loves brushing with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase as this low price.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a carrying case available for purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li>When a dental tech recommended one, I purchased this -- the cheapest available.  </li>
            <li>Yes filled my expectations it whizzes around faster than an electric one.  </li>
            <li>it is cheap electric toothbrush after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just wish it was a bit more powerful</li>
            <li>really enjoy the feeling.</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much I ordered one for myself.</li>
            <li>I needed one that my brush-heads would fit on, but that didn&#x27;t need to be plugged in to the wall.  </li>
            <li>Will try it for a while more before deciding if it is worth buying the heads for it.</li>
            <li>Teeth are in fantastic condition-</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have stayed in fantastic condition since I got this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have stayed in fantastic condition since I got this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s the cheap vitality).  </li>
            <li>It is also good that more different brush heads are available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, for the price, this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for almost a year and really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>yesterday it just started skipping and today it won&#x27;t even work, makes a buzzing sound but nothing else.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say go for a cheap one like this.</li>
            <li>Use it over the sink or while wearing house clothes because if you brush before you&#x27;re ready to go out, you will dribble toothpaste water on your nice clothes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this brush is great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>the ORAL B PRO-HEALTH my teeth get a smooth and through cleaning.</li>
            <li>i have own this items for about 11 months now and it is still working really well for me</li>
            <li>Cheap electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very cost effective</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that unit is more powerful, or if it&#x27;s just the 3D effect they advertize, but I find that the vibration is too aggressive.</li>
            <li>The timer is great as well is the battery life span, but availability to change toothbrush heads is an enormous advantage.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and efficient</li>
            <li>this brush fit the bill for my wife.</li>
            <li>Works well, although the models with rechargeable batteries are a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in my hand</li>
            <li>I would recommend this over the cheap $5 motorized brushes you can buy in the grocery store.</li>
            <li>i will be doing this later on happy hunting</li>
            <li>Bought this one for a summer home, since I like the one at the primary home.</li>
            <li>Also, the fit of the toothbrush onto the handle is tighter.  </li>
            <li>and they fit either handle.</li>
            <li>and they fit either handle.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great if you travel and are use to using a similar Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Bought this toothbrush because I accidentally ordered replacement heads that didn&#x27;t fit the one I had.</li>
            <li>and it is comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush and a different variant for my children, work great</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a cheap electric toothbrush for my fiancee that worked well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>ok but not as powerful as i had hoped.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really great around the molars - sides and back.  </li>
            <li>As of June2015, Sonicare Essence battery no longer available from Amazon and from Sonicare official website&#x27;s Support Q&amp;A section states that it can use Proresult brush head</li>
            <li>Besides the replaceable batteries, it&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>cheap battery  toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had been using a different brand electric timer brush and thought I was getting a great cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar for a power toothbrush as my personal experience with them hasn&#x27;t been good</li>
            <li>Once going does a good job; holds up well so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good no complaints.</li>
            <li>This is far superior to the disposable toothbrushes that are out there.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Far superior to the rechargeable models.</li>
            <li>do not appreciate the way the manufacturer produces this product --they should be more responsible to make the product more reliable.</li>
            <li>and, so far, I have not found a good battery option for it yet.</li>
            <li>I use the flossing action heads and so far, I think this is a perfect combination of form, function and price.</li>
            <li>works good so far, purchased the refills we&#x27;ll see how they do too</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>first problem is that I tried buying toothbrush heads online, and they were counterfeit heads that broke very quickly!  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li>The single most important feature is the built-in timer, which makes a remarkable difference in one&#x27;s brushing habits (and outcomes).  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund before the 60-day deadline (I bought mine at CVS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am sure to get the right one.</li>
            <li>My dentist/dental hygenist commented on how good and clean my teeth were when I went in for my most recent cleaning.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>So it is very useful for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I had a full blown electric one years ago and loved it, however I spent $99 on that one and only $9.99 on this one and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Cleans good and not very harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean and plaque free.</li>
            <li>it is easy, cheap, and good enough.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, and really helps with his permanent retainer.  </li>
            <li>If using AA batteries really bugs you, use rechargeable ones, but it&#x27;s a very easy and low-risk way to test whether you like using one or not.</li>
            <li>This power brush is perfect for my mouth which is small.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price!</li>
            <li>This is a replacement to my original Braun.</li>
            <li>Oral B is the reason , at 68 , I still have all my original teeth with no cavities</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the brush for about 3 weeks twice a day on the original batteries with plenty of power.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant improvement since using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The gives it a heavier weight, although you do get a more consistent motor strength.</li>
            <li>First of all I have to say that the Oral B Electric toothbrush has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful !</li>
            <li>---ORIGINAL</li>
            <li>Gives you that fresh out of the dentist feeling every time i brush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to tell them how I dislike their original design.</li>
            <li>Still on the original battery.</li>
            <li>and I am still on the original batteries.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price but is not as smooth in motion as the rechargeable Oral-Bs.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>These are the best electric toothbrush heads in my opinion as they are small and quite functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g.</li>
            <li>worth it for the price!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve ever used one of the higher end Oral B toothbrushes, you&#x27;ll be able to tell that this one is a lot weaker.</li>
            <li>Certainly worth it!</li>
            <li>I love it so much I ordered another one as a gift for my brother!</li>
            <li>After getting this for like 10 bucks it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>It is great for traveling, has a long battery life and you don&#x27;t ever have to wait for it to charge.  </li>
            <li>and I have yet to use up the two original batteries it came with.  </li>
            <li>I liked my first electric Toothbruch very much.</li>
            <li>I truly liked this brush, but cannot afford a new brush every couple of months or so.  </li>
            <li>I put my own new batteries in and nothing happened again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean and polished after every use.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is just what kids need to get a really clean set of teeth.</li>
            <li>We use the best rechargeable batteries for this and, so far, still on the initial charge.</li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel so clean with each use.  </li>
            <li>and I can take this with me and know my teeth are getting really clean even while I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li>1- Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush is defective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Oral-B Precision Clean line for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer the dual clean toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>I ended up switching them out since the dual clean heads are compatible with this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>you value clean teeth, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>There is no way that brushing by hand can duplicate the cleaning action of an electric toothbrush, but many electric brushes cost more money than I want to spend.</li>
            <li>My teeth feels amazingly clean.</li>
            <li>Great usage, it is really efficient and is not too loud.  </li>
            <li>makes your teeth clean with buildup of plaque,larry</li>
            <li>I would try to clean up the seal area as build-up occurs.</li>
            <li>SO far my parents love it and want to buy more for their friends.</li>
            <li>I also try to keep the handle clean so that crud does not build up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just ordered a replacement for the Oral B Precision Clean brush I ordered over 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li>We own several electric tooth brushes and we like them all and feel that they do an outstanding job in cleaning our teeth.  </li>
            <li>I use it when I don&#x27;t want to use my quicker manual brush and it seems to clean my teeth just as well.</li>
            <li>B002HWS9FW Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li>, you can prevent the battery seal from cracking by routinely keeping your toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li>I clean the seal around the battery case every 2 weeks or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you can prevent the battery seal from cracking by routinely keeping your toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li>I clean the seal around the battery case every 2 weeks or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth also feel ultra clean.</li>
            <li>Simple is better and just as effective.</li>
            <li>So I thought for under $10, I&#x27;d give the Oral-B Pro-health precision clean battery</li>
            <li>COULD&#x27;T CLEAN</li>
            <li>It works and always leaves ones teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Gives your teeth a dental visit clean.</li>
            <li>We switched from the $5 sonic toothbrush to the Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Been using Precision Clean toothbrushes for years now</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>i always feel clean.</li>
            <li>believe me you will know when you have completed each area and at the end you will know your teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>and my dentist recommended it to help clean my gums.  </li>
            <li>It works great for occasional use, but it isn&#x27;t as powerful as the rechargeable models.</li>
            <li>and I am still using my Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Electric Toothbrush</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so great, love it everyday.</li>
            <li>I feel that it gets the job done, however I would probably recommend also purchasing the oral b dual clean replacement brush heads as well</li>
            <li>I love the automatic timer as I always thought I was brushing my teeth for a long time, but this is for sure better and a longer time.  </li>
            <li>if one keeps it in the mouth for the two minutes and moves it over all of the teeth during the time.&lt;br /&gt;There are many different brands on the market, however this is less costly than many and if used properly does an excellent job of providing good dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>but there are certain areas that my manual brush used to clean better.</li>
            <li>great thing about this brush is that it has the same great build quality but costs half the price.</li>
            <li>Many years ago a colleague recommended getting a braun electric toothbrush (he insisted on Braun) and after having strayed into other brands and thrown them away because they are not as good, I am sticking to Braun toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>So you get optimal performance right to the end of set of batteries!</li>
            <li>and it does a good job with enough power to have them feel clean without going over and over.</li>
            <li>It perfectly brushes hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still great, but be careful if you are buying replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of battery-powered Oral B electric toothbrushes, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The first one is lasting well and doing a great job.  </li>
            <li>Why on earth would anyone spend more than I spent for this great toothbrush unless they have a real fixation and money to throw away.  </li>
            <li>delivered as expected; works great.</li>
            <li>Pretty good no issues so far.</li>
            <li>I love it, my teeth and gums looks so much healther now  </li>
            <li>it always gets my teeth super clean.  </li>
            <li>Like the 2-minute timer&lt;br /&gt;Con: it is kind of loud</li>
            <li>design of this brush is superior to the similarly priced Sonicare model.</li>
            <li>the low price and the good quality</li>
            <li>In addition, it is more gentle on my gums yet still cleans well.</li>
            <li>Gets my teeth super clean and freshens my breath.</li>
            <li>Great product so far, I am finding this product is more effective than usual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Good solid toothbrush</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price I paid for it, I think it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do thorough nice cleaning action, I almost feel like I&#x27;m using a manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li>true workhorse - both the unit and the brush-heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good, basic brush that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The batteries that came with the product lasted the full 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The kids love brushing their teeth again, thanks to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>She loved it, brushes her teeth for a longer time each time so I am saying it is a big hit.</li>
            <li>and I hope to have good news the next time I go to the dentist!</li>
            <li>I use the battery model to replace the rechargeable model and it is as good as the prior model and give me the flexibility of not needing to plug in a recharger.</li>
            <li>Good for a second unit to take camping.</li>
            <li>I will back for this.thanks for the good service.</li>
            <li>it makes my mouth feel super clean..</li>
            <li>wish the battery lasted longer, but overall good</li>
            <li>The good thing is it is compatible with several Oral-B brush heads.  </li>
            <li>timer ensures that you brush for a full 2 minutes</li>
            <li>I bought it, and it works very well, better, in fact than the rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li>I feel for those who bought earlier versions of this toothbrush, but the good news is that the company listened to the complaints and made changes.</li>
            <li>It honestly feels like I&#x27;ve just came back from a professional cleaning, and even my dentist told me I&#x27;m doing a good job</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good quality electric brush that didn&#x27;t have to be charged daily.  </li>
            <li>My son uses it and it has a timer that help him to brush for a full two minutes.</li>
            <li>so I have some sense of what&#x27;s reasonable and this seems to weigh significantly more.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>It makes a big difference cleaning wise</li>
            <li>The brush is itself is a good size and can reach in between the teeth and the entire surface of the tooth.</li>
            <li>Some are as much as $210 or more.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad trade off at all.  </li>
            <li>This is not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Head brushes are easy to find and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Very good but very slightly under powered toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I are pleasantly surprised and happy with our new toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with how much power this toothbrush has compared to previous AA cell toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Impressed with the overall quality, very sturdy and more than enough power when charged.  </li>
            <li>This one is as good as many times more expensive ones &amp; it lasts many years.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product is great, it is just that faulted button that is the problem.</li>
            <li>A great natural-whitening and tooth re-mineralizing powder to supplement your all-natural toothpaste-- and a great way to save money on those messy whitening strips and help the environment in the long term as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep one at work for after lunch brushing and my mouth feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>the do keeping my teeth clean and my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>My mouth and teeth feel fresh and thoroughly clean when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>I bought this specifically for travel since it has batteries, while my Phillips SonicCare eSeries uses a charger (great for home, but not so much when using internationally if you don&#x27;t feel like bringing a converter).  </li>
            <li>You will be amazed at how much cleaner your teeth are from this brush and it works just as great as ones that have a bigger price tag.  </li>
            <li>With this brush I can give more attention to any particular tooth easier too.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job, not only cleaning but massaging your gums.</li>
            <li>The speed &amp; pressure is good, and does NOT stop or slow on applying to teeth or my own finger.</li>
            <li>The strength is adequate.  </li>
            <li>Most electric toothbrushes will simply shut off after the magic 2 minute mark has been reached.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to convince you that this electric toothbrush is great and economic for human use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get a top name battery to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>Wife and I share and love using it together (with different brushes:-))</li>
            <li>There is a timer - it works in a way where it pulses when the two minutes are up, then if you want to keep going it will stop after 3 quick pulses.</li>
            <li>It cleans quickly and along the gums.  </li>

            <li>I tend to brush too quickly</li>
            <li>I tend to brush too quickly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to have to throw out and replace a product like this so quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used in my life, and I&#x27;m so glad that I used this one first.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Senzacare TravelSonic Electric Toothbrush is several dollars more than Oral-B, but it is much better in style, size, and noise.  </li>
            <li>So for the price I figured lets order another and maybe get lucky.</li>
            <li>This one works better and German craftsmanship is better than made in China.</li>
            <li>love that the new one is exactly the same as the old one, does a great job and my mouth appreciates it!</li>
            <li>That always seems to be so very funny to</li>
            <li>My very first electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase and will replace it with the same model when this eventually wears out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical, it works very well, its easy to use and clean and you can use it anywhere in the world that has AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re up for it, you can make your own cleansing tooth powder with equal parts Baking Soda, (freshly ground) unrefined Sea Salt and Calcium Magnesium powder and voila, all-natural Re-Mineralizing tooth powder!</li>
            <li>Just as good as my own more expensive rechargeable model.</li>
            <li>I have used oral B for years and always have had good luck with them and a long lifespan.</li>
            <li>In contrast, using this model with a pair of good rechargeable batteries will go a long way.</li>
            <li>I checked my review for accuracy and thought I&#x27;d add my thoughts that I still feel good about this purchase after so long.  </li>
            <li>It would have been better if Amazon offered a superior product and charged more, instead of cluttering our lives and dumps with poor quality items.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the battery-powered version of the one recommended to me by my dental hygienist (which was the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000).</li>
            <li>Just make sure to keep the actual brush clean and remember to remove batteries if you are traveling!</li>
            <li>This version has the benefit of being able to use new batteries.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and the 2 minute timer is really helpful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really cleans out every crevice and is easy to navigate to every corner of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I think battery operated things only can hold up so long and in this case 6 months is the best you can ask for these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and strong and cleans my teeth and gums VERY well.  </li>
            <li>WORKED VERY WELL AND EASY ON THE GUMS.DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>The timer is perfect for trying to get your kids to brush long enough.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it at first, but when I had to change the batteries I couldn&#x27;t get the cap back on.  </li>
            <li>think so far this is hands down the best deal for a power/spin brush.</li>
            <li>With this one, the regular brush head works great (same kind I used for years on the older model), and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sand blasting my teeth.</li>
            <li>Just ordered my second one, well pleased with my $12 investment 14 months ago!</li>
            <li>This brush was bought about the first of July and, in November end, I&#x27;m still using it two times a day on the original batteries that came with it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and what I ordered!</li>
            <li>My first Oral B battery toothbrush, just like this one, has lasted for 7 years, with replacement heads and batteries of course!  </li>
            <li>Highly Suggested!!!  </li>
            <li>Not quite as powerful or as fast as our home rechargeable unit, but a very adequate substitute at one sixth the cost.</li>
            <li>I will definitely brush my teeth more often now that it&#x27;s so easy to do.</li>
            <li>I will definitely brush my teeth more often now that it&#x27;s so easy to do.</li>
            <li>This one worked far better than the electric version I had and the batteries last an amazingly long time, It is awesome.</li>
            <li>I have to agree -- after the first time I used this one, my teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li>Strange as it may sound, we use this on our dog&#x27;s teeth because it&#x27;s small and fits easily in her mouth, and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>Great deal for an inexpensive little tooth brush...</li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little solution.</li>
            <li>Fast and free shipping, no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li>drspite so many poor reviews, this is the perfect toothbrush for my 9-year old.</li>
            <li>The battery enclosure is rubberized, stays water proof and the whole toothbrush feels sound and well made.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use and traveling.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap, and since it runs on AAs, it&#x27;s very portable.</li>
            <li>If our 4 year old granddaughter had been here, she  would have been able to take off the childproof cap for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful just like my electric Oral B toothbrush that needs recharging every week.  </li>
            <li>I tried fresh batteries with no difference.</li>
            <li>We have been screening for an electric toothbrush for our 4.5 year old son for quite a while, and my son simply love this one.</li>
            <li>The portibility of the unit with battery power is the main feature I like along with the cost and easy brush head replacement.</li>
            <li>It came as expected, on time and in good shape.</li>
            <li>Fresh batteries were inserted correctly, as they worked when sufficient hand pressure was placed on the compartment.  </li>
            <li>Works well, useful for travel</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the cleaning as is my daughter&#x27;s dentist when we take her in for professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>You get far more than what you pay for with this brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottom-line: the Oral-B Pro-Health Battery line is a powerful, affordable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Brushing teeth is fun</li>
            <li>Nice design that fits comfortably in the hand and does not slip around when wet.</li>
            <li>Brother says its worth every penny</li>
            <li>This is a nice toothbrush which I bought to replace an Oral B rechargeable with a similar brush head.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth this brush is still good just do not use a toothpaste with SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) OR use a sensitive toothpaste like Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>Brush head seems faster and more powerful than my old one.  </li>
            <li>It needs more power action to the head so it can remove particles from my teeth.</li>
            <li>May be useful for kids.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad that these toothbrush are sold directly by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I ordered this toothbrush just because I needed to spend a bit more to get free shipping, and my last electric one was worn out.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Brush head alone makes it worth a backup TB.</li>
            <li>B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] would be a better choice.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is worth it.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels so fresh too.  </li>
            <li>This has more operating time compared to Braun professional series.  </li>
            <li>Worth keeping one in the glove box of the car .</li>
            <li>Its worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like a powerful motor.</li>
            <li>; most electric toothbrush batteries end up going out completely after a year or two.</li>
            <li>Its nice that it accepts the OEM replacement heads that one can purchase in the multi-pack at Costco especially when the go on sale once a year or so.</li>
            <li>Works better than my old one battery one.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Received as expected and in good shape.</li>
            <li>Good alternative option if electronic brushes seem expensive - good battery life</li>
            <li>Love it my old one died</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough and you don&#x27;t have to worry about cables outlets which comes in handy when traveling</li>
            <li>I use this as a supplemental brush &amp; so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I had wondered if this one would be as powerful as the plug-in version, and it does seem to be.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and cleans well.</li>
            <li>I also bought a pack of the soft head replacement tips and glad I did.</li>
            <li>That being said this is a really nice unit for the cost, has a timer built in, and the head is smaller than the spin brush type</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s every bit as powerful as the one I use at home.  </li>
            <li>I never thought a battery-operated toothbrush could be so much fun.  </li>
            <li>Investing in a rechargeable battery system is economically effective if you brush regularly.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>this is a strong unit and works real good and seems to be solid, it does a very good job, the only drawback is the size of the brush, quite small but so far i really like it.</li>
            <li>I would guess not as strong as a brand new charger version, but better than an old one.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, it&#x27;s much better than the other electric toothbrush I had</li>
            <li>An essential for healthy teeth, rarely found at a price like this - go for it!</li>
            <li>Not a huge fan of the smaller brush head, so I&#x27;m going to probably opt for the dual clean that fits this brush, but besides that I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>(make sure they&#x27;re from a reputable seller due to fakes on the market).</li>
            <li>This model is particularly well suited for travel but of course it will work fine at home.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, have used some of their brands earlier and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The head wears out pretty quickly for my usage.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, but very effective and not cheap.  </li>
            <li>You will need to clean out the build up it accumulates inside the head at least each 2 weeks if you don&#x27;t already take great care of your toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean and replacement brushes are not that much more than standard tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Oral B has other battery operated models but not as good.</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and it is useful!</li>
            <li>as other have say its good if u want to be abel to use alot of battery or spend alot on recharable battery</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good enough too, if you want to use it for home use - as long as you&#x27;re ok with wasting batteries or swapping it out with a rechargeable AA.</li>
            <li>AA batteries are pretty cheap pretty much anywhere!</li>
            <li>It was delivered right on time.</li>
            <li>Vibrates gums and stimulates them to behave right.</li>
            <li>You have to squeeze both sides of the handle in the right places to force the cover off to enable battery replacement.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price was right and it was delivered on time.</li>
            <li>Itis just the right size and shape for me.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>The grip fits right but the on off switch can be tricky when your hand is slippery with toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I like it and think its just right for me</li>
            <li>Since the batteries come packed separately and are not installed inside the device, I had to remove the cap to insert the Duracell brand AA batteries before I could use it, so I got to test that part out right away.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is right on the money when it comes to cleaning out the crevices between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>But the price is right.</li>
            <li>Just right for my kids.</li>
            <li>I replaced the AA batteries once without a hitch, and the head is easily swapped out for new replacements.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of power but still works really well to remove plack and clean teeth.</li>
            <li>It can clean teeth very well.</li>
            <li>A full charged hybrid batteries will last more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>and it really gets your &amp;#34;pearly whites&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
            <li>This newer version looks the same as before, but I noticed that the batteries went in more easily and the compartment was much easier to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it runs off two double a battery that lasts about 6 months &amp; are very easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But only if you have VERY strong hands.  </li>
            <li>The spinning &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; is highly maneuverable in your mouth, and problem ares can be accurately targeted to remove stains and food particles.  </li>
            <li>Love that you can replace the batteries and the brush heads instead of just pitching the whole thing and buying a new one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s makes  sense to pay more less, for a better product.</li>
            <li>I used these brushes for many years and have lasted two to more time but this order from Oral-B stop working in less than a month and can not be retornar.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this particular toothbrush for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Small head works great for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of the Pro-Health motor, it&#x27;s pretty powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how much better a brushing job I am able to do with the smaller head.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and use these products together and my smile is becoming more stunning everyday.  </li>
            <li>I liked it enough initially to buy two more</li>
            <li>I have had several different brands and this is by FAR the best.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush as much as the older model it replaces ONLY BETTER.  </li>
            <li>It&#x60;s a good toothbrush, I like the round brush it gets to the back teeth better to clean and brush</li>
            <li>I have used the Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Electric Toothbrush, for several years and for the money, it is worth the cost and provides a superior teeth cleaning than just using a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>for the price, this brush seems to do as good as I believe any of the high priced rechargeable brushes do for a huge chunk of change less.</li>
            <li>Keeps my mouth clean and I&#x27;m able to really make sure my teeth located in the far back of my mouth are able to be properly touched and cleaned as well.</li>
            <li>This was a little more, but I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>works great like to rotate with my other toothbrush leaves with that clean mouth battery life is good not great</li>
            <li>Since these are relatively cheap I have just stocked up on them and when the battery needs changing I don&#x27;t even bother to put myself through the frustration I toss them into the garbage and get a new one.</li>
            <li>We use Sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries and they do a great job and last longer that even the regular batteries.  </li>
            <li>Had previously for years and loved it&#x27; .It</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised by how good it is, especially considering its price.</li>
            <li>and I think this company&#x27;s handling of this situation creates extra waste by having me throw out a perfectly usable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I think this company&#x27;s handling of this situation creates extra waste by having me throw out a perfectly usable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Was replaced super fast.</li>
            <li>So far this Oral-B is still going strong on the first pair of batteries for over 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Makes teeth cleaning for us lazy folk easy and effective.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as those high dollar brushes ...also small sleek design makes for easy traveling .Oral</li>
            <li>I like the toothbrush very much.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my husband, who likes it very much.</li>
            <li>With the charger version the strength depends very much on the usage of the battery (or the motor?).  </li>
            <li>It was priced very reasonably too.</li>
            <li>Bought this toothbrush for a very reasonable price and have been astounded at the results.  </li>
            <li>i like it very much</li>
            <li>seems the brush is small,but it is fine so far</li>
            <li>My tooth were never this clean before, when i was using normal brush.</li>
            <li>does not clean like I thought it would but does a fair job</li>
            <li>old Braun toothbrush lasted me for over 2 decades, despite occasional abuse, and was absolutely perfect in every single way.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My understanding is that you can put different brush heads on this one, but just the precision clean head compared to the dual-action head is a huge improvement in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Especially when all the others had very spotty reviews as they would die and stop charging or just weren&#x27;t very strong etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for cleaning well in hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>It requires 2 batteries, and makes a loud noise and huge vibration.  </li>
            <li>If this one was for use at home I&#x27;d give it only three stars, for its less than stellar power, but since it&#x27;s for use where the rechargeable won&#x27;t be suitable, good enough is fine and for this sort of travel I give it four stars.</li>
            <li>only things I don&#x27;t love deals with the brush head.  </li>
            <li>A regular toothbrush probably does a better job than this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I actually like this brush better.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush and it lasted way over a year without even having to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li>exactly what I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li>When this one wears out, I will probably upgrade to a higher end rechargeable version.</li>
            <li>Better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The quality is the same as the rechargeables, but it is even better.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I am running mine with Eneloop rechargeable AA batteries which last more than two months per charge, with about two minutes of brushing per day.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I can get a more thorough brushing with the circular head because it does each tooth individually.  </li>
            <li>I do fill like it cleans my teeth better then when  I use a regular tooth brush .</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than the rechargable model.</li>
            <li>If I had purchased this brush prior to purchasing the rechargable model, I would have stuck with this instead of spending much more $ on the rechargable.  </li>
            <li>Ordered several more for Xmas gifts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is the first real power tool that we give him and he enjoys to use.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li>I first received it, the power seemed anemic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ony had it for 2 days, and it has worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner since I started using this puppy!  </li>
            <li>light not heavy</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping this product will last longer and be more convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li>I used a manual toddler tooth brush until Boys&#x27; first dental visit at 20 months.</li>
            <li>It shook my hand as much as Oral-B&#x27;s pulsar brush line and is about as powerful as a video-game controller vibrating motor.</li>
            <li>The cleaning action is fantastic.</li>
            <li>First one lasted about 3 years,</li>
            <li>Really gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first battery toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Most have fancy schmancy heads that are too big for me.</li>
            <li>First, 99% of the effectiveness of any toothbrush, manual or electric, depends on the technique used by the mouth owner.  </li>
            <li>I know to brush in each quadrant of my mouth for 30-40 seconds each (more than a two-minute total); I know to massage my gums when finished; I know to brush my tounge and roof of the mouth afterwards.  </li>

            <li>That is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>At first I thought I put dying batteries in it</li>
            <li>I will order another very soon!</li>
            <li>and I thought the thing was breaking the first time it went off.</li>
            <li>I should have bought this one the first time.</li>
            <li>Although not marketed as a kid-friendly model, it definitely seems to be a better size for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so if you are only needing a short term brush and are OK spending that much more for a power toothbrush than have at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect from an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I was worried about battery life, but it&#x27;s still running on the first set of batteries.</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is my second one and I am glad that you can buy replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>removable battery model, although made in China, seems to be better than the earlier ones that I had which were made in Germany and in Mexico.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.</li>
            <li>So much better than a regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li>First, we have used Oral B rechargables for years.</li>
            <li>These brushes not only take the effort out of brushing, but they also do it more thoroughly than I can myself.</li>
            <li>Still, it does the trick and is still better than a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>First of all, I ordered this Thursday night at 7:30 and when I woke up at 8, it was at my house...</li>
            <li>A tad slower than the slower than it&#x27;s top models, but it does the job and the batteries last.  </li>
            <li>SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more and give them as gifts when i get back to Manila!</li>
            <li>been a regular user of braun electric toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li>Replace the head every three months, use regularly, and you will love your visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li>That is because you can remove more plaque using this brush than when you use a regular non-electric tooth</li>
            <li>This tooth brush works great and last a long time on one set of batteries.</li>
            <li>I recommend them to anyone who needs a battery operated toothbrush--they do a much better job than regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have been using this product for over 18 months.</li>
            <li>I bought two more and then subsequently the covers of those broke as well.</li>
            <li>Made sure they were installed properly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries after about 3 weeks of using it once/day.</li>
            <li>sure you don&#x27;t short</li>
            <li>Will contact manufacturer first.</li>
            <li>I use it very day!</li>
            <li>I can see someone trying this out for the first time and thinking that it was defective.</li>
            <li>so you can tell one from another if more than two people in a household use the same product.</li>
            <li>so you can tell one from another if more than two people in a household use the same product.</li>
            <li>This product definitely works better than manual brushing.</li>
            <li>have in the garbage regardless of how much you paid for it!</li>
            <li>Only a trip to the dentist for a cleaning made them look better.  </li>
            <li>This is my first e-toothbrush and it does its job</li>
            <li>I like regular tooth brush better</li>
            <li>I think I will buy a rechargeable toothbrush (that doesn&#x27;t use replaceable batteries) next time, because those batteries are permanently sealed and probably better protected from water.</li>
            <li>In fact I&#x27;ll probably just discard the whole unit after a year and buy a fresh one, at this price.</li>
            <li>this is my third purchase of this product.. love it</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown on picture..no complaints</li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth pretty well.</li>
            <li>My kids needed better brushing, so I got this, which uses same brush.  </li>
            <li>This was my first electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really upset about it!</li>
            <li>This is my first battery/electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>well,, out here.. haha!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how light it was for a battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I had one of the 3-5 year Oral-B toothbrushes that lasted exactly three years and then pooped out.  </li>
            <li>The brush stopped working almost as soon as it was first used.</li>
            <li>It is probably the one thing (outside of my family) that I miss most.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush and the various Spin Brush types you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that i have ever bought a powered toothbrush and it feels like im at the dentist getting a cleaning when i use it.</li>
            <li>When the batteries are fresh, it removes stains and polishes teeth very well.</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush was Sonicare Essence rechargeable</li>
            <li>Even when Por1000 is low battery, it is still a bit more power that the Battery version.</li>
            <li>I came back to this review when I realized I have used up my reserves of brushes and needed more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still fully functioning after 3 weeks on the first charge.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant for a while thinking a standard brush is all I need (and it is) however electric toothbrushes really do more work than manual brushing when you think about it</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a battery operated toothbrush and this toothbrush has made me wish I&#x27;d purchased one years ago.</li>
            <li>The first one got drained in a month.</li>
            <li>since those heads have the extra bottom part for a better brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and my teeth definitely feel cleaner using this fella.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much money some of these electric toothbrushes cost!</li>
            <li>The tooth brish is good, but there are a few problems.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job maintaining speed even when pressed firmly against teeth.</li>
            <li>new unit was very reasonably priced and seems to be better made than my old unit</li>
            <li>I HAVE TO SAY THE OLD ONE WAS BETTER THAN THE NEW ONE.</li>
            <li>The batteries included are cheap Chinese Duracells, which fizzled-out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much I plan to order the other heads available for it.</li>
            <li>clean everyday and is easy for clean I like it</li>
            <li>Certainly the AA model is better than an ordinary tooth brush, if you don&#x27;t have $80-100 to spare, it&#x27;s not a horrible option.</li>
            <li>When the replacement brush heads run out, and it&#x27;s time to buy more, I may very well buy brush heads for the older Braun battery toothbrush, as it is so much easier to insert new batteries.re</li>

            <li>Considering AA batteries are cheap these days, this is more economical than more expensive recharge ones.</li>
            <li>far the batteries have lasted a month just fine, and I have rechargeables ready to go when they die.</li>
            <li>my teeth are very clean now, i will never go back to manual brushing again.)).  </li>
            <li>I honestly thought I was breaking it, due to being in a rush, or just plan</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be buying any other kind</li>
            <li>I was assuming the flat end of the batteries go onto the spring as it is in so many products.</li>
            <li>Sure if you are good with a soldering iron, can find how to crack the case open without damaging it you can put a new battery but having done it I can tell you it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>Low price, great clean fresh feeling after brushing, and long lasting replacement heads convinced me to buy a bunch of these as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>I have no problem reaching my back teeth with the smaller head of this toothbrush or angling it around to ensure a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable; it has  a 2 min time built in; a set of 2 AA alkaline batteries last close to 2 months without the loss of speed (some technology built-in do that), but make sure you grease  </li>
            <li>We used to have electric ones that were more expensive and this one is every bit as good.</li>
            <li>I have loved this battery toothbrush for about 10 years and it finally gave out suddenly.  </li>
            <li>This brush does just as good a job as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>my dentist recommended an electric tooth brush, but they were very expensive, so I thought I would try this, and so far I am so happy with it, works great, gives you the feeling of a professional cleaning you get at the hygienist.</li>
            <li>So, after using it for 4 years, this brush is still going strong and gives me the same feeling which I got after first use.</li>
            <li>It does a good job cleaning, but keeps on slowing down, even with new batteries, maybe I get a lemon.</li>
            <li>This is a first rate cleaner and make brushing so much easier.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush worked very well during the first two month.</li>
            <li>From the first use, I felt my tooth much cleaner and whiter.</li>
            <li>I think it cleans my teeth well, but it goes through batteries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like the whole thing if they&#x27;d tell me how to fix the first one.</li>
            <li>Great for someone that has Arthritis or other problem keeping them from using their arm properly to brush with.</li>
            <li>Some expensive ones gave out after a couple of years, so I said I&#x27;d only get the $5.00 kind at the drugstore from then on, as my dentist said they were doing a great job.  </li>
            <li>They have lasted a long time plus my family has better check ups at the dentist which saves me money.  </li>
            <li>the supposed &#x27;timer&#x27; feature is pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good for me though, because I was almost worried about it being too small.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure if the brush rotations are helpful, it seems the vibration is what makes these &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type brushes good.  </li>
            <li>Also good since kids don&#x27;t usually brush for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>but good if u are lazy</li>
            <li>You can either hold it down and use it or press the button and let it run on its own.</li>
            <li>I have tried larger brush heads and they don&#x27;t even begin to fit and clean but this small, round, brushhead fits perfectly and cleans thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>one is easy to hold as the outside is coated in a rubberized layer for easy gripping and the batteries seem to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>The brushing action is certainly not like my old Sonicare, but it is very effective and will vibrate three times when 2 minutes is up.  </li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer makes it easy to brush the proper amount of time</li>
            <li>Teeth become so much whiter as the brush action really gets your teeth extremely clean.  </li>
            <li>If you start using this, you&#x27;ll never be able to go back to a regular toothbrush, as your teeth will not feel clean.</li>
            <li>The shape makes cleaning back molars easy.</li>
            <li>then the Regular Manual Tooth Brush easy to use and moor</li>
            <li>Even the hard-to-reach teeth in the back are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a steady rate for cleaning, fits well in the hand, holds a decent amount of toothpaste and, especially great for anyone with a small mouth, isn&#x27;t too big.  </li>
            <li>I used to own a similar toothbrush (not round) and it did a decent job.</li>
            <li>It is good brush but battery does not last long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about chargers (chargers use energy and also cost a certain amount).&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>but I am certainly recommending don&#x27;t buy this model if anyone is considering.  </li>
            <li>but, all things considered, it certainly does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The on/off switch is smartly sealed beneath a rubber membrane which ensures water can&#x27;t get into the internals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We charge ours in a smart Sony charger.  </li>
            <li>It sounds like a neck massager or some large device.  </li>
            <li>Although not a rechargeable toothbrush, it is lasting a long time on 1 battery, and it will be more convenient for travelling which is important to me.</li>
            <li>But overall good as long as you&#x27;re mindful of water spills (or you replace the O ring)!</li>
            <li>This unit is great, a little loud, actually it is pretty loud when compare to Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Stores near me had several alternatives at a much higher price with lots more bells and whistles I did not need.</li>
            <li>The only way this electric tooth brush could be better is if it never needed new batteries.  </li>
            <li>am just telling this as I think sometimes you forget your buyers are not all young and as strong as a four year old.  </li>
            <li>These work fine on rechargeable aa&#x27;s if you don&#x27;t want to feed it regular batteries.</li>
            <li>It works fine (just one speed), is a bit noisier and uses all the same brush heads.</li>
            <li>Its working fine, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>Two of us used it twice daily and one set of batteries turned out to be fine</li>
            <li>Vibrates fine until you actually try to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush worked fine with 2 AA batteries and the batteries last a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>The timer is a handy reminder that I&#x27;ve been brushing long enough, although a simple &amp;#34;ding&amp;#34; or sound might be better than the brush turning on and off a couple times in the middle of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B toothbrush at home for years, the kind that sits on a little recharging stand.  </li>
            <li>I soak it in peroxide (with a little mouthwash to give it a nice smell)  </li>
            <li>i like the small brush head, which let me clean my teeth one by one throughly:)</li>
            <li>For a little more than $11 it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>This model slows down or stops very easily while brushing.</li>
            <li>but then it slowed down or stopped very easily while brushing.  </li>
            <li>I recognize that this is a fairly complex products, and the heads themselves are pretty high quality, but I do think they could do a better job of keeping the price down.me one at-cost, or even ship me out one for free as a courtesy.  </li>
            <li>goes through batteries really fast when you brush your teeth 3 times a day</li>
            <li>Way too soon I had to replace the batteries, and the compartment door wouldn&#x27;t fit back on.</li>
            <li>I struggled to keep with it because it seemed to take so much longer, but really, it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>More expensive rechargeable models will have much more power so they will brush much more efficiently in the same amount of time and they also vibrate.</li>
            <li>directions on the baby aspirin said it required two thumbs to lift on both sides and I really hurt my thumb joints on both hands - still not quite healed after almost a year.  </li>
            <li>My whole family has one.</li>
            <li>It spins really fast.  </li>
            <li>This product came with the batteries which was very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Straight out of the box busted.</li>
            <li>Seems like a real winner and a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush</li>
            <li>and I bought one for my whole family.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It cleans very well</li>
            <li>I find that it is gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li>much better money spent compared to the 100</li>
            <li>The Philips model&#x27;s vibration is much stronger, but the design lends itself to you hitting your teeth on the plastic.  </li>
            <li>It fits a variety of heads designed for it and has lasted really well.</li>
            <li>That and of course not having to worry so much about plaque and cavities.</li>
            <li>and my mouth feels much cleaner than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can now go gently into her mouth and get areas</li>
            <li>When we moved to this house I didn&#x27;t realize the outlet in the bathroom only worked when the light was on.  </li>
            <li>Gets the job done for a reasonable price as compared to some models costing 5 times the price.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34</li>
            <li>yet you have to replace the head much often</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>I followed the advice of the reviewer who suggested that a light application of plumber&#x27;s silicone gel on the seal ring would eliminate possible water leakage into the battery chamber, and this has worked well.</li>
            <li>I note that several reviewers complain about the fit of the two AA batteries inside the battry compartment.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want any plug-in electric chargers cluttering my bathroom sink top, and I don&#x27;t want to hide them in the medicine cabinet and drag it it from time to time to recharge my \\&quot;built in\\&quot; rechargeable \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want any plug-in electric chargers cluttering my bathroom sink top, and I don&#x27;t want to hide them in the medicine cabinet and drag it it from time to time to recharge my \\&quot;built in\\&quot; rechargeable \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth are much cleaner than before.</li>
            <li>I found this electric toothbrush to be a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The real test of any toothbrush for me is the \\&quot;11 AM test\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>really like the brushing timer.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>Much prefer battery operated.</li>
            <li>The tootbrush is used by my daughter and she loves using it and finds it very convenient.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very inexpensive but not so much so in regards to inherent difficulties.</li>
            <li>much recomend this product</li>
            <li>Battery life is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have the Oral-B plug in unit at home and this is the closest thing to the real one.</li>
            <li>makes this unit very portable for travel.  </li>
            <li>(Note: I don&#x27;t have problem with cavity, plague, tartar build up, etc even using manual toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness for those things on your teeth)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using this electric toothbrush, you just need to make a gentle contact between the brush and his/her</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Opening the battery case is much easier.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have room for a charger in my bathroom and thus the battery solution is desirable.  </li>
            <li>The brush works really well when batteries are at max charge.  </li>
            <li>I travels very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But it performs really well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to use much battery power either.  </li>
            <li>it makes it so much easier to brush his teeth</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the one I spent four times more for.  </li>
            <li>If you travel a lot or cannot afford to fork out that much for a toothbrush</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel so much cleaner than before.</li>
            <li>I use it when traveling and really like.it.  </li>
            <li>seems to work better than expected.</li>
            <li>In the week since I&#x27;ve started using this brush my teeth have become much cleaner and noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li>This will make it much easier to brush my teeth when I travel.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely love this except that the 1st time I needed to change the batteries, the cover won&#x27;t lock, so I have it taped closed.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>You can use Alkaline or rechargeable batteries very flexible.  </li>
            <li>Just pop in AA batteries and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Although not as fast as my fully-charged rechargeable Oral-B, it works well and does the job.  </li>
            <li>I really like this electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You really do need to brush for two minutes with this model.</li>
            <li>You really do need to brush for two minutes with this model.</li>
            <li>When replacing the battery cover, so much force is required to close it, that the plastic splits.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>there are also happy folks which got broken on arrival.</li>
            <li>Depending on the brand and model, length of AA batteries can vary as much as 2 milimeter.</li>
            <li>Does it really need 2 batteries?  </li>
            <li>&quot; b/c after that amount of battery drainage, the brush was not spinning nearly as fast as our Oral-B electric, which sits in the charger all the time).  </li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>It eats batteries so fast......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not broken</li>
            <li>Works really well - and has a two minute timer which I like.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Pro-Health Precision works very well to me.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li>I very like it！It&#x27;s very good！</li>
            <li>The high-end models have integrated batteries, so when they eventually wear out, you have to replace the whole device.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s absolutely no reason to spend more than $50 on an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Then gently pull the cap away from the bottom .</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t get much easier than this.</li>
            <li>electric toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are generic brush heads available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are generic brush heads available.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>(not that I&#x27;m worrying much about my toothbrush</li>
            <li>I think that, for the price of this product and the price of the replacement heads, they could do much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that, for the price of this product and the price of the replacement heads, they could do much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It spins too fast and irritates my gums.</li>
            <li>Replacement brush heads are very affordable.</li>
            <li>It went straight to the trash.  </li>
            <li>At this price, when the head wears out, I&#x27;ll probably just replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li>Really like this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Fast deliver.</li>
            <li>inbetween very well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>This brush does not spin quite as fast as the rechargeable version</li>
            <li>and monthly use of my GUM plaque hook scale/scraper thingy, my teeth have absolutely no plaque issues and are looking better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s ironic that Philips invented the rotary electric razor which I use, but they don&#x27;t make rotary electric toothbrushes?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so this works very well.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works very well.  </li>
            <li>And it really saved me money.</li>
            <li>is just too much work.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush over a year ago (I believe), and it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>It been a couple months and still works just as well as my model that was twice as much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, I got ones for my kids too -</li>
            <li>I really like the way that this product works.</li>
            <li>I had become very dependent on this spinning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Toothbrush works really well.  </li>
            <li>and cheap enough, also can change the battery as i wish</li>
            <li>Gets the job done well at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li>4 Stars is as high as I go on inanimate objects!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>In any case, its very underpowered.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really need all that.</li>
            <li>Almost like the real thing, but not.</li>
            <li>This one feels like it&#x27;s really getting some work done.</li>
            <li>I did just received a similar brush head for sensitive gums and it&#x27;s waaay better.  </li>
            <li>As for my own experience with it, I prefer the Sonicare-style brush head; this one has a particularly thicker post, which combined with the odd channels in it</li>
            <li>(at least I never notice a change in the level of rotary speed) but it is still a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have used Oral-B Toothbrushes for many years and my old one finally threw in the towel.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you could color one ring with fingernail polish and let it dry before putting it on a brush head, or just use some colored tape around one or more of the main parts of the device in your bathroom.</li>

            <li>I loved it, until it slowly stopped working.</li>
            <li>Even if it does break at some point as other reviewers are stating, it&#x27;s very cheap to replace as the price suggests.</li>
            <li>Even if it does break at some point as other reviewers are stating, it&#x27;s very cheap to replace as the price suggests.</li>
            <li>Like most comments here, the cost is high and it seems crazy in this day to throw away a good product just because the batteries can&#x27;t be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this is because of my daughter hanging some tooth issues and needing to be sure we could clean her teeth better because she wasn&#x27;t always as cooperative and it was hard to really clean her far back upper molars.</li>
            <li>I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me.</li>
            <li>I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me.</li>
            <li>I thought of returning this piece of junk, but Amazon accepts returns unopened only &amp; in original packaging.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;rattles\\&quot; more than my other electric toothbrushes, but I can overlook that for its convenience.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m nearing a year and a half of use, this toothbrush is still going strong!</li>
            <li>It went on to say that user preference is the discriminator, NOT whether one scours off more plaque than the other.  </li>
            <li>ORAL B PRO HEALTH actually makes me excited about brushing me teeth.</li>
            <li>and I consider it more convenient on trips not to carry a charger particularly on foreign trips.</li>
            <li>friendly toothbrushes cost about the same, but this one cleans so well</li>
            <li>It arrived the other day and I tried it yesterday to make sure it would work.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does not have the screw-off closure most other Oral B battery toothbrushes have.  </li>
            <li>Both were purchased at the same time and both still have the original batteries.  </li>
            <li>Other than the addition of the two minute timer, this looked exactly like my old brush; the sale was so good that I bought several of them.  </li>
            <li>My older version Braun toothbrush has a rounded battery compartment, which is MUCH easier to grasp, and</li>
            <li>I had to use toothpicks and floss regularly to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>I have to clean the removable cap and the bottom of the toothbrush in order for the cap to go back on.</li>
            <li>In the long run, rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride batteries are FAR cheaper than Alkaline batteries, and they sure beat having some plug-in toothbrush charger cluttering up your bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>I had to use toothpicks and floss regularly to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>I really like these toothbrushes, particularly for travel purposes.  </li>
            <li>and my teeth is so clean that I will not go back to manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific.</li>
            <li>I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific.</li>
            <li>current 3 that I bought came intact and very well packed, true Amazon quality.</li>
            <li>Power output is decent and very usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I was hoping for much more from the product, which proudly bears the name &amp;#34;BraAun&amp;#34; on it.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li>My older version Braun toothbrush has a rounded battery compartment, which is MUCH easier to grasp, and</li>
            <li>Batteries last a long time in it and it does a nice job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it for travel, but I have made it my only tooth brush, even though I have an older rechargeable one.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this toothbrush for our 3 year old back in August 2012 and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>After almost 6 months of use, this little guy is still going strong!</li>
            <li>After almost 6 months of use, this little guy is still going strong!</li>
            <li>Even this toothbrush is not expensive, I was surprised by the result.</li>
            <li>I liked the cost since I was not sure I would like a mechanical toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and they are pretty sensitive on your gums.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something small for travel, and for a short duration of use, this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these toothbrushes; this one, for me, and the same one for my wife but with the full brush head (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWS9G6/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i01).</li>
            <li>If you have normal teeth, this will work very well.</li>
            <li>First thing to mention here: They fixed the battery compartment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the second one I own, but it&#x27;s several years old</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t completely replace flossing, but it gets pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>To make it worse the full day of charging is only good for 1x brushing, my wife normally brush first, by the time I use it</li>
            <li>My old brush without the timer worked just fine for several years with yearly battery changes.  </li>
            <li>but it does a better job than a plain old toothbrush so worth toting along on vacation.</li>
            <li>Time for a new brand/brush!</li>
            <li>new one, however, is of much inferior quality:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Not with my new ORAL-B PR0 it is that gentle on my gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is better than the rechargable chorded type because it takes up less space on your bathroom sink and does not occupy a power source.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this one does not clean quite as well as the rechargeable, but it is pretty darn close, and after going through two of the rechargeables eventually failing on me, I like the much lower price of this one and the convenience of using commonly available batteries.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush mainly because it was time to replace the brush head on a Braun battery brush, when I saw this.</li>
            <li>do like this brush has a 2 minute timer, which my older Braun toothbrush does not have.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly at the gym</li>
            <li>The ones at walmart/amazon and such last 3 months or more.</li>
            <li>I find that my teeth are cleaner, particularly in-between teeth, than when I used a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Could just be that this particular one is a lemon.  </li>
            <li>It does a decent job cleaning my teeth, but I won&#x27;t be throwing away my Sonicare anytime soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick inspection showed it to be both smaller / lighter than the rechargeable models;  plus it has rubbery, ribbed grip.  </li>
            <li>A low price is attractive, but I would expect the lifespan to be at least a year for something like this.</li>
            <li>The heads are smaller and fit into areas that the old style brush wouldn&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li>My older one --which</li>
            <li>The battery holds for a decent length of time.</li>
            <li>I thought that this would be a decent replacement when I&#x27;m on the road, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>thought the batteries might go quickly, but they&#x27;ve lasted about 3 weeks with only 10% loss in power (I brush 2-3 times per day).  </li>
            <li>It was the smallest of all and a classic design by Dieter Rams -</li>
            <li>All the pieces are there, it runs, but it&#x27;s noisy and does&lt;br /&gt;not clean teeth as well as the better made Braun&#x27;s that are made in Germany (this one is made in China and seems like a cheap knock-off).&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did not let me return this which is disappointing, but I&#x27;m guessing alot&lt;</li>
            <li>I have tried rechargeable batteries, but they don&#x27;t work as well as regular alkaline (Lose power too quickly)</li>
            <li>I &#x27;bit the bullet&#x27; and replaced my Sonicare (way more expensive, waaaaay better) brushes.</li>
            <li>Particularly for gums, it cleans and massages helping to prevent cavities and disease.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS.</li>
            <li>Always wanted a decent electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This one is WAY above the one I used to use and it is only $3 more.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Crest or Colgate brands that you find at local retailers and for about the same price.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush mainly because it was time to replace the brush head on a Braun battery brush, when I saw this.</li>
            <li>do like this brush has a 2 minute timer, which my older Braun toothbrush does not have.</li>
            <li>It could function as a decent travel electric brush.</li>
            <li>The battery runs low quickly.</li>
            <li>I found that not all batteries are exactly the same physical size, thus not all batteries fit in the compartment the batteries go.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush, small head is great for getting behind everything,</li>
            <li>If you really change authentic brush heads every 3 months, then the charger and new batteries are not significant cost to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have the high end Oral B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Get all the benefits of an electric toothbrush without the high cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 12/14/2015: HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this even today.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend them.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Also, the toothbrush head doesn&#x27;t rotate both ways (rotating-oscillating) which is highly recommended by dentist for electronic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the advise of one of the reviewers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the brush for cleaning your teeth.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So, with high hopes, I bought this battery powered version with the hopes it would fill that void.  </li>
            <li>No fancy functions and ultra high speed</li>
            <li>I like the brush head on my new toothbrush, as it&#x27;s able to get into smaller places, and in the back of my mouth</li>
            <li>Note that, you can not replace the batteries in any toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries and one of the most common reason for a toothbrush ends its useful live is the death of its built-in batteries.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I like the brush head on my new toothbrush, as it&#x27;s able to get into smaller places, and in the back of my mouth</li>
            <li>I use this daily at work, 5 days per week, to put this into perspective for you, but I was surprised that I got 2 months of use out of the original batteries.</li>

            <li>More expensive brushes and different technologies may be better, but for me, for now, this was the right choice.</li>
            <li>Product came very fast, I just have to buy new head brush, because the original was very rigid, it scratched my gums a little bit</li>
            <li>I am hoping that the product&#x27;s life will also extend beyond 18 months further enhancing the benefits of this model versus any Oral-B/Braun model that can cost 10 times as much!!</li>
            <li>I love this little battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>(I dont brush my teeth any more than the average person!)</li>
            <li>For the price (little more than the crummy electric brushes that you get at drug and grocery) stores</li>
            <li>After only 2 months of use, the timer function on this new brush keeps kicking in after barely 10 seconds of operation instead after 2 full minutes as stated on the package!  </li>
            <li>Have been using the dual action clean for the last one year ..</li>
            <li>The vigor of the brush movement seems solid, battery life thus far good, and seems to get into tight areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This uses the same brush heads that the the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 uses (several other rechargeable models also use the same brush heads also), so they should be readily available.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!ses the same brush heads that the the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 uses (several other rechargeable models also use the same brush heads also), so they should be readily available.</li>
            <li>So far the battery has lasted well with no sign of slowing down or power loss like I have experienced with other battery operated toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>strongly suggest this model over non-user replaceable batteries of other brands/models.to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>strongly suggest this model over non-user replaceable batteries of other brands/models.</li>
            <li>Just bought this after having used conventional toothbrushes for almost 25 years and wow, what a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>I like this almost a much as my Chargeable Oral-B Professional.</li>
            <li>So far this works very well</li>
            <li>My gums are quite sensitive but this toothbrush has really gentle bristles that don&#x27;t hurt my gums at all.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Another viewer said to clean the goop off of the battery cap and around the sealing rubber O-ring that keeps the batteries dry.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush readily accepted my spare dual action heads.</li>
            <li>I need to spend much longer time to finish brushing as it stops frequently.</li>
            <li>Very affordable, I can buy 6 of these compared to the Braun professional</li>
            <li>I like to use [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]], and they work really well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one knowing I could get a refund if it was difficult to work with the battery compartment, and I was quite happy that it was a breeze to change batteries.</li>
            <li>My teeth are much cleaner than I can manage with an old style manual brush.  </li>
            <li>I prefer this type of electric brush because AA batteries are available world wide.  </li>
            <li>My almost 9-year old daughter has a real problem with staining on her teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my 6 year old oral-b electric brush, and decided on this one after much reseach.</li>
            <li>Depress the latch clips and wipe it clean before installing.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit on the loud side, but for the price, and the fact that it&#x27;s battery-powered, I can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li>I think its key to the success of this product.</li>
            <li>I read reviews that talk about generic replacement brush heads that are poorly made (in China?), and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the potential risk, so I used a coupon and got a great deal on the real thing.</li>
            <li>Up until about a year ago I have always used a normal non-powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>had trouble getting the top off to put in the batteries.  </li>
            <li>my experience, battery-powered toothbrushes usually last more than two years  before they completely wear out, but this one did not last two months.</li>
            <li>If the value of this product was worth sending back</li>
            <li>When I had to replace my Oral B battery powered electric toothbrush that finally died after 4 long years of twice-a-day use, I was really pleased when I found a 2 for 1 sale on the Braun Oral-B Pro-Health model.  </li>
            <li>I always disassemble the old brushes, remove the AA battery, and run it through a La Crosse charger using the full charge-discharge cycle which brings the battery back to life.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it takes two AA batteries and the unit goes a week worth of brushing without charging while the internal battery models get 3 days maximum</li>
            <li>Then it is also useful for people who travel as you dont need to carry different outlets.</li>
            <li>It started out normal</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s basically only useful as a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this electric rotary brush for a few weeks now and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, sturdy, has a tiny but powerful head so it gets into nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>Our dental bills and oral health are easily worth the extra money every two years.</li>
            <li>4 months means that the toothbrush still works, but I find the power weaker, you will notice this when the 2 minute time starts vibrating, it does not vibrate like normal.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice a day for normal brushing.  </li>
            <li>delivers more consistent battery performance\\&quot; which indicates that they made at least one change to it.</li>
            <li>When I called them, they said that that was close to the normal lifetime of the product.  </li>
            <li>The batteries last a long time, so I&#x27;m glad it uses AA batteries instead of needing a charger.  </li>
            <li>combined with daily flossing (with regular dental floss) --and weekly use of my handy dandy Waterpik Oral Irrigator (the one with 6 interchangeable heads including the tiny tooth irrigator--</li>
            <li>have two more of these that we&#x27;ve used for a few years</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use rechargeables any more, because alkalines last much longer, and long enough that I don&#x27;t waste too many, maybe 4+ months, when consistently using this, and not grabbing the manual brush.</li>
            <li>A pair of AA batteries last a surprizingly long time, brushing twice or more a day, in this unit</li>
            <li>I regularly pop out my rechargeable batteries, put in fresh ones and forget about the power for up to three months.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended, especially considering the economical price.</li>
            <li>I read reviews that talk about generic replacement brush heads that are poorly made (in China?), and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the potential risk, so I used a coupon and got a great deal on the real thing.</li>
            <li>The on/off switch is protected under the casing, has a 2 minute timer which many people should pay attention to, the bottom cap stays sealed to keep water out of the battery compartment and it delivers the exact same cleaning experience as the more expensive units.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality plastic, thick rubberised grip, asures that the brush will not fall from a hand.</li>
            <li>One difference I could find is that the good one was made in Germany and poor one was made in China.  </li>
            <li>And a brand new professional series toothbrush is not cheap, and with each purchase I also end up with more and more chargers as it is always the toothbrush that breaks down</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is as powerful as the regular rechargeable ones even with new batteries installed.</li>
            <li>: Don&#x27;t throw away your batteries as they are still pretty good to power TV remote controls, clocks powered by 1xAA batteries, and other low power</li>
            <li>it strong enough compared to the charger version with internal battery?  </li>
            <li>prices vary greatly on this automatic toothbrush, and sometimes the other stores mark the prices up, but it should still be possible to find them on-sale for less-than $12each, so compare prices carefully before</li>
            <li>Every period you need to purchase a new brush head like a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Also, although it&#x27;s cool you can use almost any Oral B brush head which is great design, there&#x27;s a pointy piece use to connect the brush head so unlike other toothbrushes that come apart in a way that allows cutting the size in half for easier transportation, this one kind of resembles a screw driver.  </li>
            <li>and I seem to be getting a lot more use (almost 2 weeks) out of a single pair of batteries than standard batteries</li>
            <li>and I seem to be getting a lot more use (almost 2 weeks) out of a single pair of batteries than standard batteries</li>
            <li>I recommend the brush that has only the single head because it does a better job than the dual heads.</li>
            <li>I only wish that it came with a larger brush head, because the small one seems to take so much more time to get each tooth clean!</li>
            <li>Regular AA alkaline batteries work better but, seem to loose brushing speed within a week’s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The waterproofing grommet causes a extremely tight fit and when you use too much force, it causes the cap to crack.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have quite the same power as a more expensive electric toothbrush, but it&#x27;s good for the price, especially as a backup or travel</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has worked reliably, and if you don&#x27;t need all the features of the more expensive brushes this should do just fine.</li>
            <li>not sure what the more expensive versions can offer you, but I&#x27;m happy with this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I see where this item is no longer available due to customer feedback.  </li>
            <li>am DIY guy and do my own built in battery replacement, but this solution does not last long will not explain technical reasons anymore.  </li>
            <li>constant speed and provides great leverage to reach tough places in the mouth.</li>
            <li>Although not designed for the new brush, it does work, in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even tried yet another set of new batteries, but it still would not work.</li>
            <li>Even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li>When battery compartment was opened after 2 months&#x27; use, new batteries were inserted.  </li>
            <li>Even with new AA batteries, they wouldn&#x27;t function.</li>
            <li>I opened the brand new package and put in the batteries -</li>
            <li>I live off the grid</li>
            <li>Probably have to put 2 new batteries in it about every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>i live out of US.</li>
            <li>so I swapped them with brand new ones.</li>
            <li>I bought another and they&#x27;ve redesigned the new one.</li>
            <li>Can I changed a new one?</li>
            <li>I bought new batteries.</li>
            <li>Tried new batteries still nothing.  </li>
            <li>NEW 2000mAh</li>
            <li>I will get some new batteries and try again; otherwise, I&#x27;ll have to return it and go to a store and get one.  </li>
            <li>B004SB1TD4 Sanyo NEW 1500 eneloop</li>
            <li>Tried new batteries with no sucess.  </li>
            <li>ALSO, INFO ON NEW ONE SAYS IT WILL SIGNAL YOU AFTER 2 MINUTES OF USE.  </li>
            <li>I even tried new batteries &amp; the toothbrush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush since the start of 2011, and it still works like new.</li>
            <li>I also had the oral-b 4000 model (I think it&#x27;s been replaced with a new model)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about the cost of a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and she needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Should probably get a new head though...</li>
            <li>So this year along with goodies that cause cavities I am giving my guys new Oral B electric tooth brushes in their stockings.  </li>
            <li>Bought new batteries</li>
            <li>A new brush replacement and</li>
            <li>it will be like a new product again.</li>
            <li>but then it just quit working even with brand new batteries-&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li>Although not designed for the new brush, it does work, in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, I could set a timer and keep an eye on it, switching to different parts of my mouth as the timer counts down, but this is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Sure, I could set a timer and keep an eye on it, switching to different parts of my mouth as the timer counts down, but this is very convenient.</li>
            <li>The instructions show how to replace the battery but after finding this one I began to wonder if it was worth the time, effort and cost to bring the old one back to life.</li>
            <li>Thus far i have to say it works decently well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these specifically to try to go as light as possible for international travel.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed how this round brush with its brisk circular vibration motion cleaned much better than the old style.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very high powered and I find it superior to other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>used the brand new batteries bundled and then a very old pair of rechargeable batteries (fully charged).</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy this little toothbrush, Your mouth will thank you! :)</li>
            <li>very loud.</li>
            <li>But I discovered, like another reviewer, that the batteries very frequently needed changing.</li>
            <li>this is cheap but it does the exact same job as the more expensive rechargeable versions.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered one previously and it was fine.</li>
            <li>have had expensive electric toothbrushes and other battery operated ones - the best out there -</li>
            <li>The next day on my first use, the toothbrush lost its power before the 2 minutes was up.  </li>
            <li>The first one that we bought did not work but for a short time.  </li>
            <li>My son destroyed the first one (toddler) and we are still using the second one.</li>
            <li>The charge usually lasts more than a month.</li>
            <li>My dentist was trying to sell me his $130 toothbrush (same price on here too), but I thought I&#x27;d try this one out first.  </li>
            <li>We just took a trip for the first time last week since purchasing this.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the same design when it first came out, which must be over 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was low battery</li>
            <li>The other one I kept for almost three years - with a charger - is now about to end its life span, holding only a minute or two for operating, but while it&#x27;s running I guess it provides way more torques than this battery-powered one.</li>
            <li>I thought the first 2 I had just were fluky short life brushes</li>
            <li>I had my first one for over 5 years, and finally had to replace it...</li>
            <li>The descriptions says two AAA batteries which are small and better for travel.</li>
            <li>Probably not a big deal for most people, but it is for me, particuarly with respect to taking extra batteries as the AA batteries are bigger and heavier.</li>
            <li>It uses the same brush heads as the higher end models.</li>
            <li>However, after only a short period of time, I can see how much better it is than my regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep your gums healthy and the rotating head gets into the small nooks and crannies between your teeth and helps make your teeth whiter and cleaner.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely waterproof!</li>
            <li>The head is the same and moves the same but the rechargeable is like a fast, powerful car.</li>
            <li>This one is more like a small, economy car.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is much better than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s better than any powered or manual brush I&#x27;ve ever used in the past.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is much better than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s better than any powered or manual brush I&#x27;ve ever used in the past.</li>
            <li>Uses the same exact brush heads</li>
            <li>I love this small tipped electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Written by AAA cells, but the actual is supporting the AA battery, which made me buy before the AAA rechargeable batteries are invalid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the original double A batteries two months later (although they&#x27;re on their way</li>
            <li>The heads from the previous unit will fit my new one.</li>
            <li>For the battery cover issue, I put a little petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on the gasket, and the cover slides on and off easily.  </li>
            <li>Okay product, but could be made a little more heavy duty to last longer.</li>
            <li>So motor power is held consistant right up until the end when the batteries near complete depletion where finally the motor just stops.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean as well as other oral-B products.</li>
            <li>The little timer to remind how long to brush a nice touch.</li>
            <li>that reason, I love the new battery-powered electric toothbrushes, even if they don&#x27;t seem to last very long before neither new batteries nor a new brush head will bring them back to life.</li>
            <li>The small, round brush makes it very easy to clean all of my teeth all over.  </li>
            <li>For the time being, I use the brush head cover from my old Braun toothbrush for my new Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is far easier to put in new batteries.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot of difference between a new brush and an old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the time being, I use the brush head cover from my old Braun toothbrush for my new Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li>gentle but thorough cleaning with a brush that&#x27;s comfortable for those who have a small mouth.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and was what I expected.</li>
            <li>I finally had to replace the first one because the plastic cap for the battery compartment developed a crack and moisture corroded the contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even my cleaning man - a strong man - had a bit of trouble.  </li>
            <li>The batteries last a good long time, we use rechargeable batteries to keep costs down, no complaints at all!</li>
            <li>Of course, they looked at me strange, as near 40 year old&#x27;s rarely get oral health tools from mom.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>Know that when the batteries get weak, the brush stops with any kind of pressure.  </li>
            <li>It recently tried again to get it to work, and initially I thought it did - but burns through the batteries really quickly so after a couple of days</li>
            <li>I always seem to have a pedestal sink or a very tiny vanity, in an old-fashioned bathroom where only flat surface is the top of the toilet tank, unless I&#x27;m lucky enough to have a window and sill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>..i would have easily given 5 stars for that reason.. going to try to find something a bit more expensive that will last longer..</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is fine, the batteries packaged with it were dead, with an expiration date of 08/2013.</li>
            <li>I Do like the Oral B battery toothbrushes in general; just not this particular design.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and a little bit noisy, but functions well.</li>
            <li>This little toothbrush is fantastic value for money.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend buying this Oral-B Precision Clean Toothbrush which doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Worth every single cent!</li>
            <li>Battery-operated models are sometimes hard to find, and yet they are more practical for taking on your travels.</li>
            <li>The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber.</li>

            <li>Also the bristles of the brush aren&#x27;t that hard which is good for me, but I know some people may prefer harder or stiffer bristles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient，I want to clear my teech iImmediately！</li>
            <li>There are two lock buttons on opposite sides of the handle near the battery cap that you push simultaneously to release the cover with a gentle pull -- no problem.  </li>
            <li>THE TOOTH CLEARLY BEFORE.</li>
            <li>The action of the brush head is plenty fast enough.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used it intermittently and my 7 yr old as well as 3.5 yr old uses it.</li>
            <li>or it was just old, exposed and contaminated.</li>
            <li>Using some coupons I had, I bought two of these brushes, one for my adult son and one for myself.  </li>
            <li>If you are on a budget, you can buy this one, otherwise look at the oral-b professional 1000</li>
            <li>The buttons is a soft on/off and there&#x27;s no click</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old and my teeth structure is prone to hiding food particles.</li>
            <li>Having RA, even the simple act of brushing teeth can be a problem and this makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush for travel, after purchasing the Oral-B Professional 3000 rechargable brush for home.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this battery toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The brushing action is smoother and quieter.  </li>
            <li>I plan to use this toothbrush on vacations and so far it will meet my needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spin power seem like it was design for a 5 year old.</li>
            <li>I have a similar model from Braun which is much stronger.</li>
            <li>Finally, it completely died.  </li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been using a battery operated Oral B toothbrush, but I was looking for another to replace the old one.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely feel a benefit over using a regular brush.</li>

            <li>As a bonus, this provides the type of oromotor stimulation that will ultimately help him to stop drooling so much.</li>
            <li>WOW, this thing is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to replace both the batteries and head only once the whole time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to replace both the batteries and head only once the whole time.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 6 so far.</li>
            <li>Waited a bit to work it into my daily routine, and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Our toddler doesn&#x27;t mind his teeth being brushed as much now.</li>
            <li>This goes directly into garbage since it cannot be returned.</li>
            <li>So far, for me, it&#x27;s been four years.  </li>

            <li>This battery operator brush far exceeds the plug in system.  </li>
            <li>This is much simpler and actually smaller in size.</li>
            <li>It seems to work really well compared to manual toothbrush because you don&#x27;t actually need to move the brush head.  </li>
            <li>When our 9-yr old expressed interest in a powered toothbrush, I immediately orderd another.  </li>
            <li>(And if you use rechargeable AA, then a complete non-issue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I like it so far, no problems.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain thus far.</li>
            <li>a AA x2 batteries.&lt;br /&gt;-Brush head lasts pretty long before replacement, I&#x27;d say about 2 months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush because it uses standard AA batteries and doesn&#x27;t require me lugging the charger around when I&#x27;m traveling.  </li>
            <li>It is nosier than my old one however.  </li>
            <li>I really like this powered toothbrush,it replaces a different brand that I was using.</li>
            <li>I also ordered three soft replacement brush heads one of which I put on as soon as I got the brush, soft is important.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]]&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The speed seems to be much faster than the ones I owned earlier</li>
            <li>also really surprised how water proof it</li>
            <li>I have to use a sensitive brush head with it, or it feels like there&#x27;s a jack hammer in my mouth.</li>
            <li>After eight months the battery compartment corroded and stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>Get the same great cleaning without being forced to drag a charger along when you travel.  </li>
            <li>Wow  </li>
            <li>Our two year old Oral B 5000 is losing horsepower but is 2-3 times stronger than this offering.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel extremely sensitive these days.</li>
            <li>The case cracked on my old brush and water was getting in the battery case.  </li>
            <li>It seems to brush at about 1/2 the speed of our old chargeable Oral-B brushes.  </li>
            <li>So far working well.</li>
            <li>prefer the replaceable battery to the rechargeable units, the battery version last much longer</li>
            <li>I have already gone through the cycle of 2x braun professional series toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Comes with 2 minute timer as with Braun professional</li>
            <li>Toothbrush power is about 50-75% of a Braun professional series.  </li>
            <li>This to my opinion is also safer as I don&#x27;t have electrical wires near the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>So far I have used it about 50 times, 2 minutes each time, without it requiring a battery change.</li>
            <li>like the 2 minute timer that makes sure that you brush your teeth for at least 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, I have rechargeable batteries ready when the current ones are used</li>
            <li>But it is really easier to brush with this thing, especially on the vertical faces of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Seems to have a stronger action that my rechargeable that took a powder after 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>your gums are sensitive, it might also be ideal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My almost three year old now loves to brush his teeth, even by himself.</li>
            <li>The brush is relatively loud compared to a Sonicare, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Your saliva/toothpaste will naturally want to get within every groove of this brush.</li>
            <li>Your saliva/toothpaste will naturally want to get within every groove of this brush.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this works since it just uses aa batteries.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, you need to look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>So far, it has held up to the test of time.</li>
            <li>All of them developed cracks in the batter cover, leading to water corroding the inside and resulting in toothbrushes that stop working.  </li>
            <li>The polarity of the batteries is marked on each side of the bottom of the brush.</li>
            <li>It has removable batteries, not rechargeable fixed batteries inside the case.</li>
            <li>There are no instructions to explain about the timer, but it has the word \\&quot;timer\\&quot; just below the ON button (which doesn&#x27;t have the word \\&quot;ON\\&quot; anywhere near it) and it mentions it on the package as well.</li>
            <li>If you use them correctly your teeth are much cleaner than traditional brushing when you are finished.  </li>
            <li>I did let them know, and they assured me that they&#x27;d take some sort of action, so we&#x27;ll see.  </li>
            <li>Coupled with a whitening toothpaste and mouthwash, it works almost as well as a professional whitening treatment.</li>
            <li>HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]- plus the soft replacement brush heads recommended by some reviewers -</li>
            <li>: An absolute deep cleaning of your teeth and gums each and every time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got improved power and effectiveness compared to my old brush.</li>
            <li>Also comes with batteries which lasted me nearly 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always worried about waking the household when I brush early in the morning.</li>
            <li>I need to try some different heads as the one included doesn&#x27;t seem to get in between the teeth very well.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>(one month, so far and still going well - for 2 people, twice a day) I guess you could use a rechargeable battery</li>
            <li>I bought this for traveling, but it might as well be an old fashioned tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m near retirement age, so I&#x27;ve tried toothbrushes from the covered wagon days (manual) through plug in the wall</li>
            <li>I bought one in the same price range from another vendor &amp; it lasted a whole 3 brushing s.</li>
            <li>So far no problems to mention.</li>
            <li>The spinning mechanism appears to &amp;#34;skip&amp;#34; and the drive shaft doesn&#x27;t perform a complete revolution of the brush head, which renders brushing process</li>
            <li>I was advised to use an electric tooth brush because of it&#x27;s action by my doctor.</li>
            <li>As far as time using it goes, you do each quadrent for aproxamately 15-30 seconds</li>
            <li>really think it should last longer than 6 months.</li>
            <li>the first one I received 2 months ago worked for that long.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t want to have to throw away yet another rechargeable NiMH toothbrush when it quits after a couple of years, I prefer these with replaceable batteries, because I use EverReady lithium ion batteries, and they last a long, long time, more than paying for their premium price.  </li>
            <li>So far I believe this is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Since then the toothbrush stops frequently.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace a failing old unit.</li>
            <li>the old model</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 4 &amp; 6 years old.  </li>
            <li>This model of the Oral-B costs approximately ONE TENTH as much as the top of the line</li>
            <li>This model of the Oral-B costs approximately ONE TENTH as much as the top of the line</li>
            <li>The tooth brush isn&#x27;t as powerful as the rechargeable one (but that&#x27;s what i expected at a fraction of the cost) and the toothbrush head is removable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very similar in most respects except for a few things.</li>
            <li>This scenario sure beats throwing away a $100 rechargeable toothbrush because of a dead internal battery (been there).</li>
            <li>Every that took some strength and, to be frank, this toothbrush isn&#x27;t worth the effort to me when there are several models with a simple screw-off cap to the battery</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not like the expensive one but still has good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans very well in the small tight spaces and the rotating action brushes away food particles nicely.</li>
            <li>Not a substitute for flossing, but definitely goes deeper than a normal brush!</li>
            <li>(I brush his teeth lying down) but that got old quickly.</li>
            <li>The cover easily cracks if you are not super gentle and careful putting it</li>
            <li>Easy to handle &amp; the small INTRCHANGEABLE head keeps him from overdoing ot with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I recognize that this is a fairly complex products, and the heads themselves are pretty high quality, but I do think they could do a better job of keeping the price down.</li>
            <li>Batteries don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped, but this little thing does an amazing job for the price.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to know if the battery compartment remains free from water which was my problem with Phillips which made it necessary to change batteries too frequently.</li>
            <li>we all like to get better price for good quality as i tried other than the original it&#x60;s terrible.</li>
            <li>can brush the tooth clean but the voice a little louder.</li>
            <li>This current version of the old Braun toothbrush looks exactly the same</li>
            <li>The other brushes I&#x27;ve seen in retail stores did not look as powerful as this.  </li>
            <li>With the $2 automatic coupon, the new one is actually CHEAPER than the old one!</li>
            <li>At first we thought the batteries were loose, but this was not the case, as the motor would work if you removed the brush head.</li>
            <li>The fit is very tight on the battery unit, and residue of toothpaste tends to build up around the seal.</li>
            <li>Not very strong or quick movement.</li>
            <li>Batteries last a decent lenghth of time.</li>
            <li>this particular battery operated toothbrush is a very big disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>took two people to open it and that does not work for older people</li>
            <li>It does much more than an ordinary toothbrush especially in removing plaque.</li>
            <li>I have a crown in the back and the thing I like most about this toothbrush is the small head reaches all the around that crown.  </li>
            <li>It cleans my teethes a lot mainly the last ones.</li>
            <li>I ORDERED THIS AS A REPLACEMENT FOR MY OLDER BRAUN TOOTH BRUSH, WHEN THE ON-OFF SWITCH STARTED ACTING UP.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush works well, its powerful and the batteries last for a long time.</li>
            <li>For those who have arthritis or related medical conditions, you might need help opening the battery compartment the first time (and yes, I did).</li>
            <li>I particularly like the smaller brush head and the availability of the five-count brush head pack.</li>
            <li>For anyone who loves and cares for their dog, we highly recommend regular brushings.</li>
            <li>The exposed roots now cause me daily pain, and I have to resort to a specialty high flouride toothpaste to try to remedy the situation.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does clean your teeth, but it is a bit big for a small mouth and it is very noisy.</li>
            <li>I use the old heads to clean the thin spaces in my car interior, stereo, etc (rinse well first to remove any traces of toothpaste)</li>
            <li>It will be so easy for travel -- I&#x27;m tired of carrying the whole kit and caboodle.</li>
            <li>His is still going strong, mine had trouble closing the battery compartment from the start, until finally it cracked and</li>
            <li>The round head cleaned my sensitive teeth gently and efficiently, and the two-minute timer was very practical.</li>
            <li>battery lasts a long time, spins fast, replaceable head, waterproof.</li>
            <li>and once I started I could never go back to a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have considered buying a more expensive brush more that a few times.</li>
            <li>I love the round shaped brush and did not want to go to a different brand with a different shaped</li>
            <li>I continued to use it for several months thinking that it was somehow still better, but a few cavities later I decided to throw it away.</li>
            <li>I tried using the cap from my earlier brush and sure enough, it does not fit.  </li>
            <li>and it was exactly what I expected...</li>
            <li>If I turn it off and wait 10 seconds or so, then turn it back on, it will resume working at its normal speed - but then stop after about 10 seconds of use.  </li>
            <li>These are harder to find intbis are and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>For 25+ years I&#x27;ve always used normal toothbrushes and ever since I&#x27;ve switched to Oral-B precision care line I will never go back.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely NOT like the normal rechargeable type.</li>
            <li>Expected higher pressure.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to make the jump from a normal toothbrush to an electric one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i will ever go back to normal</li>
            <li>draw back with this product i observed is that it operates on normal aaa battery.</li>
            <li>I bought this and used it once a day for a few minutes with baking soda and hydrogen peroxide instead of tooth paste and before the week was out, no bleeding, no bad breath.  </li>
            <li>overall it is even a better brush than the less expensive Crest Spin Brush (which I also like very much) as the smaller head allows for more thorough cleansing of each individual tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like that of some household products where you must press the sides and twist at the same time and it is Very Stiff.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you that just because it doesn&#x27;t cost more than fifty dollars does not mean it is not good!</li>
            <li>Battery runs out a little quickly (or maybe it just seemed like it).</li>
            <li>When typical standard batteries are used the brush&#x27;s performance drops off even when the batteries test at near full.  </li>
            <li>I replaced the head of the toothbrush, thinking perhaps it was some sort of switch keeping me from brushing too hard and the worn bristles were causing it to be set off too easily.  </li>
            <li>as rechargeable NiMH cells last longer due to holding more charge capacity, are cheaper in the long-term, and save you throwing out bucket loads of spent Alkaline cells that would end up in landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then it suddenly died in mid-brush, and new batteries would not get it working again.</li>
            <li>second one about two and just got a new one.  </li>
            <li>if this one only lasts a year, I would buy a new one for this</li>
            <li>Bad: The head doesn&#x27;t vibrate as much or as powerfully as the kind with the battery built in.</li>
            <li>The spinning/vibrating is not as vigorous as my previous electric toothbrush (which was the kind you set in a charger to charge) but this one also doesn&#x27;t form that gross gunky stuff at the bottom like my previous toothbrush did.  </li>
            <li>is not the first instance of the same exact problem happening: my previous Oral-B Battery Toothbrush succumbed to the same faith.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly loud and the replaceable heads can be expensive but it is a cheaper electric toothbrush and considering the health benefit of clean teeth, totally worth it.</li>
            <li>only real gripe with the Oral-B is that the cleaning head is a lot bigger than my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a more expensive model &amp; didn&#x27;t really want to spend the money again.</li>
            <li>The batteries also last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>Not expensive and a set of batteries last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>This isnt the first battery brush I have had in the past, but my dentist noticed that I had been working it too much</li>
            <li>Batteries last just short of a month but the rechargeable one this one replaced lasted about three years and cost about three times as much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not 5 stars only because it lacks a modern voltage controller to keep the same blazing speeds that the disposable Duracells (1.5V AAs) pull, when using a planet-and-pocket-friendly rechargeables (1.2V AA Sanyo Eneloops, another must-have item).</li>
            <li>The only reason I replaced the old one was that the tooth-whitening toothpastes started to corrode the soft plastic.....</li>
            <li>I never successfully got the top off -</li>
            <li>but the extra brushes we had for the old one work on this one!</li>
            <li>first unit was much more expensive than Amazon&#x27;s current price</li>
            <li>advice is to save your money and either invest into something built to a higher standards or try other brand of battery-powered toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Small head assemly makes it easy to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li>as the battery wore down i noticed that it didn&#x27;t pulse as vigorously as it did when they were fresh, but overall it was usable until they completely died.</li>
            <li>I bought this recently (it runs on 2 AA batteries) along with both the professional FlossAction interchangeable brush head and the professional sensitive gum care brush (both in a pack of 3) and use it alternately</li>
            <li>Uses the same refills as the WAY more expensive models, and gives and absolute polish on all teeth surfaces like no manual action can.</li>
            <li>(voltage down from 1.5 to 1.37 or so, but enough to keep powering the toothbrush adequately at the end of the trip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the rechargeable kind and sometimes has trouble starting when I push the button which I find odd.</li>
            <li>I only need to remember to  carry fresh batteries which are already on my packing list for some of my other electronics (eg my mouse).</li>
            <li>I had the first one for years and years and finally broke down and bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I can easily move it over and down into the gumline, then massage the entire gum for as long as I wish.  </li>
            <li>As I said, I wish batteries lasted a little longer, but I guess it&#x27;s a trade off for being so powerful and doing its job so well.  </li>
            <li>It performs just as well as my older, much more expensive chargeable model.</li>
            <li>Second, I found something from the ADA or some other professional organization that reported \\&quot;there&#x27;s not a dime&#x27;s worth of difference in the effectiveness of various brands of electronic toothbrushes.\\</li>
            <li>They handle is designed with a lot of thought; very easy to hold on to all at the same time, there&#x27;s padding to help prevent any spin brush from irritating your teeth from the vibration of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a former dental hygienist with the same dental practice for 44 years,&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this battery operated toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Expensive models don&#x27;t last long enough to justify the price, and they don&#x27;t clean any better than the simpler ones.</li>
            <li>I had no problem opening the battery pack and tried replacing the batteries several times with new ones, but the brush head just sounded like a slow buzz and had no power at all to make my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>I am hoping it was an issue just with my item, and in general this model doesn&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small enough to fit in there mouth and has replaceable brush heads and is battery operated</li>
            <li>They last a long time and my mouth feels so much cleaner than using a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I have never lived in the sort of house or apartment that had counterspace near the bathroom sink -- or anywhere else in the bathroom, for that matter -- on which to keep electrical appliances such as a rechargeable toothbrush or a WaterPik.  </li>
            <li>If you stuck the head into a cup of water and turn it on there is barely any water vibration.</li>
            <li>This unit purchased was a replacement for the same 9 year old model.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT vibrate as much, but the smaller (round) head makes this brush so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>So far the second one has kept going.  </li>
            <li>I changed the batteries back to the old ones and the brush still worked.  </li>
            <li>I have replaced heads frequently and its been using the same set of rechargeable batteries that I switched to in 2012.</li>
            <li>The old Oral-B died after several years.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this toothbrush to any adult who&#x27;s still using a regular brush.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 8 year old son to replace his crappy disposable star wars tooth brush that just didn&#x27;t last at all.  </li>
            <li>I use to have to purchase soft bristles replacements for the already owned two mentioned above.</li>
            <li>My old one needed replacing and I could not find this one locally in the stores.</li>
            <li>When my seventeen year old Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush finally bit the dust (I presume the battery died), and it was time for a replacement, I decided to give the Pro 1000 rechargeable a try.</li>
            <li>This is a personal preference, but the toothbrush is a bit loud for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a definite upgrade from my old, manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Recent electric toothbrush used was the Braun Professional series.  </li>
            <li>Uses the same toothbrush head as braun professional series.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old loves using it to &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; his teeth so that is enough for me.</li>
            <li>(Our last Oral-B electric lasted \\&quot;forever\\&quot; when I followed a program of draining the batteries completely once every one-three months.)</li>
            <li>then it began stopping - or slowing until the brushes were barely moving - after about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>i actually bought this for my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>same vibrating action as the plug in models</li>
            <li>Maybe I expected too much for the price.</li>
            <li>I re-ordered because my old one finally died.</li>
            <li>I chalked it up to having used an Ultrasonic for long too and having forgotten what a normal Oral-B vibration feels</li>
            <li>it is like the batteries are going dead even though I just put in a fresh set.  </li>
            <li>had 3 settings on my old oral b braun for fast, gentle and slow.</li>
            <li>I spent around $100 on an electric toothbrush a few years ago, and it didn&#x27;t last more than a year.</li>
            <li>Good quality batteries should take at least 300-400 charge cycles, if not more.  </li>
            <li>only down side is that the vibration noise is a bit higher in this newer model than the old.</li>
            <li>This is my second one, my first last a very long time though.</li>
            <li>Later I will try various lithium ion rechargeable with it to see how they work as well as new AA batteries I buy.</li>
            <li>Batteries such as the Sanyo Eneloop can be recharged over 1000 times, and if they wear out, you can simply get a new pair of batteries, rather than purchase another toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying a new one in the future.</li>
            <li>But later I realized that it has similar behavior with new battery too.</li>
            <li>This is nothing like the regular brush, it just makes a noise and vibrates a little, but definitely not enough to get your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Comes with battery which is a plus and has been working great for a less expensive option of battery powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not surprised that I needed new batteries before the 2 weeks was up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a number of electric rotary brushes from the cheap to the expensive and this cheap one works about the same as the others – no better and no worse</li>
            <li>and it worked for about half the time as the first charge ...</li>
            <li>So, not sure how this compares to other automatic toothbrushes, but we love them.  </li>
            <li>Other than that seems same as my rechargeable OralB. Accomplishes exactly what I bought it</li>
            <li>I will loose power during mid brushing which is very irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is very little power, and the brush head doesn&#x27;t rotate enough to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>clean the small gaps between teeth, I will recommend you get the following oral-B floss</li>
            <li>I doubt any electric toothbrush would last that long, but the point is that the battery is not the limiting factor in the lifespan of this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I especially like how the brush heads are small and fit to the back of my molars.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>The pricey models cost 5 to 10 times as much as this basic one, but you can bet they won&#x27;t last 5 to 10 times as long.</li>
            <li>It does have a small round head, and I would kind of like a bigger one for broader \\&quot;coverage,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Of course for the $10 price I should had figured it was not a single lithium rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li>I have a similar model from Braun which is much stronger and last very long time (now they no longer make this model).  </li>
            <li>Next time my wife&#x27;s power toothbrush is losing power, I just need to flip open the easy access port on the bottom and insert two common AA batteries.</li>
            <li>It is not really built to last and it stops if you put too much pressure on it.  </li>
            <li>All the rest, were the basic model, starting with the classic smaller white model.</li>
            <li>So far I have gone 3 weeks on the same set of batteries and the motor strength stays the same regardless of battery charge.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money and the round head is dentist recommended because it reaches your back teeth and gums !</li>
            <li>She spoke highly of the other major brand of \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; rechargeable toothbrushes, so I did a bit of research.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant about this toothbrush at first because of the price.</li>
            <li>Works as expected with given price performance.&lt;br /&gt;Liked it with 2 AA batteries, highly portable for worldwide travel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what other people are having trouble with when replacing there batteries, but it is simple and easy.</li>
            <li>My nails are not long, but after more than 10 minutes and 1 broken thumbnail, I finally managed to open the battery case and insert the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have an earlier version of this toothbrush, but apparently it was a nightmare to attempt to replace the batteries on this model.</li>
            <li>so the kids (and I) have no excuse.  </li>
            <li>My nails are not long, but after more than 10 minutes and 1 broken thumbnail, I finally managed to open the battery case and insert the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had trouble with the first toothbrush they sent.</li>
            <li>I find that this inexpensive electric toothbrush does just as good a job as the very expensive brand recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>The batteries that came with this product started to fail after 6 weeks, but the new batteries I replaced them with are still going strong after 3 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give you a deep cleaning all the way down to the gums and below, your teeth will feel incredibly clean and you&#x27;ll throw every other to express you</li>
            <li>this toothbrush does NOT have a cover for the brush head, as does my older battery version, so traveling with this \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush would/should require devising some other type of cover for traveling.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush does NOT have a cover for the brush head, as does my older battery version, so traveling with this \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush would/should require devising some other type of cover for traveling.</li>
            <li>The battery compartment is so much easier to open than other electric toothbrushes (especially if you have arthritis or weakness in your hands).  </li>
            <li>dont belive in negative reviews here mentioning about breaking bottom, you just have to open it very carefully and everything will be ok.)))</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly if you can&#x27;t afford the other ones..</li>
            <li>The bad  thing about the vitality rechargeable and all the older  oral-b I own is that you need to  recharge it after 3-4 days of 2-3 daily brushings.</li>
            <li>About every week, I take off the cap, carefully roll the rubber O-ring off the handle, and clean the goop (toothpaste; dried saliva; etc) from the groove where the rubber O-ring rested, and the cap and batteries go back without issue.  </li>
            <li>but, the power is slower and less intense.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace it because it would take up less valuable bathroom-sink real estate and be easier to travel with.</li>
            <li>I love the small round rotate brush</li>
            <li>I can only imagine after the batteries deplete I will be forced to replace batteries before full use of them.</li>
            <li>It would go to slow but promptly back to full speed.  </li>
            <li>The head of the toothbrush is extremely small, pay a little extra get a better quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li>No much vibration and very loud</li>
            <li>It finally broke when I was not as gentle as usual--trying to get the compartment lid on by sitting it on the counter and pressing down hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very happy with this toothbrush, it does not spin a full cycle, but just vibrates the bristles back and forth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not as powerful as the more expensive models, but I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed as I have been happy with everything I have gotten from AMAZON up to this point !~!</li>
            <li>It uses the same heads and oscillates almost as fast but costs a lot less.</li>
            <li>This AA battery operated brush was less money than replacement batteries for the old unit (provided I could even get the old unit apart).  </li>
            <li>haha, Batteries do not last incredibly long, but if you use rechargeable ones and are CAREFUL when changing them (aka closing the battery section all the way, not making the same mistake twice...)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using other pair of new batteries but didn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may sound a little loud on the video, but really it is not that loud at all, at least it hasn&#x27;t bothered me or my dog.</li>

            <li> I put 2 rechargeable AA (2000 MA) and the thing kept  going and going without a noticeable lack  of power for a good 2 months.</li>
            <li> I thought of using my teeth as gripper, but doubted that would be good for my dental health.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used these toothbrushes for many years and am very happy as to how clean they brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Nice product packaging was also good and is very easy to sue and to store would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Works great, strong toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Keep your batteries strong and your teeth will be happy.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and is easy to maneuver around.</li>
            <li> GREAT BRUSH EASY TO USE &amp; TRAVEL</li>
            <li> Easy to use, did a great job,</li>
            <li> Whiter looking teeth and more pleasant dentist checkups.</li>
            <li> Oral-B is easy to use and does a great job of cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> Cheap and fine, very good!</li>
            <li> it is very good for my teeth cleaning,it worth the price I  paid.</li>
            <li> First electric I&#x27;ve owned...does a wonderful job of cleaning while being very easy to hold and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cheap way to have a electric (battery) tooth brush for travel.  </li>
            <li> It is simply AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It did a great job of maintaining my teeth and gums - a statement confirmed by my dentist and oral hygienist.  </li>
            <li> Works great... can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re so cheap.  </li>
            <li> And the price was amazing.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price is amazing compared to store prices.</li>
            <li> The timer is a nice touch, it&#x27;s starts pulsating when you&#x27;ve been brushing for two minutes.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, nice product for the money.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s nice since I will need it for a trip now.</li>
            <li> I wished these portable toothbruses came with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li> The sonic kind hurts my gum and it tickles a lot as well.</li>
            <li> It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design.</li>
            <li> It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The plug in model is outstanding and this is talmost as good.  </li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they provided a switch to control vibration.  </li>
            <li> except I would have liked it to vibrate faster.</li>
            <li> When I called Amazon they were nice enought to credit my account and send me another one.  </li>
            <li> So , I bought a garbage for my own money.</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I bought it I set it aside for months before I got the courage to try it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Oral-B brushes for my daughter, since she is handicapped and can&#x27;t brush her own teeth.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as good or better..</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It is a good started toothbrush for someone who isn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> I have owned Braun electric toothbrushes for years (the kind you plug into the wall) and all were excellent.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> as i have many aaa batteries around my home, so i have a good gadget to use them now.</li>
            <li> Electric vibration highly effective and when used for cleaning it  </li>
            <li> well i have one of oral-B tooth brush but honestly compare to this one</li>
            <li> 2-minute timer is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I own 2 rechargeable electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> This one works great and the rotating head spins better than most.</li>
            <li> The 2 minute notification feature is nice, too.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is one of a kind.</li>
            <li> This is a nice toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> UNLESS YOU OWN A BATTERY CHARGER.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product, it keeps my mouth feeling much cleaner than it ever did with a manual brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product, it keeps my mouth feeling much cleaner than it ever did with a manual brush</li>
            <li> To me, this is a nice deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li> I have a nice Panasonic battery operated electric toothbrush at home, and decided to get another one for the office use.  </li>
            <li> This really is the best option for those that are considering ordering another Oral B with the charging station.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Nice pressure on the brush</li>
            <li> Nice thing about them is that I can travel anywhere with these and not have to worry about whether my plug will work or if I need a charger converter.</li>
            <li> what can i say about this nice Battery Tooth Brush</li>
            <li> Needed a good electric toothbrush to take better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is nice and portable</li>
            <li> Although it burns through batteries, and the head wears out kind of rapidly</li>
            <li> Waaaay cheaper than the built-in battery kind, as are the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> nice item, works well and no hassle packaging, plus it came on time, and I got to use a 3 buck off coupon...</li>
            <li> and it is really an effective toothbrush that cleans your teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> But it does have gr8 power and works nicely.  </li>
            <li> Gets good power to the head for a good clean.</li>
            <li> I swapped out the brush that came with the unit for the Dual Clean type, and it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The good thing about it is you want to brush your teeth many times a day  because it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush&amp;#34; works great in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> it does a great clean like never before..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless - for the price it&#x27;s a great clean, just don&#x27;t buy it for the timer feature.</li>
            <li> And for the first 58 days that I had it, I loved the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean best of all.</li>
            <li> you run this brush on your teeth the FULL 2 minutes, it will work great for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Great Amazon customer service returned for full refund</li>
            <li> really amazing , very cheep , very good ,</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very good and easy to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush until I got a sonic one (which I now love more).</li>
            <li> Great item, price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great price and arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li> It does everything I need it to do, travels well, AND is very easy on batteries.  </li>
            <li> Then it is very easy to close the battery cover.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy for me, and I don&#x27;t have a lot of strength in my fingers!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> great keeps teeth clean and healthy</li>
            <li> My dentist is happy and I feel like they clean my teeth better then before.</li>
            <li> Receive product very please a very good price.</li>
            <li> Works great for my elementary age child.  </li>
            <li> The product is light and portable, so it is also good for travel.  </li>
            <li> I went with this because it cheap and has good ratings.</li>
            <li> cheap and good version of e-brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect for introducing brushing to  3-5 years old kids.</li>
            <li> Great stuff worth the money.</li>
            <li> This one requires two batteries and takes up more space; however, it is highly effective.</li>
            <li> Even using a worn 2 year old brush head it does the best job cleaning my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to use rechargeable batteries with this.  </li>
            <li> I also ended up getting this one for travel, but found that I actually liked it better, and started using it every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been six months now, and so far it has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> This was by far the best deal I found anywhere.</li>
            <li> So far, excellent.</li>
            <li> It is also nice not to have a unit on your bathroom sink top taking up space.  </li>
            <li> No problems with shipping, received early, best price I could find.</li>
            <li> We change batteries frequently, but brush works sporadically at best.</li>
            <li> Panasonic slim electric toothbrush is also nice, but cost more.  </li>
            <li> Wow its awesome it</li>
            <li> cheap and good to use</li>
            <li> It cleaned the best as far as battery powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It has a timer to help you brush the right amount of time &amp; does a great job.</li>
            <li> Very good, very like, satisfied.</li>
            <li> With this one, the charge lasts a lot longer because the batteries are the best kind and last a lot longer too.  </li>
            <li> My kids love these and the sensitive precision heads are perfect for their 1st set of teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush seems to do a good job in keeping our daughter’s teeth clean as she has no cavities to date.  </li>
            <li> It works great with eneloop rechargeable batteries (more powerful than the expired alkaline batteries it comes with).</li>
            <li> great for traveling without fear of running out of gas.&lt;br /&gt;the speed is substantially slower than the regular rechargeable, and also substantially louder, but it&#x27;s a great backup for travel.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush did a great job and has a great life with regular batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking this will clean as good as a Soniccare vibrating rechargeable brush priced four times this</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with this and am even brushing more.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t for those two major flaws, it would still be a perfect brush.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very reasonable price, quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Very nice productbwith good quality and performance, it is a good choice for anyone wants to get an effective toothbrush with reasonable price</li>
            <li> Great at first, but started replacing batteries every 10 days or so.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it and not as great since.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for the first couple of months.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning and performs consistently even when the batteries are low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a very functional product!  </li>
            <li> Teeth is very important for us</li>
            <li> Not to mention you can clean your toddlers or your own teeth more effectively.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pack and handy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very good and sensitive.</li>
            <li> But it was a huge mistake!  </li>
            <li> It will keep going unless you hit the button if you want to keep brushing for more.  </li>
            <li> Cleans better than sonic.</li>
            <li> more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My kids love them.......</li>
            <li> and my Dentist is glad I started using as it does more strokes than manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my plug in Oral-B toothbrush because it was no longer able to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a satisfied Oral-B electric toothbrush user for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I do hope sincerely they will continue to make this battery-powered Toothbrush because I also have a pacemaker and can&#x27;t use the electric because they put magnets in both the charger and the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There must be better battery powered brushes out there.</li>
            <li> I hung in there and found my dental check-ups were getting better and better.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush</li>
            <li> I love the brush, and the battery convenance.</li>
            <li> Brush heads are cheaper on ebay but saty way from the  cheap kind.</li>
            <li> but this is so much better than any</li>
            <li> I am ordering more.  </li>
            <li> I think everyone should be using this product to better take care of teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I found this product and that there are companies which make these type of products.</li>
            <li> My love with this product continues...</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much more cleaner</li>
            <li> Had this in the rechargeable style for years and was most satisfied.</li>
            <li> After a month of use, can&#x27;t imagine spending more for the wall plug type.</li>
            <li> Before this brush I had a $30 sonicare which was 10 times better and</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B&#x27;s electric brushes for almost 10 years and the results have been phenomenal.</li>
            <li> The cleaning action is brilliant.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> One of the best features is the circuitry that boosts the voltage of your batteries as they age in order to keep the motor speed constant.</li>
            <li> There Is nothing better than brushing your teeth with the oral b toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad another reviewer gave me the idea of getting an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love the way my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> This brush is better than the one&lt;</li>
            <li> I purcahsed the \\&quot;Oral-B Pro-Health Battery Tootbrush \\&quot;  and charged it over night (more than 12 hours).  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare (Philips HX3631/06) vibrates much more, but it hurts when it hits your teeth (and you WILL hit your teeth, because it designed like a manual tooth brush head!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel but would not recommend for daily home use.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it uses rechargeable batteries and have had no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> Even best Duracell alkaline batteries can not last more than 3 weeks with 4-6 mins usage per day.</li>
            <li> This one is even better with the timer and easier to handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a re-chargeable oral-b toothbrush for many years and this product works just as well or better with 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> If mine ever breaks I would not hesitate go and buy a couple more.</li>
            <li> For the price it is being offered, it is perfect tool to have with you, especially when you traveling.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush of all time</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied by this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how that one could  be 10 times better for the money.  </li>
            <li> and I think this one is better than what they make.</li>
            <li> This looked perfect because it used the same heads I already had</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I started with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but eventually it stopped recharging - like most devices you don&#x27;t get unlimited battery life.</li>
            <li> I have had this battery operated toothbrush for more than a year.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> So now I make sure I rinse the inside of the brush and wipe the metal thingy.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself some time and dental bills and get a Sonicare :-)</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush but find myself throwing it out every month or so.  </li>
            <li> This was a significantly more than the Vitality line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it can be cheaper as you&#x27;ll have to pay much more money on those brush heads.</li>
            <li> I love the awesome 2-minute timer that lets you know that you&#x27;ve been brushing for 2 minutes with a slightly different &#x27;vibration&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and its a phenomenal buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly impressed by the build quality and no-hassle usage since the last 4 years.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> so I love that it&#x27;s battery operated</li>
            <li> I have bought many Braun products over the years, and most are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, my tooth brush does a better job.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I think this toothbrush and NiMH rechargeable batteries (purchased separately) are a much better value.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Love the timer.  </li>
            <li> We use this on our toddler and it has made teeth brushing more efficient easier.</li>
            <li> Replaceable batteries are definitely the best choice -- for me.  </li>
            <li> Replaceable batteries are definitely the best choice -- for me.  </li>
            <li> I think everyone should be using this product to better take care of teeth health.</li>
            <li> Oral-B, you have just made a customer for life :)</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush that really works well.  </li>
            <li> This vibrates three times to basically say \\&quot;OK freaky, wrap it up!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> but I thought I was getting a better product.  </li>
            <li> My suggestion is to either purchase a better electric toothbrush or buy a cheaper one that works just as well.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I think it does a better job.</li>
            <li> Just barely okay.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> However, I think the sonic toothbrushes are better in cleaning</li>
            <li> It rotates like the home version just not as powerful and the price was good.</li>
            <li> If you have an outlet and don&#x27;t mind the cord and stand taking up some space in your bathroom, the corded option may be a better choice for some people.</li>
            <li> and we both love it.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel so much more cleaner than a manual brush would.</li>
            <li> I was glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is excellent and I went online to buy the specific head I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush..</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love these battery operated toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Spend money on something better.</li>
            <li> My dentist says ANY electric toothbrush is better than a manual.</li>
            <li> For what the price is, this deserves more than 5 stars considering what your getting:&lt;br /&gt;-great</li>
            <li> I love no longer having a cord getting in the way.  </li>
            <li> makes the kissing process quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I have had it almost a month now and still love it.  </li>
            <li> after 5 years wore out-- had one love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li> One set of AA batteries lasted me more than three months.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll be able to have it replaced more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one is much more way better</li>
            <li> i love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Much better than Crest Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> You can pay couple more dollar to get the one (also from Oral-B) with the timer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Glad it came with a battery</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> features of exchangeable heads make it more versatile as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find this a better option that trying to move the charging station everywhere</li>
            <li> I also find that I brush my teeth more often with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I shall be ordering more, just in case these are phased out and replaced by inferior \\&quot;updated versions\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I do a much better job at brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> and I do a more uniform cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I would love to use this brush if someone could tell me how to turn the stinking thing on.  </li>
            <li> and I love the fact that I can just switch out the batteries with another set of rechargeable AA batteries.</li>
            <li> This is a good product at an economical price.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better for children than adults.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get two more and use them for my daughters.</li>
            <li> It could have more speed.</li>
            <li> I would shell out some more money for one that covers all throughout its head.</li>
            <li> We love them and nothing we know cleans like they do.</li>
            <li> Save your money on this one and put it towards the top end Oral B.</li>
            <li> Well, its ok.</li>
            <li> I just started brushing with it, but it feels like it&#x27;s polished better in a shorter amount of time than my manual.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about picking up some more for my family members.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I got this one.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> They were okay, but they weren&#x27;t Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Also, many of the strictly battery-operated toothbrushes have the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; brush heads.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> love this spinning brushh</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Better dentist checkups now that I am using this and not a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It is better than rechargable ones.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t so sure when I bought it but even after 9 months it&#x27;s still going on strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Items as describe and its more affordable to buy in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Spend 20 more dollars for a spin brush or for one at target that plugs in and charges.</li>
            <li> I just love it  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> At home I use an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush, which I love.  </li>
            <li> I love this Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this model as she can throw it into a bag for a trip and not have to worry about taking a charger with her to make sure that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great tooth brush and it really works well.  </li>
            <li> The product was as advertised, shipping was fast-very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Hope to be able to cheaper.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am reasonably satisfied with those products.</li>
            <li> I love this item...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rechargeable Braun Oral-B brushes for many years.</li>
            <li> also found it to be better if you use the gum massaging brush.</li>
            <li> The Braun rechargeable device use a nickel metal hydride, which is better for storage and use with motors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suspect it would do better with NiCad rechargeable AA.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, and the love it.</li>
            <li> There are probably better battery toothbrushes out there, but they cost a lot more than this one.  </li>
            <li> u speed more money</li>
            <li> As many reviewers already mentioned, I bought this because of the replaceable batteries.</li>
            <li> Like the competitive price, but expect better durability than this, going elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the handle which has a better grip than my electronic Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Price was better than the market</li>
            <li> and I love Prime.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush solved it--and I love the timer feature.</li>
            <li> I have heard that sonic brush heads are much more prone to being a breeding ground for bacteria.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your battery has juice before you take it with you. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> It seems to work even better (more power/rotations) than the rechargeable one I have.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be sure to dispose of them correctly.</li>
            <li> Circular motion gives you better results.  </li>
            <li> Great fast service</li>
            <li> The ones that come with it are Duracell AA&#x27;s, but you might be able to use rechargeable NiMH batteries, which I have not tried (yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I would have paid a bit more for that feature.)</li>
            <li> It would make using the brush a much better experience for first-time users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s more of a marketing tool to get you to buy replacement brush heads more often, but you can use that as a reminder if you prefer.</li>
            <li> It also probably does a better job without brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s more of a marketing tool to get you to buy replacement brush heads more often, but you can use that as a reminder if you prefer.</li>
            <li> It also probably does a better job without brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes really work great.  </li>
            <li> Love their electric toothbrush heads and the job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for 11 or 12 years and love it.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for many months and it still works like the day I opened it.  </li>
            <li> The rechargeable version has much more umph, but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I purchase this device, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> However, this one really works and it comes at a great price.  </li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth much better than manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed love it.</li>
            <li> I love that i don;t have to plug this in to charge it.</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> Have had better.</li>
            <li> The power seems even better with the two AA batteries that come with the brush.</li>
            <li> a side note: If you are trying to move towards more holistic cleansing, you can try Burt&#x27;s Bees All-natural Toothpaste</li>
            <li> Love the portability (no charger required) and the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> Feels much much better than reg tooth brush</li>
            <li> and my kids love them.</li>
            <li> Also love that it has a 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> I love the built-in 2 minute timer</li>
            <li> Affordable, and easily able to change heads every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> these are more the quality of a kid&#x27;s toy IMHO.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B electric toothbrush and always missed it while traveling.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> they love it as well.</li>
            <li> OralB brushheads fit  it nicely.</li>
            <li> battery works better than cordless</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to everyone. :)</li>
            <li> I have a rechargable Oral B Vitality toothbrush that I use for every day use, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> You can spend much more, but why?</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But it is infinitely better than the defective $25 Braun Oral B Replacement Power Handle</li>
            <li> I totally love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> but now I have one that is battery operated for travel, buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love it, it makes me brush my teath longer</li>
            <li> we BOTH love it.  </li>
            <li> So glad I took the chance on it</li>
            <li> Pop the top off, rinse, and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Have used the Oral-B electric toothbrush for several months and it has performed flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> The battery cover seems to better than the ones I have used before.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I now spend more time cleaning our teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have a pair of adjustable pliers with which I was finally able to twist it off.  </li>
            <li> For me this design works better than the larger/longer brush design.  </li>
            <li> more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it was able to indicate 30-second time intervals along with the two-minute indication that it does provide.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> i wish the instruction and having better + and - on the battery compartment would help align the batteries correctly..  </li>
            <li> I look forward to brushing my teeth now more than I used to.</li>
            <li> I love this one for traveling as I don&#x27;t have to worry about bringing a charging stand/charging it.</li>
            <li> wished this one came in more color choices...</li>
            <li> I would buy them for my children as well if there were more colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a cheap toothbrush this should be your choice!</li>
            <li> It is more appealing for my daughter..</li>
            <li> This is simpler, lighter-weight, easier to keep clean, and has so far run perfectly for more than three weeks without a battery change.</li>
            <li> these are very good tooth brushes, the first one lasted 10yrs and was still usable, battery cap split not allowing batteries to make good contact on the old one</li>
            <li> this was for my son and it seems to get his teeth very clean and we love the 2 minute timer on it.</li>
            <li> Very useful!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> far so good!</li>
            <li> It cleans better than the original tooth brush !</li>
            <li> My dentist knew when I first started using the battery Oral B toothbrush, because my teeth were cleaner, my gums were in excellent shape, and the plaque I always get on my lower teeth was much diminished.</li>
            <li> I really liked the feeling it leaves of clean mouth.</li>
            <li> nicely designed for travel wish it had a cover for the brush head to keep it clean when travel.</li>
            <li> The battery gives you about medium power for a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The batteries are amazing and while it costs more money to get started they quickly pay for themselves and the charger many times over their life span.  </li>
            <li> Teeth are nice and clean, battery lasts about 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> as they always have them on-sale for between $9-$14per toothbrush, and while it&#x27;s really good to be able to find them here, consistently like this, on Amazon and</li>
            <li> But for now this is great and highly recommended if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> it is good ,and easy useful.</li>
            <li> Needed an electric toothbrush for my extensive travelling, this was perfect not as strong as the one I have at home</li>
            <li> Wow is this perfect for travel, quick delivery as well</li>
            <li> It leaves teeth very clean and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oscillating bristles thoroughly cleans and massages the tooth, tongue and gum areas of the mouth and leave the areas feeling very clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my teeth feel polished and very clean compared to a manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It was very comfortable on the teeth and gums, as well as easy to hold with the ergonomic grip.  </li>
            <li> and I always thought I did a pretty good job until I got this one.</li>
            <li> Pretty good after a week of use.</li>
            <li> My first oral-b (which I loved) battery died.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Loved this toothbrush when I first received it - a gift from a dentist.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this little toothbrush gives great bang for the buck (a great buy)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this little toothbrush gives great bang for the buck (a great buy)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this product, my teeth are significantly whiter and NO CAVITIES!</li>
            <li> Even my hygienist is happy about my new brush!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> toothbrush does a great job on my teeth and gums, and it feels more like using my old one than the Pro 1000.</li>
            <li> Fully charged batteries can easily get you three or four weeks of use, so you would have to use the toothbrush for more than 50 years before the batteries wore out, anyway.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish the batteries came out more easily.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much &amp; that I brought 3 more for the rest of family.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush isn&#x27;t as good as my regular Oral-B electric toothbrush, but it is a good option for when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li> Honestly that&#x27;s kind of frighteningly fast.</li>
            <li> Works well as a daily toothbrush, definitely better than a manual brush, would be ideal for travel as well.</li>
            <li> nice to know you are really cleaning your teeth, the right way ... this toothbrush does a great and easy job</li>
            <li> Working great so far!  </li>
            <li> To prevent water to leak into battery  cell, i have wraped it up with sticky tape and all seems to work fine :-)</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else to clean my teeth!</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth really clean!</li>
            <li> I like the shape better too; it&#x27;s more hand friendly.</li>
            <li> This newly designed version is great; access to the batteries is easy.  </li>
            <li> I got it because I wanted to be able to experience that after-the-dentist visit clean more than just twice a year.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels as if it gives me an excellent brush &amp; my teeth &amp; mouth feel really clean afterward.</li>
            <li> the price is very cheap, very worth buying</li>
            <li> It is a very cool product.</li>
            <li> I got very good price of these heads from my local Sam&#x27;s Club.&lt;br /&gt;(5)</li>
            <li> It does a very good job cleaning my teeth, and the batteries last quite a while.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very good ,especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a more comfortable grip and a lower pitch \\&quot;whine\\&quot; than the electric one.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the most important.</li>
            <li> so it is much more cleaning and comfortable for him</li>
            <li> best $11 I&#x27;ve ever spent..</li>
            <li> was surprised to find that it included a 3 min timer - a great way to shame you into brushing your teeth for the recommended amount of time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ; electric brushes yet more substantial than the cheap ones ...</li>
            <li> As an aside, we wouldn&#x27;t use a toothbrush this small on our own teeth, but it&#x27;s perfect for our needs.</li>
            <li> So far, working great.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived early &amp; what seems to be great shape.</li>
            <li> We were surprised to discover when we received this one that there was no plastic cover for the head, greatly reducing the usefulness of the brush for traveling.</li>
            <li> So far this is great for work travel.</li>
            <li> But I think the product has gotten more cheaply made over the years.</li>
            <li> Well designed, feels great in the hand, this is a perfect low priced battery operated toothbrush that improves  upon the earlier models at this price point.</li>
            <li> Works well and ideal for packing for extended international travel.</li>
            <li> So far, everything is great.</li>
            <li> So far this toothbrush is working great for us.</li>
            <li> Most importantly it targets my teeth</li>
            <li> and i am happy so far with it.</li>
            <li> I liked the rotating action and effective cleaning as opposed to the Sonicare models I had used for many years.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery good product.</li>
            <li> After cleaning the parts the real fun begins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more economic and more effective to use this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This product really cleans the stain off my teeth, good product.</li>
            <li> Good price, works very well.</li>
            <li> FOR GOOD HEALTH.THE HEADS FOR THIS TOOTHBRUSH ARE QUITE REASONABLE</li>
            <li> No problems at all - though I do miss the Oral-B, which seemed to fit my hand better and was more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> It really does a good job for the price.</li>
            <li> you can clean your teeth better because you can apply more pressure but this unit did work just fine for the price.</li>
            <li> What is interesting about this one is that it tells me when to stop brushing, after two minutes it sends a pulsed signal that you are done, convenient and very useful.</li>
            <li> Works nicely and the price is right</li>
            <li> the two minute timer is excellent and it really cleans your teeth when used properly, which is very easy to do.  </li>
            <li> Just like with people, it helps keep their mouths clean, their teeth from getting cavities, their gums from becoming inflamed, and their bodies healthy.</li>
            <li> Good little toothbrush for great price.</li>
            <li> My dentist even comments on how clean my teeth :)  </li>
            <li> I love the Oral B electric toothbrush line, my teeth get really clean.  </li>
            <li> So far both work perfectly and get my teeth much cleaner than manuals.</li>
            <li> Good price, strong action, convenient for travel, no wires to tangle or display on counter top.</li>

            <li> and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity, but it seems just about as strong as the plug in version.  </li>
            <li> But the strength of the brush rotating is not as strong as the rechargeable versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the efficiency of the toothbrush in getting to all cavities in the mouth, gentle yet effective.  </li>

            <li> Still going strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no where near as good as my Vitality, but it&#x27;s not terrible either.  </li>
            <li> and that is still going strong too.  </li>
            <li> I liked it very much.. am beginner with this electric tooth</li>
            <li> Love the special 2-minute timer feature that lets the user know when two minutes of brushing have elapsed.  </li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning - as good as the rechargeable (more expensive) variety.</li>
            <li> Normally, I have had good luck with this brand.</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush at first.</li>
            <li> I used a battery operated brush for the first time and I liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> true :)</li>
            <li> down the best one.</li>
            <li> Such a great toothbrush, what I love is how it feels like it is cleaning in the part you can&#x27;t reach with a regular toothbrush, it&#x27;s a great purchase</li>
            <li> Needed a new electric toothbrush and Oral B is always a good bet.</li>
            <li> A brand new brush is always good.</li>
            <li> really good for a new user as me.</li>
            <li> This is the best powered toothbrush for less than $20 period.</li>
            <li> Runs just fine on AA NiCads, charge lasts about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I checked charge on batteries, it was fine.</li>
            <li> it works fine however the brush part does not have a cover</li>
            <li> Fine.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re able and willing to spend a bit more check out</li>
            <li> It is still fine though.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold, signals when two minutes have passed and is easy to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> this works just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a fine toothbrush and works well.  </li>
            <li> But on this model, it feels fine with the lower</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these for over three years, and it is still working fine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind this at all because the 2-minute duration works just fine to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a fine dental instrument.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works fine, as described, stops every 2 mins to signalize about time to change the sides.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s version works fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s work fine &amp; Help me to protect My Teeth</li>
            <li> The timer keeps us honest! :) Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t eat battery power too quickly!</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, but it performs well and cleans my teeth better than adequately.</li>
            <li> Super value!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is easy to clean, and the batteries are easy to access and change.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is incredibly inexpensive and works better than my previous rechargable Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, yet very comfortable on my teeth.</li>
            <li> In my equipment, Duracell Alkaline fit perfectly and the compartment closes tight.</li>
            <li> so you can take the ones you use at home and still use this wonderful little brush.  </li>
            <li> The power is nice and strong which I love, other folks may not be so thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable, quiet and does a great job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I bought cheap foil stickers for my daughter to decorate it with and she loves brushing with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase as this low price.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a carrying case available for purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li> When a dental tech recommended one, I purchased this -- the cheapest available.  </li>
            <li> Yes filled my expectations it whizzes around faster than an electric one.  </li>
            <li> it is cheap electric toothbrush after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a bit more powerful</li>
            <li> really enjoy the feeling.</li>
            <li> and I liked it so much I ordered one for myself.</li>
            <li> I needed one that my brush-heads would fit on, but that didn&#x27;t need to be plugged in to the wall.  </li>
            <li> Will try it for a while more before deciding if it is worth buying the heads for it.</li>
            <li> Teeth are in fantastic condition-</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have stayed in fantastic condition since I got this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have stayed in fantastic condition since I got this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s the cheap vitality).  </li>
            <li> It is also good that more different brush heads are available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, for the price, this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for almost a year and really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> yesterday it just started skipping and today it won&#x27;t even work, makes a buzzing sound but nothing else.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say go for a cheap one like this.</li>
            <li> Use it over the sink or while wearing house clothes because if you brush before you&#x27;re ready to go out, you will dribble toothpaste water on your nice clothes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this brush is great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> the ORAL B PRO-HEALTH my teeth get a smooth and through cleaning.</li>
            <li> i have own this items for about 11 months now and it is still working really well for me</li>
            <li> Cheap electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very cost effective</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that unit is more powerful, or if it&#x27;s just the 3D effect they advertize, but I find that the vibration is too aggressive.</li>
            <li> The timer is great as well is the battery life span, but availability to change toothbrush heads is an enormous advantage.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and efficient</li>
            <li> this brush fit the bill for my wife.</li>
            <li> Works well, although the models with rechargeable batteries are a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in my hand</li>
            <li> I would recommend this over the cheap $5 motorized brushes you can buy in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> i will be doing this later on happy hunting</li>
            <li> Bought this one for a summer home, since I like the one at the primary home.</li>
            <li> Also, the fit of the toothbrush onto the handle is tighter.  </li>
            <li> and they fit either handle.</li>
            <li> and they fit either handle.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great if you travel and are use to using a similar Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush because I accidentally ordered replacement heads that didn&#x27;t fit the one I had.</li>
            <li> and it is comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush and a different variant for my children, work great</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a cheap electric toothbrush for my fiancee that worked well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> ok but not as powerful as i had hoped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really great around the molars - sides and back.  </li>
            <li> As of June2015, Sonicare Essence battery no longer available from Amazon and from Sonicare official website&#x27;s Support Q&amp;A section states that it can use Proresult brush head</li>
            <li> Besides the replaceable batteries, it&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> cheap battery  toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had been using a different brand electric timer brush and thought I was getting a great cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar for a power toothbrush as my personal experience with them hasn&#x27;t been good</li>
            <li> Once going does a good job; holds up well so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is far superior to the disposable toothbrushes that are out there.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Far superior to the rechargeable models.</li>
            <li> do not appreciate the way the manufacturer produces this product --they should be more responsible to make the product more reliable.</li>
            <li> and, so far, I have not found a good battery option for it yet.</li>
            <li> I use the flossing action heads and so far, I think this is a perfect combination of form, function and price.</li>
            <li> works good so far, purchased the refills we&#x27;ll see how they do too</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> first problem is that I tried buying toothbrush heads online, and they were counterfeit heads that broke very quickly!  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li> The single most important feature is the built-in timer, which makes a remarkable difference in one&#x27;s brushing habits (and outcomes).  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund before the 60-day deadline (I bought mine at CVS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am sure to get the right one.</li>
            <li> My dentist/dental hygenist commented on how good and clean my teeth were when I went in for my most recent cleaning.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> So it is very useful for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I had a full blown electric one years ago and loved it, however I spent $99 on that one and only $9.99 on this one and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Cleans good and not very harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean and plaque free.</li>
            <li> it is easy, cheap, and good enough.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and really helps with his permanent retainer.  </li>
            <li> If using AA batteries really bugs you, use rechargeable ones, but it&#x27;s a very easy and low-risk way to test whether you like using one or not.</li>
            <li> This power brush is perfect for my mouth which is small.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement to my original Braun.</li>
            <li> Oral B is the reason , at 68 , I still have all my original teeth with no cavities</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brush for about 3 weeks twice a day on the original batteries with plenty of power.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant improvement since using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The gives it a heavier weight, although you do get a more consistent motor strength.</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say that the Oral B Electric toothbrush has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful !</li>
            <li> ---ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> Gives you that fresh out of the dentist feeling every time i brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to tell them how I dislike their original design.</li>
            <li> Still on the original battery.</li>
            <li> and I am still on the original batteries.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price but is not as smooth in motion as the rechargeable Oral-Bs.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> These are the best electric toothbrush heads in my opinion as they are small and quite functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g.</li>
            <li> worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve ever used one of the higher end Oral B toothbrushes, you&#x27;ll be able to tell that this one is a lot weaker.</li>
            <li> Certainly worth it!</li>
            <li> I love it so much I ordered another one as a gift for my brother!</li>
            <li> After getting this for like 10 bucks it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It is great for traveling, has a long battery life and you don&#x27;t ever have to wait for it to charge.  </li>
            <li> and I have yet to use up the two original batteries it came with.  </li>
            <li> I liked my first electric Toothbruch very much.</li>
            <li> I truly liked this brush, but cannot afford a new brush every couple of months or so.  </li>
            <li> I put my own new batteries in and nothing happened again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean and polished after every use.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is just what kids need to get a really clean set of teeth.</li>
            <li> We use the best rechargeable batteries for this and, so far, still on the initial charge.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel so clean with each use.  </li>
            <li> and I can take this with me and know my teeth are getting really clean even while I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li> 1- Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush is defective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Oral-B Precision Clean line for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the dual clean toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> I ended up switching them out since the dual clean heads are compatible with this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> you value clean teeth, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> There is no way that brushing by hand can duplicate the cleaning action of an electric toothbrush, but many electric brushes cost more money than I want to spend.</li>
            <li> My teeth feels amazingly clean.</li>
            <li> Great usage, it is really efficient and is not too loud.  </li>
            <li> makes your teeth clean with buildup of plaque,larry</li>
            <li> I would try to clean up the seal area as build-up occurs.</li>
            <li> SO far my parents love it and want to buy more for their friends.</li>
            <li> I also try to keep the handle clean so that crud does not build up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just ordered a replacement for the Oral B Precision Clean brush I ordered over 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li> We own several electric tooth brushes and we like them all and feel that they do an outstanding job in cleaning our teeth.  </li>
            <li> I use it when I don&#x27;t want to use my quicker manual brush and it seems to clean my teeth just as well.</li>
            <li> B002HWS9FW Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li> , you can prevent the battery seal from cracking by routinely keeping your toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li> I clean the seal around the battery case every 2 weeks or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you can prevent the battery seal from cracking by routinely keeping your toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li> I clean the seal around the battery case every 2 weeks or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth also feel ultra clean.</li>
            <li> Simple is better and just as effective.</li>
            <li> So I thought for under $10, I&#x27;d give the Oral-B Pro-health precision clean battery</li>
            <li> COULD&#x27;T CLEAN</li>
            <li> It works and always leaves ones teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Gives your teeth a dental visit clean.</li>
            <li> We switched from the $5 sonic toothbrush to the Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Been using Precision Clean toothbrushes for years now</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> i always feel clean.</li>
            <li> believe me you will know when you have completed each area and at the end you will know your teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> and my dentist recommended it to help clean my gums.  </li>
            <li> It works great for occasional use, but it isn&#x27;t as powerful as the rechargeable models.</li>
            <li> and I am still using my Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Electric Toothbrush</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so great, love it everyday.</li>
            <li> I feel that it gets the job done, however I would probably recommend also purchasing the oral b dual clean replacement brush heads as well</li>
            <li> I love the automatic timer as I always thought I was brushing my teeth for a long time, but this is for sure better and a longer time.  </li>
            <li> if one keeps it in the mouth for the two minutes and moves it over all of the teeth during the time.&lt;br /&gt;There are many different brands on the market, however this is less costly than many and if used properly does an excellent job of providing good dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> but there are certain areas that my manual brush used to clean better.</li>
            <li> great thing about this brush is that it has the same great build quality but costs half the price.</li>
            <li> Many years ago a colleague recommended getting a braun electric toothbrush (he insisted on Braun) and after having strayed into other brands and thrown them away because they are not as good, I am sticking to Braun toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> So you get optimal performance right to the end of set of batteries!</li>
            <li> and it does a good job with enough power to have them feel clean without going over and over.</li>
            <li> It perfectly brushes hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still great, but be careful if you are buying replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of battery-powered Oral B electric toothbrushes, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The first one is lasting well and doing a great job.  </li>
            <li> Why on earth would anyone spend more than I spent for this great toothbrush unless they have a real fixation and money to throw away.  </li>
            <li> delivered as expected; works great.</li>
            <li> Pretty good no issues so far.</li>
            <li> I love it, my teeth and gums looks so much healther now  </li>
            <li> it always gets my teeth super clean.  </li>
            <li> Like the 2-minute timer&lt;br /&gt;Con: it is kind of loud</li>
            <li> design of this brush is superior to the similarly priced Sonicare model.</li>
            <li> the low price and the good quality</li>
            <li> In addition, it is more gentle on my gums yet still cleans well.</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth super clean and freshens my breath.</li>
            <li> Great product so far, I am finding this product is more effective than usual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Good solid toothbrush</li>
            <li> Overall, for the price I paid for it, I think it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do thorough nice cleaning action, I almost feel like I&#x27;m using a manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> true workhorse - both the unit and the brush-heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good, basic brush that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The batteries that came with the product lasted the full 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The kids love brushing their teeth again, thanks to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> She loved it, brushes her teeth for a longer time each time so I am saying it is a big hit.</li>
            <li> and I hope to have good news the next time I go to the dentist!</li>
            <li> I use the battery model to replace the rechargeable model and it is as good as the prior model and give me the flexibility of not needing to plug in a recharger.</li>
            <li> Good for a second unit to take camping.</li>
            <li> I will back for this.thanks for the good service.</li>
            <li> it makes my mouth feel super clean..</li>
            <li> wish the battery lasted longer, but overall good</li>
            <li> The good thing is it is compatible with several Oral-B brush heads.  </li>
            <li> timer ensures that you brush for a full 2 minutes</li>
            <li> I bought it, and it works very well, better, in fact than the rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li> I feel for those who bought earlier versions of this toothbrush, but the good news is that the company listened to the complaints and made changes.</li>
            <li> It honestly feels like I&#x27;ve just came back from a professional cleaning, and even my dentist told me I&#x27;m doing a good job</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good quality electric brush that didn&#x27;t have to be charged daily.  </li>
            <li> My son uses it and it has a timer that help him to brush for a full two minutes.</li>
            <li> so I have some sense of what&#x27;s reasonable and this seems to weigh significantly more.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> It makes a big difference cleaning wise</li>
            <li> The brush is itself is a good size and can reach in between the teeth and the entire surface of the tooth.</li>
            <li> Some are as much as $210 or more.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad trade off at all.  </li>
            <li> This is not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Head brushes are easy to find and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Very good but very slightly under powered toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I are pleasantly surprised and happy with our new toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how much power this toothbrush has compared to previous AA cell toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Impressed with the overall quality, very sturdy and more than enough power when charged.  </li>
            <li> This one is as good as many times more expensive ones &amp; it lasts many years.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the product is great, it is just that faulted button that is the problem.</li>
            <li> A great natural-whitening and tooth re-mineralizing powder to supplement your all-natural toothpaste-- and a great way to save money on those messy whitening strips and help the environment in the long term as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep one at work for after lunch brushing and my mouth feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> the do keeping my teeth clean and my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> My mouth and teeth feel fresh and thoroughly clean when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for travel since it has batteries, while my Phillips SonicCare eSeries uses a charger (great for home, but not so much when using internationally if you don&#x27;t feel like bringing a converter).  </li>
            <li> You will be amazed at how much cleaner your teeth are from this brush and it works just as great as ones that have a bigger price tag.  </li>
            <li> With this brush I can give more attention to any particular tooth easier too.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job, not only cleaning but massaging your gums.</li>
            <li> The speed &amp; pressure is good, and does NOT stop or slow on applying to teeth or my own finger.</li>
            <li> The strength is adequate.  </li>
            <li> Most electric toothbrushes will simply shut off after the magic 2 minute mark has been reached.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to convince you that this electric toothbrush is great and economic for human use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Just make sure you get a top name battery to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Wife and I share and love using it together (with different brushes:-))</li>
            <li> There is a timer - it works in a way where it pulses when the two minutes are up, then if you want to keep going it will stop after 3 quick pulses.</li>
            <li> It cleans quickly and along the gums.  </li>

            <li> quickly delivered.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush too quickly</li>
            <li> I tend to brush too quickly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to throw out and replace a product like this so quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used in my life, and I&#x27;m so glad that I used this one first.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Senzacare TravelSonic Electric Toothbrush is several dollars more than Oral-B, but it is much better in style, size, and noise.  </li>
            <li> So for the price I figured lets order another and maybe get lucky.</li>
            <li> This one works better and German craftsmanship is better than made in China.</li>
            <li> love that the new one is exactly the same as the old one, does a great job and my mouth appreciates it!</li>
            <li> That always seems to be so very funny to</li>
            <li> My very first electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase and will replace it with the same model when this eventually wears out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical, it works very well, its easy to use and clean and you can use it anywhere in the world that has AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re up for it, you can make your own cleansing tooth powder with equal parts Baking Soda, (freshly ground) unrefined Sea Salt and Calcium Magnesium powder and voila, all-natural Re-Mineralizing tooth powder!</li>
            <li> Just as good as my own more expensive rechargeable model.</li>
            <li> I have used oral B for years and always have had good luck with them and a long lifespan.</li>
            <li> In contrast, using this model with a pair of good rechargeable batteries will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I checked my review for accuracy and thought I&#x27;d add my thoughts that I still feel good about this purchase after so long.  </li>
            <li> It would have been better if Amazon offered a superior product and charged more, instead of cluttering our lives and dumps with poor quality items.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the battery-powered version of the one recommended to me by my dental hygienist (which was the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000).</li>
            <li> Just make sure to keep the actual brush clean and remember to remove batteries if you are traveling!</li>
            <li> This version has the benefit of being able to use new batteries.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and the 2 minute timer is really helpful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really cleans out every crevice and is easy to navigate to every corner of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I think battery operated things only can hold up so long and in this case 6 months is the best you can ask for these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and strong and cleans my teeth and gums VERY well.  </li>
            <li> WORKED VERY WELL AND EASY ON THE GUMS.DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> The timer is perfect for trying to get your kids to brush long enough.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it at first, but when I had to change the batteries I couldn&#x27;t get the cap back on.  </li>
            <li> think so far this is hands down the best deal for a power/spin brush.</li>
            <li> With this one, the regular brush head works great (same kind I used for years on the older model), and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sand blasting my teeth.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my second one, well pleased with my $12 investment 14 months ago!</li>
            <li> This brush was bought about the first of July and, in November end, I&#x27;m still using it two times a day on the original batteries that came with it.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and what I ordered!</li>
            <li> My first Oral B battery toothbrush, just like this one, has lasted for 7 years, with replacement heads and batteries of course!  </li>
            <li> Highly Suggested!!!  </li>
            <li> Not quite as powerful or as fast as our home rechargeable unit, but a very adequate substitute at one sixth the cost.</li>
            <li> I will definitely brush my teeth more often now that it&#x27;s so easy to do.</li>
            <li> I will definitely brush my teeth more often now that it&#x27;s so easy to do.</li>
            <li> This one worked far better than the electric version I had and the batteries last an amazingly long time, It is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have to agree -- after the first time I used this one, my teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li> Strange as it may sound, we use this on our dog&#x27;s teeth because it&#x27;s small and fits easily in her mouth, and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great deal for an inexpensive little tooth brush...</li>
            <li> Great little brush.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little solution.</li>
            <li> Fast and free shipping, no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> drspite so many poor reviews, this is the perfect toothbrush for my 9-year old.</li>
            <li> The battery enclosure is rubberized, stays water proof and the whole toothbrush feels sound and well made.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use and traveling.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap, and since it runs on AAs, it&#x27;s very portable.</li>
            <li> If our 4 year old granddaughter had been here, she  would have been able to take off the childproof cap for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful just like my electric Oral B toothbrush that needs recharging every week.  </li>
            <li> I tried fresh batteries with no difference.</li>
            <li> We have been screening for an electric toothbrush for our 4.5 year old son for quite a while, and my son simply love this one.</li>
            <li> The portibility of the unit with battery power is the main feature I like along with the cost and easy brush head replacement.</li>
            <li> It came as expected, on time and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Fresh batteries were inserted correctly, as they worked when sufficient hand pressure was placed on the compartment.  </li>
            <li> Works well, useful for travel</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the cleaning as is my daughter&#x27;s dentist when we take her in for professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> You get far more than what you pay for with this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottom-line: the Oral-B Pro-Health Battery line is a powerful, affordable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Brushing teeth is fun</li>
            <li> Nice design that fits comfortably in the hand and does not slip around when wet.</li>
            <li> Brother says its worth every penny</li>
            <li> This is a nice toothbrush which I bought to replace an Oral B rechargeable with a similar brush head.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth this brush is still good just do not use a toothpaste with SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) OR use a sensitive toothpaste like Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li> Brush head seems faster and more powerful than my old one.  </li>
            <li> It needs more power action to the head so it can remove particles from my teeth.</li>
            <li> May be useful for kids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad that these toothbrush are sold directly by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush just because I needed to spend a bit more to get free shipping, and my last electric one was worn out.  </li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Brush head alone makes it worth a backup TB.</li>
            <li> B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] would be a better choice.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth it.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels so fresh too.  </li>
            <li> This has more operating time compared to Braun professional series.  </li>
            <li> Worth keeping one in the glove box of the car .</li>
            <li> Its worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like a powerful motor.</li>
            <li> ; most electric toothbrush batteries end up going out completely after a year or two.</li>
            <li> Its nice that it accepts the OEM replacement heads that one can purchase in the multi-pack at Costco especially when the go on sale once a year or so.</li>
            <li> Works better than my old one battery one.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Received as expected and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Good alternative option if electronic brushes seem expensive - good battery life</li>
            <li> Love it my old one died</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough and you don&#x27;t have to worry about cables outlets which comes in handy when traveling</li>
            <li> I use this as a supplemental brush &amp; so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I had wondered if this one would be as powerful as the plug-in version, and it does seem to be.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I also bought a pack of the soft head replacement tips and glad I did.</li>
            <li> That being said this is a really nice unit for the cost, has a timer built in, and the head is smaller than the spin brush type</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s every bit as powerful as the one I use at home.  </li>
            <li> I never thought a battery-operated toothbrush could be so much fun.  </li>
            <li> Investing in a rechargeable battery system is economically effective if you brush regularly.</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> this is a strong unit and works real good and seems to be solid, it does a very good job, the only drawback is the size of the brush, quite small but so far i really like it.</li>
            <li> I would guess not as strong as a brand new charger version, but better than an old one.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, it&#x27;s much better than the other electric toothbrush I had</li>
            <li> An essential for healthy teeth, rarely found at a price like this - go for it!</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smaller brush head, so I&#x27;m going to probably opt for the dual clean that fits this brush, but besides that I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> (make sure they&#x27;re from a reputable seller due to fakes on the market).</li>
            <li> This model is particularly well suited for travel but of course it will work fine at home.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, have used some of their brands earlier and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The head wears out pretty quickly for my usage.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, but very effective and not cheap.  </li>
            <li> You will need to clean out the build up it accumulates inside the head at least each 2 weeks if you don&#x27;t already take great care of your toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean and replacement brushes are not that much more than standard tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Oral B has other battery operated models but not as good.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and it is useful!</li>
            <li> as other have say its good if u want to be abel to use alot of battery or spend alot on recharable battery</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good enough too, if you want to use it for home use - as long as you&#x27;re ok with wasting batteries or swapping it out with a rechargeable AA.</li>
            <li> AA batteries are pretty cheap pretty much anywhere!</li>
            <li> It was delivered right on time.</li>
            <li> Vibrates gums and stimulates them to behave right.</li>
            <li> You have to squeeze both sides of the handle in the right places to force the cover off to enable battery replacement.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price was right and it was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Itis just the right size and shape for me.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> The grip fits right but the on off switch can be tricky when your hand is slippery with toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I like it and think its just right for me</li>
            <li> Since the batteries come packed separately and are not installed inside the device, I had to remove the cap to insert the Duracell brand AA batteries before I could use it, so I got to test that part out right away.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is right on the money when it comes to cleaning out the crevices between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> But the price is right.</li>
            <li> Just right for my kids.</li>
            <li> I replaced the AA batteries once without a hitch, and the head is easily swapped out for new replacements.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of power but still works really well to remove plack and clean teeth.</li>
            <li> It can clean teeth very well.</li>
            <li> A full charged hybrid batteries will last more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> and it really gets your &amp;#34;pearly whites&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
            <li> This newer version looks the same as before, but I noticed that the batteries went in more easily and the compartment was much easier to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it runs off two double a battery that lasts about 6 months &amp; are very easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But only if you have VERY strong hands.  </li>
            <li> The spinning &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; is highly maneuverable in your mouth, and problem ares can be accurately targeted to remove stains and food particles.  </li>
            <li> Love that you can replace the batteries and the brush heads instead of just pitching the whole thing and buying a new one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s makes  sense to pay more less, for a better product.</li>
            <li> I used these brushes for many years and have lasted two to more time but this order from Oral-B stop working in less than a month and can not be retornar.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this particular toothbrush for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Small head works great for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of the Pro-Health motor, it&#x27;s pretty powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how much better a brushing job I am able to do with the smaller head.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and use these products together and my smile is becoming more stunning everyday.  </li>
            <li> I liked it enough initially to buy two more</li>
            <li> I have had several different brands and this is by FAR the best.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush as much as the older model it replaces ONLY BETTER.  </li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a good toothbrush, I like the round brush it gets to the back teeth better to clean and brush</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Electric Toothbrush, for several years and for the money, it is worth the cost and provides a superior teeth cleaning than just using a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> for the price, this brush seems to do as good as I believe any of the high priced rechargeable brushes do for a huge chunk of change less.</li>
            <li> Keeps my mouth clean and I&#x27;m able to really make sure my teeth located in the far back of my mouth are able to be properly touched and cleaned as well.</li>
            <li> This was a little more, but I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> works great like to rotate with my other toothbrush leaves with that clean mouth battery life is good not great</li>
            <li> Since these are relatively cheap I have just stocked up on them and when the battery needs changing I don&#x27;t even bother to put myself through the frustration I toss them into the garbage and get a new one.</li>
            <li> We use Sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries and they do a great job and last longer that even the regular batteries.  </li>
            <li> Had previously for years and loved it&#x27; .It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by how good it is, especially considering its price.</li>
            <li> and I think this company&#x27;s handling of this situation creates extra waste by having me throw out a perfectly usable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I think this company&#x27;s handling of this situation creates extra waste by having me throw out a perfectly usable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Was replaced super fast.</li>
            <li> So far this Oral-B is still going strong on the first pair of batteries for over 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Makes teeth cleaning for us lazy folk easy and effective.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as those high dollar brushes ...also small sleek design makes for easy traveling .Oral</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush very much.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband, who likes it very much.</li>
            <li> With the charger version the strength depends very much on the usage of the battery (or the motor?).  </li>
            <li> It was priced very reasonably too.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush for a very reasonable price and have been astounded at the results.  </li>
            <li> i like it very much</li>
            <li> seems the brush is small,but it is fine so far</li>
            <li> My tooth were never this clean before, when i was using normal brush.</li>
            <li> does not clean like I thought it would but does a fair job</li>
            <li> old Braun toothbrush lasted me for over 2 decades, despite occasional abuse, and was absolutely perfect in every single way.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My understanding is that you can put different brush heads on this one, but just the precision clean head compared to the dual-action head is a huge improvement in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Especially when all the others had very spotty reviews as they would die and stop charging or just weren&#x27;t very strong etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning well in hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It requires 2 batteries, and makes a loud noise and huge vibration.  </li>
            <li> If this one was for use at home I&#x27;d give it only three stars, for its less than stellar power, but since it&#x27;s for use where the rechargeable won&#x27;t be suitable, good enough is fine and for this sort of travel I give it four stars.</li>
            <li> only things I don&#x27;t love deals with the brush head.  </li>
            <li> A regular toothbrush probably does a better job than this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I actually like this brush better.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and it lasted way over a year without even having to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> exactly what I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li> When this one wears out, I will probably upgrade to a higher end rechargeable version.</li>
            <li> Better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The quality is the same as the rechargeables, but it is even better.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I am running mine with Eneloop rechargeable AA batteries which last more than two months per charge, with about two minutes of brushing per day.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I can get a more thorough brushing with the circular head because it does each tooth individually.  </li>
            <li> I do fill like it cleans my teeth better then when  I use a regular tooth brush .</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than the rechargable model.</li>
            <li> If I had purchased this brush prior to purchasing the rechargable model, I would have stuck with this instead of spending much more $ on the rechargable.  </li>
            <li> Ordered several more for Xmas gifts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the first real power tool that we give him and he enjoys to use.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I first received it, the power seemed anemic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ony had it for 2 days, and it has worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner since I started using this puppy!  </li>
            <li> light not heavy</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping this product will last longer and be more convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li> I used a manual toddler tooth brush until Boys&#x27; first dental visit at 20 months.</li>
            <li> It shook my hand as much as Oral-B&#x27;s pulsar brush line and is about as powerful as a video-game controller vibrating motor.</li>
            <li> The cleaning action is fantastic.</li>
            <li> First one lasted about 3 years,</li>
            <li> Really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first battery toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Most have fancy schmancy heads that are too big for me.</li>
            <li> First, 99% of the effectiveness of any toothbrush, manual or electric, depends on the technique used by the mouth owner.  </li>
            <li> I know to brush in each quadrant of my mouth for 30-40 seconds each (more than a two-minute total); I know to massage my gums when finished; I know to brush my tounge and roof of the mouth afterwards.  </li>

            <li> That is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> At first I thought I put dying batteries in it</li>
            <li> I will order another very soon!</li>
            <li> and I thought the thing was breaking the first time it went off.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this one the first time.</li>
            <li> Although not marketed as a kid-friendly model, it definitely seems to be a better size for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if you are only needing a short term brush and are OK spending that much more for a power toothbrush than have at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect from an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I was worried about battery life, but it&#x27;s still running on the first set of batteries.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and I am glad that you can buy replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> removable battery model, although made in China, seems to be better than the earlier ones that I had which were made in Germany and in Mexico.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> So much better than a regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> First, we have used Oral B rechargables for years.</li>
            <li> These brushes not only take the effort out of brushing, but they also do it more thoroughly than I can myself.</li>
            <li> Still, it does the trick and is still better than a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered this Thursday night at 7:30 and when I woke up at 8, it was at my house...</li>
            <li> A tad slower than the slower than it&#x27;s top models, but it does the job and the batteries last.  </li>
            <li> SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more and give them as gifts when i get back to Manila!</li>
            <li> been a regular user of braun electric toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li> Replace the head every three months, use regularly, and you will love your visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> That is because you can remove more plaque using this brush than when you use a regular non-electric tooth</li>
            <li> This tooth brush works great and last a long time on one set of batteries.</li>
            <li> I recommend them to anyone who needs a battery operated toothbrush--they do a much better job than regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have been using this product for over 18 months.</li>
            <li> I bought two more and then subsequently the covers of those broke as well.</li>
            <li> Made sure they were installed properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries after about 3 weeks of using it once/day.</li>
            <li> sure you don&#x27;t short</li>
            <li> Will contact manufacturer first.</li>
            <li> I use it very day!</li>
            <li> I can see someone trying this out for the first time and thinking that it was defective.</li>
            <li> so you can tell one from another if more than two people in a household use the same product.</li>
            <li> so you can tell one from another if more than two people in a household use the same product.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works better than manual brushing.</li>
            <li> have in the garbage regardless of how much you paid for it!</li>
            <li> Only a trip to the dentist for a cleaning made them look better.  </li>
            <li> This is my first e-toothbrush and it does its job</li>
            <li> I like regular tooth brush better</li>
            <li> I think I will buy a rechargeable toothbrush (that doesn&#x27;t use replaceable batteries) next time, because those batteries are permanently sealed and probably better protected from water.</li>
            <li> In fact I&#x27;ll probably just discard the whole unit after a year and buy a fresh one, at this price.</li>
            <li> this is my third purchase of this product.. love it</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown on picture..no complaints</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth pretty well.</li>
            <li> My kids needed better brushing, so I got this, which uses same brush.  </li>
            <li> This was my first electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset about it!</li>
            <li> This is my first battery/electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> well,, out here.. haha!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how light it was for a battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I had one of the 3-5 year Oral-B toothbrushes that lasted exactly three years and then pooped out.  </li>
            <li> The brush stopped working almost as soon as it was first used.</li>
            <li> It is probably the one thing (outside of my family) that I miss most.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush and the various Spin Brush types you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that i have ever bought a powered toothbrush and it feels like im at the dentist getting a cleaning when i use it.</li>
            <li> When the batteries are fresh, it removes stains and polishes teeth very well.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush was Sonicare Essence rechargeable</li>
            <li> Even when Por1000 is low battery, it is still a bit more power that the Battery version.</li>
            <li> I came back to this review when I realized I have used up my reserves of brushes and needed more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still fully functioning after 3 weeks on the first charge.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant for a while thinking a standard brush is all I need (and it is) however electric toothbrushes really do more work than manual brushing when you think about it</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a battery operated toothbrush and this toothbrush has made me wish I&#x27;d purchased one years ago.</li>
            <li> The first one got drained in a month.</li>
            <li> since those heads have the extra bottom part for a better brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and my teeth definitely feel cleaner using this fella.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much money some of these electric toothbrushes cost!</li>
            <li> The tooth brish is good, but there are a few problems.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job maintaining speed even when pressed firmly against teeth.</li>
            <li> new unit was very reasonably priced and seems to be better made than my old unit</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO SAY THE OLD ONE WAS BETTER THAN THE NEW ONE.</li>
            <li> The batteries included are cheap Chinese Duracells, which fizzled-out quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love it so much I plan to order the other heads available for it.</li>
            <li> clean everyday and is easy for clean I like it</li>
            <li> Certainly the AA model is better than an ordinary tooth brush, if you don&#x27;t have $80-100 to spare, it&#x27;s not a horrible option.</li>
            <li> When the replacement brush heads run out, and it&#x27;s time to buy more, I may very well buy brush heads for the older Braun battery toothbrush, as it is so much easier to insert new batteries.re</li>

            <li> Considering AA batteries are cheap these days, this is more economical than more expensive recharge ones.</li>
            <li> far the batteries have lasted a month just fine, and I have rechargeables ready to go when they die.</li>
            <li> my teeth are very clean now, i will never go back to manual brushing again.)).  </li>
            <li> I honestly thought I was breaking it, due to being in a rush, or just plan</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be buying any other kind</li>
            <li> I was assuming the flat end of the batteries go onto the spring as it is in so many products.</li>
            <li> Sure if you are good with a soldering iron, can find how to crack the case open without damaging it you can put a new battery but having done it I can tell you it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Low price, great clean fresh feeling after brushing, and long lasting replacement heads convinced me to buy a bunch of these as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I have no problem reaching my back teeth with the smaller head of this toothbrush or angling it around to ensure a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable; it has  a 2 min time built in; a set of 2 AA alkaline batteries last close to 2 months without the loss of speed (some technology built-in do that), but make sure you grease  </li>
            <li> We used to have electric ones that were more expensive and this one is every bit as good.</li>
            <li> I have loved this battery toothbrush for about 10 years and it finally gave out suddenly.  </li>
            <li> This brush does just as good a job as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> my dentist recommended an electric tooth brush, but they were very expensive, so I thought I would try this, and so far I am so happy with it, works great, gives you the feeling of a professional cleaning you get at the hygienist.</li>
            <li> So, after using it for 4 years, this brush is still going strong and gives me the same feeling which I got after first use.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning, but keeps on slowing down, even with new batteries, maybe I get a lemon.</li>
            <li> This is a first rate cleaner and make brushing so much easier.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush worked very well during the first two month.</li>
            <li> From the first use, I felt my tooth much cleaner and whiter.</li>
            <li> I think it cleans my teeth well, but it goes through batteries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like the whole thing if they&#x27;d tell me how to fix the first one.</li>
            <li> Great for someone that has Arthritis or other problem keeping them from using their arm properly to brush with.</li>
            <li> Some expensive ones gave out after a couple of years, so I said I&#x27;d only get the $5.00 kind at the drugstore from then on, as my dentist said they were doing a great job.  </li>
            <li> They have lasted a long time plus my family has better check ups at the dentist which saves me money.  </li>
            <li> the supposed &#x27;timer&#x27; feature is pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good for me though, because I was almost worried about it being too small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure if the brush rotations are helpful, it seems the vibration is what makes these &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type brushes good.  </li>
            <li> Also good since kids don&#x27;t usually brush for 2 minutes</li>
            <li> but good if u are lazy</li>
            <li> You can either hold it down and use it or press the button and let it run on its own.</li>
            <li> I have tried larger brush heads and they don&#x27;t even begin to fit and clean but this small, round, brushhead fits perfectly and cleans thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> one is easy to hold as the outside is coated in a rubberized layer for easy gripping and the batteries seem to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The brushing action is certainly not like my old Sonicare, but it is very effective and will vibrate three times when 2 minutes is up.  </li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer makes it easy to brush the proper amount of time</li>
            <li> Teeth become so much whiter as the brush action really gets your teeth extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> If you start using this, you&#x27;ll never be able to go back to a regular toothbrush, as your teeth will not feel clean.</li>
            <li> The shape makes cleaning back molars easy.</li>
            <li> then the Regular Manual Tooth Brush easy to use and moor</li>
            <li> Even the hard-to-reach teeth in the back are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a steady rate for cleaning, fits well in the hand, holds a decent amount of toothpaste and, especially great for anyone with a small mouth, isn&#x27;t too big.  </li>
            <li> I used to own a similar toothbrush (not round) and it did a decent job.</li>
            <li> It is good brush but battery does not last long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about chargers (chargers use energy and also cost a certain amount).&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> but I am certainly recommending don&#x27;t buy this model if anyone is considering.  </li>
            <li> but, all things considered, it certainly does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The on/off switch is smartly sealed beneath a rubber membrane which ensures water can&#x27;t get into the internals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We charge ours in a smart Sony charger.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like a neck massager or some large device.  </li>
            <li> Although not a rechargeable toothbrush, it is lasting a long time on 1 battery, and it will be more convenient for travelling which is important to me.</li>
            <li> But overall good as long as you&#x27;re mindful of water spills (or you replace the O ring)!</li>
            <li> This unit is great, a little loud, actually it is pretty loud when compare to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Stores near me had several alternatives at a much higher price with lots more bells and whistles I did not need.</li>
            <li> The only way this electric tooth brush could be better is if it never needed new batteries.  </li>
            <li> am just telling this as I think sometimes you forget your buyers are not all young and as strong as a four year old.  </li>
            <li> These work fine on rechargeable aa&#x27;s if you don&#x27;t want to feed it regular batteries.</li>
            <li> It works fine (just one speed), is a bit noisier and uses all the same brush heads.</li>
            <li> Its working fine, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> Two of us used it twice daily and one set of batteries turned out to be fine</li>
            <li> Vibrates fine until you actually try to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush worked fine with 2 AA batteries and the batteries last a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> The timer is a handy reminder that I&#x27;ve been brushing long enough, although a simple &amp;#34;ding&amp;#34; or sound might be better than the brush turning on and off a couple times in the middle of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B toothbrush at home for years, the kind that sits on a little recharging stand.  </li>
            <li> I soak it in peroxide (with a little mouthwash to give it a nice smell)  </li>
            <li> i like the small brush head, which let me clean my teeth one by one throughly:)</li>
            <li> For a little more than $11 it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> This model slows down or stops very easily while brushing.</li>
            <li> but then it slowed down or stopped very easily while brushing.  </li>
            <li> I recognize that this is a fairly complex products, and the heads themselves are pretty high quality, but I do think they could do a better job of keeping the price down.me one at-cost, or even ship me out one for free as a courtesy.  </li>
            <li> goes through batteries really fast when you brush your teeth 3 times a day</li>
            <li> Way too soon I had to replace the batteries, and the compartment door wouldn&#x27;t fit back on.</li>
            <li> I struggled to keep with it because it seemed to take so much longer, but really, it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> More expensive rechargeable models will have much more power so they will brush much more efficiently in the same amount of time and they also vibrate.</li>
            <li> directions on the baby aspirin said it required two thumbs to lift on both sides and I really hurt my thumb joints on both hands - still not quite healed after almost a year.  </li>
            <li> My whole family has one.</li>
            <li> It spins really fast.  </li>
            <li> This product came with the batteries which was very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Straight out of the box busted.</li>
            <li> Seems like a real winner and a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush</li>
            <li> and I bought one for my whole family.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It cleans very well</li>
            <li> I find that it is gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> much better money spent compared to the 100</li>
            <li> The Philips model&#x27;s vibration is much stronger, but the design lends itself to you hitting your teeth on the plastic.  </li>
            <li> It fits a variety of heads designed for it and has lasted really well.</li>
            <li> That and of course not having to worry so much about plaque and cavities.</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels much cleaner than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can now go gently into her mouth and get areas</li>
            <li> When we moved to this house I didn&#x27;t realize the outlet in the bathroom only worked when the light was on.  </li>
            <li> Gets the job done for a reasonable price as compared to some models costing 5 times the price.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34</li>
            <li> yet you have to replace the head much often</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> I followed the advice of the reviewer who suggested that a light application of plumber&#x27;s silicone gel on the seal ring would eliminate possible water leakage into the battery chamber, and this has worked well.</li>
            <li> I note that several reviewers complain about the fit of the two AA batteries inside the battry compartment.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want any plug-in electric chargers cluttering my bathroom sink top, and I don&#x27;t want to hide them in the medicine cabinet and drag it it from time to time to recharge my \\&quot;built in\\&quot; rechargeable \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want any plug-in electric chargers cluttering my bathroom sink top, and I don&#x27;t want to hide them in the medicine cabinet and drag it it from time to time to recharge my \\&quot;built in\\&quot; rechargeable \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are much cleaner than before.</li>
            <li> I found this electric toothbrush to be a real bargain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The real test of any toothbrush for me is the \\&quot;11 AM test\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> really like the brushing timer.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Much prefer battery operated.</li>
            <li> The tootbrush is used by my daughter and she loves using it and finds it very convenient.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very inexpensive but not so much so in regards to inherent difficulties.</li>
            <li> much recomend this product</li>
            <li> Battery life is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have the Oral-B plug in unit at home and this is the closest thing to the real one.</li>
            <li> makes this unit very portable for travel.  </li>
            <li> (Note: I don&#x27;t have problem with cavity, plague, tartar build up, etc even using manual toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness for those things on your teeth)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using this electric toothbrush, you just need to make a gentle contact between the brush and his/her</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Opening the battery case is much easier.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have room for a charger in my bathroom and thus the battery solution is desirable.  </li>
            <li> The brush works really well when batteries are at max charge.  </li>
            <li> I travels very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But it performs really well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to use much battery power either.  </li>
            <li> it makes it so much easier to brush his teeth</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the one I spent four times more for.  </li>
            <li> If you travel a lot or cannot afford to fork out that much for a toothbrush</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel so much cleaner than before.</li>
            <li> I use it when traveling and really like.it.  </li>
            <li> seems to work better than expected.</li>
            <li> In the week since I&#x27;ve started using this brush my teeth have become much cleaner and noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> This will make it much easier to brush my teeth when I travel.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely love this except that the 1st time I needed to change the batteries, the cover won&#x27;t lock, so I have it taped closed.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> You can use Alkaline or rechargeable batteries very flexible.  </li>
            <li> Just pop in AA batteries and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Although not as fast as my fully-charged rechargeable Oral-B, it works well and does the job.  </li>
            <li> I really like this electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You really do need to brush for two minutes with this model.</li>
            <li> You really do need to brush for two minutes with this model.</li>
            <li> When replacing the battery cover, so much force is required to close it, that the plastic splits.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> there are also happy folks which got broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> Depending on the brand and model, length of AA batteries can vary as much as 2 milimeter.</li>
            <li> Does it really need 2 batteries?  </li>
            <li> &quot; b/c after that amount of battery drainage, the brush was not spinning nearly as fast as our Oral-B electric, which sits in the charger all the time).  </li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> It eats batteries so fast......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not broken</li>
            <li> Works really well - and has a two minute timer which I like.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Pro-Health Precision works very well to me.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li> I very like it！It&#x27;s very good！</li>
            <li> The high-end models have integrated batteries, so when they eventually wear out, you have to replace the whole device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s absolutely no reason to spend more than $50 on an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Then gently pull the cap away from the bottom .</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t get much easier than this.</li>
            <li> electric toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are generic brush heads available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are generic brush heads available.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> (not that I&#x27;m worrying much about my toothbrush</li>
            <li> I think that, for the price of this product and the price of the replacement heads, they could do much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that, for the price of this product and the price of the replacement heads, they could do much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It spins too fast and irritates my gums.</li>
            <li> Replacement brush heads are very affordable.</li>
            <li> It went straight to the trash.  </li>
            <li> At this price, when the head wears out, I&#x27;ll probably just replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Really like this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Fast deliver.</li>
            <li> inbetween very well.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> This brush does not spin quite as fast as the rechargeable version</li>
            <li> and monthly use of my GUM plaque hook scale/scraper thingy, my teeth have absolutely no plaque issues and are looking better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s ironic that Philips invented the rotary electric razor which I use, but they don&#x27;t make rotary electric toothbrushes?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this works very well.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works very well.  </li>
            <li> And it really saved me money.</li>
            <li> is just too much work.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush over a year ago (I believe), and it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It been a couple months and still works just as well as my model that was twice as much.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, I got ones for my kids too -</li>
            <li> I really like the way that this product works.</li>
            <li> I had become very dependent on this spinning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works really well.  </li>
            <li> and cheap enough, also can change the battery as i wish</li>
            <li> Gets the job done well at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> 4 Stars is as high as I go on inanimate objects!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> In any case, its very underpowered.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really need all that.</li>
            <li> Almost like the real thing, but not.</li>
            <li> This one feels like it&#x27;s really getting some work done.</li>
            <li> I did just received a similar brush head for sensitive gums and it&#x27;s waaay better.  </li>
            <li> As for my own experience with it, I prefer the Sonicare-style brush head; this one has a particularly thicker post, which combined with the odd channels in it</li>
            <li> (at least I never notice a change in the level of rotary speed) but it is still a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B Toothbrushes for many years and my old one finally threw in the towel.</li>
            <li> Alternatively, you could color one ring with fingernail polish and let it dry before putting it on a brush head, or just use some colored tape around one or more of the main parts of the device in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Alternatively, you could color one ring with fingernail polish and let it dry before putting it on a brush head, or just use some colored tape around one or more of the main parts of the device in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I loved it, until it slowly stopped working.</li>
            <li> Even if it does break at some point as other reviewers are stating, it&#x27;s very cheap to replace as the price suggests.</li>
            <li> Even if it does break at some point as other reviewers are stating, it&#x27;s very cheap to replace as the price suggests.</li>
            <li> Like most comments here, the cost is high and it seems crazy in this day to throw away a good product just because the batteries can&#x27;t be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this is because of my daughter hanging some tooth issues and needing to be sure we could clean her teeth better because she wasn&#x27;t always as cooperative and it was hard to really clean her far back upper molars.</li>
            <li> I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me.</li>
            <li> I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me.</li>
            <li> I thought of returning this piece of junk, but Amazon accepts returns unopened only &amp; in original packaging.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;rattles\\&quot; more than my other electric toothbrushes, but I can overlook that for its convenience.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m nearing a year and a half of use, this toothbrush is still going strong!</li>
            <li> It went on to say that user preference is the discriminator, NOT whether one scours off more plaque than the other.  </li>
            <li> ORAL B PRO HEALTH actually makes me excited about brushing me teeth.</li>
            <li> and I consider it more convenient on trips not to carry a charger particularly on foreign trips.</li>
            <li> friendly toothbrushes cost about the same, but this one cleans so well</li>
            <li> It arrived the other day and I tried it yesterday to make sure it would work.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does not have the screw-off closure most other Oral B battery toothbrushes have.  </li>
            <li> Both were purchased at the same time and both still have the original batteries.  </li>
            <li> Other than the addition of the two minute timer, this looked exactly like my old brush; the sale was so good that I bought several of them.  </li>
            <li> My older version Braun toothbrush has a rounded battery compartment, which is MUCH easier to grasp, and</li>
            <li> I had to use toothpicks and floss regularly to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> I have to clean the removable cap and the bottom of the toothbrush in order for the cap to go back on.</li>
            <li> In the long run, rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride batteries are FAR cheaper than Alkaline batteries, and they sure beat having some plug-in toothbrush charger cluttering up your bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> I had to use toothpicks and floss regularly to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrushes, particularly for travel purposes.  </li>
            <li> and my teeth is so clean that I will not go back to manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific.</li>
            <li> I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific.</li>
            <li> current 3 that I bought came intact and very well packed, true Amazon quality.</li>
            <li> Power output is decent and very usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I was hoping for much more from the product, which proudly bears the name &amp;#34;BraAun&amp;#34; on it.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My older version Braun toothbrush has a rounded battery compartment, which is MUCH easier to grasp, and</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time in it and it does a nice job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought it for travel, but I have made it my only tooth brush, even though I have an older rechargeable one.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this toothbrush for our 3 year old back in August 2012 and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> After almost 6 months of use, this little guy is still going strong!</li>
            <li> After almost 6 months of use, this little guy is still going strong!</li>
            <li> Even this toothbrush is not expensive, I was surprised by the result.</li>
            <li> I liked the cost since I was not sure I would like a mechanical toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and they are pretty sensitive on your gums.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something small for travel, and for a short duration of use, this is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these toothbrushes; this one, for me, and the same one for my wife but with the full brush head (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWS9G6/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i01).</li>
            <li> If you have normal teeth, this will work very well.</li>
            <li> First thing to mention here: They fixed the battery compartment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the second one I own, but it&#x27;s several years old</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t completely replace flossing, but it gets pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> To make it worse the full day of charging is only good for 1x brushing, my wife normally brush first, by the time I use it</li>
            <li> My old brush without the timer worked just fine for several years with yearly battery changes.  </li>
            <li> but it does a better job than a plain old toothbrush so worth toting along on vacation.</li>
            <li> Time for a new brand/brush!</li>
            <li> new one, however, is of much inferior quality:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Not with my new ORAL-B PR0 it is that gentle on my gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is better than the rechargable chorded type because it takes up less space on your bathroom sink and does not occupy a power source.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this one does not clean quite as well as the rechargeable, but it is pretty darn close, and after going through two of the rechargeables eventually failing on me, I like the much lower price of this one and the convenience of using commonly available batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush mainly because it was time to replace the brush head on a Braun battery brush, when I saw this.</li>
            <li> do like this brush has a 2 minute timer, which my older Braun toothbrush does not have.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly at the gym</li>
            <li> The ones at walmart/amazon and such last 3 months or more.</li>
            <li> I find that my teeth are cleaner, particularly in-between teeth, than when I used a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Could just be that this particular one is a lemon.  </li>
            <li> It does a decent job cleaning my teeth, but I won&#x27;t be throwing away my Sonicare anytime soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick inspection showed it to be both smaller / lighter than the rechargeable models;  plus it has rubbery, ribbed grip.  </li>
            <li> A low price is attractive, but I would expect the lifespan to be at least a year for something like this.</li>
            <li> The heads are smaller and fit into areas that the old style brush wouldn&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li> My older one --which</li>
            <li> The battery holds for a decent length of time.</li>
            <li> I thought that this would be a decent replacement when I&#x27;m on the road, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> thought the batteries might go quickly, but they&#x27;ve lasted about 3 weeks with only 10% loss in power (I brush 2-3 times per day).  </li>
            <li> It was the smallest of all and a classic design by Dieter Rams -</li>
            <li> All the pieces are there, it runs, but it&#x27;s noisy and does&lt;br /&gt;not clean teeth as well as the better made Braun&#x27;s that are made in Germany (this one is made in China and seems like a cheap knock-off).&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did not let me return this which is disappointing, but I&#x27;m guessing alot&lt;</li>
            <li> I have tried rechargeable batteries, but they don&#x27;t work as well as regular alkaline (Lose power too quickly)</li>
            <li> I &#x27;bit the bullet&#x27; and replaced my Sonicare (way more expensive, waaaaay better) brushes.</li>
            <li> Particularly for gums, it cleans and massages helping to prevent cavities and disease.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS.</li>
            <li> Always wanted a decent electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This one is WAY above the one I used to use and it is only $3 more.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Crest or Colgate brands that you find at local retailers and for about the same price.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush mainly because it was time to replace the brush head on a Braun battery brush, when I saw this.</li>
            <li> do like this brush has a 2 minute timer, which my older Braun toothbrush does not have.</li>
            <li> It could function as a decent travel electric brush.</li>
            <li> The battery runs low quickly.</li>
            <li> I found that not all batteries are exactly the same physical size, thus not all batteries fit in the compartment the batteries go.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, small head is great for getting behind everything,</li>
            <li> If you really change authentic brush heads every 3 months, then the charger and new batteries are not significant cost to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have the high end Oral B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Get all the benefits of an electric toothbrush without the high cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 12/14/2015: HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this even today.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend them.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Also, the toothbrush head doesn&#x27;t rotate both ways (rotating-oscillating) which is highly recommended by dentist for electronic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the advise of one of the reviewers.  </li>

            <li> I can highly recommend this powered toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So, with high hopes, I bought this battery powered version with the hopes it would fill that void.  </li>
            <li> No fancy functions and ultra high speed</li>
            <li> I like the brush head on my new toothbrush, as it&#x27;s able to get into smaller places, and in the back of my mouth</li>
            <li> Note that, you can not replace the batteries in any toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries and one of the most common reason for a toothbrush ends its useful live is the death of its built-in batteries.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I like the brush head on my new toothbrush, as it&#x27;s able to get into smaller places, and in the back of my mouth</li>
            <li> I use this daily at work, 5 days per week, to put this into perspective for you, but I was surprised that I got 2 months of use out of the original batteries.</li>
            <li> I use this daily at work, 5 days per week, to put this into perspective for you, but I was surprised that I got 2 months of use out of the original batteries.</li>
            <li> More expensive brushes and different technologies may be better, but for me, for now, this was the right choice.</li>
            <li> Product came very fast, I just have to buy new head brush, because the original was very rigid, it scratched my gums a little bit</li>
            <li> I am hoping that the product&#x27;s life will also extend beyond 18 months further enhancing the benefits of this model versus any Oral-B/Braun model that can cost 10 times as much!!</li>
            <li> I love this little battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> (I dont brush my teeth any more than the average person!)</li>
            <li> For the price (little more than the crummy electric brushes that you get at drug and grocery) stores</li>
            <li> After only 2 months of use, the timer function on this new brush keeps kicking in after barely 10 seconds of operation instead after 2 full minutes as stated on the package!  </li>
            <li> Have been using the dual action clean for the last one year ..</li>
            <li> The vigor of the brush movement seems solid, battery life thus far good, and seems to get into tight areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This uses the same brush heads that the the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 uses (several other rechargeable models also use the same brush heads also), so they should be readily available.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!ses the same brush heads that the the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 uses (several other rechargeable models also use the same brush heads also), so they should be readily available.</li>
            <li> So far the battery has lasted well with no sign of slowing down or power loss like I have experienced with other battery operated toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> strongly suggest this model over non-user replaceable batteries of other brands/models.to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> strongly suggest this model over non-user replaceable batteries of other brands/models.</li>
            <li> Just bought this after having used conventional toothbrushes for almost 25 years and wow, what a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> I like this almost a much as my Chargeable Oral-B Professional.</li>
            <li> So far this works very well</li>
            <li> My gums are quite sensitive but this toothbrush has really gentle bristles that don&#x27;t hurt my gums at all.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Another viewer said to clean the goop off of the battery cap and around the sealing rubber O-ring that keeps the batteries dry.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush readily accepted my spare dual action heads.</li>
            <li> I need to spend much longer time to finish brushing as it stops frequently.</li>
            <li> Very affordable, I can buy 6 of these compared to the Braun professional</li>
            <li> I like to use [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]], and they work really well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one knowing I could get a refund if it was difficult to work with the battery compartment, and I was quite happy that it was a breeze to change batteries.</li>
            <li> My teeth are much cleaner than I can manage with an old style manual brush.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this type of electric brush because AA batteries are available world wide.  </li>
            <li> My almost 9-year old daughter has a real problem with staining on her teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my 6 year old oral-b electric brush, and decided on this one after much reseach.</li>
            <li> Depress the latch clips and wipe it clean before installing.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit on the loud side, but for the price, and the fact that it&#x27;s battery-powered, I can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li> I think its key to the success of this product.</li>
            <li> I read reviews that talk about generic replacement brush heads that are poorly made (in China?), and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the potential risk, so I used a coupon and got a great deal on the real thing.</li>
            <li> Up until about a year ago I have always used a normal non-powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> had trouble getting the top off to put in the batteries.  </li>
            <li> my experience, battery-powered toothbrushes usually last more than two years  before they completely wear out, but this one did not last two months.</li>
            <li> If the value of this product was worth sending back</li>
            <li> When I had to replace my Oral B battery powered electric toothbrush that finally died after 4 long years of twice-a-day use, I was really pleased when I found a 2 for 1 sale on the Braun Oral-B Pro-Health model.  </li>
            <li> I always disassemble the old brushes, remove the AA battery, and run it through a La Crosse charger using the full charge-discharge cycle which brings the battery back to life.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it takes two AA batteries and the unit goes a week worth of brushing without charging while the internal battery models get 3 days maximum</li>
            <li> Then it is also useful for people who travel as you dont need to carry different outlets.</li>
            <li> It started out normal</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s basically only useful as a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric rotary brush for a few weeks now and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, sturdy, has a tiny but powerful head so it gets into nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> Our dental bills and oral health are easily worth the extra money every two years.</li>
            <li> 4 months means that the toothbrush still works, but I find the power weaker, you will notice this when the 2 minute time starts vibrating, it does not vibrate like normal.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for normal brushing.  </li>
            <li> delivers more consistent battery performance\\&quot; which indicates that they made at least one change to it.</li>
            <li> When I called them, they said that that was close to the normal lifetime of the product.  </li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time, so I&#x27;m glad it uses AA batteries instead of needing a charger.  </li>
            <li> combined with daily flossing (with regular dental floss) --and weekly use of my handy dandy Waterpik Oral Irrigator (the one with 6 interchangeable heads including the tiny tooth irrigator--</li>
            <li> have two more of these that we&#x27;ve used for a few years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use rechargeables any more, because alkalines last much longer, and long enough that I don&#x27;t waste too many, maybe 4+ months, when consistently using this, and not grabbing the manual brush.</li>
            <li> A pair of AA batteries last a surprizingly long time, brushing twice or more a day, in this unit</li>
            <li> I regularly pop out my rechargeable batteries, put in fresh ones and forget about the power for up to three months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended, especially considering the economical price.</li>
            <li> I read reviews that talk about generic replacement brush heads that are poorly made (in China?), and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the potential risk, so I used a coupon and got a great deal on the real thing.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is protected under the casing, has a 2 minute timer which many people should pay attention to, the bottom cap stays sealed to keep water out of the battery compartment and it delivers the exact same cleaning experience as the more expensive units.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality plastic, thick rubberised grip, asures that the brush will not fall from a hand.</li>
            <li> One difference I could find is that the good one was made in Germany and poor one was made in China.  </li>
            <li> And a brand new professional series toothbrush is not cheap, and with each purchase I also end up with more and more chargers as it is always the toothbrush that breaks down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is as powerful as the regular rechargeable ones even with new batteries installed.</li>
            <li> : Don&#x27;t throw away your batteries as they are still pretty good to power TV remote controls, clocks powered by 1xAA batteries, and other low power</li>
            <li> it strong enough compared to the charger version with internal battery?  </li>
            <li> prices vary greatly on this automatic toothbrush, and sometimes the other stores mark the prices up, but it should still be possible to find them on-sale for less-than $12each, so compare prices carefully before</li>
            <li> Every period you need to purchase a new brush head like a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Also, although it&#x27;s cool you can use almost any Oral B brush head which is great design, there&#x27;s a pointy piece use to connect the brush head so unlike other toothbrushes that come apart in a way that allows cutting the size in half for easier transportation, this one kind of resembles a screw driver.  </li>
            <li> and I seem to be getting a lot more use (almost 2 weeks) out of a single pair of batteries than standard batteries</li>
            <li> and I seem to be getting a lot more use (almost 2 weeks) out of a single pair of batteries than standard batteries</li>
            <li> I recommend the brush that has only the single head because it does a better job than the dual heads.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it came with a larger brush head, because the small one seems to take so much more time to get each tooth clean!</li>
            <li> Regular AA alkaline batteries work better but, seem to loose brushing speed within a week’s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The waterproofing grommet causes a extremely tight fit and when you use too much force, it causes the cap to crack.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have quite the same power as a more expensive electric toothbrush, but it&#x27;s good for the price, especially as a backup or travel</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has worked reliably, and if you don&#x27;t need all the features of the more expensive brushes this should do just fine.</li>
            <li> not sure what the more expensive versions can offer you, but I&#x27;m happy with this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I see where this item is no longer available due to customer feedback.  </li>
            <li> am DIY guy and do my own built in battery replacement, but this solution does not last long will not explain technical reasons anymore.  </li>
            <li> constant speed and provides great leverage to reach tough places in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Although not designed for the new brush, it does work, in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even tried yet another set of new batteries, but it still would not work.</li>
            <li> Even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li> When battery compartment was opened after 2 months&#x27; use, new batteries were inserted.  </li>
            <li> Even with new AA batteries, they wouldn&#x27;t function.</li>
            <li> I opened the brand new package and put in the batteries -</li>
            <li> I live off the grid</li>
            <li> Probably have to put 2 new batteries in it about every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> i live out of US.</li>
            <li> so I swapped them with brand new ones.</li>
            <li> I bought another and they&#x27;ve redesigned the new one.</li>
            <li> Can I changed a new one?</li>
            <li> I bought new batteries.</li>
            <li> Tried new batteries still nothing.  </li>
            <li> NEW 2000mAh</li>
            <li> I will get some new batteries and try again; otherwise, I&#x27;ll have to return it and go to a store and get one.  </li>
            <li> B004SB1TD4 Sanyo NEW 1500 eneloop</li>
            <li> Tried new batteries with no sucess.  </li>
            <li> ALSO, INFO ON NEW ONE SAYS IT WILL SIGNAL YOU AFTER 2 MINUTES OF USE.  </li>
            <li> I even tried new batteries &amp; the toothbrush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush since the start of 2011, and it still works like new.</li>
            <li> I also had the oral-b 4000 model (I think it&#x27;s been replaced with a new model)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about the cost of a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and she needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Should probably get a new head though...</li>
            <li> So this year along with goodies that cause cavities I am giving my guys new Oral B electric tooth brushes in their stockings.  </li>
            <li> Bought new batteries</li>
            <li> A new brush replacement and</li>
            <li> it will be like a new product again.</li>
            <li> but then it just quit working even with brand new batteries-&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> Although not designed for the new brush, it does work, in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, I could set a timer and keep an eye on it, switching to different parts of my mouth as the timer counts down, but this is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Sure, I could set a timer and keep an eye on it, switching to different parts of my mouth as the timer counts down, but this is very convenient.</li>
            <li> The instructions show how to replace the battery but after finding this one I began to wonder if it was worth the time, effort and cost to bring the old one back to life.</li>
            <li> Thus far i have to say it works decently well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these specifically to try to go as light as possible for international travel.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed how this round brush with its brisk circular vibration motion cleaned much better than the old style.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very high powered and I find it superior to other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> used the brand new batteries bundled and then a very old pair of rechargeable batteries (fully charged).</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this little toothbrush, Your mouth will thank you! :)</li>
            <li> very loud.</li>
            <li> But I discovered, like another reviewer, that the batteries very frequently needed changing.</li>
            <li> this is cheap but it does the exact same job as the more expensive rechargeable versions.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered one previously and it was fine.</li>
            <li> have had expensive electric toothbrushes and other battery operated ones - the best out there -</li>
            <li> The next day on my first use, the toothbrush lost its power before the 2 minutes was up.  </li>
            <li> The first one that we bought did not work but for a short time.  </li>
            <li> My son destroyed the first one (toddler) and we are still using the second one.</li>
            <li> The charge usually lasts more than a month.</li>
            <li> My dentist was trying to sell me his $130 toothbrush (same price on here too), but I thought I&#x27;d try this one out first.  </li>
            <li> We just took a trip for the first time last week since purchasing this.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same design when it first came out, which must be over 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was low battery</li>
            <li> The other one I kept for almost three years - with a charger - is now about to end its life span, holding only a minute or two for operating, but while it&#x27;s running I guess it provides way more torques than this battery-powered one.</li>
            <li> I thought the first 2 I had just were fluky short life brushes</li>
            <li> I had my first one for over 5 years, and finally had to replace it...</li>
            <li> The descriptions says two AAA batteries which are small and better for travel.</li>
            <li> Probably not a big deal for most people, but it is for me, particuarly with respect to taking extra batteries as the AA batteries are bigger and heavier.</li>
            <li> It uses the same brush heads as the higher end models.</li>
            <li> However, after only a short period of time, I can see how much better it is than my regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep your gums healthy and the rotating head gets into the small nooks and crannies between your teeth and helps make your teeth whiter and cleaner.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely waterproof!</li>
            <li> The head is the same and moves the same but the rechargeable is like a fast, powerful car.</li>
            <li> This one is more like a small, economy car.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is much better than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s better than any powered or manual brush I&#x27;ve ever used in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is much better than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s better than any powered or manual brush I&#x27;ve ever used in the past.</li>
            <li> Uses the same exact brush heads</li>
            <li> I love this small tipped electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Written by AAA cells, but the actual is supporting the AA battery, which made me buy before the AAA rechargeable batteries are invalid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the original double A batteries two months later (although they&#x27;re on their way</li>
            <li> The heads from the previous unit will fit my new one.</li>
            <li> For the battery cover issue, I put a little petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on the gasket, and the cover slides on and off easily.  </li>
            <li> Okay product, but could be made a little more heavy duty to last longer.</li>
            <li> So motor power is held consistant right up until the end when the batteries near complete depletion where finally the motor just stops.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean as well as other oral-B products.</li>
            <li> The little timer to remind how long to brush a nice touch.</li>
            <li> that reason, I love the new battery-powered electric toothbrushes, even if they don&#x27;t seem to last very long before neither new batteries nor a new brush head will bring them back to life.</li>
            <li> The small, round brush makes it very easy to clean all of my teeth all over.  </li>
            <li> For the time being, I use the brush head cover from my old Braun toothbrush for my new Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is far easier to put in new batteries.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot of difference between a new brush and an old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the time being, I use the brush head cover from my old Braun toothbrush for my new Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li> gentle but thorough cleaning with a brush that&#x27;s comfortable for those who have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace the first one because the plastic cap for the battery compartment developed a crack and moisture corroded the contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even my cleaning man - a strong man - had a bit of trouble.  </li>
            <li> The batteries last a good long time, we use rechargeable batteries to keep costs down, no complaints at all!</li>
            <li> Of course, they looked at me strange, as near 40 year old&#x27;s rarely get oral health tools from mom.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> Know that when the batteries get weak, the brush stops with any kind of pressure.  </li>
            <li> It recently tried again to get it to work, and initially I thought it did - but burns through the batteries really quickly so after a couple of days</li>
            <li> I always seem to have a pedestal sink or a very tiny vanity, in an old-fashioned bathroom where only flat surface is the top of the toilet tank, unless I&#x27;m lucky enough to have a window and sill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> ..i would have easily given 5 stars for that reason.. going to try to find something a bit more expensive that will last longer..</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is fine, the batteries packaged with it were dead, with an expiration date of 08/2013.</li>
            <li> I Do like the Oral B battery toothbrushes in general; just not this particular design.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and a little bit noisy, but functions well.</li>
            <li> This little toothbrush is fantastic value for money.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend buying this Oral-B Precision Clean Toothbrush which doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Worth every single cent!</li>
            <li> Battery-operated models are sometimes hard to find, and yet they are more practical for taking on your travels.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber.</li>
            <li> Also the bristles of the brush aren&#x27;t that hard which is good for me, but I know some people may prefer harder or stiffer bristles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient，I want to clear my teech iImmediately！</li>
            <li> There are two lock buttons on opposite sides of the handle near the battery cap that you push simultaneously to release the cover with a gentle pull -- no problem.  </li>
            <li> THE TOOTH CLEARLY BEFORE.</li>
            <li> The action of the brush head is plenty fast enough.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used it intermittently and my 7 yr old as well as 3.5 yr old uses it.</li>
            <li> or it was just old, exposed and contaminated.</li>
            <li> Using some coupons I had, I bought two of these brushes, one for my adult son and one for myself.  </li>
            <li> If you are on a budget, you can buy this one, otherwise look at the oral-b professional 1000</li>
            <li> The buttons is a soft on/off and there&#x27;s no click</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and my teeth structure is prone to hiding food particles.</li>
            <li> Having RA, even the simple act of brushing teeth can be a problem and this makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for travel, after purchasing the Oral-B Professional 3000 rechargable brush for home.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this battery toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The brushing action is smoother and quieter.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use this toothbrush on vacations and so far it will meet my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spin power seem like it was design for a 5 year old.</li>
            <li> I have a similar model from Braun which is much stronger.</li>
            <li> Finally, it completely died.  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using a battery operated Oral B toothbrush, but I was looking for another to replace the old one.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely feel a benefit over using a regular brush.</li>
            <li> cleaning action</li>
            <li> B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] and didn&#x27;t require an outlet nearby.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, this provides the type of oromotor stimulation that will ultimately help him to stop drooling so much.</li>
            <li> WOW, this thing is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to replace both the batteries and head only once the whole time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to replace both the batteries and head only once the whole time.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 6 so far.</li>
            <li> Waited a bit to work it into my daily routine, and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Our toddler doesn&#x27;t mind his teeth being brushed as much now.</li>
            <li> This goes directly into garbage since it cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> So far, for me, it&#x27;s been four years.  </li>
            <li> So far, for me, it&#x27;s been four years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and my teeth structure is prone to hiding food particles.</li>
            <li> This battery operator brush far exceeds the plug in system.  </li>
            <li> This is much simpler and actually smaller in size.</li>
            <li> It seems to work really well compared to manual toothbrush because you don&#x27;t actually need to move the brush head.  </li>
            <li> When our 9-yr old expressed interest in a powered toothbrush, I immediately orderd another.  </li>
            <li> (And if you use rechargeable AA, then a complete non-issue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I like it so far, no problems.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain thus far.</li>
            <li> a AA x2 batteries.&lt;br /&gt;-Brush head lasts pretty long before replacement, I&#x27;d say about 2 months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush because it uses standard AA batteries and doesn&#x27;t require me lugging the charger around when I&#x27;m traveling.  </li>
            <li> It is nosier than my old one however.  </li>
            <li> I really like this powered toothbrush,it replaces a different brand that I was using.</li>
            <li> I also ordered three soft replacement brush heads one of which I put on as soon as I got the brush, soft is important.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]]&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The speed seems to be much faster than the ones I owned earlier</li>
            <li> also really surprised how water proof it</li>
            <li> I have to use a sensitive brush head with it, or it feels like there&#x27;s a jack hammer in my mouth.</li>
            <li> After eight months the battery compartment corroded and stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Get the same great cleaning without being forced to drag a charger along when you travel.  </li>
            <li> Wow  </li>
            <li> Our two year old Oral B 5000 is losing horsepower but is 2-3 times stronger than this offering.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel extremely sensitive these days.</li>
            <li> The case cracked on my old brush and water was getting in the battery case.  </li>
            <li> It seems to brush at about 1/2 the speed of our old chargeable Oral-B brushes.  </li>
            <li> So far working well.</li>
            <li> prefer the replaceable battery to the rechargeable units, the battery version last much longer</li>
            <li> I have already gone through the cycle of 2x braun professional series toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Comes with 2 minute timer as with Braun professional</li>
            <li> Toothbrush power is about 50-75% of a Braun professional series.  </li>
            <li> This to my opinion is also safer as I don&#x27;t have electrical wires near the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> So far I have used it about 50 times, 2 minutes each time, without it requiring a battery change.</li>
            <li> like the 2 minute timer that makes sure that you brush your teeth for at least 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, I have rechargeable batteries ready when the current ones are used</li>
            <li> But it is really easier to brush with this thing, especially on the vertical faces of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seems to have a stronger action that my rechargeable that took a powder after 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> your gums are sensitive, it might also be ideal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My almost three year old now loves to brush his teeth, even by himself.</li>
            <li> The brush is relatively loud compared to a Sonicare, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Your saliva/toothpaste will naturally want to get within every groove of this brush.</li>
            <li> Your saliva/toothpaste will naturally want to get within every groove of this brush.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this works since it just uses aa batteries.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, you need to look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> So far, it has held up to the test of time.</li>
            <li> All of them developed cracks in the batter cover, leading to water corroding the inside and resulting in toothbrushes that stop working.  </li>
            <li> The polarity of the batteries is marked on each side of the bottom of the brush.</li>
            <li> It has removable batteries, not rechargeable fixed batteries inside the case.</li>
            <li> There are no instructions to explain about the timer, but it has the word \\&quot;timer\\&quot; just below the ON button (which doesn&#x27;t have the word \\&quot;ON\\&quot; anywhere near it) and it mentions it on the package as well.</li>
            <li> If you use them correctly your teeth are much cleaner than traditional brushing when you are finished.  </li>
            <li> I did let them know, and they assured me that they&#x27;d take some sort of action, so we&#x27;ll see.  </li>
            <li> Coupled with a whitening toothpaste and mouthwash, it works almost as well as a professional whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]- plus the soft replacement brush heads recommended by some reviewers -</li>
            <li> : An absolute deep cleaning of your teeth and gums each and every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got improved power and effectiveness compared to my old brush.</li>
            <li> Also comes with batteries which lasted me nearly 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always worried about waking the household when I brush early in the morning.</li>
            <li> I need to try some different heads as the one included doesn&#x27;t seem to get in between the teeth very well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> (one month, so far and still going well - for 2 people, twice a day) I guess you could use a rechargeable battery</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling, but it might as well be an old fashioned tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m near retirement age, so I&#x27;ve tried toothbrushes from the covered wagon days (manual) through plug in the wall</li>
            <li> I bought one in the same price range from another vendor &amp; it lasted a whole 3 brushing s.</li>
            <li> So far no problems to mention.</li>
            <li> The spinning mechanism appears to &amp;#34;skip&amp;#34; and the drive shaft doesn&#x27;t perform a complete revolution of the brush head, which renders brushing process</li>
            <li> I was advised to use an electric tooth brush because of it&#x27;s action by my doctor.</li>
            <li> As far as time using it goes, you do each quadrent for aproxamately 15-30 seconds</li>
            <li> really think it should last longer than 6 months.</li>
            <li> the first one I received 2 months ago worked for that long.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t want to have to throw away yet another rechargeable NiMH toothbrush when it quits after a couple of years, I prefer these with replaceable batteries, because I use EverReady lithium ion batteries, and they last a long, long time, more than paying for their premium price.  </li>
            <li> So far I believe this is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Since then the toothbrush stops frequently.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a failing old unit.</li>
            <li> the old model</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 4 &amp; 6 years old.  </li>
            <li> This model of the Oral-B costs approximately ONE TENTH as much as the top of the line</li>
            <li> This model of the Oral-B costs approximately ONE TENTH as much as the top of the line</li>
            <li> The tooth brush isn&#x27;t as powerful as the rechargeable one (but that&#x27;s what i expected at a fraction of the cost) and the toothbrush head is removable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very similar in most respects except for a few things.</li>
            <li> This scenario sure beats throwing away a $100 rechargeable toothbrush because of a dead internal battery (been there).</li>
            <li> Every that took some strength and, to be frank, this toothbrush isn&#x27;t worth the effort to me when there are several models with a simple screw-off cap to the battery</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not like the expensive one but still has good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans very well in the small tight spaces and the rotating action brushes away food particles nicely.</li>
            <li> Not a substitute for flossing, but definitely goes deeper than a normal brush!</li>
            <li> (I brush his teeth lying down) but that got old quickly.</li>
            <li> The cover easily cracks if you are not super gentle and careful putting it</li>
            <li> Easy to handle &amp; the small INTRCHANGEABLE head keeps him from overdoing ot with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I recognize that this is a fairly complex products, and the heads themselves are pretty high quality, but I do think they could do a better job of keeping the price down.</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped, but this little thing does an amazing job for the price.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to know if the battery compartment remains free from water which was my problem with Phillips which made it necessary to change batteries too frequently.</li>
            <li> we all like to get better price for good quality as i tried other than the original it&#x60;s terrible.</li>
            <li> can brush the tooth clean but the voice a little louder.</li>
            <li> This current version of the old Braun toothbrush looks exactly the same</li>
            <li> The other brushes I&#x27;ve seen in retail stores did not look as powerful as this.  </li>
            <li> With the $2 automatic coupon, the new one is actually CHEAPER than the old one!</li>
            <li> At first we thought the batteries were loose, but this was not the case, as the motor would work if you removed the brush head.</li>
            <li> The fit is very tight on the battery unit, and residue of toothpaste tends to build up around the seal.</li>
            <li> Not very strong or quick movement.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a decent lenghth of time.</li>
            <li> this particular battery operated toothbrush is a very big disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> took two people to open it and that does not work for older people</li>
            <li> It does much more than an ordinary toothbrush especially in removing plaque.</li>
            <li> I have a crown in the back and the thing I like most about this toothbrush is the small head reaches all the around that crown.  </li>
            <li> It cleans my teethes a lot mainly the last ones.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS AS A REPLACEMENT FOR MY OLDER BRAUN TOOTH BRUSH, WHEN THE ON-OFF SWITCH STARTED ACTING UP.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush works well, its powerful and the batteries last for a long time.</li>
            <li> For those who have arthritis or related medical conditions, you might need help opening the battery compartment the first time (and yes, I did).</li>
            <li> I particularly like the smaller brush head and the availability of the five-count brush head pack.</li>
            <li> For anyone who loves and cares for their dog, we highly recommend regular brushings.</li>
            <li> The exposed roots now cause me daily pain, and I have to resort to a specialty high flouride toothpaste to try to remedy the situation.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does clean your teeth, but it is a bit big for a small mouth and it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> I use the old heads to clean the thin spaces in my car interior, stereo, etc (rinse well first to remove any traces of toothpaste)</li>
            <li> It will be so easy for travel -- I&#x27;m tired of carrying the whole kit and caboodle.</li>
            <li> His is still going strong, mine had trouble closing the battery compartment from the start, until finally it cracked and</li>
            <li> The round head cleaned my sensitive teeth gently and efficiently, and the two-minute timer was very practical.</li>
            <li> battery lasts a long time, spins fast, replaceable head, waterproof.</li>
            <li> and once I started I could never go back to a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have considered buying a more expensive brush more that a few times.</li>
            <li> I love the round shaped brush and did not want to go to a different brand with a different shaped</li>
            <li> I continued to use it for several months thinking that it was somehow still better, but a few cavities later I decided to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I tried using the cap from my earlier brush and sure enough, it does not fit.  </li>
            <li> and it was exactly what I expected...</li>
            <li> If I turn it off and wait 10 seconds or so, then turn it back on, it will resume working at its normal speed - but then stop after about 10 seconds of use.  </li>
            <li> These are harder to find intbis are and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> For 25+ years I&#x27;ve always used normal toothbrushes and ever since I&#x27;ve switched to Oral-B precision care line I will never go back.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely NOT like the normal rechargeable type.</li>
            <li> Expected higher pressure.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to make the jump from a normal toothbrush to an electric one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i will ever go back to normal</li>
            <li> draw back with this product i observed is that it operates on normal aaa battery.</li>
            <li> I bought this and used it once a day for a few minutes with baking soda and hydrogen peroxide instead of tooth paste and before the week was out, no bleeding, no bad breath.  </li>
            <li> overall it is even a better brush than the less expensive Crest Spin Brush (which I also like very much) as the smaller head allows for more thorough cleansing of each individual tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like that of some household products where you must press the sides and twist at the same time and it is Very Stiff.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you that just because it doesn&#x27;t cost more than fifty dollars does not mean it is not good!</li>
            <li> Battery runs out a little quickly (or maybe it just seemed like it).</li>
            <li> When typical standard batteries are used the brush&#x27;s performance drops off even when the batteries test at near full.  </li>
            <li> I replaced the head of the toothbrush, thinking perhaps it was some sort of switch keeping me from brushing too hard and the worn bristles were causing it to be set off too easily.  </li>
            <li> as rechargeable NiMH cells last longer due to holding more charge capacity, are cheaper in the long-term, and save you throwing out bucket loads of spent Alkaline cells that would end up in landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then it suddenly died in mid-brush, and new batteries would not get it working again.</li>
            <li> second one about two and just got a new one.  </li>
            <li> if this one only lasts a year, I would buy a new one for this</li>
            <li> Bad: The head doesn&#x27;t vibrate as much or as powerfully as the kind with the battery built in.</li>
            <li> The spinning/vibrating is not as vigorous as my previous electric toothbrush (which was the kind you set in a charger to charge) but this one also doesn&#x27;t form that gross gunky stuff at the bottom like my previous toothbrush did.  </li>
            <li> is not the first instance of the same exact problem happening: my previous Oral-B Battery Toothbrush succumbed to the same faith.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly loud and the replaceable heads can be expensive but it is a cheaper electric toothbrush and considering the health benefit of clean teeth, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> only real gripe with the Oral-B is that the cleaning head is a lot bigger than my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a more expensive model &amp; didn&#x27;t really want to spend the money again.</li>
            <li> The batteries also last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> Not expensive and a set of batteries last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> This isnt the first battery brush I have had in the past, but my dentist noticed that I had been working it too much</li>
            <li> Batteries last just short of a month but the rechargeable one this one replaced lasted about three years and cost about three times as much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not 5 stars only because it lacks a modern voltage controller to keep the same blazing speeds that the disposable Duracells (1.5V AAs) pull, when using a planet-and-pocket-friendly rechargeables (1.2V AA Sanyo Eneloops, another must-have item).</li>
            <li> The only reason I replaced the old one was that the tooth-whitening toothpastes started to corrode the soft plastic.....</li>
            <li> I never successfully got the top off -</li>
            <li> but the extra brushes we had for the old one work on this one!</li>
            <li> first unit was much more expensive than Amazon&#x27;s current price</li>
            <li> advice is to save your money and either invest into something built to a higher standards or try other brand of battery-powered toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small head assemly makes it easy to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li> as the battery wore down i noticed that it didn&#x27;t pulse as vigorously as it did when they were fresh, but overall it was usable until they completely died.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently (it runs on 2 AA batteries) along with both the professional FlossAction interchangeable brush head and the professional sensitive gum care brush (both in a pack of 3) and use it alternately</li>
            <li> Uses the same refills as the WAY more expensive models, and gives and absolute polish on all teeth surfaces like no manual action can.</li>
            <li> (voltage down from 1.5 to 1.37 or so, but enough to keep powering the toothbrush adequately at the end of the trip.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the rechargeable kind and sometimes has trouble starting when I push the button which I find odd.</li>
            <li> I only need to remember to  carry fresh batteries which are already on my packing list for some of my other electronics (eg my mouse).</li>
            <li> I had the first one for years and years and finally broke down and bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I can easily move it over and down into the gumline, then massage the entire gum for as long as I wish.  </li>
            <li> As I said, I wish batteries lasted a little longer, but I guess it&#x27;s a trade off for being so powerful and doing its job so well.  </li>
            <li> It performs just as well as my older, much more expensive chargeable model.</li>
            <li> Second, I found something from the ADA or some other professional organization that reported \\&quot;there&#x27;s not a dime&#x27;s worth of difference in the effectiveness of various brands of electronic toothbrushes.\\</li>
            <li> They handle is designed with a lot of thought; very easy to hold on to all at the same time, there&#x27;s padding to help prevent any spin brush from irritating your teeth from the vibration of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a former dental hygienist with the same dental practice for 44 years,&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this battery operated toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive models don&#x27;t last long enough to justify the price, and they don&#x27;t clean any better than the simpler ones.</li>
            <li> I had no problem opening the battery pack and tried replacing the batteries several times with new ones, but the brush head just sounded like a slow buzz and had no power at all to make my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> I am hoping it was an issue just with my item, and in general this model doesn&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small enough to fit in there mouth and has replaceable brush heads and is battery operated</li>
            <li> They last a long time and my mouth feels so much cleaner than using a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I have never lived in the sort of house or apartment that had counterspace near the bathroom sink -- or anywhere else in the bathroom, for that matter -- on which to keep electrical appliances such as a rechargeable toothbrush or a WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> If you stuck the head into a cup of water and turn it on there is barely any water vibration.</li>
            <li> This unit purchased was a replacement for the same 9 year old model.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT vibrate as much, but the smaller (round) head makes this brush so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> So far the second one has kept going.  </li>
            <li> I changed the batteries back to the old ones and the brush still worked.  </li>
            <li> I have replaced heads frequently and its been using the same set of rechargeable batteries that I switched to in 2012.</li>
            <li> The old Oral-B died after several years.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toothbrush to any adult who&#x27;s still using a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 8 year old son to replace his crappy disposable star wars tooth brush that just didn&#x27;t last at all.  </li>
            <li> I use to have to purchase soft bristles replacements for the already owned two mentioned above.</li>
            <li> My old one needed replacing and I could not find this one locally in the stores.</li>
            <li> When my seventeen year old Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush finally bit the dust (I presume the battery died), and it was time for a replacement, I decided to give the Pro 1000 rechargeable a try.</li>
            <li> This is a personal preference, but the toothbrush is a bit loud for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a definite upgrade from my old, manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Recent electric toothbrush used was the Braun Professional series.  </li>
            <li> Uses the same toothbrush head as braun professional series.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old loves using it to &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; his teeth so that is enough for me.</li>
            <li> (Our last Oral-B electric lasted \\&quot;forever\\&quot; when I followed a program of draining the batteries completely once every one-three months.)</li>
            <li> then it began stopping - or slowing until the brushes were barely moving - after about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> i actually bought this for my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> same vibrating action as the plug in models</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected too much for the price.</li>
            <li> I re-ordered because my old one finally died.</li>
            <li> I chalked it up to having used an Ultrasonic for long too and having forgotten what a normal Oral-B vibration feels</li>
            <li> it is like the batteries are going dead even though I just put in a fresh set.  </li>
            <li> had 3 settings on my old oral b braun for fast, gentle and slow.</li>
            <li> I spent around $100 on an electric toothbrush a few years ago, and it didn&#x27;t last more than a year.</li>
            <li> Good quality batteries should take at least 300-400 charge cycles, if not more.  </li>
            <li> only down side is that the vibration noise is a bit higher in this newer model than the old.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, my first last a very long time though.</li>
            <li> Later I will try various lithium ion rechargeable with it to see how they work as well as new AA batteries I buy.</li>
            <li> Batteries such as the Sanyo Eneloop can be recharged over 1000 times, and if they wear out, you can simply get a new pair of batteries, rather than purchase another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying a new one in the future.</li>
            <li> But later I realized that it has similar behavior with new battery too.</li>
            <li> This is nothing like the regular brush, it just makes a noise and vibrates a little, but definitely not enough to get your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Comes with battery which is a plus and has been working great for a less expensive option of battery powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not surprised that I needed new batteries before the 2 weeks was up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of electric rotary brushes from the cheap to the expensive and this cheap one works about the same as the others – no better and no worse</li>
            <li> and it worked for about half the time as the first charge ...</li>
            <li> So, not sure how this compares to other automatic toothbrushes, but we love them.  </li>
            <li> Other than that seems same as my rechargeable OralB. Accomplishes exactly what I bought it</li>
            <li> I will loose power during mid brushing which is very irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is very little power, and the brush head doesn&#x27;t rotate enough to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> clean the small gaps between teeth, I will recommend you get the following oral-B floss</li>
            <li> I doubt any electric toothbrush would last that long, but the point is that the battery is not the limiting factor in the lifespan of this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I especially like how the brush heads are small and fit to the back of my molars.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> The pricey models cost 5 to 10 times as much as this basic one, but you can bet they won&#x27;t last 5 to 10 times as long.</li>
            <li> It does have a small round head, and I would kind of like a bigger one for broader \\&quot;coverage,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Of course for the $10 price I should had figured it was not a single lithium rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I have a similar model from Braun which is much stronger and last very long time (now they no longer make this model).  </li>
            <li> Next time my wife&#x27;s power toothbrush is losing power, I just need to flip open the easy access port on the bottom and insert two common AA batteries.</li>
            <li> It is not really built to last and it stops if you put too much pressure on it.  </li>
            <li> All the rest, were the basic model, starting with the classic smaller white model.</li>
            <li> So far I have gone 3 weeks on the same set of batteries and the motor strength stays the same regardless of battery charge.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money and the round head is dentist recommended because it reaches your back teeth and gums !</li>
            <li> She spoke highly of the other major brand of \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; rechargeable toothbrushes, so I did a bit of research.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about this toothbrush at first because of the price.</li>
            <li> Works as expected with given price performance.&lt;br /&gt;Liked it with 2 AA batteries, highly portable for worldwide travel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other people are having trouble with when replacing there batteries, but it is simple and easy.</li>
            <li> My nails are not long, but after more than 10 minutes and 1 broken thumbnail, I finally managed to open the battery case and insert the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have an earlier version of this toothbrush, but apparently it was a nightmare to attempt to replace the batteries on this model.</li>
            <li> so the kids (and I) have no excuse.  </li>
            <li> My nails are not long, but after more than 10 minutes and 1 broken thumbnail, I finally managed to open the battery case and insert the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had trouble with the first toothbrush they sent.</li>
            <li> I find that this inexpensive electric toothbrush does just as good a job as the very expensive brand recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> The batteries that came with this product started to fail after 6 weeks, but the new batteries I replaced them with are still going strong after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give you a deep cleaning all the way down to the gums and below, your teeth will feel incredibly clean and you&#x27;ll throw every other to express you</li>
            <li> this toothbrush does NOT have a cover for the brush head, as does my older battery version, so traveling with this \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush would/should require devising some other type of cover for traveling.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush does NOT have a cover for the brush head, as does my older battery version, so traveling with this \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush would/should require devising some other type of cover for traveling.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is so much easier to open than other electric toothbrushes (especially if you have arthritis or weakness in your hands).  </li>
            <li> dont belive in negative reviews here mentioning about breaking bottom, you just have to open it very carefully and everything will be ok.)))</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly if you can&#x27;t afford the other ones..</li>
            <li> The bad  thing about the vitality rechargeable and all the older  oral-b I own is that you need to  recharge it after 3-4 days of 2-3 daily brushings.</li>
            <li> About every week, I take off the cap, carefully roll the rubber O-ring off the handle, and clean the goop (toothpaste; dried saliva; etc) from the groove where the rubber O-ring rested, and the cap and batteries go back without issue.  </li>
            <li> but, the power is slower and less intense.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace it because it would take up less valuable bathroom-sink real estate and be easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> I love the small round rotate brush</li>
            <li> I can only imagine after the batteries deplete I will be forced to replace batteries before full use of them.</li>
            <li> It would go to slow but promptly back to full speed.  </li>
            <li> The head of the toothbrush is extremely small, pay a little extra get a better quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> No much vibration and very loud</li>
            <li> It finally broke when I was not as gentle as usual--trying to get the compartment lid on by sitting it on the counter and pressing down hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this toothbrush, it does not spin a full cycle, but just vibrates the bristles back and forth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as powerful as the more expensive models, but I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as I have been happy with everything I have gotten from AMAZON up to this point !~!</li>
            <li> It uses the same heads and oscillates almost as fast but costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> This AA battery operated brush was less money than replacement batteries for the old unit (provided I could even get the old unit apart).  </li>
            <li> haha, Batteries do not last incredibly long, but if you use rechargeable ones and are CAREFUL when changing them (aka closing the battery section all the way, not making the same mistake twice...)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using other pair of new batteries but didn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may sound a little loud on the video, but really it is not that loud at all, at least it hasn&#x27;t bothered me or my dog.</li>
            <li> If you are not very careful about closing the battery compartment properly, there tends to be minor water leakage into the battery compartment which could potentially ruin the battery</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had shoulder surgery on my right arm and am clumsy with my left, thinking that I&#x27;d go back to a manual toothbrush when my arm recovered.</li>
            <li> Weak and doesn&#x27;t feel clean after brushing my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do not care about other features the expensive ones offers, I think this has more value.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can replace the batteries and it takes the same replacement heads as other Oral-B professional care electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with that...and seriously, if it&#x27;s just the battery, I&#x27;d rather be able to buy a replacement battery for cheaper instead of throwing out and replacing the whole product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just went to the dentist for cleaning and noticed the dental assistant spent a little more time cleaning than usual.  </li>
            <li> I listen carefully and hear the faint sound of high pitched vibration.  </li>
            <li> The tooth brush spends more time off then on while i&amp;#34;m trying to brush my teeth making it very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I use the long, thin self-sealing plastic bags available at Asian markets to store chopsticks to store this in my bag.</li>
            <li> The packet was already open and the batteries were flat.</li>
            <li> : I originally gave this item a 1 star review as I figured it was broken.</li>
            <li> I put the batteries in the same way and if you look close around the edge, you will see that one positive goes down and the other up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 6/21/16: I have been using this toothbrush for about a year and half now and it is still working like new.</li>
            <li> This new one lasted only a few weeks and SNAP, it cracked again when the cover was put back on after battery change.</li>
            <li> and the batteries seem to last a very long time, despite the fact that currently 2 persons are using the same unit.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have pointed out that when the other built-in \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; batteries wear out (and they will), then you have to throw away the whole unit.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have pointed out that when the other built-in \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; batteries wear out (and they will), then you have to throw away the whole unit.  </li>
            <li> Still running off the initial set of batteries, so it&#x27;s got long life and my teeth are noticably cleaner than with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much money for so long.</li>
            <li> I guess it should work similar with the rechargeable ones and we will see how long the battery will last.</li>
            <li> I usually use (older) Rayovac hybrid rechargeables, and have also used regular Energizers and have no difficulty getting the cover back on with either one.</li>
            <li> At 8 bucks a pop, with a new brush head and a set of batteries included, it is just about cheaper to replace the electric toothbrush every few months than to order the replacement brush heads, which are often counterfeit unless you buy the pricey big box store replacements.</li>
            <li> second problem was that the brush itself, the handle with the motor and battery, didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Does a nice job cleaning teeth, even compared to a previous expensive setup.</li>
            <li> Use it with rechargeable AA batteries and it will easily outperform the disposable, rechargeable toothbrushes which only use 1-AA battery and fail to hold a charge after a while.</li>
            <li> Its vibrations are not as fast as the Phillips brush I used in the past, so the brushing process is slower.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if too much water had gotten in it or what.  </li>
            <li> It costs no more than 10 bucks, you can not expect too much of it.</li>
            <li> I do not expect much in that price range and assume its life is not more than 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> I hope they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> a.lso you can get the replacement heads at bj and they last a really long time</li>
            <li> Lasted me long enough for the price.</li>
            <li> the battery does not last for long, and gives way in a year or two....</li>
            <li> I have been using a regular electric Brawn toothbrush for years and wanted one I could take on long trips.</li>
            <li> At this time interval the motor briefly oscillates off-on-off-on to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing</li>
            <li> so I use it for long enough.</li>
            <li> The brush head itself is smaller than I was accustomed to using but it didn&#x27;t take me long to adjust to the size.</li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I see it lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> and I see it lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> When it finally died (after a long time)</li>
            <li> I do not know how long the batteries last yet since I just got this today and made some comparisons to the rechargeable model I have.</li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> there is no indication of how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> I have found that these battery operated brushes last a long time before the battery needs replacement.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> see how long the 2 AA batteries last.</li>
            <li> The power and the long lasting batteries and the 2min timer.</li>
            <li> Frugal with batteries, which last a long time with this product.  </li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li> read in some reviews that the battery doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> I hope they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re used to the power of a base-charged brush, this seems pretty slow.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner than ever before (sounds cheesy, but its true!).</li>
            <li> The refills are the same as almost 10 years now, so it has become a sort of de facto standard, so you won&#x27;t be left with an usuels novelty brush, like Colgate and other fad</li>
            <li> hope these Duracell batteries last a VERY long time, because I don&#x27;t want to go through this again too soon.</li>
            <li> and sometimes the batteries don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t seem to last very long.  </li>
            <li> and like me want to change to battery since the rechargeable won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> hope these Duracell batteries last a VERY long time, because I don&#x27;t want to go through this again too soon.</li>
            <li> Been using it for like 30 days and didn&#x27;t touch my previous (old style) toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is still compatible with), but it&#x27;s also half the price and offers the consumer the convenience of swapping out batteries.</li>
            <li> I needed a toothbrush with a small head to fit in my small mouth.</li>
            <li> My previous toothbrush was the Braun Oral-B with the old style rectangular brush.  </li>
            <li> have been taking the brush itself,  off every few days and cleaning up the residue that accumulates inside,  as I noticed that my old rechargeable insides  were starting to rust.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No charger to worry about lessening clutter in the Toilet.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless I am curious just how thorough the brushing is because the head of the tooth brush is much smaller than traditional brushes?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not likely due to water getting into the crevices as I&#x27;ve tried multiple methods to avoid that from being a possibility.&lt;br /&gt;It is not likely due to battery corrosion as I&#x27;ve tried multiple batteries and visual inspection shows no corrosion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the batteries last for weeks on a single charge.</li>
            <li> My usual brushes work on this brush so I won&#x27;t have to buy new ones for future trips</li>
            <li> Not only does this cut down on what I have to pack and carry, but it also means that I don&#x27;t have to worry about using it in countries where the electric current is not the same as that in the US.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands of tooth brushes and finally have given up and came back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not exactly the same device because they advertise on the back of the package \\&quot;Improved technology</li>
            <li> I also feel like it is a little loud, but that just might be because I&#x27;m not used to using an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> those two seemingly insignificant details are enough to drive you nuts with frustration every single time!</li>
            <li> far as I am concerned this brush manages to do a terrific job with very little effort.</li>
            <li> He had an incredible build-up of plaque which Dentist attributed to his insane amount of drool (counterintuitive, I know).</li>
            <li> The heads are expensive but you can get cheap Oral-B brand ones from ebay.</li>
            <li> Because these brushes were a fraction of the price of a Sonicare, I was skeptical, but since it was cheap to &amp;#34;try</li>
            <li> The small head goes so far back</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery lasted a long time, maybe almost 3 months.  </li>
            <li> The interior was not marked with the customary + or - signs for the battery placement.  </li>
            <li> Wet the battery cap O-ring with your fingertip or you will never get it back on!</li>
            <li> Strangely, I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth 3 times a day since I got this</li>
            <li> It lasted an incredibly long time.  </li>
            <li> Well, I did and subsequently it got wet inside.</li>
            <li> I am a coffee and tea drinker all day long.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it depends on how long your batteries hold the charge).</li>
            <li> This guarantees moisture vapour can&#x27;t get into the battery chamber which over time can corrode rechargable batteries in long term</li>
            <li> My gripe with electric toothbrushes with built in batteries is that after 2-3 years, the battery looses its charge and you have to charge frequently, to a point that you have to charge it everyday.  </li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t have to bring your charger along when you go out of the country or on long trips.  </li>
            <li> a rechargeable enuloop  battery lasts a long time in one .</li>
            <li> Should have purchased this long ago</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long the batteries hold up.</li>
            <li> but  had used too long.</li>
            <li> Would return to Amazon, but dont know their policy on how long.</li>
            <li> how long I brush in each quarter of my mouth.</li>
            <li> how long I brush in each quarter of my mouth.</li>
            <li> so well I consider that a minor thing.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses the staining is almost completely gone, just a bit remains between her teeth.  </li>
            <li> It lasts  long time.</li>
            <li> Fairly long battery life.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a five-year old but haven&#x27;t yet gotten it out for her because it&#x27;s really heavy.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I like the way the 2-min. timer &#x27;stutters&#x27; to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.  </li>
            <li> , just hope it lasts long time</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for a year and haven&#x27;t have any issues at all; just regular battery and head changes which is expected.  </li>
            <li> But a pair of batteries lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Though, I hope it came in on a different color like pink..</li>
            <li> The base cap which you remove to insert the batteries seems fairly substantial to me.  </li>
            <li> Third, I learned that the \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; toothbrushes move their heads up and down across your tooth, while this Oral-B rotates its head a bizillion times a second.  </li>
            <li> I am on my 4th device, although, one of those, Triumph, now discontinued, which also moved the brush up and down, I only used briefly.</li>
            <li> short, you get the same cleaning efficacy at half the cost with extended periods between charges.</li>
            <li> I mean I know we are living in 21st centure and no new  \\&quot;thing\\&quot; supposed to work longer than warranty period, normally 1y.</li>
            <li> normally it&#x27;s a 1 star because of the amount waste of plastic and other materials.</li>
            <li> Finally a quality electric toothbrush for the working class, don&#x27;t know about you but money is extremely tight in this economy and spending upwards over $100 on an electric toothbrush is simply out of reach for me.  </li>
            <li> so all I am left with is a rechargeable AA Ni-Cad battery for use in other devices.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went through several over the years, all due to the battery cap/cover (on the bottom) cracking.</li>
            <li> Pro-Health does have a neat water-proof battery compartment, and a little petrolium jelly will not only water-proof it further, it will make opening the thing easier when there are no batteries inside.</li>
            <li> The only place it lags a bit is in brushing the tongue/roof of the mouth due to lack of surface</li>
            <li> My last one had to be charged every other week.  </li>
            <li> It is not likely due to battery corrosion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other reviewers spoke of the difficulty getting the bottom back on after replacing the batteries...</li>
            <li> The package was open and the batteries were scattered around the box which contained other items I had ordered.</li>
            <li> From reading other reviews, I gather that the issue with these used to be short battery life, and I can&#x27;t comment on that yet.</li>
            <li> I got a Spinbrush and was disappointed at the design, with a rectangular brush that just dragged along next to the circular spinning brush, so I looked at the Oral-Be brushes and found this one, with replaceable batteries and able to take several of the Oral-B brushes.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other similar product</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for a very long time (about a year).&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> The battery lasts very long compared to rechargeable models.</li>
            <li> remove the head and dry the handle after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It felt weird and didn&#x27;t seem to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I charged it again and the same thing happened in the evening and the next few days.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the brush stalk has multiple holes that funnel fluids out of your mouth, which can get messy.  </li>
            <li> My dentist found no gum disease whatsoever the next check up (6 months later) and wouldn&#x27;t believe I had had that trouble until he consullted his notes.</li>
            <li> Could be a problem for an elderly person or anyone with limited hand strength.  </li>
            <li> Needed  an electric toothbrush for Motorcycle travel (limited room).  </li>
            <li> it runs a good-long time on a single battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how little difference between this cheap brush and our expensive daily brush.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal for an adult probably, but too heavy for little hands.</li>
            <li> My  hands are not strong enough to open and close the cover.  </li>
            <li> One last item, I could care less about five different \\&quot;modes,\\&quot; timers, neon lights and other bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> One last item, I could care less about five different \\&quot;modes,\\&quot; timers, neon lights and other bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sending this back because it&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li> Here one flat end goes on a spring and one + end goes on the other spring.</li>
            <li> I expected this thing to give up a long time ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am curious how long each battery type lasts.</li>
            <li> : Press firmly on both raised dots in the center of the blue half-circles just above the bottom cover.</li>
            <li> To do a thorough job cleaning my teeth, I have to turn the brush off and wait at least 30 seconds before turning it back on only to have the same problem reoccur after only 10 seconds or less.  </li>
            <li> A big thumbs down.</li>
            <li> This morning when I brushed my teeth though it stopped when I pushed down.</li>
            <li> Just run the entire brush under the sink and the wipe everything down after you&#x27;re done, it takes about 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> Just run the entire brush under the sink and the wipe everything down after you&#x27;re done, it takes about 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> Motor not powerful enough, was slower than my previous toothbrush of the same make &amp; model.</li>
            <li> Either I&#x27;m not strong enough, (should you really need super human strength to replace the base)</li>
            <li> when new which slowly falls to every day before needing charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i read some Costumer Reviews it&#x27;s get slow after 1 month&#x27;s even change the battery new one.</li>
            <li> This is disappointing because I&#x27;ve been very loyal to Oral-B electric tooth brush for years.</li>
            <li> They are knock-offs  and last less  than a month.</li>
            <li> Also, the button failed on me for the first time recently</li>
            <li> Also, really prefer the small round brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to reach the back molars.</li>
            <li> My 3 were all less than 5 months (one a different brand).  </li>
            <li> Had a previous Oral B toothbrush and had no problems with it until it suddenly quit working..</li>
            <li> And sending it back to have it replaced would cost me half the price of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So you get similar result for much less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want the same small head, not the double head.</li>
            <li> I will run it a few battery cycles to see how long the batteries last.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d pay $10-15 extra for this because it would be cheaper than a converter and less risky because I&#x27;d know they&#x27;d tested it with the product)</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d pay $10-15 extra for this because it would be cheaper than a converter and less risky because I&#x27;d know they&#x27;d tested it with the product)</li>
            <li> Only downside is that the blure parts turn black.</li>
            <li> so those with smaller mouths or less access space between the cheeks and the teeth may prefer this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was not due to mechanical failure as the build quality of this Made in Germany product is solid.</li>
            <li> Like other raters said, you can keep recharging these batteries -- up to 250 times according to the manufacturer -- for as long as the toothbrush motor lasts.  </li>
            <li> Like other raters said, you can keep recharging these batteries -- up to 250 times according to the manufacturer -- for as long as the toothbrush motor lasts.  </li>
            <li> Good brush, the shortcomings I can verify are: (1) needs a thicker O ring to sufficiently protect from water leaking to the batteries, and (2) motor begins to slow and weaken as the batteries run low.</li>
            <li> Also consider that I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice already, the the second time the battery section opened and closed with a lot less</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it came with batteries, and it&#x27;s a little bigger than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> The brush head is a little bit smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> I used this tooth brush when it was shaped just  a little bit differently and it lasted for yrs.  </li>
            <li> But there are ways that its design could be improved or that you can do as a consumer to make it last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> It also has a built in timer feature that given a little stutter when you have brushed for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rationalize spending a lot on the super-exotic mechanical teeth-cleaning products available out there, but I WAS a little skeptical about buying this one (despite the bargain-basement price), because of the &amp;#34;battery&amp;#34; issue.</li>
            <li> Mine had a very weak brushing action from the start, and I tried to remedy it by trying several different sets of batteries.</li>
            <li> The brush head is about the same size as the tool a dentist uses to clean/polish teeth thus, it reaches and cleans even the hard to reach back teeth well.  </li>
            <li> a result of this bad experience, my son dumped his brush, but I am more stubborn, and still using mine to return my investment.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I bough mine at least 8 years ago as a travel brush because I use the more expensive rechargeable Oral-B brushes at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get at least another one of this model to keep in the different locations I travel back &amp; forth between.</li>
            <li> only complaint with this brush is the relatively short life span before batteries need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it only lasted for 6 months.</li>
            <li> They are affordable and seem to be as long lasting as any I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Soft (Colors May Vary)]] (sometimes branded Crest, lately branded Arm &amp; Hammer)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I haven&#x27;t found a brush cover for when we travel so currently are just using the plastic case it was delivered in.</li>
            <li> A dentist recommended I use one of these a few years back</li>
            <li> All the money I&#x27;ve spent on Amazon</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li> I only used this product for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> No problem really, unless you&#x27;re an OCD like me and like to brush under your tongue and the gums BEHIND your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is such a waste.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts way longer than I expected and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I have gotten it plenty wet during use and there is no problem with this well made brush.</li>
            <li> I use it carefully.</li>
            <li> To me there is no real comparison.</li>
            <li> Replacement and extra brushes are available, too, so family members can share the same base unit.</li>
            <li> and then it is basically dead after a 3rd try.</li>
            <li> I got a few uses out of my 3rd change but ended up just tossing it since I was just then using a bulky toothbrush with no motor.</li>
            <li> It got slower and slower and after trying several batteries, I discovered it was completely dead.</li>
            <li> We had one for a few years that finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> I bought the replacement toothbrush for 9.99 minus a 2.00 coupon.  </li>
            <li> the package was open and the battery is missing......</li>
            <li> Unit appears to be just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just curious why I didn&#x27;t do this sooner..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just curious why I didn&#x27;t do this sooner.</li>
            <li> However be careful for this workaround - make</li>
            <li> and am having same trouble.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not very thorough, and this device helps me time</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not very thorough, and this device helps me time</li>
            <li> Purchase one and have used it for a few weeks and now ordered a second.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t handle the toothbrush roughly or anything, so I don&#x27;t believe that I have caused the problem.</li>
            <li> careful changing the battery as some reviewers have stated they broke the battery cap while removing it.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months and battery seems to be lasting well!</li>
            <li> Changing the batteries was easier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I bought a few months back from SmallAppliance.com.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The battery only lasts a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Never really had any power.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to drag along the charger or a converter.  </li>
            <li> so minus 1</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the base of this unit is sturdy enough to support the unit upright on the counter top.</li>
            <li> We own a system that is charged by a base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried replacing the batteries - not at all easy, since the case is VERY difficult to close again.  </li>
            <li> Owned several rechargeable (internal battery) types but seem to have very little luck with these -- the motor failed, or the thing would not hold the charge for any reasonable period of time, or the speed degraded after some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t particularly care for the extra features on the really expensive models (electronic displays, etc.).</li>
            <li> The small round brush head cleans even the most difficult to reach areas of the mouth.</li>
            <li> The only thing to note is that if you use the heads with 2 bristle groups, the batteries will run down a little faster.</li>
            <li> The fact that ageing rechargable batteries can be replaced as their capacity diminishes means you can expect years of service from one of these, whereas the more expensive units with internal batteries are useless junk as soon as they loose the majority of their capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 2 previous brushes like this -- both lasted a very long time.  </li>
            <li> (the internal battery eventually loses its ability to retain a charge - happens long before the motor begins to burn out).  </li>
            <li> Unless I got a &#x27;lemon&#x27; tooth brush - I seriously doubt that due to other reviewers&#x27; similar complaints over low power issue - I won&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My only (minor) complaint is that you still have to change two AA batteries every couple of months.  </li>
            <li> A little hard to open battery compartment but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed when the un-replaceable rechargeable battery in my previous Oral-B toothbrush wore out, and the whole thing became junk.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find this battery toothbrush in a store, especially with its simple round head.</li>
            <li> I did have to use the brush head for my other electric toothbrush since I ran out.</li>
            <li> It is not as tall as the other one I bought so</li>
            <li> I rather brush my teeth with oral-b than any other eletric brush on the market.</li>
            <li> This is my third Braun tooth brush which has served me well for the past five years.</li>
            <li> This is my second one I purchased over the past five years.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s died in two weeks due to water leakage.</li>
            <li> We tried other battery tooth brushes for the kids</li>
            <li> But the motor may be the other reason that the power degrades over time.  </li>
            <li> i have to find other tpothbrush.of course.</li>
            <li> I will order a different brush head as the one provided just rotates and is too small.</li>
            <li> I had my other ORAL B for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these for family members, and all have worked well for quite a long while now.</li>
            <li> and I just purchased another one our other daughter who turned 3.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of electric/battery toothbrushes in the past.  </li>
            <li> you have to buy the other head separate</li>
            <li> Tried some other, cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> User replaceable batteries means that I can now use this toothbrush for years and not worry about the non-user replaceable batteries of other electric brush models.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I bought this one for travel because it is smaller and lighter, and used it while traveling the past 3-1/2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> (I use my electronic toothbrush the other time each day.)  </li>
            <li> reason why I picked this toothbrush versus others is based off of what I took away from other reviewers on other products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can then graduate to other products if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I power this toothbrush with 2 AA Energizer rechargeable batteries and recharge them about every other month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> device is compatible with the usual replacement toothbrush heads, and it works with standard AA batteries.</li>
            <li> They seem pointless to me, and I suspect having numerous extraneous features increases the probability that the toothbrush will break.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alternatively, you can press one raised dot on one side, then the other, and then remove the cap.</li>
            <li> If you buy them here you can send them back for a refund if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I plan to try rechargeable NiMH batteries and keep one of my small chargers at work when these batteries are finally exhausted.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you buy them here you can send them back for a refund if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I plan to try rechargeable NiMH batteries and keep one of my small chargers at work when these batteries are finally exhausted.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Often, when traveling, I cannot conveniently recharge other batteries.</li>
            <li> I like this one because the brush heads spin and are small for smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried the other heads yet, but the included head works</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for a recent trip to Europe since my usual Oral-B rechargeable would not work on their electric.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Grade: A, or Five Stars!t way to save money on those messy whitening strips and help the environment in the long term as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral-B head is small enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting my foot in my mouth, and with fully charged batteries, it brushes and polishes away.</li>
            <li> As a Sonicare user, I wanted something small for short trips.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other brands</li>
            <li> We have other Oral-B battery toothbrushes</li>
            <li> In other word if Pro1000 is &amp;#34;forceful&amp;#34; the Pro Health Battery is &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other inexpensive electric toothbrushes but don&#x27;t seem to have any power.</li>
            <li> I tried to get the battery compartment off, not easy to get off, but I didn&#x27;t go hard enough because I didn&#x27;t actually need to remove it.</li>
            <li> I noticed that replacement heads are a little expensive but really worth it</li>
            <li> The old version was so difficult that I recently threw it away after struggling with it for five years.  </li>
            <li> However, I have been through 2 of these, and both times I have broken the unit when replacing the batteries for the 2nd or 3rd time.</li>
            <li> When I change the batteries about every other month, it becomes hard to open or even close the battery cover due to the toothpaste buildup on the O-ring.  </li>
            <li> I had to bite the bullet and buy one with the wall charger, which unfortunately only runs on 110V and is thus not suitable for travel, unlike this AA-operated model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always so exhausted in the early mornings and late evenings that I can barely lift my arms sometimes.</li>
            <li> I usually floss at least once  a day after brushing and I am always a little surprised by how little excess debris is present after using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> However, I find it is not very powerful compared to my previous electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (as a few other reviewers have noted), gradually worsened to the point it will not really function.  </li>
            <li> That being the case, this may be less expensive in the long over buying those $5 throw-away battery-powered toothbrushes that have no replaceable heads, especially if the generic replacement heads work out.  </li>
            <li> That being the case, this may be less expensive in the long over buying those $5 throw-away battery-powered toothbrushes that have no replaceable heads, especially if the generic replacement heads work out.  </li>
            <li> brush came with the unit is a little harder than I like, [</li>
            <li> As the one that comes with is a bit tough for my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li> The fact that it was 75% less costly than other brands is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This replaced the travel tooth brush my other half had.</li>
            <li> The other I purchased at Wal-mart for half the price</li>
            <li> The battery cover is a bit hard to open.</li>
            <li> How hard can it be to brush your teeth with a regular toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How hard can it be to brush your teeth with a regular toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was frustrated and upset that they wouldn&#x27;t sell me one at-cost, or even ship me out one for free as a courtesy.  </li>
            <li> To me it was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> only complaint is about the cost of the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> will spend at least 10 minutes getting my brush back in working order.</li>
            <li> It eats through batteries like CRAZY and doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as powerful.</li>
            <li> I believe that those who complained must have had an earlier version of this one.</li>
            <li> The only slight downside is that it&#x27;s hard to remove the bottom cover to replace the batteries (my husband has to actually do it for me and he has a hard time with it), but the toothbrush works</li>
            <li> For years knew about these and was like - not worth it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the loudness.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost..</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time using a manual brush gently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That would be my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> I also wanted to be able to travel with it and not carry around a charging base.  </li>
            <li> I have pushed the toothbrush into my stomach in hopes of getting the cap on and I&#x27;ve put the brush on the bathroom sink and forced it on by using my entire body weight.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about bringing charge base and plugging in, etc at the hotel now that I travel more for work.</li>
            <li> When it reaches 2 minutes, its vibration becomes slow, and you can definitely feel it.  </li>
            <li> The motor won&#x27;t slow down when battery power gets too low</li>
            <li> certainly not what I&#x27;d like to use for everyday brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, it uses less toothpaste than a conventional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Cavities have gone down.</li>
            <li> Stays cleaner than the ones that sit on a base (those get so gross) but batteries go out quickly since I use it a lot</li>
            <li> Holding the thing upside down keeps everything neat.</li>
            <li> I had come down with a case of gingivitis to the degree</li>
            <li> If you have a toothbrush holder, you should place it upside down, not letting the water seep into the battery</li>
            <li> And at these prices, great.&lt;br /&gt;one of the advantages is that you can pack the batteries separately and avoid running down the batteries accidentally by bumping on the switch, which happens with the rechargeable model.</li>
            <li> I bought two pcs, both broke down after the two-month warranty expired.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I resolved the problem with Amazon, and got a refund and got the seller shut down, but it bothered me that I was having to do the work for this, rather than the company selling the toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> After one month it slows down or stops while brushing.</li>
            <li> update in the future on reliability...but based on past experience with Oral B brushes, I don&#x27;t expect any problems!</li>
            <li> This product works very well, except that it replacing the batteries is extremely difficult because the compartment is too tight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Brush head is very small, takes longer to brush than larger models&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very small head and low speed</li>
            <li> It uses two AA batteries, so it is on the heavy side, but is extremely well built and should travel well.</li>
            <li> I have been using it with the rechargeable for about a month and a half</li>
            <li> Why buy rechargeable more expensive units where the battery will fail prematurely then you are out your investment.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have had - this one failed after only two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less messier</li>
            <li> My comparison is to the previous Oral B brush model I owned for years before it was dropped and broke.</li>
            <li> and I bought it less than 2 months ago....</li>
            <li> I have the previous version of this toothbrush and have been using it for about a year.</li>
            <li> had already stocked up on the brush heads on a previous trip to Costco so buying this was a no brainer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasted for less than 5 months.</li>
            <li> simplier and less clutter to use rechargeable batteries than the models with a stand charger.</li>
            <li> This is less than half the price of a rechargeable battery model...</li>
            <li> I bought this as an upgrade to my previous Oral-B electric toothbrush (without a timer).</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just affective, plus the replacement brush head 50% less than Sonciare.</li>
            <li> Typical, 1900mAh Minimum, 1500 cycle, 8 Pack AA, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]].</li>
            <li> Much less than I paid for it years ago.</li>
            <li> toothbrush has become unserviceable after a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a noise or something else, but it does this thing like the battery is going out, which was odd.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with a rechargeable Oral B model and noted that this one is slightly heavier and spins at a reduced speed.</li>
            <li> One quarter after I have used it, my dentist told me that my teeth had less buildup than before.  </li>
            <li> It is hidden by the cover</li>
            <li> (d) the option to replace just the battery if the battery is the reason for the product dying (e) slightly cheaper toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> (d) the option to replace just the battery if the battery is the reason for the product dying (e) slightly cheaper toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> I typically store my toothbrush, and brush for that matter, in the shower.  </li>
            <li> My previous rechargeable tooth brush had to have a cord system and added clutter to the sink area.  </li>
            <li> so very much less than those models</li>
            <li> It has less power than my rechargeable (also a Braun Oral-B)</li>
            <li> and you can even feel your teeth having less plaque then before.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost one and half month now</li>
            <li> My previous Oral-B battery powered toothbrush lasted forever (7 yrs).  </li>
            <li> This lasted me less than two months.</li>
            <li> I bought this less than 6 months ago, and already 2 months after I bought it</li>
            <li> /&gt;-LONG lasting, I mean close to 1 month of everyday brushing using</li>
            <li> i dont have to work as hard or as long.</li>
            <li> first it felt a bit awkward and reminded me of a dentist visit I had in the past&lt;br</li>
            <li> Water has leaked into the battery compartment, rusting the contacts--especially the spring coil that connects the two AA batteries, and making a mess of the rechargeable batteries I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the ones with the small round brush only, but there are dual-action types also if you prefer those, and at least one other type.  </li>
            <li> I like the ones with the small round brush only, but there are dual-action types also if you prefer those, and at least one other type.  </li>
            <li> But having to replace only after a few uses is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> However, it gets really messy with toothpaste and spit running down the device while using it.</li>
            <li> It was on way too tightly -</li>
            <li> But for our family (on a tight budget) there is no question.</li>
            <li> The weak point is the battery compartment lid, but the previous one did last for 2 years and a month.</li>
            <li> Putting in new batteries is is insanely difficult.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write such negative reviews, but this product deserves it.  </li>
            <li> it goes at half speed for a few seconds ...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a single negative thing to say about it.  </li>
            <li> I shake it a little bit and can hear something chugging but</li>
            <li> i got this for my little brother and he loves it...</li>
            <li> a FURIOUS little worker-</li>
            <li> It still works, but a little awkward.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price of this little beauty.</li>
            <li> My dentist can&#x27;t believe how little plaque I GET USING THIS TOOTHBRUTH.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know Braun still made this little baby.  </li>
            <li> I used a little vaseline and a piece of electrical tape to seal the battery compartment and don&#x27;t see any evidence of water in the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> I started used it in Jan 2011, so it life-cycle is about a little over 2 years.</li>
            <li> I find I brush longer and pay closer attention to each little tooth with this Oral-B thingy.</li>
            <li> Well, I use a regular toothbrush rather than this weak thing.</li>
            <li> for my situation (little bench space in bathroom)</li>
            <li> Sad, especially since we don&#x27;t need to be making more plastic trash. :(</li>
            <li> Bought these for my kid&#x27;s because the &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; power toothbrushes are a joke and die after a few weeks and you are unable to get new heads for them.</li>
            <li> I highly do not recommend this oral b toothbrush unless you like brushing with a child&#x27;s slow motorized toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had used a sonicare for past few years but picked this up online due to the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I like the little round brush for this model.  </li>
            <li> this brush needs 2 aaa batteries, so it&#x27;s a little heavy for holding, but</li>
            <li> also thought it might be a little gimmicky.  </li>
            <li> Brushing the front of your teeth in particular is tedious with the small brush head.</li>
            <li> I think I wore this battery down!</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but still a little irritating.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the battery can be hard to replace.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well for 4 months then kept cutting off while using.</li>
            <li> We have an Oral-B rechargeabke toothbrush at home, but it is inconvenient to bring along when we travel -- especially to countries with different voltage.  </li>
            <li> I threw it away and am now ordering the ones that the battery goes dead after about three months.</li>
            <li> Thought maybe it was shipped with a dead battery, but that didnt help either.</li>
            <li> few things strike me immediately -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, the brush completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Reaches difficult to reach areas ..better than dual action</li>
            <li> The one I received worked for a few days then</li>
            <li> As well, the brush is heavy and bulky, and seems underpowered for a two battery brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I began using an electric toothbrush a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I use the round head instead of the elongated.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a round head on it and spins in a circular motion.  </li>
            <li> That way you don&#x27;t have to change batteries until they are completely dead.</li>
            <li> used it a few times, then forgot about it.  </li>
            <li> Today, after a few weeks of not using it, it would not power on.  </li>
            <li> Dead batteries?  </li>
            <li> Odds are it will be DOA or die on you after a few users.  </li>
            <li> It took a few days for him to realize I wasn&#x27;t trying to kill him -</li>
            <li> It might be twice as heavy and twice as shakey as the Vitality line (whose brush heads</li>
            <li> This brush is garbage, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Fifth, I&#x27;ve been recharging AA alkalaine batteries for a few years and using them in this toothbrush, but now I&#x27;ve moved to NiMH (nickel metal hydride) to see if it makes any difference.  </li>
            <li> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I leave the decision to you.for a few years and using them in this toothbrush, but now I&#x27;ve moved to NiMH (nickel metal hydride) to see if it makes any difference.  </li>
            <li> The batteries provided were dead</li>
            <li> The cap would just not fit again.  </li>
            <li> using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> I had spontaneous gum bleeding, horrible breath, and was already losing some teeth.  </li>
            <li> had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> Since the batteries are removable, you can use different set of batteries until the toothbrush broken.</li>
            <li> If you want to save the environment and you don&#x27;t want to throw dead batteries into garbage cans</li>
            <li> Not to harsh</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s running, it will just stop and make a clicking noise for a few seconds</li>
            <li> then (maybe) start up again for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> but since I have quite a few AAs batteries lying around the house</li>
            <li> Maybe the batteries are dead</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended just the one, round spinner and that&#x27;s what this has.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite a few months now.</li>
            <li> 2x batteries last me approximately 4 months with a pair of duracells (as per my usage).  </li>
            <li> We got tired of lugging our electric toothbrush charger with us when we travel, it&#x27;s just so big.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> It seems wasteful to throw out a functional toothbrush when only the charger is broken.  </li>
            <li> It seems wasteful to throw out a functional toothbrush when only the charger is broken.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are not cheap, but you can&#x27;t put a price on that just-came-from</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t waste any money on this one</li>
            <li> Water got inside the battery compartment and it stopped working within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I also got one for my 88-year-old father who has trouble brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stopped working within a few weeks because the batteries were expired.</li>
            <li> BUT - (reason for the missing star)</li>
            <li> Chinese origin of the moving parts and consequent assembly methods may be the culprit behind the string failures with this type of brush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> After using this brush as indicated for a few weeks, I visited my dentist who told me that my brushing habits were causing my gums to recede.</li>
            <li> I found an Oral B electric toothbrush on the internet for $20 that I&#x27;ve had a few years.  </li>
            <li> The batteries went dead after a few times of use.</li>
            <li> few things strike me immediately -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottom cap can be irritating to open however my husband has no problem</li>
            <li> least with this when the battery fails, I replace the battery not the whole toothbrush.</li>
            <li> That comes to just $2.04 less than the cost of the brush, head and batteries!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush uses the same refill brushes that other expensive models use.</li>
            <li> I also threw out my original one after about a year and tried a different brand electric toothbrush, it was terrible!</li>
            <li> Too clunky, bulky, and just plain rickety</li>
            <li> This is the first bad review I&#x27;ve ever written on Amazon, I&#x27;m not a problem customer dont waste</li>
            <li> Thus it is not easy to return the product.</li>
            <li> It covers very less area..</li>
            <li> But it has one major defect in battery section: after some time of work when you make a replacement of batteries the battery section cap failed to close.</li>
            <li> But the heads are expensive, and I&#x27;ve had three major problems with</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hated the small little itty bitty button to turn it on and off.</li>
            <li> For me the battery cover comes off and goes on with very little trouble.  </li>
            <li> I like that we have two different appearing brushes, but would go with less expensive Oral-B if it was just myself.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I should have anticipated that it wouldn&#x27;t be as powerful as what I&#x27;m accustomed to, but I was still disappointed.</li>
            <li> Is brush head is small and round though vesus my sonicare&#x27;s sort of rectangular shapped brush head.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to remove and can leak or break if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Gets in and around every tooth because of the small round brush.  </li>
            <li> and I just felt like my mouth was never clean!</li>
            <li> in all, I don&#x27;t have too much of a complaint, considering that the toothbrush has already lasted a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> The least expensive I have found so far has been a pack of 3 from Wal-Mart for $15.00.</li>
            <li> But the batteries don&#x27;t last long and the cap on the bottom is very difficult to remove to change the batteries.</li>
            <li> I am pretty amazed at how sold I am on the little round head brushes - I went into this purchase expecting to hate it.</li>
            <li> My little one is not complaining!</li>
            <li> However, the bristles are a little hard on the gums.  </li>
            <li> The small head on this brush</li>
            <li> Both of my Braun toothbrushes are comparable, with small differences.</li>
            <li> Both of my Braun toothbrushes are comparable, with small differences.</li>
            <li> Am not sure if the seller&lt;br /&gt;sent</li>
            <li> It is no better than a $3 Spin brush.  </li>
            <li> It has just a small brush that spins around</li>
            <li> bought this as a replacement to the one I have had for 3 years it had a small cracked on one part.  </li>
            <li> No more words are needed.</li>
            <li> but, when they fail, you have lost several times the cost of&lt;br /&gt;the battery driven model.</li>
            <li> is so big it would be uncomfortable for me to use.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the dual head, but got my wife this one who prefers the small head.</li>
            <li> After Amazon failed to deliver two day delivery item they resent and it finally came.  </li>
            <li> When you get use to it, you will never use ordinary toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Amazon usually suggests the &amp;#34;Generic Oral B Compatible Brush Head Replacement for Oral B&amp;#34; which is NOT compatible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s past &amp;#34;Amazon&#x27;s&amp;#34; return date -</li>
            <li> I like these electric toothbrushes, but I find them difficult to open to get the  batteries in</li>
            <li> Amazon rocks as usual.</li>
            <li> but i think the head of brush is too small</li>
            <li> Unbelievably low-powered.</li>
            <li> I usually use a sonicare but bought this one for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I used the product for may be a month, and then I am not able to replace the batteries.  </li>
            <li> The entire product is now useless.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this was a manufacturing issue, but I just opened mine, and used it, when you put the batteries in, it starts vibrating automatically and does not stop even when you click the button to stop.</li>
            <li> only reason i give 4 start that the brush parts are expensive.......</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is difficult to open.</li>
            <li> The Tip of the brush is too small to use.</li>
            <li> Use these to brush my small dog&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> The small head for the toothbrush allows you to control where it goes.  </li>
            <li> Aggressive brushing is not better brushing.</li>
            <li> I like that the batteries are replaceable,  but the brush is way too small.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: If your lazy you shouldn&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, this inexpensive option with AA batteries is so weak by comparison, that it is destined for the drawer with other items that we might use after a nuclear war is over.</li>
            <li> head is kinda small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few days a month for at least two years, and</li>
            <li> If I use that gum brush with the yellow paddles on the rechargeable, it is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> : cannot disable timer and the bristle head is small.</li>
            <li> the brush head is small but u can change that</li>
            <li> just keeps on going and and dont stop till u figure it that it wasent a short and the lame time and isent realy timer if none of this bothers</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 of these in the past 8 months.  </li>
            <li> I am lazy and it helps.</li>
            <li> The head of this toothbrush feels too small.  </li>
            <li> I usually need to replace the battery after three weeks of continuous use.</li>
            <li> Not sure of description on Amazon...</li>
            <li> However the battery compartment cover is difficult to take off and put on, and has actually cracked.  </li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> It has a 3 minute timer, though I usually go past the the three minutes.  </li>
            <li> Battery door can be incredibly difficult to pry off, but batteries really last though.  </li>
            <li> Usually need a pliers or something</li>
            <li> Every time I change the battery, it is difficult to open the compartment.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems with parts not fitting.</li>
            <li> Brush head is too small...</li>
            <li> it is the small, circular brush head.  </li>
            <li> It seems to get into areas that are difficult with the larger brush</li>
            <li> So now I must look and see if I can find the small, circular brush with the easy-screw battery cap.</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> Both of my Braun toothbrushes are comparable, with small differences.</li>
            <li> Both of my Braun toothbrushes are comparable, with small differences.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because: (a) it uses the same heads as the ordinary Oral-B toothbrushes, (b) it uses regular AA batteries, which means I can use my rechargeable AAs</li>
            <li> They seem to have improved the cap over the battery compartment - it&#x27;s a little less frustrating to remove and replace.</li>
            <li> The hum it makes when running is slightly annoying, and solicits some odd looks from others if you&#x27;re in a public restroom, but for the price I think I can get over the strange buzzing.</li>
            <li> on off button often not responding!&lt;br /&gt;- very hard (often impossible) to open and close back the bottom cap when it&#x27;s time to replace the batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Round brush is very small.</li>
            <li> The battery chamber seals well but can be perfected by applying a thin layer of vaseline or other grease around the O-ring of the lower snap out section.</li>
            <li> one negative is that I always find the battery compartment difficult to open on these OralB brushes.</li>
            <li> The second time using enough force to close the brush caused the base of the brush to crack.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even more difficult replacing the base.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a crap shot but at least you get two fresh AA batteries.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never easy!</li>
            <li> However, I emailed Amazon and another was shipped very quickly at no charge!</li>
            <li> I got this as an alternative to our main rechargeable toothbrush for when one of us is sick or when I travel.</li>
            <li> It  gets to hard to reach parts of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It comes with a hard bristle.</li>
            <li> I had never used an electric toothbrush before (age 77 -- habits die hard).  </li>
            <li> the replacement heads were hard to get.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you press too hard, it just stops.</li>
            <li> Battery cover is still really hard to get off but cleaning the inside of the cover helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I no longer brush too hard and cause myself pain.</li>
            <li> For the price, hard to beat.</li>
            <li> It cleanse the hard to reach places and</li>
            <li> Alas, the little pushbutton switch died this AM.</li>
            <li> people complained about it being too hard.</li>
            <li> If your sick and tired of buying rechargeable toothbrushes with internal batteries that quickly loose their charge capacity and can&#x27;t be replaced, then this toothbrush is for you.</li>
            <li> The brushing power of this product sucks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But our biggest complaint is that 90% of the time, the darned brush WILL NOT START.  </li>
            <li> sucks.</li>
            <li> but I figured I had to at least try something</li>
            <li> My dentist reccomends electric toothbrushes to prevent gum recession, and for me at least it works.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid about bringing all of the extra adapters etc, so i bought this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of travelling lately, and miss my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I didnt order the rechargable one like I meant to, but I was desperate to replace my last oral b rechargable</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never liked the idea of having to leave it out on the counter and unprotected all day while it is charging.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;would recommend it for everyone to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> They are just common batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no nice.</li>
            <li> This $11 version is still going after at least two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are at least three types of brush heads for the Oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> There are at least three types of brush heads for the Oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> In order fro this to be a five-star product, I&#x27;d like to see (a) dual voltage chargers at least offered as an option</li>
            <li> In order fro this to be a five-star product, I&#x27;d like to see (a) dual voltage chargers at least offered as an option</li>
            <li> So distracting and clumsy to have the brush with a cord by sink.</li>
            <li> it includes the batteries AND a toothbrush, replacement toothbrushes are at least $7 a piece.</li>
            <li> But when the batteries start to lose power, the toothbrush loses its cleaning power.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s two months the product is working well for me, using it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush&#x27;s package was totally broken and it was missing a battery.</li>
            <li> : It Spins too slow and stops sometime when given pressure.</li>
            <li> after using few times one of my tooth is broken</li>
            <li> The number of times it went to slow increased as did the length of time it stayed in slow speed.  </li>
            <li> Since, leaveing AMAZON PRIME my shipping is slow.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable unit has always run slow.</li>
            <li> But toothpaste does accumulate on the a bit difficult to clean charging device, at the base of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so I suggest everyone to buy it and brush your teeth everyday !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out why the other toothbrushes are so expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to the previous line of Vitality brushes (which had a simple induction recharger base), the Pro-Health Battery line uses two AA&#x27;s (not AAA&#x27;s as stated in their description) to power the brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head on this is very small.  </li>
            <li> I have to use a screwdriver with a very small head.  </li>
            <li> With a crack down the side, water enters and corrodes the batteries, and soon both the batteries and the toothbrush are useless and have to be thrown out.</li>
            <li> Seriously, of all the devices that you would want to travel with, isn&#x27;t a toothbrush the #1 one?  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mess with expensive rechargables.  </li>
            <li> battery cover a little difficult to remove, but wouldn&#x27;t prevent me from purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush failed after a little over a month.</li>
            <li> It drives me mad every single time changing batteries.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the one I had was a fluke with a bad switch or something; I don&#x27;t know, and I hesitate to buy another one of the same model, although I will probably get another Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Too bad I left it during my vacation.</li>
            <li> but I fear I may have the same bad luck.</li>
            <li> Battery life stinks pretty bad</li>
            <li> I became incredibly frustrated with the internal battery models dying 12 to 18 months after purchase.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not good...</li>
            <li> had tried a Philips Sonicare toothbrush a few years ago but was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Not a good option.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality dead out of the box.</li>
            <li> I got the Oral-B to try, but extremely disappointed, so I&#x27;m going back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Weak bristles in the head.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment!  </li>
            <li> Oral-B has an electric toothbrush powered by 1xAA battery, but the power output is weak.  </li>
            <li> faulty and motor weak.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow!</li>
            <li> Using manual toothbrush, you need to keep brushing and it is very hard to do detail work even if you have 100% compliance from your dog.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to remove the batteries from the unit to handle them</li>
            <li> - it is almost impossible to get it closed.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality all around, seals weak, electronic timer</li>
            <li> Out of the box, for me it&#x27;s a bit tough.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to using one that charges with a wall socket vs. one that is battery operated only, you&#x27;ll find this product very disappointing.</li>
            <li> you can help; help; if not, at the very least, do no harm to no one&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The vitality rechargeable brush gets very slow after 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> Gunk will build up under the brush head, which is a little nasty, but probably not a big deal except to germaphobes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s poorly assembled and</li>
            <li> ol tired.</li>
            <li> and they expect me to run around printing out labels to return a product they shipped me broken.</li>
            <li> Poor performance.</li>
            <li> and it got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> The cover is poorly designed and flimsy.</li>
            <li> my dentist said that these are actually worse than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The on-off switch button is broken.  </li>
            <li> so I replaced them after a frustrating struggle with cover.</li>
            <li> Approximately 1/3 the cost of the entry-level Oral B 1000 model.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been frustrating.</li>
            <li> This is the least expensive electric toothbrush from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Told her my battery toothbrush had broken</li>
            <li> Frustrating, and do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so tired of things that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have an extra base to lug around with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> yes, it is a little difficult but put some muscle into it ladies!</li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> Not worth it, was bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  always used the least expensive model since I see no difference from the expensive ones, unless you are looking for \\&quot;extras\\&quot;, like timer, lcd screen, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to remove the base prior to replacing batteries.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are not cheap (about $6.50 each in a package of three), but instructions say to change every 3 months, so cost impact is not so bad.</li>
            <li> Total disappointment :-(</li>
            <li> When it wouldn&#x27;t work and I had to use a regular toothbrush I hated it.</li>
            <li> One less charger base in the BR.</li>
            <li> It works, but is very weak.</li>
            <li> The straight-bottom cap to insert the batteries was extremely difficult for me to grab.</li>
            <li> The on-off switch failed on both.  </li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t brush wrong with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird since both springs are on the cap</li>
            <li> so it feels a bit weird.</li>
            <li> Battery cover removal sometime can be difficult.</li>
            <li> I visit my dentist every 6 months without fail</li>
            <li> it began to stop spinning when I was brushing my teeth randomly</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I shopped online.</li>
            <li> and the it he brushes are so expensive.</li>
            <li> It was hard-wired and difficult to replace.</li>
            <li> The heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> I was not used to the speed at which it failed, after 3 weeks it was useless.</li>
            <li> Because traveling with a rechargeable unit can be difficult, I purchased this battery operated toothbrush specifically for travel.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with</li>
            <li> but replacing batteries is overly difficult.</li>
            <li> item received was broken!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that it has a clutch to prevent injury and that has failed.  </li>
            <li> I was using the Sonic care electric (Phillips I believe) for over 10 years but the heads were expensive.</li>
            <li> They take up counter space, are expensive and they die eventually anyway.</li>
            <li> My expensive rechargeable unit broke so</li>
            <li> but I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price .</li>
            <li> Is the toothbrush head is too expensive,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want an expensive toothbrush with a rechargeable battery that would eventually burn out.</li>
            <li> Both failed within 2/3 months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the few changes the base cracked and rust set into the battery contacts and rendered the toothbrush useless.</li>
            <li> SO i tried YET ANOTHER in a different brand, and that was also awful.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find and a lot of fake ones on Amazon</li>
            <li> If you just want the benefit of oscillation-rotation cleaning and not a bunch of fancy but useless features, get this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> To me though, this is a sign that maybe the toothbrush heads are too expensive.  </li>
            <li> If they weren&#x27;t so expensive, there wouldn&#x27;t be demand for counterfeiting them, right?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate waste</li>
            <li> I hate waste</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> But the heads were too expensive to replace.  </li>
            <li> And for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Still getting used to electric toothbrush, but Oral-B products haven&#x27;t failed me yet.. recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to know what replacement head to get.  </li>
            <li> The battery compartment cover becomes increasingly difficult to remove as time goes by.  </li>
            <li> page has shown a wrong</li>
            <li> then found I bought 24 wrong batteries.</li>
            <li> Then it is difficult to  close the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> What else can be said about this useless product ?</li>
            <li> No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Works as well as the expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;Standard</li>
            <li> Why buy the expensive ones...</li>
            <li> I have to admit Sonicare brush head is too expensive that why I tried Oral B Pro 1000(rechargeable).</li>
            <li> You know, an expensive one?</li>
            <li> The battery lasted a mere two years before refusing to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> They work just like the expensive models except it doesn&#x27;t have the timer to tell you when to change the area you are brushing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Oral-B refuses to use screw-on battery covers and instead uses squeeze-on ones.</li>
            <li> The straight-bottom cap to insert the batteries was extremely difficult for me to grab.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> i had written about the oral b electric toothbrush that did not work,  i was wrong as i have discovered that the two batteries were not placed correctly.  </li>
            <li> (Boy is developmentally delayed with very poor oromotor skills).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very poor performance.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> The packing then was very poor and the items were almost falling out of the packs when I got them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both mine and my husband&#x27;s are very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Purchased the battery operated to take away on a trip as I didnt want to travel with a manual toothbrush or my usual brush with base and powerpoint charging.  </li>
            <li> but the toothbrush is very shaky making it very uncomfortable while brushing.</li>
            <li> The base is hard to remover</li>
            <li> It is awful, and rough on my gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrible with battery life, half the brush head broke off in my mouth while I was brushing.</li>
            <li> Quite a disappointment.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m crazy.</li>
            <li> it is so difficult to change battery!</li>
            <li> After a month, the timer totally go mad.</li>
            <li> The small brush head can get into the smallest places and get to all that nasty debris that collects.</li>
            <li> I do use Energizer Lithium AA batteries which are stupid expensive</li>
            <li> very uncomfortable in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Opening it to insert batteries is very difficult.</li>
            <li> one gripe, the base cap to exchange the batteries are difficult to take off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cap at the bottom that lets you access the battery chamber connects with a catch on each side that are very difficult to engage.  </li>
            <li> Opening the product so as to insert two batteries was the nearest thing to impossible.  </li>
            <li> Of course, this time removing the end piece proved impossible.  </li>
            <li> Replacement of batteries is almost impossible.</li>
            <li> However, the battery cover is impossible to get on.  </li>
            <li> I saw the bad reviews for this item before buying and thought I would take the chance.  </li>
            <li> Asi not buy this brush bad investment ...</li>
            <li> no problems with it at all, read the battery part was bad but got it and have had no  prob.</li>
            <li> Never had a bad Oral B product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too bad.  </li>
            <li> but the motor always ends up bad on these things.. or atleast on the 2 that i have bought.</li>
            <li> Bad design.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and will try to return it.</li>
            <li> Still, this shouldn&#x27;t happen, and I&#x27;ve lost my money here... :(</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed to realized it was powered by AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I tried the Vitality model before but was disappointed the charge would gradually diminish over time so that you have to charge it</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so you never leave a dirty spot!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> VERY disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and one of the cap is already broken!!!</li>
            <li> The stupid thing doesn&#x27;t stay on while brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> so i will keep typing regardless of the stupid system.</li>
            <li> Stores in the medicine cabinet and no charging base or cord to deal with.</li>
            <li> I think this is annoying.</li>
            <li> With batteries inside, pressing the two tabs at the base will cause the door to spring open.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because I needed to travel and could not find my spare charging base for the Oral-B Pro-Health toothbrush I use at home.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I hate brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> then the home base units though but affordable .</li>
            <li> The cap will go on the base in either direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can spend thousands of dollars on a Sonicare toothbrush but your dentist is still going to hate you.  </li>
            <li> I like how well it cleans, and the battery life, but I hate trying to change the battery</li>
            <li> After using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years, I hate to go without, even when traveling.  </li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 stars however, removing the base to change the batteries</li>
            <li> but is annoying when you are out of batteries and have to make a trip for your toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The way to solve the problem is to use plumber grease, KY gel or non petroleum base lube.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t beat the crap out of my gums and cause bleeding/gum receding.</li>
            <li> Purchased for travel so I would not have to carry a charging base.</li>
            <li> Bad move!  </li>
            <li> Again, Bad move!  </li>
            <li> I hated having chargers in my bathroom as they look unsightly.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> But when I opened the box I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and not going to by it ever again.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Oral-B came along and proved me wrong!!!  </li>
            <li> PLEASE Oral-B, correct the wrong doing!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  </li>
            <li> Annoying!  </li>
            <li> That can drive you crazy!!!</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> And crazy I&#x27;m not!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what to say, it is simply awesome!</li>
            <li> It makes brushing a pleasurable experience. I look forward to its relaxing vibration.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, it&#x27;s much better than the other electric toothbrush I had</li>
            <li> Great product.  Inexpensive alternative to electric toothbrushes.  Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> It was so good for me</li>
            <li> The small head on this brush I think its key to the success of this product. It  gets to hard to reach parts of your mouth. Great value! this is my third brush I buy.</li>
            <li> This current version of the old Braun toothbrush looks exactly the same but it&#x27;s poorly assembled and redesigned.&lt;br /&gt;My old Braun toothbrush lasted me for over 2 decades, despite occasional abuse, and was absolutely perfect in every single way.&lt;br /&gt;This new one, however, is of much inferior quality:&lt;br /&gt;- on off button often not responding!&lt;br /&gt;- very hard (often impossible) to open and close back the bottom cap when it&#x27;s time to replace the batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it wasn&#x27;t for those two major flaws, it would still be a perfect brush.&lt;br /&gt;But those two seemingly insignificant details are enough to drive you nuts with frustration every single time!</li>
            <li> goes through batteries really fast when you brush your teeth 3 times a day</li>
            <li> For the price, the value of this electric toothbrush is great.  I bought this specifically for travel since it has batteries, while my Phillips SonicCare eSeries uses a charger (great for home, but not so much when using internationally if you don&#x27;t feel like bringing a converter).  Now that I use an electric toothbrush and travel for extended periods of time, this toothbrush is great.  The timer is a nice touch, it&#x27;s starts pulsating when you&#x27;ve been brushing for two minutes.  It will keep going unless you hit the button if you want to keep brushing for more.  It doesn&#x27;t have quite the same power as a more expensive electric toothbrush, but it&#x27;s good for the price, especially as a backup or travel toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I don&#x27;t love deals with the brush head.  Out of the box, for me it&#x27;s a bit tough.  I did just received a similar brush head for sensitive gums and it&#x27;s waaay better.  You can buy a 2 or 3 pack on amazon.  Also, although it&#x27;s cool you can use almost any Oral B brush head which is great design, there&#x27;s a pointy piece use to connect the brush head so unlike other toothbrushes that come apart in a way that allows cutting the size in half for easier transportation, this one kind of resembles a screw driver.  So basically the one piece is how you&#x27;ll need to transport it.  Also, there&#x27;s no cap for the brush head.  Otherwise, nice product for the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect ...like prophy cup used at dental office.  I preferred the softer heads.  Cleans better than sonic.</li>
            <li> Buy the ones that has already has batteries that lasts about three months.  I had this one where you install batteries a short time. Way too soon I had to replace the batteries, and the compartment door wouldn&#x27;t fit back on. I threw it away and am now ordering the ones that the battery goes dead after about three months.</li>
            <li> Good tooth brush. One AA battery is already included in this product. Every period you need to purchase a new brush head like a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I recommend this toothbrush it&#x27;s the best electric toothbrush for the price and it  dies a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> 5/2013&lt;br /&gt;This is replacing a rechargable unit I left at some one&#x27;s house.  I will update when battery runs out and have to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/2013&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasted a long time, maybe almost 3 months.  I was wondering how my rechargeable batteries would work with this unit.  I have been using it with the rechargeable for about a month and a half and it is still going strong.  I don&#x27;t know what other people are having trouble with when replacing there batteries, but it is simple and easy.</li>
            <li> constant speed and provides great leverage to reach tough places in the mouth. Good for massaging gums as well. This is after using it for a month. No complains!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cheap way to have a electric (battery) tooth brush for travel.  Plenty of power and the battery is still running!</li>
            <li> Works great for my elementary age child.  Dentist recommended it to us.</li>
            <li> Receive product very please a very good price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at target. Not very strong or quick movement. Thought maybe it was shipped with a dead battery, but that didnt help either. A regular toothbrush probably does a better job than this toothbrush. I recommend not purchasing this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush mainly because it was time to replace the brush head on a Braun battery brush, when I saw this. This \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush was about the same price I paid for the Braun battery toothbrush, and decided to try this, instead of looking for the brush heads for the Braun battery toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things strike me immediately -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t understand why this brush is referred to as \\&quot;electric,\\&quot; when both of my Braun toothbrushes run on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- this toothbrush does NOT have a cover for the brush head, as does my older battery version, so traveling with this \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush would/should require devising some other type of cover for traveling. For the time being, I use the brush head cover from my old Braun toothbrush for my new Braun toothbrush. Although not designed for the new brush, it does work, in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Replacing the batteries on this \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush has proven to be a nightmare. The straight-bottom cap to insert the batteries was extremely difficult for me to grab. My nails are not long, but after more than 10 minutes and 1 broken thumbnail, I finally managed to open the battery case and insert the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope these Duracell batteries last a VERY long time, because I don&#x27;t want to go through this again too soon. My older version Braun toothbrush has a rounded battery compartment, which is MUCH easier to grasp, and therefore insert/change batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Found genuine Braun replacement brush heads for a very good price. I read reviews that talk about generic replacement brush heads that are poorly made (in China?), and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the potential risk, so I used a coupon and got a great deal on the real thing. I hope they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this brush has a 2 minute timer, which my older Braun toothbrush does not have. I like the brush head on my new toothbrush, as it&#x27;s able to get into smaller places, and in the back of my mouth more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush. Both of my Braun toothbrushes are comparable, with small differences. When the replacement brush heads run out, and it&#x27;s time to buy more, I may very well buy brush heads for the older Braun battery toothbrush, as it is so much easier to insert new batteries.re easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush. Both of my Braun toothbrushes are comparable, with small differences. When the replacement brush heads run out, and it&#x27;s time to buy more, I may very well buy brush heads for the older Braun battery toothbrush, as it is so much easier to insert new batteries.</li>
            <li> The small, round brush makes it very easy to clean all of my teeth all over.  Sadly, the brush completely stopped working.  I thought it was time for a battery change, but that did NOT solve that problem.  I truly liked this brush, but cannot afford a new brush every couple of months or so.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I find that this inexpensive electric toothbrush does just as good a job as the very expensive brand recommended by my dentist.  The product is light and portable, so it is also good for travel.  The toothbrush is easy to clean, and the batteries are easy to access and change.</li>
            <li> My kids love them.......</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long. otherwise its a good brush. I have to change brush head every two months.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to keep my Pearly Whites white</li>
            <li> My family travels a lot. We wanted an electric toothbrush that we can take with us everywhere we go. We found it! We don&#x27;t need to worry about voltage differences and AA batteries are available even in the remotest parts of the world, so it is perfect for us!</li>
            <li> I love it, my teeth and gums looks so much healther now  and my Dentist is glad I started using as it does more strokes than manual brushing.</li>
            <li> Why buy rechargeable more expensive units where the battery will fail prematurely then you are out your investment. Sure if you are good with a soldering iron, can find how to crack the case open without damaging it you can put a new battery but having done it I can tell you it&#x27;s not worth the hassle. Check ebay for bulk brushead lots they are way cheaper than drugstores etc..These work fine on rechargeable aa&#x27;s if you don&#x27;t want to feed it regular batteries.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my plug in Oral-B toothbrush because it was no longer able to hold a charge.  I also wanted to be able to travel with it and not carry around a charging base.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity, but it seems just about as strong as the plug in version.  I only wish that it came with a larger brush head, because the small one seems to take so much more time to get each tooth clean! From what I understand, I can replace it with a larger brush head when the time comes.  For the price, I would definitely recommend this, especially if you are coming from using a manual toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It is what it is, a toothbrush.  It works well.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues.  Teeth feel clean and polished after every use.</li>
            <li> Such a great toothbrush, what I love is how it feels like it is cleaning in the part you can&#x27;t reach with a regular toothbrush, it&#x27;s a great purchase</li>
            <li> Have been using the dual action clean for the last one year ..Awesome this one is better ..Reaches difficult to reach areas ..better than dual action</li>
            <li> Beware! This product is non-returnable! The one I received worked for a few days then stopped working. I had ordered one previously and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Very effective and great price.</li>
            <li> Wife said it&#x60;s good,so i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush, works perfectly! Should be cleaned often</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush&amp;#34; works great in my opinion.  Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I switch to a powered toothbrush.  After looking over the options and reading up on some of them, I went for the lower-cost toothbrush.  I have been very happy with this.  Still running off the initial set of batteries, so it&#x27;s got long life and my teeth are noticably cleaner than with a regular toothbrush.  More expensive brushes and different technologies may be better, but for me, for now, this was the right choice.</li>
            <li> The packet was already open and the batteries were flat. Am not sure if the seller&lt;br /&gt;sent me a used tooth brush or it was just old, exposed and contaminated.</li>
            <li> Bought this battery toothbrush to replace an Oral-B electric than would not hold a charge any longer. I actually like this brush better. It&#x27;s got a more comfortable grip and a lower pitch \\&quot;whine\\&quot; than the electric one. Batteries last a decent lenghth of time. I have checked the battery compartment and have no issues of water leakage, etc. Stores in the medicine cabinet and no charging base or cord to deal with. Very handy to travel with. I would buy this brush again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The brushing power of this product sucks. I&#x27;ve been a satisfied Oral-B electric toothbrush user for over 10 years. And I bought this product to replace another oral-b brush, but one with a charger. If you&#x27;re used to using one that charges with a wall socket vs. one that is battery operated only, you&#x27;ll find this product very disappointing. I had no problem opening the battery pack and tried replacing the batteries several times with new ones, but the brush head just sounded like a slow buzz and had no power at all to make my teeth feel clean. A big thumbs down.</li>
            <li> This power brush is perfect for my mouth which is small.  I have tried larger brush heads and they don&#x27;t even begin to fit and clean but this small, round, brushhead fits perfectly and cleans thoroughly.  I do hope sincerely they will continue to make this battery-powered Toothbrush because I also have a pacemaker and can&#x27;t use the electric because they put magnets in both the charger and the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write such negative reviews, but this product deserves it.  Using some coupons I had, I bought two of these brushes, one for my adult son and one for myself.  We immediately noticed that this is not a vibrating toothbrush, rather, the two motions of the brush are rotating and reciprocating. There is no vibrating effect. As well, the brush is heavy and bulky, and seems underpowered for a two battery brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But our biggest complaint is that 90% of the time, the darned brush WILL NOT START.  At first we thought the batteries were loose, but this was not the case, as the motor would work if you removed the brush head. It seems as if the motor does not have sufficient starting torque, because if I wiggled the brush bristles to loosen them, the brush would then start. Just try wiggling the bristles with toothpaste already on them...not fun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of this bad experience, my son dumped his brush, but I am more stubborn, and still using mine to return my investment. There must be better battery powered brushes out there.</li>
            <li> I thought this toothbrush would be like my Sonicare electric toothbrush and be good for traveling.  It is no better than a $3 Spin brush.  It has just a small brush that spins around so I don&#x27;t get why anyone would buy this vs a drugstore spin brush.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have had - this one failed after only two weeks of use.  The on-off switch failed on both.  I like the idea of being able to use rechargable batteries, especially when traveling, but if it won&#x27;t turn on, it is useless.</li>
            <li> This is a great battery powered tooth brush for the price.  It has a steady rate for cleaning, fits well in the hand, holds a decent amount of toothpaste and, especially great for anyone with a small mouth, isn&#x27;t too big.  I have no problem reaching my back teeth with the smaller head of this toothbrush or angling it around to ensure a good cleaning.  Plus, it&#x27;s easier to rinse off/clean than another battery powered toothbrush I owned.  I like the fact that the bristles change color as well, reminding me when I need to change the brush head.</li>
            <li> I began using an electric toothbrush a few years ago.  I struggled to keep with it because it seemed to take so much longer, but really, it didn&#x27;t.  I hung in there and found my dental check-ups were getting better and better.  I highly recommend this particular toothbrush for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is just what kids need to get a really clean set of teeth. They can&#x27;t brush wrong with this it&#x27;s small enough to fit in there mouth and has replaceable brush heads and is battery operated it&#x27;s just great . I bought cheap foil stickers for my daughter to decorate it with and she loves brushing with it. For the price and peace of mind her teeth are getting cleaned well it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> This fits the bill.  I was looking for a battery operated toothbrush because I travel in my car quite a bit.  The other brushes I&#x27;ve seen in retail stores did not look as powerful as this.  I use this mainly at the gym and when I&#x27;m on the road. Impressed with the overall quality, very sturdy and more than enough power when charged.  Fast and free shipping, no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and it lasted way over a year without even having to replace the batteries. I replaced it with a more expensive model, but it has served me well. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase as this low price. The brush head rotates back and forth. More expensive rechargeable models will have much more power so they will brush much more efficiently in the same amount of time and they also vibrate. If you are on a budget, you can buy this one, otherwise look at the oral-b professional 1000 (all the models are the same except for extras you don&#x27;t need).</li>
            <li> exactly what I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li> Up until about a year ago I have always used a normal non-powered toothbrush. They get the job done, but this Oral B powered toothbrush takes it to another level. My mouth feels noticeably cleaner and I cant see myself ever switching back to the manual style. When this one wears out, I will probably upgrade to a higher end rechargeable version. But for now this is great and highly recommended if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> I like it. I have a rechargeable toothbrush but I always use this battery one when travelling. The battery life is great! I&#x27;ve used it for about 50 times and I haven&#x27;t had to change the battery.</li>
            <li> bought this as a replacement to the one I have had for 3 years it had a small cracked on one part.  I love this brush it always gets my teeth super clean.  A dentist recommended I use one of these a few years back and once I started I could never go back to a normal toothbrush.  You will be amazed at how much cleaner your teeth are from this brush and it works just as great as ones that have a bigger price tag.  My dentist even comments on how clean my teeth :)  a.lso you can get the replacement heads at bj and they last a really long time</li>
            <li> I just took this out and put the batteries in it. I did have to use the brush head for my other electric toothbrush since I ran out. It comes with a hard bristle. I put the batteries in the same way and if you look close around the edge, you will see that one positive goes down and the other up. It&#x27;s weird since both springs are on the cap but that&#x27;s how they go. The buttons is a soft on/off and there&#x27;s no click so it feels a bit weird. It is not as tall as the other one I bought so that&#x27;s nice since I will need it for a trip now. I wished these portable toothbruses came with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li> I love the brush, and the battery convenance. BUT, the cover is the pits, hence the one star. I honestly thought I was breaking it, due to being in a rush, or just plan ol tired. But after the 5th time, enough is enough. PLEASE Oral-B, correct the wrong doing!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my kids works great. Better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> As a former dental hygienist with the same dental practice for 44 years,&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this battery operated toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great  job along with making the mouth feel good. if one keeps it in the mouth for the two minutes and moves it over all of the teeth during the time.&lt;br /&gt;There are many different brands on the market, however this is less costly than many and if used properly does an excellent job of providing good dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> ***Just an update: If you do not like sonic toothbrushes like me,  this  one is for you. Very affordable; it has  a 2 min time built in; a set of 2 AA alkaline batteries last close to 2 months without the loss of speed (some technology built-in do that), but make sure you grease  battery cap o-ring before you close or it will crack after some time (it happened  to me); it lasts  forever  and it does the  same  job as  the  much more expensive Oral-B in the market. Dito.&lt;br /&gt;I have posted the same review for the oral-b vitality toothbrush, but it is related to the pro-health model as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth wih oral-b for over 10 years now, and they are all similar to  the vitality model.  I&#x27;ve  always used the least expensive model since I see no difference from the expensive ones, unless you are looking for \\&quot;extras\\&quot;, like timer, lcd screen, etc. The vitality is a very good brush. I use the round head instead of the elongated.  I rather brush my teeth with oral-b than any other eletric brush on the market. The sonic kind hurts my gum and it tickles a lot as well. Oral-B  entry level eletric brushes are the way to  go. I can&#x27;t brush my teeth with regular toothbrush anymore. Brush heads are cheaper on ebay but saty way from the  cheap kind. They are knock-offs  and last less  than a month. The ones at walmart/amazon and such last 3 months or more. The bad  thing about the vitality rechargeable and all the older  oral-b I own is that you need to  recharge it after 3-4 days of 2-3 daily brushings. I think this is annoying. I didn&#x27;t want to leave the brush recharging after every use. So I bought the ORAL-B Pro-Health that uses two AA batteries. It is simply AMAZING. The quality is the same as the rechargeables, but it is even better. The batteries lasts forever on the pro-health. I put 2 rechargeable AA (2000 MA) and the thing kept  going and going without a noticeable lack  of power for a good 2 months. It is the best.  The vitality rechargeable brush gets very slow after 3-4 days. Not with the pro-health. Buy the  pro-health. It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design. Another thing is ORAL-B equipment lasts forever. I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me. And since they are the entry level brushes, I just buy another one of  the same. No need to buy another battery.&lt;br /&gt;Again, go with the ORAL-B PRO-HEALTH eletric toothbrush.slow after 3-4 days. Not with the pro-health. Buy the  pro-health. It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design. Another thing is ORAL-B equipment lasts forever. I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me. And since they are the entry level brushes, I just buy another one of  the same. No need to buy another battery.  Again, go with the ORAL-B PRO-HEALTH eletric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT TOOTHBRUSH.  SO VERY, VERY POWERFUL!!!  I THINK IT IS THE BEST I HAVE EVERY HAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had expensive electric toothbrushes and other battery operated ones - the best out there - but this is so much better than any I have every owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had trouble getting the top off to put in the batteries.  It was on way too tightly - even my cleaning man - a strong man - had a bit of trouble.  I did NOT have enough pressure.  I always worry about damaging my thumbs because . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did damage my thumb joints (both) once trying to take off a cap of baby aspirin.  Go figure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions on the baby aspirin said it required two thumbs to lift on both sides and I really hurt my thumb joints on both hands - still not quite healed after almost a year.  I never successfully got the top off - someone else did it for me.  If our 4 year old granddaughter had been here, she  would have been able to take off the childproof cap for me.  That always seems to be so very funny to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just telling this as I think sometimes you forget your buyers are not all young and as strong as a four year old.  Smiling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the toothbrush!  I am ordering more.  The BEST EVER!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x60;ve ever owned. My whole family has one. Cavities have gone down.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and I think this is the best thing happened to my teeth since my birth. I&#x27;m 31 years old and my teeth structure is prone to hiding food particles. I had to use toothpicks and floss regularly to keep them clean. I&#x27;m using this brush since last 1 month and I must say \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know what was holding me not to buy this product earlier. I think everyone should be using this product to better take care of teeth health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive reviews here at amazon helped me to buy this product and hence I&#x27;m leaving my feedback also so as to encourage those who are still undecided. Go for it, it might be one of the best buys of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-11/10/2014: So, after using it for 4 years, this brush is still going strong and gives me the same feeling which I got after first use. I&#x27;m glad that I found this product and that there are companies which make these type of products. My love with this product continues...</li>
            <li> This inexpensive battery powered toothbrush works just as well as the much more expensive rechargeable version that it replaced.  I am running mine with Eneloop rechargeable AA batteries which last more than two months per charge, with about two minutes of brushing per day.  I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I have never lived in the sort of house or apartment that had counterspace near the bathroom sink -- or anywhere else in the bathroom, for that matter -- on which to keep electrical appliances such as a rechargeable toothbrush or a WaterPik.  I always seem to have a pedestal sink or a very tiny vanity, in an old-fashioned bathroom where only flat surface is the top of the toilet tank, unless I&#x27;m lucky enough to have a window and sill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that reason, I love the new battery-powered electric toothbrushes, even if they don&#x27;t seem to last very long before neither new batteries nor a new brush head will bring them back to life. And for the first 58 days that I had it, I loved the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean best of all. The round head cleaned my sensitive teeth gently and efficiently, and the two-minute timer was very practical. But then it suddenly died in mid-brush, and new batteries would not get it working again. I even tried yet another set of new batteries, but it still would not work. Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund before the 60-day deadline (I bought mine at CVS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, battery-powered toothbrushes usually last more than two years  before they completely wear out, but this one did not last two months. Perhaps the one I had was a fluke with a bad switch or something; I don&#x27;t know, and I hesitate to buy another one of the same model, although I will probably get another Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean as well as other oral-B products. But it will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I put toothpaste on it and turned it on.. big mistake.  After I cleared the toothpaste out of my eyeballs, nose, face and washed the mirror I tried it again but I put the brush in my mouth before I turned it on.  It&#x27;s a lot less messier that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said.. It spins really fast.  It&#x27;s got a round head on it and spins in a circular motion.  I feel like I can get a more thorough brushing with the circular head because it does each tooth individually.  With this brush I can give more attention to any particular tooth easier too.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be rating a toothbrush but i lke this one a lot. It really does a great job, not only cleaning but massaging your gums. Having RA, even the simple act of brushing teeth can be a problem and this makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Never have used a battery powered tooth brush before. I do fill like it cleans my teeth better then when  I use a regular tooth brush . My teeth feel so much more cleaner and I always thought I did a pretty good job until I got this one. I would recommend it .</li>
            <li> This is a battery operated toothbrush using two AA batteries.  This product came with the batteries which was very convenient.  It&#x27;s powerful just like my electric Oral B toothbrush that needs recharging every week.  I bought this because it uses the same refill as my electric toothbrush.  It works great!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that is reasonably priced. This is my third Braun tooth brush which has served me well for the past five years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for travel, after purchasing the Oral-B Professional 3000 rechargable brush for home.  I liked the rotating action and effective cleaning as opposed to the Sonicare models I had used for many years.  I was pleasantly surprised by this battery toothbrush.  I actually like it better than the rechargable model. The brushing action is smoother and quieter.  If I had purchased this brush prior to purchasing the rechargable model, I would have stuck with this instead of spending much more $ on the rechargable.  Using rechargable batteries would make this a fairly inexpensive brush to own. I find that my teeth are cleaner, particularly in-between teeth, than when I used a Sonicare.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works almost as well as the rechargeable Oral-B toothbrush.  I do miss the 30 second beep that is on the rechargeable.  The battery life is very good.  I&#x27;m into my 16th day of using the current set of batteries.  I plan to use this toothbrush on vacations and so far it will meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY WIFE&#x27;S TRIP TO UK TO AVOID AC/DC ISSUES SINCE SHE&#x27;S USED TO A CORDED ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH AT HOME. IT WORKED WELL AND WAS A GREAT CONVENIENCE.</li>
            <li> Had this in the rechargeable style for years and was most satisfied. When the internal battery died, was concerned that the replaceable battery model would not measure up but, considering the price, took a chance. After a month of use, can&#x27;t imagine spending more for the wall plug type. We use the best rechargeable batteries for this and, so far, still on the initial charge. The heads from the previous unit will fit my new one. Ordered several more for Xmas gifts.</li>
            <li> The plug in model is outstanding and this is talmost as good.  I use it when I travel and it is the best battery operated that I have ever used. Oral B has other battery operated models but not as good.</li>
            <li> Looks and works just like the rechargeable version.  But the strength of the brush rotating is not as strong as the rechargeable versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are use to using rechargeable one, you will feel a difference when using this one.  It will feel as if you haven&#x27;t recharged your rechargeable one for a while and lost it&#x27;s power.</li>
            <li> This one worked far better than the electric version I had and the batteries last an amazingly long time, It is awesome.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery good product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> Motor agitates bristles slower than desired. I tried fresh batteries with no difference. My comparison is to the previous Oral B brush model I owned for years before it was dropped and broke. If the value of this product was worth sending back I would do so, in hope for the issue to be corrected. I can only imagine after the batteries deplete I will be forced to replace batteries before full use of them. Attachment heads are made in Germany, the brush itself is made in China.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush as much as the older model it replaces ONLY BETTER.  It is far easier to put in new batteries.  The old version was so difficult that I recently threw it away after struggling with it for five years.  THIS, however, is great.  I like the shape better too; it&#x27;s more hand friendly.</li>
            <li> When I had to replace my Oral B battery powered electric toothbrush that finally died after 4 long years of twice-a-day use, I was really pleased when I found a 2 for 1 sale on the Braun Oral-B Pro-Health model.  Other than the addition of the two minute timer, this looked exactly like my old brush; the sale was so good that I bought several of them.  Now I know why they were on sale!  My old brush without the timer worked just fine for several years with yearly battery changes.  After only 2 months of use, the timer function on this new brush keeps kicking in after barely 10 seconds of operation instead after 2 full minutes as stated on the package!  To do a thorough job cleaning my teeth, I have to turn the brush off and wait at least 30 seconds before turning it back on only to have the same problem reoccur after only 10 seconds or less.  To get the full 2 minutes of brushing time now takes 8-10 minutes or more!!!  Of course, this problem didn&#x27;t show up until AFTER the 60 day product warranty had expired!!</li>
            <li> Wont turn on . Straight out of the box busted. All the money I&#x27;ve spent on Amazon and they expect me to run around printing out labels to return a product they shipped me broken. This is the first bad review I&#x27;ve ever written on Amazon, I&#x27;m not a problem customer dont waste you&#x27;re money on this.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job cleaning teeth, even compared to a previous expensive setup. The little timer to remind how long to brush a nice touch.</li>
            <li> This product has been overrated. I went with this because it cheap and has good ratings. This toothbrush was a huge disappointment.  It&#x27;s spin power seem like it was design for a 5 year old. It&#x27;s slow! If you stuck the head into a cup of water and turn it on there is barely any water vibration. Before this brush I had a $30 sonicare which was 10 times better and when I rub my finger on my teeth it would squeak. Too bad I left it during my vacation. I highly do not recommend this oral b toothbrush unless you like brushing with a child&#x27;s slow motorized toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement to my original Braun. Needed a non-rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: This is a great toothbrush. Comfortable to use. Like the 2-minute timer&lt;br /&gt;Con: it is kind of loud&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Very Happy</li>
            <li> Pros: Great functionality. Takes with me during, camping and travel. Wish there was a carrying case available for purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Battery cover removal sometime can be difficult.</li>
            <li> I had never used an electric toothbrush before (age 77 -- habits die hard).  When a dental tech recommended one, I purchased this -- the cheapest available.  Bad move!  Opening the product so as to insert two batteries was the nearest thing to impossible.  Had this been sitting in a warehouse somewhere?  The rubberized materials did not respond to pressure.  The plastic end was immobile.  Pliers didn&#x27;t help.  I thought of using my teeth as gripper, but doubted that would be good for my dental health.  I finally pried the end off with the back of a fine-bladed knife.  The interior was not marked with the customary + or - signs for the battery placement.  It appeared that the wire springs were at one end, so I inserted batteries side-by-side pointed together.  Again, Bad move!  After replacing the end piece with difficulty, of course the appliance would not turn on.  Then I found a one sentence instruction of how to place the batteries -- on a corner of cardboard inner packaging.  Well done, Oral-B -- you hid that quite successfully!  Of course, this time removing the end piece proved impossible.  I thought of returning this piece of junk, but Amazon accepts returns unopened only &amp; in original packaging.  The cost of sending would nearly equal any refund, which would be denied anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, do your customers a service &amp; refuse to stock or sell such rubbish!  I&#x27;m heading for my local  drugstore to eyeball any product I purchase now!</li>
            <li> The Best.  No more words are needed.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work almost as good Asa sonicare. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smaller brush though</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B&#x27;s electric brushes for almost 10 years and the results have been phenomenal. I visit my dentist every 6 months without fail (yes I have dental insurance and bi-annual cleanings are covered) and I have received nothing but praise from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently switched to this model becauser I became incredibly frustrated with the internal battery models dying 12 to 18 months after purchase. This was not due to mechanical failure as the build quality of this Made in Germany product is solid. However the Ni-Cad batteries cannot sustain charges well after prolonged use. I always disassemble the old brushes, remove the AA battery, and run it through a La Crosse charger using the full charge-discharge cycle which brings the battery back to life. However the disassembly of the brush does not permit for its reconstruction so all I am left with is a rechargeable AA Ni-Cad battery for use in other devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this brush is that it has the same great build quality but costs half the price. Additionally, it takes two AA batteries and the unit goes a week worth of brushing without charging while the internal battery models get 3 days maximum when new which slowly falls to every day before needing charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, you get the same cleaning efficacy at half the cost with extended periods between charges. I am hoping that the product&#x27;s life will also extend beyond 18 months further enhancing the benefits of this model versus any Oral-B/Braun model that can cost 10 times as much!! Seems like a real winner and a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> I like this almost a much as my Chargeable Oral-B Professional. It is great for camping trips.</li>
            <li> This is the best battery toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  My teeth feel as if they&#x27;ve been polished after using it.  Love it so much I plan to order the other heads available for it.</li>
            <li> sucks. very loud. very uncomfortable in your mouth. never again.</li>
            <li> Item as stated in sealed package.  I really like this toothbrush and I bought one for my whole family.</li>
            <li> great product and great price</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. For the $13 price... its exceptional value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning action is brilliant. My teeth felt cleaner in just one session.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with AA batteries included. After 3 months of use the batteries are holding up just fine.&lt;br /&gt;- The 2 minute timer is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;- Looks and feels like a much more expensive brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- If you are not very careful about closing the battery compartment properly, there tends to be minor water leakage into the battery compartment which could potentially ruin the battery contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;- Highly recommended! This is the best powered toothbrush for less than $20 period.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  I like that I can use a battery and I&#x27;m not tied to a wall for charging and I can use the replacement brush heads that I already had.</li>
            <li> Motor not powerful enough, was slower than my previous toothbrush of the same make &amp; model.</li>
            <li> I have a similar model from Braun which is much stronger. I tried regular &amp; rechargeable batteries. This model slows down or stops very easily while brushing. Poor performance.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has problems spinning. Mine doesn&#x27;t even work anymore and I bought it less than 2 months ago....it began to stop spinning when I was brushing my teeth randomly and it got worse and worse. It is now to the point where I took the batteries out and have to use it as if it is a regular toothbrush...</li>
            <li> Great deal for an inexpensive little tooth brush...</li>
            <li> It is not really built to last and it stops if you put too much pressure on it.  To me it was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this toothbrush.  It cleans very well and I would recommend this toothbrush.  I find that it is gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> We have been screening for an electric toothbrush for our 4.5 year old son for quite a while, and my son simply love this one. This is the first real power tool that we give him and he enjoys to use.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well and is easy to use. There are rechargeable models but, when they fail, you have lost several times the cost of&lt;br /&gt;the battery driven model. I stick with this model.</li>
            <li> cheap and good version of e-brush. much better money spent compared to the 100+ version</li>
            <li> Yes filled my expectations it whizzes around faster than an electric one.  Very pleased batteries were included.</li>
            <li> This seems to work as well as the more expensive Oral-B it just isn&#x27;t rechargeable and doesn&#x27;t have an LCD display. It uses the same heads and oscillates almost as fast but costs a lot less. The batteries seem to last for a while but you could try using rechargeable batteries. One of the best features is the circuitry that boosts the voltage of your batteries as they age in order to keep the motor speed constant. That way you don&#x27;t have to change batteries until they are completely dead.</li>
            <li> There Is nothing better than brushing your teeth with the oral b toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush worked great for a year but broke after a year and a week of use.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Okay. This will be the last time I buy this product. Went through several over the years, all due to the battery cap/cover (on the bottom) cracking. This new one lasted only a few weeks and SNAP, it cracked again when the cover was put back on after battery change. The cover is poorly designed and flimsy. I always use rechargeable AA batteries so have to take them out to recharge every two weeks. The cover easily cracks if you are not super gentle and careful putting it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution: buy the rechargeable ones so you don&#x27;t have to replace batteries.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush at first, because the head is perfect for brushing.  But I discovered, like another reviewer, that the batteries very frequently needed changing. And, this toothbrush requires 2 batteries rather than just 1.  Then, after only three months, the toothbrush began to stop and start while I was using it.  Finally, it completely died.  Very disappointing.  I&#x27;m glad another reviewer gave me the idea of getting an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  I might try that.</li>
            <li> This electric, battery-powered toothbrush is perfect for traveling from one country to another. I regularly go from the UK to the US, and this toothbrush means that I don&#x27;t have to bring a charger and a plug adapter. My only caveat is that it seems louder and \\&quot;rattles\\&quot; more than my other electric toothbrushes, but I can overlook that for its convenience.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using a battery operated Oral B toothbrush, but I was looking for another to replace the old one.  All I could find were the rechargeable ones but I have no place in my bathroom to plug and keep the charger.  I looked in lots of stores that sell toothbrushes and on line....nothing I wanted.  There were some but they were either \\&quot;kids\\&quot; toothbrushes or the brush head is so big it would be uncomfortable for me to use.  I like the little round brush for this model.  Amazon to the rescue!!!  If Amazon doesn&#x27;t have it, it probably doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li> This unit purchased was a replacement for the same 9 year old model.  It has traveled the world with me.  The portibility of the unit with battery power is the main feature I like along with the cost and easy brush head replacement.</li>
            <li> Save your money with this Oral-B as it stands up to the more expensive ones.Feels great on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Works nicely and the price is right</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had a Braun rechargeable toothbrush for years. Finally the battery would no longer hold a charge. The instructions show how to replace the battery but after finding this one I began to wonder if it was worth the time, effort and cost to bring the old one back to life. Not only does this one work well but the extra brushes we had for the old one work on this one! And no cords at all so you could use it for travel as well!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this toothbrush.  I had one before, and it was great, but this one cuts out at times.  Even with new batteries.  Could just be that this particular one is a lemon.  Normally, I have had good luck with this brand.</li>
            <li> Love the way my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> I saw the bad reviews for this item before buying and thought I would take the chance.  it is cheap electric toothbrush after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received it, the power seemed anemic.  I chalked it up to having used an Ultrasonic for long too and having forgotten what a normal Oral-B vibration feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it a few times, then forgot about it.  Today, after a few weeks of not using it, it would not power on.  Dead batteries?  I replace them.  Still same.  I listen carefully and hear the faint sound of high pitched vibration.  But the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t rotate at all.  I shake it a little bit and can hear something chugging but still no toothbrush moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sending this back because it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and skip this product.  Odds are it will be DOA or die on you after a few users.  I get it, they want to make a disposable product you have to replace.  But having to replace only after a few uses is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Great price. Just wish it was a bit more powerful</li>
            <li> does the job. really enjoy the feeling.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for the money. This brush is better than the one&lt;br /&gt;I got from my dentist. I like the 2 minute timer feature.</li>
            <li> my son loved and i recommend any one to buy it</li>
            <li> It is what I wanted works great</li>
            <li> I purcahsed the \\&quot;Oral-B Pro-Health Battery Tootbrush \\&quot;  and charged it over night (more than 12 hours).  The next day on my first use, the toothbrush lost its power before the 2 minutes was up.  I charged it again and the same thing happened in the evening and the next few days.  This must be a \\&quot;reject quality\\&quot; product.  Unfortunately, I shopped online. Thus it is not easy to return the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ony had it for 2 days, and it has worked pretty well. This morning when I brushed my teeth though it stopped when I pushed down. I let up and it continued working, but hopefully this was a one time issue. I like the fact that it came with batteries, and it&#x27;s a little bigger than it looks in the picture. That&#x27;s good for me though, because I was almost worried about it being too small.</li>
            <li> Perfect for introducing brushing to  3-5 years old kids.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use Duraell AA rechargeable batteries and have had no problem with opening/closing the battery compartment to change the batteries. This is my second one I purchased over the past five years.</li>
            <li> Impressed with this brush.  I&#x27;ve used manual (nonelectric) brushes all of my life. This one vibrates and the heads swivel rapidly in a 30-45 degree arc.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with the battery compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of this brush is superior to the similarly priced Sonicare model. It does NOT vibrate as much, but the smaller (round) head makes this brush so much easier to use.  You have to get use to the idea of brushing a &amp;#34;tooth at a time&amp;#34;, and not sawing across abunch of teeths.  The Sonicare (Philips HX3631/06) vibrates much more, but it hurts when it hits your teeth (and you WILL hit your teeth, because it designed like a manual tooth brush head!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if the brush rotations are helpful, it seems the vibration is what makes these &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type brushes good.  Regardless, this brush with the precision clean head feels wonderful along the gum line. It would be nice if they provided a switch to control vibration.  The Philips model&#x27;s vibration is much stronger, but the design lends itself to you hitting your teeth on the plastic.  I am pretty amazed at how sold I am on the little round head brushes - I went into this purchase expecting to hate it.</li>
            <li> The brush is very solid for a price. Nice quality plastic, thick rubberised grip, asures that the brush will not fall from a hand. Also there is a simple 2 minute timer build in, which is quite convenient.  The brush head does extremely good job, cleaning teeth and space between them. The manual brushes are nor even colse to it. I bought this specific model, because the brush itself is quite compact. There is no charging docks. Great little brush.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this and I liked it so much I ordered one for myself. You can&#x27;t beat this toothbrush for the price. We used to have electric ones that were more expensive and this one is every bit as good. We&#x27;ve been using the same batteries for almost 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints. We&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> the low price and the good quality</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush very much. I&#x27;d give it a five except I would have liked it to vibrate faster. But it did the job and that&#x27;s the most important. even the batteries that came with it worked! Yea! cause I forgot to pack batteries for my trip which is why I bought the brush to begin with. It came as expected, on time and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my second one, well pleased with my $12 investment 14 months ago! Alas, the little pushbutton switch died this AM. Lemme see.. One user, twice daily X 14 months...that&#x27;s 840 cycles, yes? With the $2 automatic coupon, the new one is actually CHEAPER than the old one! Runs just fine on AA NiCads, charge lasts about 10 days. Never needed to replace the brush head. NOTE! Wet the battery cap O-ring with your fingertip or you will never get it back on!</li>
            <li> The first one that we bought did not work but for a short time.  It just stopped.  When I called Amazon they were nice enought to credit my account and send me another one.  So far the second one has kept going.  I guess time will tell.  Maybe the second time will be a charm!!</li>
            <li> i got this for my little brother and he loves it... he said it cleans his teeth all the way inside since the head is smaller so it is much more cleaning and comfortable for him</li>
            <li> I get rave reviews from the dental hygienist</li>
            <li> Great product! Next time you will continue to buy</li>
            <li> It was delivered right on time. But when I opened the box I was very disappointed. The toothbrush&#x27;s package was totally broken and it was missing a battery. I had to throw it away because how can give my child to use such thing, it might be used by someone else before us. So , I bought a garbage for my own money. I am very disappointed and not going to by it ever again.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter electric toothbrush for kids and/or anyone.&lt;br /&gt;It works with a simple 1 button operation with a 2 minute timer.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great and I like the fact that it runs off two double a battery that lasts about 6 months &amp; are very easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that the handle is not bulky like a lot of electric toothbrushes that are designed &amp; marketed toward kids.&lt;br /&gt;This makes the 3rd one that I have purchased. My son destroyed the first one (toddler) and we are still using the second one. I bought the third one for use when he goes to Grandma&#x27;s house.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is about the cost of the replacement brush heads. The least expensive I have found so far has been a pack of 3 from Wal-Mart for $15.00.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush! Works very well! Great for cleaning well in hard to reach places. Plan to order another soon.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!!!! It leaves teeth very clean and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for almost 10 years now and I&#x27;m not going to switch.;)</li>
            <li> This is a defective unit.  When battery compartment was opened after 2 months&#x27; use, new batteries were inserted.  The compartment refused to click shut.  Fresh batteries were inserted correctly, as they worked when sufficient hand pressure was placed on the compartment.  My son worked on this but the spring device, or whatever, refused to hold the compartment shut.  I am contacting the maker to request a replacement.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush massage the gums well.</li>
            <li> We have had the Oral B rechargable toothbrush at home for about 30 years.  Love it!  Had 2 battery powered travel toothbrushes for about 20 years.  Finally corroded at the battery area.  Needed replacing.  Absolutely love the efficiency of the toothbrush in getting to all cavities in the mouth, gentle yet effective.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Works great, strong toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My DH and I must be the last people on the planet to get automatic toothbrushes.  So, not sure how this compares to other automatic toothbrushes, but we love them.  My teeth feel so much cleaner since I started using this puppy!  I love the automatic timer as I always thought I was brushing my teeth for a long time, but this is for sure better and a longer time.  We got a good price on these from Amazon.  Very happy customers!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. I have 2; 1 for home and 1 for travel. It fits a variety of heads designed for it and has lasted really well. I had my last one for 8 years. Oral B is an excellent product. My dentist knew when I first started using the battery Oral B toothbrush, because my teeth were cleaner, my gums were in excellent shape, and the plaque I always get on my lower teeth was much diminished.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, who had been lamenting that she needed an electric one for vacations and such. She&#x27;s quite happy with it, and was pleased to discover that the batteries and head were both replaceable. As for my own experience with it, I prefer the Sonicare-style brush head; this one has a particularly thicker post, which combined with the odd channels in it seem to make for a fair amount of drooling while I brush. Not exactly a big deal, but certainly not what I&#x27;d like to use for everyday brushing. Still, it&#x27;s an excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> I have the previous version of this toothbrush and have been using it for about a year. Had one before that, but dropped it and the battery cap cracked (used that for several years). I prefer the dual head, but got my wife this one who prefers the small head. The 2 minute timer makes it easy to brush the proper amount of time and since I&#x27;ve been using these my Dentist has complimented me on how well I maintain my teeth. I like this style because you can use regular AA batteries or rechargable AA batteries (which is what I use). The charge usually lasts more than a month. Also, because it&#x27;s not hooked to a battery charger I can keep them out of sight in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake</li>
            <li> my dentist recommended an electric tooth brush, but they were very expensive, so I thought I would try this, and so far I am so happy with it, works great, gives you the feeling of a professional cleaning you get at the hygienist.</li>
            <li> I also have the high end Oral B electric toothbrush.  I actually prefer this one though because it&#x27;s compact and I can change the batter.  In addition, it is more gentle on my gums yet still cleans well.</li>
            <li> Many years ago a colleague recommended getting a braun electric toothbrush (he insisted on Braun) and after having strayed into other brands and thrown them away because they are not as good, I am sticking to Braun toothbrushes. Battery-operated models are sometimes hard to find, and yet they are more practical for taking on your travels. The Oral-B heads are also the best.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel but would not recommend for daily home use.  I don&#x27;t think it is as powerful as the regular rechargeable ones even with new batteries installed.</li>
            <li> Pretty good after a week of use. I absolutely feel a benefit over using a regular brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works well. I haven&#x27;t had one cavity since using it. The only reason this product did not get 5 stars was because of the difficulty in changing the batteries. I dread when the batteries die! Once they die it means I have will spend at least 10 minutes getting my brush back in working order. I have to clean the removable cap and the bottom of the toothbrush in order for the cap to go back on. After cleaning the parts the real fun begins. It takes all I have to get the cap back on correctly. I have hurt the heel of my hand pushing the cap on. I have pushed the toothbrush into my stomach in hopes of getting the cap on and I&#x27;ve put the brush on the bathroom sink and forced it on by using my entire body weight. Nothing works and it&#x27;s never easy! I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for almost 2 years and the only reason I&#x27;ve stuck with it is because they work so well and the it he brushes are so expensive. I have considered buying a more expensive brush more that a few times.</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth super clean and freshens my breath. It&#x27;s incredibly loud and the replaceable heads can be expensive but it is a cheaper electric toothbrush and considering the health benefit of clean teeth, totally worth it. This is my second one, my first last a very long time though.</li>
            <li> An essential for healthy teeth, rarely found at a price like this - go for it!</li>
            <li> the pacage cames without the battarys. I didnt understand. and its to noisy while using.</li>
            <li> Oral B is the reason , at 68 , I still have all my original teeth with no cavities</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;takes standard batteries&lt;br /&gt;enthusiastic cleaning action&lt;br /&gt;seems well made and sealed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;Brush head is very small, takes longer to brush than larger models&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great buy. recommended!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and was what I expected. Perfect when you don&#x27;t have a convenient outlet and definitely worth the switch from manual.&lt;br /&gt;The one negative is that I always find the battery compartment difficult to open on these OralB brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> Great price. Small head works great for me.</li>
            <li> Not bad. However I though the surface area of the brush would have been bigger.</li>
            <li> I bought two. My husband&#x27;s died in two weeks due to water leakage. TWO WEEKS! Mine no longer works because the battery compartment cap is STUCK. I couldn&#x27;t pull it off even with someone else helping me.&lt;br /&gt;For those who are planning to buy this: YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</li>
            <li> it is good one . light not heavy my kids start using it .</li>
            <li> This is a first rate cleaner and make brushing so much easier.</li>
            <li> After Amazon failed to deliver two day delivery item they resent and it finally came.  I wanted a quality electric toothbrush battery operated so I could use in South Africa.  this was perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Honestly, when I bought it I set it aside for months before I got the courage to try it. I&#x27;d just always used a manual toothbrush. I got it because I wanted to be able to experience that after-the-dentist visit clean more than just twice a year. That and of course not having to worry so much about plaque and cavities. I go over each tooth as if I were polishing it and my mouth feels much cleaner than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many more expensive electric toothbrushes out there, but if you use this properly and take your time, I don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> Works well, useful for travel</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar for a power toothbrush as my personal experience with them hasn&#x27;t been good (the internal battery eventually loses its ability to retain a charge - happens long before the motor begins to burn out).  Opted for this one after reading the reviews.  No complaints as it brushes well.  Not a huge fan of the smaller brush head, so I&#x27;m going to probably opt for the dual clean that fits this brush, but besides that I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great price and my son loves his Oral-B</li>
            <li> This a great compact and portable battery toothbrush.  Love the fact that it uses rechargeable batteries and have had no problems at all.  Great price too!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Oral-B brushes for my daughter, since she is handicapped and can&#x27;t brush her own teeth. I can now go gently into her mouth and get areas a larger brush can not. I am satisfied with the cleaning as is my daughter&#x27;s dentist when we take her in for professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> best $11 I&#x27;ve ever spent.. after multiple $100+ toothbrushes.. I got this one and a 5 pack of heads for $15... and it&#x27;s just as good or better.. can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much money for so long.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my lunchbox so I can brush after lunch at a construction site</li>
            <li> Pros: Ideal for a beginner of electric toothbrush. No need to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It Spins too slow and stops sometime when given pressure. Even best Duracell alkaline batteries can not last more than 3 weeks with 4-6 mins usage per day.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for work and I like to limit what I bring with me as much as possible.  Having this toothbrush that does not require a charger stand is very nice.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!!. My first oral-b (which I loved) battery died. It was hard-wired and difficult to replace. This one is even better with the timer and easier to handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a re-chargeable oral-b toothbrush for many years and this product works just as well or better with 2 AA batteries. I&#x27;ve used the brush for about 3 weeks twice a day on the original batteries with plenty of power. The chargers eventually stop working so I&#x27;m hoping this product will last longer and be more convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li> Worth the money and the round head is dentist recommended because it reaches your back teeth and gums !</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I had one that cost me $150.00 that did not work as well as this brush.  The power in it is awesome.  Your teeth will feel so clean with each use.  A product you will not regret buying at a great price!</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush.  I can&#x27;t ever get the timer to work (at least I never notice a change in the level of rotary speed) but it is still a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good brush, the shortcomings I can verify are: (1) needs a thicker O ring to sufficiently protect from water leaking to the batteries, and (2) motor begins to slow and weaken as the batteries run low. But overall good as long as you&#x27;re mindful of water spills (or you replace the O ring)!</li>
            <li> it is good ,and easy useful. i like it.</li>
            <li> You get far more than what you pay for with this brush. I bough mine at least 8 years ago as a travel brush because I use the more expensive rechargeable Oral-B brushes at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;1 It does an excellent job at cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2 The battery lasts for a very long time (about a year).&lt;br /&gt;3 I don&#x27;t have to worry about chargers (chargers use energy and also cost a certain amount).&lt;br /&gt;4 It is so inexpensive and efficient that I don&#x27;t worry about the cost of replacement AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;5 If mine ever breaks I would not hesitate go and buy a couple more.</li>
            <li> When you get use to it, you will never use ordinary toothbrush again.There is always deal on this item, so maybe you can wait for the deal before buying one.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral B electric toothbrush line, my teeth get really clean.  I needed one that my brush-heads would fit on, but that didn&#x27;t need to be plugged in to the wall.  When we moved to this house I didn&#x27;t realize the outlet in the bathroom only worked when the light was on.  This means plugging in my toothbrush doesn&#x27;t recharge the battery.  I tried keeping it in the bedroom, but that didn&#x27;t work.  With this toothbrush I don&#x27;t need to plug it in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great!!!  I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet and it&#x27;s been weeks, now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, I&#x27;m going on a vacation soon and I can take this with me and know my teeth are getting really clean even while I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and it is useful! It cleans better than the original tooth brush ! Teeth is very important for us so I suggest everyone to buy it and brush your teeth everyday !!</li>
            <li> Great product so far, I am finding this product is more effective than usual toothbrushes. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but try to use it every next day. It perfectly brushes hard to reach teeth. For the price it is being offered, it is perfect tool to have with you, especially when you traveling.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush worked very well during the first two month. Then it stopped working for no reason....I changed the battery and brush head, but it still didn&#x27;t work. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush of all time</li>
            <li> Great stuff worth the money. Good alternatives.</li>
            <li> I bought it to travel with since I already have one that is rechargeable at home.</li>
            <li> Even this toothbrush is not expensive, I was surprised by the result. From the first use, I felt my tooth much cleaner and whiter. Besides the fact that it uses batteries gives you freedom as you can move around without cable limitations. Then it is also useful for people who travel as you dont need to carry different outlets. I am really satisfied by this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Braun one I&#x27;d had for 6-7 years.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find that it included a 3 min timer - a great way to shame you into brushing your teeth for the recommended amount of time!&lt;br /&gt;I had already stocked up on the brush heads on a previous trip to Costco so buying this was a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;I like the AA battery power as I have a bunch of rechargeable ones around.</li>
            <li> drspite so many poor reviews, this is the perfect toothbrush for my 9-year old. Easy to handle &amp; the small INTRCHANGEABLE head keeps him from overdoing ot with the toothpaste. The speed &amp; pressure is good, and does NOT stop or slow on applying to teeth or my own finger. Just as good as my own more expensive rechargeable model.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but felt compelled to. My dentist was trying to sell me his $130 toothbrush (same price on here too), but I thought I&#x27;d try this one out first.  I don&#x27;t know how that one could  be 10 times better for the money.  I especially like how the brush heads are small and fit to the back of my molars. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> The head wears out pretty quickly for my usage. Been using it twice a day and for only a week, but the toothbrush head looks like it is quite worn out and needs to be replaced. Will try it for a while more before deciding if it is worth buying the heads for it. The heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the price!</li>
            <li> So far this works very well</li>
            <li> This is a really great value.  Get all the benefits of an electric toothbrush without the high cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using arm&amp;hammer battery powered tooth brush and I think this one is better than what they make. Like it.</li>
            <li> I used a manual toddler tooth brush until Boys&#x27; first dental visit at 20 months. He had an incredible build-up of plaque which Dentist attributed to his insane amount of drool (counterintuitive, I know). (Boy is developmentally delayed with very poor oromotor skills). The hygienist specifically told me an electric toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t help but I figured I had to at least try something different.&lt;br /&gt;  For a while, I&#x27;d just switch heads on my rechargable OralB and bring it over to the changing table (I brush his teeth lying down) but that got old quickly. This looked perfect because it used the same heads I already had [[ASIN:B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] and didn&#x27;t require an outlet nearby. It took a few days for him to realize I wasn&#x27;t trying to kill him - thankfully, he loves the taste of toothpaste. We are now 1 month away from his next appt with no obvious plaque build up which I have to attribute to this brush. As a bonus, this provides the type of oromotor stimulation that will ultimately help him to stop drooling so much.</li>
            <li> Needed an electric toothbrush for my extensive travelling, this was perfect not as strong as the one I have at home but it work great and it doesn&#x27;t eat battery power too quickly!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant improvement since using this toothbrush. It is a good started toothbrush for someone who isn&#x27;t sure if using an electric toothbrush will make a big difference without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;It does make a difference and I&#x27;m glad I started with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these. They all died at some point, probably because water got inside the toothbrush through the battery compartment. Even with new AA batteries, they wouldn&#x27;t function. I had to bite the bullet and buy one with the wall charger, which unfortunately only runs on 110V and is thus not suitable for travel, unlike this AA-operated model.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B with batteries instead of rechargeables. I had a regular Oral-B for years but eventually it stopped recharging - like most devices you don&#x27;t get unlimited battery life. So I replaced it with this that takes 2 AA batteries which of course are inexpensive and can be replaced for the life of the brush. So far both work perfectly and get my teeth much cleaner than manuals.</li>
            <li> A great value for the price. It&#x27;s surely one of the best ones if you don&#x27;t care about bells and whistles. Been using it for like 30 days and didn&#x27;t touch my previous (old style) toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;Update after ~4months of use. It&#x27;s still great, but be careful if you are buying replacement heads. Amazon usually suggests the &amp;#34;Generic Oral B Compatible Brush Head Replacement for Oral B&amp;#34; which is NOT compatible.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews. I had an Oral-B (non-rechargeable) that I loved and used about a year. I thought this was the same thing. It&#x27;s the rechargeable kind and sometimes has trouble starting when I push the button which I find odd. Once going does a good job; holds up well so far. Great price.</li>
            <li> I have had this battery operated toothbrush for more than a year.  I purchased it as a replacement for an Oral-B electric toothbrush that died after about 10 years of use.  I love the round shaped brush and did not want to go to a different brand with a different shaped brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after reading the reviews, I purchased this one.  I love it.  It does everything I need it to do, travels well, AND is very easy on batteries.  I had visions of having to replace batteries every couple of weeks, but they last for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have an issue one morning when I pushed the button and the unit did not turn on.  So I replaced the batteries.  Still did not turn on.  I thought I would have to trash it, but before I threw it away I took off the brush unit and noticed a bit of grit (I mix baking soda with my toothpaste) around the metal thingy that makes the toothbrush move.  I cleaned that off and rinsed out the inside of the brush, stuck it back on, and pushed the button again.  It started up like a champ.  I changed the batteries back to the old ones and the brush still worked.  So now I make sure I rinse the inside of the brush and wipe the metal thingy.  I have had no problems since then.</li>
            <li> my dentist said that these are actually worse than a manual toothbrush. I have to agree -- after the first time I used this one, my teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean. I continued to use it for several months thinking that it was somehow still better, but a few cavities later I decided to throw it away. Save yourself some time and dental bills and get a Sonicare :-)</li>
            <li> no charging, take along a couple of batteries, great for travel, a bargain at the price and a must for good oral health.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush to use for travel purposes.  We just took a trip for the first time last week since purchasing this.  I opened the brand new package and put in the batteries - the switch is broke and the unit will not work.  It&#x27;s past &amp;#34;Amazon&#x27;s&amp;#34; return date - so I&#x27;m just out of luck.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done for a reasonable price as compared to some models costing 5 times the price.  A little hard to open battery compartment but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband, who likes it very much. I like that we have two different appearing brushes, but would go with less expensive Oral-B if it was just myself. This one requires two batteries and takes up more space; however, it is highly effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Good price, and the quality is ok, but nothing very impressive. The brush head is a little bit smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after I changed the batteries twice. Lasted for less than 5 months.</li>
            <li> very good toothbrush, i love it. does what it says it does</li>
            <li> 1- Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush is defective.  The on-off switch button is broken.  I would like to return the defective one for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I hesitate between 3 and 4 stars.  I love this tooth brush but find myself throwing it out every month or so.  I used this tooth brush when it was shaped just  a little bit differently and it lasted for yrs.  I would eventually through it out because it didn&#x27;t look so very nice any more.and the replacement heads were hard to get.  I love the small round rotate brush and it does a good job.  But since the design has changed  I have gone through 3 or 4 of these all to the same end.  as soon as I change the batteries I find the tooth brush not working properly,  it is like the batteries are going dead even though I just put in a fresh set.  The tooth brush spends more time off then on while i&amp;#34;m trying to brush my teeth making it very frustrating.  I tried other brands of tooth brushes and finally have given up and came back to this one.  Since these are relatively cheap I have just stocked up on them and when the battery needs changing I don&#x27;t even bother to put myself through the frustration I toss them into the garbage and get a new one.</li>
            <li> Broke within one month!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it any better than boostjuice already has, the Oral-B Pro-Health Battery line are a great series of alternative electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the previous line of Vitality brushes (which had a simple induction recharger base), the Pro-Health Battery line uses two AA&#x27;s (not AAA&#x27;s as stated in their description) to power the brush. The gives it a heavier weight, although you do get a more consistent motor strength. The motor won&#x27;t slow down when battery power gets too low, it will just stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the Pro-Health motor, it&#x27;s pretty powerful. It shook my hand as much as Oral-B&#x27;s pulsar brush line and is about as powerful as a video-game controller vibrating motor. This was a significantly more than the Vitality line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro-Health does have a neat water-proof battery compartment, and a little petrolium jelly will not only water-proof it further, it will make opening the thing easier when there are no batteries inside. With batteries inside, pressing the two tabs at the base will cause the door to spring open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom-line: the Oral-B Pro-Health Battery line is a powerful, affordable toothbrush. It might be twice as heavy and twice as shakey as the Vitality line (whose brush heads it is still compatible with), but it&#x27;s also half the price and offers the consumer the convenience of swapping out batteries.</li>
            <li> It drives me mad every single time changing batteries. And it can be cheaper as you&#x27;ll have to pay much more money on those brush heads.</li>
            <li> I like the way this toothbrush cleans my teeth, but if you buy it, get plenty of batteries. I think I replace the batteries every two weeks. I&#x27;m going to buy one that plugs in.</li>
            <li> All you need to know is this is a \\&quot;10\\&quot; on a rating scale. Best toothbrush I ever owned for that price.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down the best one. One word &#x3D; Awesome!</li>
            <li> it was as it described..  my teeth are very clean now, i will never go back to manual brushing again.)).  i want to recomend envelope rechargable battay, i pulled it inside and they work already 1 month without charging!!!!!  dont belive in negative reviews here mentioning about breaking bottom, you just have to open it very carefully and everything will be ok.)))</li>
            <li> Good price, strong action, convenient for travel, no wires to tangle or display on counter top. It worked very well for 4 months then kept cutting off while using. I checked charge on batteries, it was fine. I am disappointed and will try to return it.</li>
            <li> The only way this electric tooth brush could be better is if it never needed new batteries.  It is better than the rechargable chorded type because it takes up less space on your bathroom sink and does not occupy a power source.</li>
            <li> I like these electric toothbrushes, but I find them difficult to open to get the  batteries in and sometimes the batteries don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Just bought this after having used conventional toothbrushes for almost 25 years and wow, what a huge improvement! My teeth feel cleaner than ever before (sounds cheesy, but its true!). Here&#x27;s what I think after having used this product for just about 2 weeks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The design is very simple. The battery enclosure is rubberized, stays water proof and the whole toothbrush feels sound and well made. It came with Duracell batteries which was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;2. The cleaning action is fantastic. My gums are quite sensitive but this toothbrush has really gentle bristles that don&#x27;t hurt my gums at all.&lt;br /&gt;3. I love the awesome 2-minute timer that lets you know that you&#x27;ve been brushing for 2 minutes with a slightly different &#x27;vibration&#x27; pattern.&lt;br /&gt;4. Strangely, I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth 3 times a day since I got this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have absolutely no complaints. I love this toothbrush and its a phenomenal buy for the price. Amazon rocks as usual. I noticed that replacement heads are a little expensive but really worth it (make sure they&#x27;re from a reputable seller due to fakes on the market). I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Oral-B Precision Clean line for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/14/2015: HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this even today. WOW, this thing is a FURIOUS little worker- it functions just like it did on day one (4 years ago!). I can&#x27;t really say that about most things I own. I&#x27;m incredibly impressed by the build quality and no-hassle usage since the last 4 years. There is no sign of water damage, nor has the motor lost any speed and the 2 minute timer still works flawlessly. I have replaced heads frequently and its been using the same set of rechargeable batteries that I switched to in 2012. People just don&#x27;t make stuff like this anymore. Teeth are in fantastic condition- my dentist jokes that she makes really easy $$$ off me these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/1/12: I&#x27;m nearing a year and a half of use, this toothbrush is still going strong! I&#x27;m on my third replaceable head and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems. I can&#x27;t believe this product has worked so well for the price- what a value! I&#x27;ve switched to using the Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries and I seem to be getting a lot more use (almost 2 weeks) out of a single pair of batteries than standard batteries so I highly recommend them. My teeth and gums have stayed in fantastic condition since I got this toothbrush. Now I swear by this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/18/11: After almost 6 months of use, this little guy is still going strong! I&#x27;ve had to replace both the batteries and head only once the whole time. Very happy with this toothbrush!! I&#x27;m on my third replaceable head and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems. I can&#x27;t believe this product has worked so well for the price- what a value! I&#x27;ve switched to using the Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries and I seem to be getting a lot more use (almost 2 weeks) out of a single pair of batteries than standard batteries so I highly recommend them.

            <li> The toothbrush head on this is very small.  Reminds of the brush head at the dentist office when they polish your teeth at the end of a cleaning.  Does the job but would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. I prefer the dual clean toothbrush head. I ended up switching them out since the dual clean heads are compatible with this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> stay away from this product!!&lt;br /&gt;we brought two. it is so difficult to change battery! and one of the cap is already broken!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the same design when it first came out, which must be over 20 years ago.  Briefly we moved to the sonic type design but returned because of the cost and performance.  We tried other battery tooth brushes for the kids but it was child play in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it strong enough compared to the charger version with internal battery?  Somebody said so but it depends.  With the charger version the strength depends very much on the usage of the battery (or the motor?).  There is a lot of difference between a new brush and an old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the brand new batteries bundled and then a very old pair of rechargeable batteries (fully charged). The strength is adequate.  I would guess not as strong as a brand new charger version, but better than an old one.  If you really change authentic brush heads every 3 months, then the charger and new batteries are not significant cost to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both versions don&#x27;t lasting forever.  This version has the benefit of being able to use new batteries.  But the motor may be the other reason that the power degrades over time.  We shall see.  Also, the button failed on me for the first time recently (it&#x27;s the cheap vitality).  The axle could rust.  Once the seal (if any) at the axle leaks. Water that leaked in came out stained with something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best part is that the sink area isn&#x27;t clustered by two chargers and wires.  And now it&#x27;s the perfect travel tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I only used this product for a few weeks.  It started out normal but then it slowed down or stopped very easily while brushing.  At first, I thought it was low battery but this issue didn&#x27;t improve after I replaced the battery.  It&#x27;s very poor performance.  I have a similar model from Braun which is much stronger and last very long time (now they no longer make this model).  One difference I could find is that the good one was made in Germany and poor one was made in China.  I am not saying this is the reason but I am certainly recommending don&#x27;t buy this model if anyone is considering.  I will give this a rating of zero star if that&#x27;s an option.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My dentist always comments on how clean my teeth are and healthy my gums are. I live off the grid so I love that it&#x27;s battery operated</li>
            <li> Good solid toothbrush but as with any battery rechargeable toothbrush, beware of bottom compartment rusting. Lasted me long enough for the price.</li>
            <li> using it every day, like the way it cleans</li>
            <li> Stays cleaner than the ones that sit on a base (those get so gross) but batteries go out quickly since I use it a lot</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; electric brushes yet more substantial than the cheap ones ... good compromise ...  best toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Putting in new batteries is is insanely difficult.  My  hands are not strong enough to open and close the cover.  Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I had one of these before and loved it.  It lasted an incredibly long time.  Uses AA battery and easy to replace.  Once you get used to this toothbrush you will never go back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say that the Oral B Electric toothbrush has been my favorite for years. The small round brush head cleans even the most difficult to reach areas of the mouth. I travel quite a bit and just keep this toothbrush in my suitcase.  I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about recharging, especially if I&#x27;m out of the country or camping.</li>
            <li> I think it cleans my teeth well, but it goes through batteries pretty fast. Probably have to put 2 new batteries in it about every 3 weeks. I also feel like it is a little loud, but that just might be because I&#x27;m not used to using an electric toothbrush. Overall, for the price I paid for it, I think it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Works great for my son with his braces. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush died in record time.  I was not used to the speed at which it failed, after 3 weeks it was useless.</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush at first. However, when it came time to change the batteries I could not close the battery compartment unless I took off the 0-ring. Well, I did and subsequently it got wet inside. Even my husband tried to close it with the o-ring in. I just threw the toothbrush away and plan on getting a rechargeable one instead. The last rechargeable one I had lasted for several years.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had this version of toothbrush for over 5 years now.  First one lasted about 3 years, second one about two and just got a new one.  simplier and less clutter to use rechargeable batteries than the models with a stand charger.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  I have bought many Braun products over the years, and most are outstanding.  I have owned Braun electric toothbrushes for years (the kind you plug into the wall) and all were excellent.&lt;br /&gt;But this particular battery operated toothbrush is a very big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;There is very little power, and the brush head doesn&#x27;t rotate enough to clean your teeth.  You&#x27;d be better off using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;If you value clean teeth, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The old Oral-B died after several years. This is simpler, lighter-weight, easier to keep clean, and has so far run perfectly for more than three weeks without a battery change.The price was great! I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I use the rechargeable one for home, but on the road it is a pain to have the charger, especially for international travel.  I take the batteries out when I pack it though, otherwise it may run during the flight....</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery</li>
            <li> The best battery toothbrush. The heads are expensive but you can get cheap Oral-B brand ones from ebay. Lasts a 3+ weeks on my rechargeable NiCd batteries with two 2+ minute uses a day.</li>
            <li> Round brush is very small. But it is poweful</li>
            <li> good and practical yet you have to replace the head much often so i recommend you buy it with the replacement heads</li>
            <li> The single most important feature is the built-in timer, which makes a remarkable difference in one&#x27;s brushing habits (and outcomes).  Mechanically, the thing is well constructed.  It runs for several weeks on a pair of (Eneloop rechargeable) batteries.  The only downside is that the brush stalk has multiple holes that funnel fluids out of your mouth, which can get messy.  Holding the thing upside down keeps everything neat.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well.  In fact, my tooth brush does a better job.</li>
            <li> Good one. With battery in.</li>
            <li> it works fine however the brush part does not have a cover, how can a person pack this in a travel case without  a brush cover , I purchased this only for travel, a total loss ,</li>
            <li> I use an electric rechargeable Oral B toothbrush at home and have been very pleased with the results I get from it.  Because traveling with a rechargeable unit can be difficult, I purchased this battery operated toothbrush specifically for travel.  Wish it came with some sort of stand or holder but, all things considered, it certainly does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush.  Works well and the time is a bonus.  Would recommend it to anyone. It is also good that more different brush heads are available.</li>
            <li> I have bought this for every one in my family, and for friends too. Rechargeable does not make sense....the battery does not last for long, and gives way in a year or two....then the brush is gone for every. And it&#x27;s a hassle to carry a charger...takes up space while travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 AA cells keep a charge for a month. I have rechargeable AA cells that go in my flashlight, toothbrush and GPS. Need to carry just one charger. This is less than half the price of a rechargeable battery model...it&#x27;s makes  sense to pay more less, for a better product.</li>
            <li> I moved from a Crest SpinBrush to this toothbrush from OralB.  The OralB brush has a considerably smaller head.  I&#x27;m surprised how much better a brushing job I am able to do with the smaller head.  This toothbrush came with two Duracell AA batteries.  It does use up even good quality alkaline batteries within 3-4 weeks.  I&#x27;ve switched to using rechargeable NiMH AA batteries which last longer, save money and are kinder to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has a very similar toothbrush from OralB but hers has a recharging stand and a built in rechargeable battery.  Her rechargeable brush cost over $100.  I think this toothbrush and NiMH rechargeable batteries (purchased separately) are a much better value.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much.. am beginner with this electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feature i dont like it is AAA/AA cells based.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel polished every time! Vibrates gums and stimulates them to behave right. Short brush time. Brushing teeth is fun again!&lt;br /&gt;For the price, what a steal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B tooth brushes for years and they work.  This model is particularly well suited for travel but of course it will work fine at home.</li>
            <li> Finally a quality electric toothbrush for the working class, don&#x27;t know about you but money is extremely tight in this economy and spending upwards over $100 on an electric toothbrush is simply out of reach for me.  This affordable, quality made toothbrush will help keep the dental bills away, thank you Oral-B!</li>
            <li> The battery is so easy to crack and makes water leak onside.it makes this toothbrush stop working.&lt;br /&gt;Now i have to find other tpothbrush.of course. Not thia one</li>
            <li> Great value you for the price. Nice design that fits comfortably in the hand and does not slip around when wet.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 6 so far. Been giving them as gifts to my family. Everyone should have one</li>
            <li> It was just a tempting price tag that pushed me to buy this product. After receiving this, i installed the 2 AA duracell batteries and found that product is not working. I&#x27;ve tried using other pair of new batteries but didn&#x27;t worked. Total disappointment :-( i live out of US. I don&#x27;t know what to do with this. Neither i can throw away nor keep with me.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this.  Waited a bit to work it into my daily routine, and really like it.  Gives me that extra touch that I&#x27;ve previously only gotten in a dental chair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful ! but i think the head of brush is too small</li>
            <li> I bought this as an upgrade to my previous Oral-B electric toothbrush (without a timer). My understanding is that you can put different brush heads on this one, but just the precision clean head compared to the dual-action head is a huge improvement in my opinion. The only place it lags a bit is in brushing the tongue/roof of the mouth due to lack of surface area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the batteries have lasted a month just fine, and I have rechargeables ready to go when they die. The timer is a handy reminder that I&#x27;ve been brushing long enough, although a simple &amp;#34;ding&amp;#34; or sound might be better than the brush turning on and off a couple times in the middle of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price, this is fantastic. I haven&#x27;t used an expensive brush to compare it to, but I have no motivation to spend more.</li>
            <li> I used these brushes for many years and have lasted two to more time but this order from Oral-B stop working in less than a month and can not be retornar.Asi not buy this brush bad investment ... ok</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush! Really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> can brush the tooth clean but the voice a little louder.</li>
            <li> Nice battery operated toothbrush at a good price.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but there are certain areas that my manual brush used to clean better. Brushing the front of your teeth in particular is tedious with the small brush head.</li>
            <li> Wow is this perfect for travel, quick delivery as well</li>
            <li> Could be faster, but otherwise I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush after reading the Amazon reviews. It&#x27;s the first battery toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. It definitely leaves your teeth fresher and cleaner than a regular toothbrush. In my case, the handle size took a bit of getting used to. I would recommend this toothbrush to any adult who&#x27;s still using a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Brother says its worth every penny</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush that cleans great between teeth and every time you brush it feels like you just came from your dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of power but still works really well to remove plack and clean teeth.</li>
            <li> My very first electronic toothbrush. Takes 2 aa batteries. It makes my teeth feel great and look great...it lets you know when two min have passed....highly recommended</li>
            <li> Has plenty of power.  Batteries still strong after a month.  Love the timer.  Teeth feel cleaner than with a manual brush and my gums seem to be healthier.</li>
            <li> Fine. My last one lasted a year.</li>
            <li> Great product for price. We use this on our toddler and it has made teeth brushing more efficient easier. Our toddler doesn&#x27;t mind his teeth being brushed as much now. An for the price it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I used several of the earlier version of this product, the only flaw of which was the difficulty of opening the bottom in order to replace the batteries.  This newly designed version is great; access to the batteries is easy.  I followed the advice of the reviewer who suggested that a light application of plumber&#x27;s silicone gel on the seal ring would eliminate possible water leakage into the battery chamber, and this has worked well.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this battery toothbrush in a store, especially with its simple round head. Most have fancy schmancy heads that are too big for me.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as those high dollar brushes ...also small sleek design makes for easy traveling .Oral B is a staple within our household</li>
            <li> This brush is garbage, don&#x27;t waste your money. I have been using a regular electric Brawn toothbrush for years and wanted one I could take on long trips. This is nothing like the regular brush, it just makes a noise and vibrates a little, but definitely not enough to get your teeth clean. This goes directly into garbage since it cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  I note that several reviewers complain about the fit of the two AA batteries inside the battry compartment.  Another viewer said to clean the goop off of the battery cap and around the sealing rubber O-ring that keeps the batteries dry.  He&#x27;s correct.  About every week, I take off the cap, carefully roll the rubber O-ring off the handle, and clean the goop (toothpaste; dried saliva; etc) from the groove where the rubber O-ring rested, and the cap and batteries go back without issue.  There IS, repeat IS, a spring in the battery cap to compensate for longer or shorter batteries.  In the long run, rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride batteries are FAR cheaper than Alkaline batteries, and they sure beat having some plug-in toothbrush charger cluttering up your bathroom sink.  ---ORIGINAL POST:----&gt;  One dental technician complimented me on the care of my teeth.  I told her I was using the Oral-B Pro Health.  She spoke highly of the other major brand of \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; rechargeable toothbrushes, so I did a bit of research.  First, 99% of the effectiveness of any toothbrush, manual or electric, depends on the technique used by the mouth owner.  Second, I found something from the ADA or some other professional organization that reported \\&quot;there&#x27;s not a dime&#x27;s worth of difference in the effectiveness of various brands of electronic toothbrushes.\\&quot;  It went on to say that user preference is the discriminator, NOT whether one scours off more plaque than the other.  Third, I learned that the \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; toothbrushes move their heads up and down across your tooth, while this Oral-B rotates its head a bizillion times a second.  I can easily move it over and down into the gumline, then massage the entire gum for as long as I wish.  Fourth, take a look at the cost of the replacement heads of this toothbrush (not the knockoffs, but the branded packages) and you&#x27;ll see a big difference from the \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; toothbrushes.  Fifth, I&#x27;ve been recharging AA alkalaine batteries for a few years and using them in this toothbrush, but now I&#x27;ve moved to NiMH (nickel metal hydride) to see if it makes any difference.  Like other raters said, you can keep recharging these batteries -- up to 250 times according to the manufacturer -- for as long as the toothbrush motor lasts.  So far, for me, it&#x27;s been four years.  My wife and I both use this Oral-B, twice daily, seven days a week (different brush heads of course).  Other reviewers have pointed out that when the other built-in \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; batteries wear out (and they will), then you have to throw away the whole unit.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;m recharging my batteries and just replacing them as needed.  I don&#x27;t want any plug-in electric chargers cluttering my bathroom sink top, and I don&#x27;t want to hide them in the medicine cabinet and drag it it from time to time to recharge my \\&quot;built in\\&quot; rechargeable \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; toothbrush.  Replaceable batteries are definitely the best choice -- for me.  One last item, I could care less about five different \\&quot;modes,\\&quot; timers, neon lights and other bells and whistles.  I know to brush in each quadrant of my mouth for 30-40 seconds each (more than a two-minute total); I know to massage my gums when finished; I know to brush my tounge and roof of the mouth afterwards.  I don&#x27;t need to spend another $100 on a simple toothbrush to remind me to do these things.  This model of the Oral-B costs approximately ONE TENTH as much as the top of the line \\&quot;supersonic\\&quot; toothbrush.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I leave the decision to you.for a few years and using them in this toothbrush, but now I&#x27;ve moved to NiMH (nickel metal hydride) to see if it makes any difference.  Like other raters said, you can keep recharging these batteries -- up to 250 times according to the manufacturer -- for as long as the toothbrush motor lasts.  So far, for me, it&#x27;s been four years.  My wife and I both use this Oral-B, twice daily, seven days a week (different brush heads of course).  Other reviewers have pointed out that when the other built-in \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; batteries wear out (and they will), then you have to throw away the whole unit.

            <li> That is my first electric toothbrush and I think this is the best thing happened to my teeth . I&#x27;m 30 years old and my teeth structure is prone to hiding food particles. I had to use toothpicks and floss regularly to keep them clean. I&#x27;m using this brush since last 1 week and I must say &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know what was holding me not to buy this product earlier. I think everyone should be using this product to better take care of teeth health.</li>
            <li> Love using this to clean my teeth.  Makes them feel great.</li>
            <li> Keeps my mouth clean and I&#x27;m able to really make sure my teeth located in the far back of my mouth are able to be properly touched and cleaned as well. Oral-B, you have just made a customer for life :) The battery is just 2 AA batteries that will last a while considering the short time it should take to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> The batteries provided were dead so I replaced them after a frustrating struggle with cover. The head of the toothbrush is extremely small, pay a little extra get a better quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for almost a year and really enjoy it.  Batteries last a long time in it and it does a nice job of cleaning my teeth.  Just make sure to keep the actual brush clean and remember to remove batteries if you are traveling!</li>
            <li> Unbelievably low-powered. It doesn&#x27;t do thorough nice cleaning action, I almost feel like I&#x27;m using a manual tooth brush. This is disappointing because I&#x27;ve been very loyal to Oral-B electric tooth brush for years. The other one I kept for almost three years - with a charger - is now about to end its life span, holding only a minute or two for operating, but while it&#x27;s running I guess it provides way more torques than this battery-powered one. At first I thought I put dying batteries in it so I swapped them with brand new ones. Still the same. Unless I got a &#x27;lemon&#x27; tooth brush - I seriously doubt that due to other reviewers&#x27; similar complaints over low power issue - I won&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush that really works well.  The spinning &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; is highly maneuverable in your mouth, and problem ares can be accurately targeted to remove stains and food particles.  I am a long time user of battery-powered Oral B electric toothbrushes, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  Love the special 2-minute timer feature that lets the user know when two minutes of brushing have elapsed.  A great value for the money, too!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I put the batteries in and nothing happened. I put my own new batteries in and nothing happened again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a refund.</li>
            <li> have used an oral B for 30 years - the ones that have the re-charger that plugs in.  This battery operator brush far exceeds the plug in system.  Greater power and really clean teeth.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are much cleaner than before. I love this toothbrush! It is easy to use, and the 2 minute timer is really helpful.</li>
            <li> I found this electric toothbrush to be a real bargain.  It&#x27;s easy to handle and manipulate throughout the mouth.  Brush and battery life are good.  It&#x27;s an excelent product for the price.</li>
            <li> The vibration of the entire unit is excessivive! Makes for difficulty keeping the teenie brushhead on target. I&#x27;ll bear with it for now, but wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased it. I will order a different brush head as the one provided just rotates and is too small.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy unit - very pleased with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true workhorse - both the unit and the brush-heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to dislike</li>
            <li> There is no way that brushing by hand can duplicate the cleaning action of an electric toothbrush, but many electric brushes cost more money than I want to spend. This is a good, basic brush that gets the job done. My dentist reccomends electric toothbrushes to prevent gum recession, and for me at least it works.  My gums had started receeding, but they have remained stable since I added an electric toothbrush to my routine. I wish this toothbrush had two speeds, but considering the price I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my dog.I also use one.So far so good no complaints.You can&#x27;t go wrong with it buy it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 8 year old son to replace his crappy disposable star wars tooth brush that just didn&#x27;t last at all.  This is far superior to the disposable toothbrushes that are out there.  Love that you can replace the batteries and the brush heads instead of just pitching the whole thing and buying a new one.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Just inserted my 3rd set of batteries, meaning this thing is devouring a pair of AAs every 2-3 weeks.  I still like the brush, does a great job of cleaning my teeth.  But my Sonicare can go 3-4 months on a set of batteries...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title is the review.  It does a decent job cleaning my teeth, but I won&#x27;t be throwing away my Sonicare anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test of any toothbrush for me is the \\&quot;11 AM test\\&quot;.  Basically, how do my teeth feel after I&#x27;ve been up for 4-5 hours and eaten.  And at that this toothbrush passes with flying colors.  With a traditional toothbrush my teeth start to feel dirty/filmy by noon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the brushing timer.  Most electric toothbrushes will simply shut off after the magic 2 minute mark has been reached.  This vibrates three times to basically say \\&quot;OK freaky, wrap it up!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real gripe with the Oral-B is that the cleaning head is a lot bigger than my Sonicare.  No problem really, unless you&#x27;re an OCD like me and like to brush under your tongue and the gums BEHIND your teeth.  It still works, but a little awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for the price it&#x27;s great.  But if you&#x27;re able and willing to spend a bit more check out the [[ASIN:B000FEIOHW Philips Sonicare HX3351/02 Xtreme Battery Operated Toothbrush]].  Even using a worn 2 year old brush head it does the best job cleaning my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have the Oral B rechargeable toothbrush and going to Europe I was afraid about bringing all of the extra adapters etc, so i bought this one.  The batteries that came with the product lasted the full 3 weeks.  The tooth brush isn&#x27;t as powerful as the rechargeable one (but that&#x27;s what i expected at a fraction of the cost) and the toothbrush head is removable.</li>
            <li> Gives you that fresh out of the dentist feeling every time i brush! Very great product.. even better price! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but I thought I was getting a better product.  I usually use a sonicare but bought this one for traveling.  My suggestion is to either purchase a better electric toothbrush or buy a cheaper one that works just as well.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush. No cords no stand just 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want an electric toothbrush. Much prefer battery operated. It travels well. Don&#x27;t have to worry about different voltages. Also, really prefer the small round brush. I think it does a better job.</li>
            <li> Works great and use for travelling. Battery operated makes it a snap and no corded units to pack. Used it three weeks on recent overseas travel and still charged for next trip.</li>
            <li> The tootbrush is used by my daughter and she loves using it and finds it very convenient.  The batteries are easy to install.</li>
            <li> I will order another very soon!</li>
            <li> The kids love brushing their teeth again, thanks to this toothbrush. It&#x27;s small enough to reach the back molars. It does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush for the price. Strong vibration and makes mouth feel cleaner</li>
            <li> Just barely okay. The brush works okay but replacing batteries is overly difficult. I have two brushes and have replaced the batteries in one twice. The second time using enough force to close the brush caused the base of the brush to crack. It&#x27;s also difficult to remove the base prior to replacing batteries. The brush is very inexpensive but not so much so in regards to inherent difficulties.</li>
            <li> I had my other ORAL B for over 10 years. Was initially delighted with this one.  yesterday it just started skipping and today it won&#x27;t even work, makes a buzzing sound but nothing else.  I replaced the batteries last night thinking that was the problem. So now I cannot return/replace because I bought it in February.  Won&#x27;t buy another one again from you.</li>
            <li> I really liked the feeling it leaves of clean mouth. Even my hygienist is happy about my new brush!!&lt;br /&gt;very much recomend this product</li>
            <li> It is a good toothbrush. I choose this one by not the rechargeable ones since it is convenient to replace battery. However, I think the sonic toothbrushes are better in cleaning</li>
            <li> seems the brush is small,but it is fine so far</li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrushes, particularly for travel purposes.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about bringing along recharging docks, power cords, etc.  2-AA batteries is all it takes.  I&#x27;ve used these toothbrushes for many years and am very happy as to how clean they brush my teeth.  Will continue to buy these, as needed!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush to take with you during trips when you don&#x27;t want to take your home unit.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best electric toothbrushes.  My last one had to be charged every other week.  With this one, the charge lasts a lot longer because the batteries are the best kind and last a lot longer too.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use a plug-in electric toothbrush daily and wanted something similar for travelling, without having to carry the re-charging unit.  A battery-operated toothbrush such as this &#x27;fits the bill&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I bought two. My daughter and grandson use them and like them. Battery life is reasonable.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush it does not Work, i need my money back</li>
            <li> Quality toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years. This toothbrush readily accepted my spare dual action heads.</li>
            <li> i like the small brush head, which let me clean my teeth one by one throughly:) this brush needs 2 aaa batteries, so it&#x27;s a little heavy for holding, but as i have many aaa batteries around my home, so i have a good gadget to use them now.</li>
            <li> Weak and doesn&#x27;t feel clean after brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My Sonicare died so I got the Oral-B to try, but extremely disappointed, so I&#x27;m going back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Pros:  it works and cleans your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  there is a timer that can not be reset to a different length of time and I thought the thing was breaking the first time it went off.</li>
            <li> This is the best portable toothbrush I have ever used. I have the Oral-B plug in unit at home and this is the closest thing to the real one. It rotates like the home version just not as powerful and the price was good.</li>
            <li> we bought this since we had to move overseas and our electronic brush would not work with 220 volts.  Works great.  Only complaint is that the battery can be hard to replace.  You have to squeeze both sides of the handle in the right places to force the cover off to enable battery replacement.  My wife does not have the strength to do that.  Could be a problem for an elderly person or anyone with limited hand strength.  But other than that, it works very well.  If you have an outlet and don&#x27;t mind the cord and stand taking up some space in your bathroom, the corded option may be a better choice for some people.</li>
            <li> Very good, very like, satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good product - no complaints</li>
            <li> Giving this 5 stars because it works great.  Using it on my dog&#x27;s teeth is a work in progress.</li>
            <li> item received was broken!</li>
            <li> Works as expected with given price performance.&lt;br /&gt;Liked it with 2 AA batteries, highly portable for worldwide travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my oral health since using this tooth brush and so has my dentist. However, it gets really messy with toothpaste and spit running down the device while using it. Also, if you press too hard, it just stops. For the price, though it a great product.</li>
            <li> I used the product for may be a month, and then I am not able to replace the batteries.  The cap would just not fit again.  The entire product is now useless.  I don&#x27;t know how to fix it.  This is such a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these for family members, and all have worked well for quite a long while now.</li>
            <li> We wanted to take our electric toothbrushes with us but we were traveling in Europe with different plugs. These battery operated brushes were terrific. I highly recommend them for traveling.</li>
            <li> The tooth brish is good, but there are a few problems.  Its vibrations are not as fast as the Phillips brush I used in the past, so the brushing process is slower.  Secondly, there is no cap that comes along with the brush so it has to be used at home only and is not portable unless I buy some cap which will match it.  I tried using the cap from my earlier brush and sure enough, it does not fit.  I have not used it long enough to know if the battery compartment remains free from water which was my problem with Phillips which made it necessary to change batteries too frequently.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Nice to be able to use rechargeable batteries with this.  Know that when the batteries get weak, the brush stops with any kind of pressure.  Keep your batteries strong and your teeth will be happy.</li>
            <li> A great toothbrush that runs on 2 AA batteries. I used to have one that had to be recharged. This is much simpler and actually smaller in size. Great for everyday use and traveling.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. the two minute timer is excellent and it really cleans your teeth when used properly, which is very easy to do.  I found that not all batteries are exactly the same physical size, thus not all batteries fit in the compartment the batteries go. In my equipment, Duracell Alkaline fit perfectly and the compartment closes tight. Duracell alkaline came with the equipment. I do not know if that is the case with all the battery toothbrushes. I am happy with it and I can carry the toothbrush with me in my travel kit when traveling without having to be concerned with travel adapters or converters. I would recommend the battery toothbrush to my family &amp; friends without reservations.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2f9d8f9826d8fa004a31e787ce529ec]] I don&#x27;t need to convince you that this electric toothbrush is great and economic for human use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here are some comments about the unit:&lt;br /&gt;It seems that it is energy efficient.  I put in Energizer AA batt and it has been running for a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;Powered by AA batt makes this unit very portable for travel.  You don&#x27;t need to worry about recharging it or if the charger is dual voltage or not.&lt;br /&gt;Compare to using manual toothbrush, this electric toothbrush will save you time to achieve the same cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the more expensive versions can offer you, but I&#x27;m happy with this electric toothbrush.  (Note: I don&#x27;t have problem with cavity, plague, tartar build up, etc even using manual toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness for those things on your teeth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus review!&lt;br /&gt;I just started using this toothbrush to brush my Sheltie&#x27;s teeth.  It seems to work really well compared to manual toothbrush because you don&#x27;t actually need to move the brush head.  Using manual toothbrush, you need to keep brushing and it is very hard to do detail work even if you have 100% compliance from your dog.  Using this electric toothbrush, you just need to make a gentle contact between the brush and his/her teeth.&lt;br /&gt;A dedicated manual dog toothbrush will cost you over $10.00.  It&#x27;s more economic and more effective to use this electric toothbrush.  Alternatively, you can get a toddler toothbrush from dollar store, but it is a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I will give an update on how well this electric toothbrush performs vs. manual toothbrush after about a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;It may sound a little loud on the video, but really it is not that loud at all, at least it hasn&#x27;t bothered me or my dog.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I used it twice daily for 60 days on one set of batteries.  I originally bought it for travel, but I have made it my only tooth brush, even though I have an older rechargeable one.  This doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space and I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it until the batteries actually run out and they only talk a minute or so to change them... unlike hours to recharge the rechargeable one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking the brush itself,  off every few days and cleaning up the residue that accumulates inside,  as I noticed that my old rechargeable insides  were starting to rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this brush and I  would definitely recommend it for daily use or for traveling.  It performs just as well as my older, much more expensive chargeable model.</li>
            <li> using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> Leaves your teeth feeling like you just went to the dentist</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I was buying a battery-operated toothbrush.  As the batteries lose their charge, the brush gets stuck.  Annoying!  Not sure how fast the batteries go, but I expect I may decide on a rechargeable unit!</li>
            <li> Love it! I replaced a more expensive model &amp; didn&#x27;t really want to spend the money again. I should have bought this one the first time. It works great! I loved it so much &amp; that I brought 3 more for the rest of family. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My teeth feels amazingly clean. There is no separate button for the timer but simply pulses during the two minute mark. Great Value as well, I just saw this at Rite Aid and it was $16</li>
            <li> Works very well. My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush so I bought this as an alternative to the more expensive ones. The battery lasts way longer than I expected and cleans well. I will never go back to a non-electric brush.</li>
            <li> I got one for myself and my husband and we both love it. It makes my teeth feel so much more cleaner than a manual brush would. Also the bristles of the brush aren&#x27;t that hard which is good for me, but I know some people may prefer harder or stiffer bristles. My husband said that we should of switched to one of these sooner!</li>
            <li> Wife and I have both been using Oral B 1000 toothbrushes for several years.  When our 9-yr old expressed interest in a powered toothbrush, I immediately orderd another.  But before giving it to her, we came across this battery powered model in a local store.  Quick inspection showed it to be both smaller / lighter than the rechargeable models;  plus it has rubbery, ribbed grip.  Although not marketed as a kid-friendly model, it definitely seems to be a better size for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Cost:  Approximately 1/3 the cost of the entry-level Oral B 1000 model.&lt;br /&gt;- Size:  Shorter &amp; lighter than the Oral B rechargeable brushes.&lt;br /&gt;- Compatibility:  Takes all the same replaceable heads as the more expensive Oral B models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;- Batteries:  Takes two AA batteries, but reviews here indicate 3+ months of life. (And if you use rechargeable AA, then a complete non-issue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update in the future on reliability...but based on past experience with Oral B brushes, I don&#x27;t expect any problems!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been frustrating. I bought one and like it a lot. Then, when the battery needed to be replaced, I tried to open it and could not. It became a maddening exercise. Nothing fits it -- for me. I bought another and they&#x27;ve redesigned the new one. Opening the battery case is much easier. I&#x27;m still trying to correct the &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34;. I&#x27;d like to tell them how I dislike their original design. I&#x27;d like the whole thing if they&#x27;d tell me how to fix the first one.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts very long compared to rechargeable models. However, I find it is not very powerful compared to my previous electric toothbrush. It is still fine though.</li>
            <li> She loved it, brushes her teeth for a longer time each time so I am saying it is a big hit. Great for someone that has Arthritis or other problem keeping them from using their arm properly to brush with.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner and I hope to have good news the next time I go to the dentist!</li>
            <li> I am a coffee and tea drinker all day long.  This product really cleans the stain off my teeth, good product.</li>
            <li> I used a battery operated brush for the first time and I liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;At first it felt a bit awkward and reminded me of a dentist visit I had in the past&lt;br /&gt;and I missed the foam produced during manual brushing but I will get over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really cleans out every crevice and is easy to navigate to every corner of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Just look into the proper way of using an electric toothbrush as it might prevent you&lt;br /&gt;from over brushing  and gum regression.</li>
            <li> after using few times one of my tooth is broken</li>
            <li> I was glad I purchased this.  I don&#x27;t really have room for a charger in my bathroom and thus the battery solution is desirable.  There was a noticeable improvement in teeth cleaning within days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then 6 weeks passed.  It would go to slow but promptly back to full speed.  The number of times it went to slow increased as did the length of time it stayed in slow speed.  Now it&#x27;s basically only useful as a manual toothbrush.  I&#x27;m guessing that it has a clutch to prevent injury and that has failed.  A low price is attractive, but I would expect the lifespan to be at least a year for something like this.</li>
            <li> Pros: It&#x27;s cheaper than rechargeable products.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It drains the batteries. I would recommend using rechargeable batteries with this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the cost since I was not sure I would like a mechanical toothbrush.  The battery life is excellent and I went online to buy the specific head I wanted.  The first one is lasting well and doing a great job.  All in all I am very satisfied with this purchase and will replace it with the same model when this eventually wears out.  I have gotten it plenty wet during use and there is no problem with this well made brush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush..it brushes well and I like that it came with batteries too.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The brush works really well when batteries are at max charge.  I recommend getting a high quality rechargeable battery set.  When typical standard batteries are used the brush&#x27;s performance drops off even when the batteries test at near full.  By using good rechargeable batteries you can get max performance all the time.</li>
            <li> I want to know the product quality guarantee period.I use it carefully. But  it doesn&#x27;t work well. Can I changed a new one?</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I was using the Sonic care electric (Phillips I believe) for over 10 years but the heads were expensive. This toothbrush just outperforms the Sonic care. The heads are smaller and fit into areas that the old style brush wouldn&#x27;t go. To me there is no real comparison. Good price, works very well.</li>
            <li> You might as well buy the battery operated one because it&#x27;s just as good as the $100 version. I recommend the brush that has only the single head because it does a better job than the dual heads.</li>
            <li> I love these battery operated toothbrushes.  I have used oral B for years and always have had good luck with them and a long lifespan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric rotary brush for a few weeks now and am completely satisfied. It works well, when used correctly with toothpaste, to remove surface stains. It doesn&#x27;t get between tightly-spaced teeth as well as a simple hand brush. I&#x27;ve had a number of electric rotary brushes from the cheap to the expensive and this cheap one works about the same as the others – no better and no worse so I&#x27;d say go for a cheap one like this. Replacement and extra brushes are available, too, so family members can share the same base unit.</li>
            <li> Great usage, it is really efficient and is not too loud.  I bought it for my boyfriend and he loves it</li>
            <li> Best to get an electrical one.  I thought the first 2 I had just were fluky short life brushes but no ... I think battery operated things only can hold up so long and in this case 6 months is the best you can ask for these. My 3 were all less than 5 months (one a different brand).  But in the time I had it it worked great so if you are only needing a short term brush and are OK spending that much more for a power toothbrush than have at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I tried changing the batteries. Two of the ones I had (one only made it through 1 set of batteries), I changed the battery and it worked for about half the time as the first charge ... and then it is basically dead after a 3rd try. I got a few uses out of my 3rd change but ended up just tossing it since I was just then using a bulky toothbrush with no motor.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently (it runs on 2 AA batteries) along with both the professional FlossAction interchangeable brush head and the professional sensitive gum care brush (both in a pack of 3) and use it alternately and my teeth is so clean that I will not go back to manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Had trouble with the first toothbrush they sent. It got slower and slower and after trying several batteries, I discovered it was completely dead. However, I emailed Amazon and another was shipped very quickly at no charge! It&#x27;s a good product and works well.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my kid&#x27;s because the &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; power toothbrushes are a joke and die after a few weeks and you are unable to get new heads for them. My kids love these and the sensitive precision heads are perfect for their 1st set of teeth.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, no problems.  Just make sure you get a top name battery to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price! Had a previous Oral B toothbrush and had no problems with it until it suddenly quit working.. Hope this one will last longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a traveling toothbrush. It does a great job and I like it. I travels very well.</li>
            <li> no complaints great product for the the price!!! no problems with it at all, read the battery part was bad but got it and have had no  prob.</li>
            <li> While brushing your teeth, sometimes it stops running.&lt;br /&gt;It is not likely due to water getting into the crevices as I&#x27;ve tried multiple methods to avoid that from being a possibility.&lt;br /&gt;It is not likely due to battery corrosion as I&#x27;ve tried multiple batteries and visual inspection shows no corrosion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a couple of these units. It is not likely due to battery corrosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Easily portable without a clunky charger. Great for travel. Battery lasts a long time!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;intermittent power outages.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, sturdy, has a tiny but powerful head so it gets into nooks and crannies. It runs on AA batteries and has a replaceable head. And best of all, it has a timer!</li>
            <li> This is a nice toothbrush which I bought to replace an Oral B rechargeable with a similar brush head.  In my opinion this one does not clean quite as well as the rechargeable, but it is pretty darn close, and after going through two of the rechargeables eventually failing on me, I like the much lower price of this one and the convenience of using commonly available batteries.</li>
            <li> The brush is SO TINY. Spend money on something better.</li>
            <li> I use the battery model to replace the rechargeable model and it is as good as the prior model and give me the flexibility of not needing to plug in a recharger.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this was a manufacturing issue, but I just opened mine, and used it, when you put the batteries in, it starts vibrating automatically and does not stop even when you click the button to stop. I am hoping it was an issue just with my item, and in general this model doesn&#x27;t have that issue. Other than that, the product is great, it is just that faulted button that is the problem.</li>
            <li> I had used a sonicare for past few years but picked this up online due to the reviews.  Thus far i have to say it works decently well.  The vigor of the brush movement seems solid, battery life thus far good, and seems to get into tight areas.  Can&#x27;t complain thus far.</li>
            <li> I had come down with a case of gingivitis to the degree I had spontaneous gum bleeding, horrible breath, and was already losing some teeth.  I bought this and used it once a day for a few minutes with baking soda and hydrogen peroxide instead of tooth paste and before the week was out, no bleeding, no bad breath.  My dentist found no gum disease whatsoever the next check up (6 months later) and wouldn&#x27;t believe I had had that trouble until he consullted his notes.</li>
            <li> Needed  an electric toothbrush for Motorcycle travel (limited room).  This fits the bill and has the same two minute timer as my electric one at home but, no need for  a charger stand.</li>
            <li> My dentist says ANY electric toothbrush is better than a manual. This OralB is a lot cheaper than Sonicare and I can use rechargeable AA batteries instead of some proprietary battery and charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave it only 3 stars is because:&lt;br /&gt;1. The cap at the bottom is easy to break when replacing your battery. The waterproofing grommet causes a extremely tight fit and when you use too much force, it causes the cap to crack. This happened on both of my purchases.&lt;br /&gt;2. Even though it&#x27;s seemingly waterproof, toothpaste gunk gets in there (when you store it standing up) and eventually the water will work itself into the battery compartment causing corrosion on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;3. Some water dribbles out from the brush head and spills onto my shirt. Use it over the sink or while wearing house clothes because if you brush before you&#x27;re ready to go out, you will dribble toothpaste water on your nice clothes.</li>
            <li> My wife just loves hers.</li>
            <li> Works great keeps teeth clean and healthy</li>
            <li> Your mouth will thank you if you ditch your manual toothbrush and switch to this toothbrush.  Teeth become so much whiter as the brush action really gets your teeth extremely clean.  The wonderful thing about this is you can change the brush heads to whatever you like (flosser head, precision head, etc.).  The power is nice and strong which I love, other folks may not be so thrilled.  If you have sensitive teeth this brush is still good just do not use a toothpaste with SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) OR use a sensitive toothpaste like Sensodyne.  I have sensitive teeth and use these products together and my smile is becoming more stunning everyday.  My son loves the timer function on the brush as he no longer has to use the clock.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush works great but I wish they sent us two different colors that way we could tell whos was whos.</li>
            <li> For what the price is, this deserves more than 5 stars considering what your getting:&lt;br /&gt;-great durability, good company&lt;br /&gt;-LONG lasting, I mean close to 1 month of everyday brushing using a AA x2 batteries.&lt;br /&gt;-Brush head lasts pretty long before replacement, I&#x27;d say about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and I have to say that it NEVER malfunctioned on me.&lt;br /&gt;Even the timer has been perfect.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, was bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new toothbrush. It works really well!  I love no longer having a cord getting in the way.  It was priced very reasonably too.</li>
            <li> Strange as it may sound, we use this on our dog&#x27;s teeth because it&#x27;s small and fits easily in her mouth, and it works perfectly! For anyone who loves and cares for their dog, we highly recommend regular brushings. Just like with people, it helps keep their mouths clean, their teeth from getting cavities, their gums from becoming inflamed, and their bodies healthy. Also, the price was right and it was delivered on time. As an aside, we wouldn&#x27;t use a toothbrush this small on our own teeth, but it&#x27;s perfect for our needs.</li>
            <li> makes your teeth clean with buildup of plaque,larry</li>
            <li> I had my first one for over 5 years, and finally had to replace it...love that the new one is exactly the same as the old one, does a great job and my mouth appreciates it!</li>
            <li> Wife and I share and love using it together (with different brushes:-)) Electric vibration highly effective and when used for cleaning it  makes the kissing process quite enjoyable. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this little battery operated toothbrush.  I had a full blown electric one years ago and loved it, however I spent $99 on that one and only $9.99 on this one and it works perfectly.  I have had it almost a month now and still love it.  It&#x27;s sturdy and strong and cleans my teeth and gums VERY well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Itis just the right size and shape for me.  I plan to purchase another for when I travel.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Not enough power compared to the rechargeable version</li>
            <li> nicely designed for travel wish it had a cover for the brush head to keep it clean when travel. My older one --which after 5 years wore out-- had one love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li> took two people to open it and that does not work for older people</li>
            <li> It does much more than an ordinary toothbrush especially in removing plaque.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as the one where you plug in the AC outlet. It does affect performance in my opinion by being a battery</li>
            <li> this is a strong unit and works real good and seems to be solid, it does a very good job, the only drawback is the size of the brush, quite small but so far i really like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these specifically to try to go as light as possible for international travel. The descriptions says two AAA batteries which are small and better for travel. The brushes arrived and they take two AA batteries which are included. Probably not a big deal for most people, but it is for me, particuarly with respect to taking extra batteries as the AA batteries are bigger and heavier.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the price.  Don&#x27;t mess with expensive rechargables.  They take up counter space, are expensive and they die eventually anyway.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush because it uses standard AA batteries and doesn&#x27;t require me lugging the charger around when I&#x27;m traveling.  One set of AA batteries lasted me more than three months.  An excellent product!</li>
            <li> When I received it, it wasn&#x27;t working. I thought it was the batteries. I bought new batteries. Still doesn&#x27;t work. And sending it back to have it replaced would cost me half the price of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy a toothbrush in a Rite Aid. If it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll be able to have it replaced more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of good reviews, so I guess I got unlucky. Still, this shouldn&#x27;t happen, and I&#x27;ve lost my money here... :(</li>
            <li> Got it to replace an Oral-B Vitality rechargeable model that finally died.  Brush head seems faster and more powerful than my old one.  So far, working great.  It is nosier than my old one however.  Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Weak bristles in the head. It needs more power action to the head so it can remove particles from my teeth.</li>
            <li> well i have one of oral-B tooth brush but honestly compare to this one this one is much more way better i love it.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i give 4 start that the brush parts are expensive....... lol&lt;br /&gt;well you got what you paid for ........&lt;br /&gt;but we all like to get better price for good quality as i tried other than the original it&#x60;s terrible.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- It can clean teeth very well. Much better than manual toothbrushes. Much better than Crest Spinbrush. I am very happy to have it.&lt;br /&gt;- It takes 2 AA rechargeable batteries. A full charged hybrid batteries will last more than 2 weeks. (it depends on how long your batteries hold the charge). Alkaline batteries last a month. So it is very useful for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;- Since the batteries are removable, you can use different set of batteries until the toothbrush broken. Note that, you can not replace the batteries in any toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries and one of the most common reason for a toothbrush ends its useful live is the death of its built-in batteries.&lt;br /&gt;- If you want to save the environment and you don&#x27;t want to throw dead batteries into garbage cans then you don&#x27;t like toothbrushes with built-in rechargeable batteries. It is very hard to remove the batteries from the unit to handle them properly.&lt;br /&gt;- This is the least expensive electric toothbrush from Oral-B. But it performs really well.&lt;br /&gt;- This toothbrush uses the same refill brushes that other expensive models use. So you get similar result for much less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- This one does not have a timer. You can pay couple more dollar to get the one (also from Oral-B) with the timer.&lt;br /&gt;- People reported that this toothbrush lasts from 1 to 2 years. Well, the most expensive (about 9 times more expensive) Oral-B electric toothbrush lasts from 3 to 5 years. If you do not care about other features the expensive ones offers, I think this has more value.</li>
            <li> My expensive rechargeable unit broke so I tried one of these-much cheaper and it&#x27;s easy to stick in a pair of rechargeable AA batteries. It works fine (just one speed), is a bit noisier and uses all the same brush heads. Good for a second unit to take camping.</li>
            <li> If your sick and tired of buying rechargeable toothbrushes with internal batteries that quickly loose their charge capacity and can&#x27;t be replaced, then this toothbrush is for you. These toothbrushes also feature  electronics that keep the motor voltage constant - and hence maintain optimal orbital brushing speed - even as the battery voltage declines as they discharge. So motor power is held consistant right up until the end when the batteries near complete depletion where finally the motor just stops. So you get optimal performance right to the end of set of batteries! This feature also means despite the lower voltage of using 2x 1.2V NiMH rechargeable cells, you get the same brushing speed and power as using 2x 1.5V Alkaline cells. This is great! as rechargeable NiMH cells last longer due to holding more charge capacity, are cheaper in the long-term, and save you throwing out bucket loads of spent Alkaline cells that would end up in landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality of the units is great as you&#x27;d expect for a Braun, even for a cheaper unit. The battery chamber seals well but can be perfected by applying a thin layer of vaseline or other grease around the O-ring of the lower snap out section. This guarantees moisture vapour can&#x27;t get into the battery chamber which over time can corrode rechargable batteries in long term service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch is smartly sealed beneath a rubber membrane which ensures water can&#x27;t get into the internals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2-minute timer is a nice feature. At this time interval the motor briefly oscillates off-on-off-on to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing but if you wan&#x27;t to keep brushing, you can as it doesnt turn the motor off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this brush is great, especially for the price. The fact that ageing rechargable batteries can be replaced as their capacity diminishes means you can expect years of service from one of these, whereas the more expensive units with internal batteries are useless junk as soon as they loose the majority of their capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific. The Spinbrush ran too-slow on lower voltage rechargable batteries, the battery chamber leaked, the button corroded and became unreliable, and batteries quickly corroded due to the leaking chamber. All these problems are remedied with this Braun model.capacity.  I changed from using a Spinbrush Pro clean to this Braun, and the improvement is terrific.

            <li> perfect for travel. Glad it came with a battery</li>
            <li> Best cordless brush that you can buy with your money</li>
            <li> toothbrush works well, will see if it holds up</li>
            <li> This is good value and works well. The battery holds for a decent length of time. I like how it has a timer so I use it for long enough.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect from an electric toothbrush. There is a timer - it works in a way where it pulses when the two minutes are up, then if you want to keep going it will stop after 3 quick pulses. I tried to get the battery compartment off, not easy to get off, but I didn&#x27;t go hard enough because I didn&#x27;t actually need to remove it.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Love it.  The battery compartment is so much easier to open than other electric toothbrushes (especially if you have arthritis or weakness in your hands).  The brush head itself is smaller than I was accustomed to using but it didn&#x27;t take me long to adjust to the size.</li>
            <li> Works well. Still on the original battery. Gunk will build up under the brush head, which is a little nasty, but probably not a big deal except to germaphobes. waterproof, you can run the entire thing under water without a problem.</li>
            <li> Takes AA batteries which makes it easy for travelling abroad, so you can take it anywhere in the world and not worry about recharging it or bringing a charger.  Head brushes are easy to find and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I like that it uses batteries and doesn&#x27;t require a charge. It&#x27;s powerful, yet very comfortable on my teeth. I received a terrific price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush until I got a sonic one (which I now love more).</li>
            <li> This was a replacement purchase for the same Oral B electric brush I had bought twelve years ago.  That alone says a lot.  The fact that it was 75% less costly than other brands is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New features of exchangeable heads make it more versatile as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that the vibration noise is a bit higher in this newer model than the old.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a good toothbrush, I like the round brush it gets to the back teeth better to clean and brush</li>
            <li> WORKED VERY WELL AND EASY ON THE GUMS.DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED AS ORAL HEALTH IS ESSENTIAL FOR GOOD HEALTH.THE HEADS FOR THIS TOOTHBRUSH ARE QUITE REASONABLE AS WELL.</li>
            <li> I own 2 rechargeable electric toothbrushes.  One the Philips Sonic and the Oral B braun rechargeable toothbrushes. This ORAL B PRO- HEALTH PRECISION beats both of those hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the ORAL B PRO-HEALTH my teeth get a smooth and through cleaning. Not to harsh just right. I use to have to purchase soft bristles replacements for the already owned two mentioned above. Not with my new ORAL-B PR0 it is that gentle on my gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 3 settings on my old oral b braun for fast, gentle and slow. I ended up hating it because to turn off I had to click it off 3 times just to reapply toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ORAL B PRO HEALTH actually makes me excited about brushing me teeth. Already bought one for my husband and sister. They too agree with me it is far superior to their rechargeable electric top of the line toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually went and purchased a 2nd one to take out of town with me on trips. I would rate this 10 stars if I could. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> After a month, the timer totally go mad. I need to spend much longer time to finish brushing as it stops frequently. That can drive you crazy!!!</li>
            <li> it is very good for my teeth cleaning,it worth the price I  paid.I will back for this.thanks for the good service.</li>
            <li> used to Phillips Sonic Care. When mine stopped working after several years I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;Big difference and big mistake. Too clunky, bulky, and just plain rickety</li>
            <li> I already had one of these, but bought another for traveling.  I love this thing!  The only con is that the newer ones don&#x27;t come with that &amp;#34;snap-in-place&amp;#34; plastic cover to protect the brush bristles.&lt;br /&gt;This thing gets into all the tiny crevices between your teeth (I use the &amp;#34;Oral B Floss Action&amp;#34; brush heads).  It feels good against my gums also.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to use much battery power either.  I end up replacing my batteries every 3 to 5 months (guess it depends on the battery brand). Please don&#x27;t EVER discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described. My Rayovak batteries fit in perfect. The batteries also last a pretty long time. Overall, very happy with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/21/16: I have been using this toothbrush for about a year and half now and it is still working like new. I expected this thing to give up a long time ago. My Costco batteries last over a month. Battery cover is still really hard to get off but cleaning the inside of the cover helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of travelling lately, and miss my electric toothbrush. I thought that this would be a decent replacement when I&#x27;m on the road, but it isn&#x27;t. Perhaps I should have anticipated that it wouldn&#x27;t be as powerful as what I&#x27;m accustomed to, but I was still disappointed. I even changed the batteries to see if that would help but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m probably just going to go back to using a manual toothbrush when I travel (thank goodness for dentist freebies!).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price of this little beauty. I was worried about battery life, but it&#x27;s still running on the first set of batteries. I find this a better option that trying to move the charging station everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> The Tip of the brush is too small to use. May be useful for kids. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because I needed to travel and could not find my spare charging base for the Oral-B Pro-Health toothbrush I use at home. This toothbrush has worked reliably, and if you don&#x27;t need all the features of the more expensive brushes this should do just fine. It uses the same brush heads as the higher end models.</li>
            <li> I see where this item is no longer available due to customer feedback.  I ordered mine on July 5, 2013 and it was exactly what I expected...and I love it!  I&#x27;m searching for replacement heads now.  I want the same small head, not the double head.</li>
            <li> i have own this items for about 11 months now and it is still working really well for me and yes i would buy again if i have too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient，I want to clear my teech iImmediately！</li>
            <li> Oral-B pro health battery toothbrush cleans your teeth great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like when the Dentist cleanse them I would recommend buying this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tooth brush</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very reasonable price, quick delivery.  This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned; after I use it, it feels just like I went to the dentist to have my teeth cleaned.  I also find that I brush my teeth more often with this product.</li>
            <li> this was for my son and it seems to get his teeth very clean and we love the 2 minute timer on it. it makes it so much easier to brush his teeth</li>
            <li> I really like this powered toothbrush,it replaces a different brand that I was using. It is comfortable to hold, signals when two minutes have passed and is easy to replace the batteries. I also ordered three soft replacement brush heads one of which I put on as soon as I got the brush, soft is important.&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]]&lt;br /&gt;When it wears out I plan to replace it with the same brush.</li>
            <li> Cheap electric toothbrush.  My first electric toothbrush.  Has the automatic 2 minute timer.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. My old one needed replacing and I could not find this one locally in the stores. They only offered the same product with additional items not needed. The price was right and I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> Use these to brush my small dog&#x27;s teeth.  Great!</li>
            <li> I have tried all the toothbrushes out there and the Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Powdered toothbrush is the best. This is my second one and I am glad that you can buy replacement heads.  I hope Oral-B doesn&#x27;t do away with it.</li>
            <li> Far superior to the rechargeable models.</li>
            <li> Purchased this toothbrush for our 3 year old back in August 2012 and is still going strong.  This toothbrush seems to do a good job in keeping our daughter’s teeth clean as she has no cavities to date.  She’s has no problems using the toothbrush.  This toothbrush is very cost effective and I just purchased another one our other daughter who turned 3.  Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> I used to own a similar toothbrush (not round) and it did a decent job. This one does a good job of cleaning. Since it&#x27;s smaller it&#x27;s easier to reach the back teeth. The speed is about the same as any electric toothbrush. There is only one speed. You can either hold it down and use it or press the button and let it run on its own.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It cleans quickly and along the gums.  I keep one at work for after lunch brushing and my mouth feels clean and fresh.  I have a crown in the back and the thing I like most about this toothbrush is the small head reaches all the around that crown.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Been through two of these.  They stop working properly after a week or so.  While it&#x27;s running, it will just stop and make a clicking noise for a few seconds then (maybe) start up again for a few seconds.  This unit does have a timer which is supposed to pulse the motor when 2 minutes has elapsed -- That is NOT what I&#x27;m describing here.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush because I did not like the alternative which was the rechargeable one. Owned several rechargeable (internal battery) types but seem to have very little luck with these -- the motor failed, or the thing would not hold the charge for any reasonable period of time, or the speed degraded after some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This removable battery model, although made in China, seems to be better than the earlier ones that I had which were made in Germany and in Mexico. The speed seems to be much faster than the ones I owned earlier and the batteries seem to last a very long time, despite the fact that currently 2 persons are using the same unit. Three weeks on and I am still on the original batteries. I like the shape and the feel of these units, they are not cylindrical like the earlier ones I owned, and they are easier to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that these toothbrush are sold directly by Amazon. I ordered a couple about 3 years ago and these came from a third party associated with Amazon. The packing then was very poor and the items were almost falling out of the packs when I got them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current 3 that I bought came intact and very well packed, true Amazon quality. Delivery was prompt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall be ordering more, just in case these are phased out and replaced by inferior \\&quot;updated versions\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The weak point is the battery compartment lid, but the previous one did last for 2 years and a month. I would try to clean up the seal area as build-up occurs. It finally broke when I was not as gentle as usual--trying to get the compartment lid on by sitting it on the counter and pressing down hard.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I like it. It works great with eneloop rechargeable batteries (more powerful than the expired alkaline batteries it comes with).</li>
            <li> great price, replaced one I used for years</li>
            <li> I didnt order the rechargable one like I meant to, but I was desperate to replace my last oral b rechargable so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  It worked for 3 months and died.  I think I went through 2 sets of batteries a month (I dont brush my teeth any more than the average person!) until it slowed to a grinding halt.  It would rotate 1/2 a turn and stop.  VERY disappointing.  My rechargable lasted almost 3 years, I&#x27;ll go that route again.</li>
            <li> Great item, price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush just because I needed to spend a bit more to get free shipping, and my last electric one was worn out.  I&#x27;ve used several types of electric/battery toothbrushes in the past.  Some expensive ones gave out after a couple of years, so I said I&#x27;d only get the $5.00 kind at the drugstore from then on, as my dentist said they were doing a great job.  This was a little more, but I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.  It has good power, and I like the timer/pause feature.  It does have a small round head, and I would kind of like a bigger one for broader \\&quot;coverage,\\&quot; but overall I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> We have an Oral-B rechargeabke toothbrush at home, but it is inconvenient to bring along when we travel -- especially to countries with different voltage.  This battery-operated toothbrush solves the problem.  It is lightweight, does a good job on our teeth and is quite inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great spin ..Brush and it makes my mouth feel super clean.. I will be purchasing some of these for my relatives ..I brought the flossed head to used with this brush its a must have..</li>
            <li> I was hoping that since this was made by Oral-B it would work as well as my home model. It does not. Battery powered tooth brushes just don&#x27;t have the motor strength to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model for years, with &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; brush heads. They seem to have improved the cap over the battery compartment - it&#x27;s a little less frustrating to remove and replace.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product, so I got it.  I&#x27;m pleased with it.  The small head for the toothbrush allows you to control where it goes.  The timer feature is great, it does a stop-start-stop at every 2 minutes.  Also, the brush head can be easily detached for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Works great, my teeth feel cleaner than with the sonic toothbrush! My dentist recommended Oral-B spin rather than sonic. I think my teeth are already whiter.</li>
            <li> I hated having chargers in my bathroom as they look unsightly.  So I threw them away and bought the battery model.  It works just as well and the batteries have lasted about a month already and I have not had to replace them yet.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and a little bit noisy, but functions well. The brush is really tiny. Gonna get a larger brush.</li>
            <li> This replaces the AA battery-powered Oral-B brush I&#x27;d used for perhaps five years.  I finally had to replace the first one because the plastic cap for the battery compartment developed a crack and moisture corroded the contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first unit was much more expensive than Amazon&#x27;s current price but it was worth it.  It did a great job of maintaining my teeth and gums - a statement confirmed by my dentist and oral hygienist.  I had no hesitation at all in buying the replacement, especially at this price - it&#x27;s a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll go through a pair of AA alkaline batteries in around a month but eliminates the hassles of rechargeable batteries.  Not a bad trade off at all.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> My dentist can&#x27;t believe how little plaque I GET USING THIS TOOTHBRUTH.  iT IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it but I was skeptical.  However, after only a short period of time, I can see how much better it is than my regular toothbrush.  I do a much better job at brushing my teeth and I do a more uniform cleaning.  The 2-minute timer helps my routine.  Replacement brushes are not cheap (about $6.50 each in a package of three), but instructions say to change every 3 months, so cost impact is not so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted an electric toothbrush but I&#x27;ve never liked the idea of having to leave it out on the counter and unprotected all day while it is charging.  Since this is battery operated I can put it in a drawer when it isn&#x27;t in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has great battery life. I&#x27;ve had it for over 6 months and haven&#x27;t had to replace the battery.  It&#x27;s also compatible with all of the Oral-B heads</li>
            <li> Great value and cleans my teeth better than a $200 electric Sonicare...</li>
            <li> Bought this when my dental hygienist recommended I use an electric brush. Does a great job and is easy to maneuver around.</li>
            <li> I needed a brush to help with my receding gums and this brush was recommended by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. It does the job and doesn&#x27;t go through batteries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also really surprised how water proof it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it and it cleans with no hassle it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price but is not as smooth in motion as the rechargeable Oral-Bs. Brush head alone makes it worth a backup TB.</li>
            <li> SO far my parents love it and want to buy more for their friends. I guess it should work similar with the rechargeable ones and we will see how long the battery will last.</li>
            <li> Gets around the molars and inside front teeth with ease. Our dentist is going to be very happy!</li>
            <li> This only comes with one toothbrush head. you have to buy the other head separate</li>
            <li> I would love to use this brush if someone could tell me how to turn the stinking thing on.  Tried new batteries still nothing.  I&#x27;ll return this tomorrow for sure!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about this toothbrush at first because of the price. Let me tell you that just because it doesn&#x27;t cost more than fifty dollars does not mean it is not good! This is a great toothbrush and I love the fact that I can just switch out the batteries with another set of rechargeable AA batteries.</li>
            <li> wonderful,hope for more discount!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t use the one I spent four times more for.  It is very effective and durable.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This battery-powered toothbrush works well with the standard Oral B rotating heads. Use it with rechargeable AA batteries and it will easily outperform the disposable, rechargeable toothbrushes which only use 1-AA battery and fail to hold a charge after a while.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare stopped charging after one year, total cost during that 12 month is around $240. This unit is great, a little loud, actually it is pretty loud when compare to Sonicare. But it&#x27;s just affective, plus the replacement brush head 50% less than Sonciare. Annual operating cost for this guy is around $40 person vs $240 for Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush came with the unit is a little harder than I like, [[ASIN:B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] would be a better choice. I recommend use [[ASIN:B004UG41XW eneloop NEW 2000mAh Typical, 1900mAh Minimum, 1500 cycle, 8 Pack AA, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]]. They are the best rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I was always a manual brusher but this changed my mind! My teeth feel cleaner and stay that way longer, they are whiter and my breath is fresher. The batteries that came with this product started to fail after 6 weeks, but the new batteries I replaced them with are still going strong after 3 months.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the plug in electric toothbrushes but it works great for travel.  The batteries last a long time.  I recommend the Oral-B electric or the Sonicare for plug in.  If you travel a lot or cannot afford to fork out that much for a toothbrush this works just fine.</li>
            <li> When my seventeen year old Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush finally bit the dust (I presume the battery died), and it was time for a replacement, I decided to give the Pro 1000 rechargeable a try. I wasn&#x27;t looking for any bells and whistles, just something that cleaned well and felt solid. I also ended up getting this one for travel, but found that I actually liked it better, and started using it every day. It&#x27;s been six months now, and so far it has worked flawlessly. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the battery cover that others have mentioned. I usually use (older) Rayovac hybrid rechargeables, and have also used regular Energizers and have no difficulty getting the cover back on with either one. I also try to keep the handle clean so that crud does not build up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush does a great job on my teeth and gums, and it feels more like using my old one than the Pro 1000. I don&#x27;t know if that unit is more powerful, or if it&#x27;s just the 3D effect they advertize, but I find that the vibration is too aggressive. I have to use a sensitive brush head with it, or it feels like there&#x27;s a jack hammer in my mouth. Aggressive brushing is not better brushing. With this one, the regular brush head works great (same kind I used for years on the older model), and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sand blasting my teeth. It also feels healthier for my gums, where you don&#x27;t want anything too aggressive. Provided the battery cover holds up, I would definitely recommend this model. I also like the convenience of not having something else to plug in on my counter, and I can get a couple of months of use out of my batteries before I have to recharge them. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive electric toothbrush it exceeded my expectations.  Am still using it and will purchase another one if and when this one stops working</li>
            <li> So much better than a regular toothbrush! I&#x27;m reaching places I couldn&#x27;t before and my teeth feel so much cleaner than before. Not a substitute for flossing, but definitely goes deeper than a normal brush!</li>
            <li> This is a fine toothbrush and works well.  I use it when traveling and really like.it.  There is NO problem with opening the battery compartment that others have commented about.  There are two lock buttons on opposite sides of the handle near the battery cap that you push simultaneously to release the cover with a gentle pull -- no problem.  I suppose you could put just a bit of silicone grease on the rubber seal if you&#x27;d like, but it is not really necessary..  This is a good product at an economical price.  It uses the same replacement heads as my Braun/Oral B rechargeable toothbrush at home.</li>
            <li> Was suggested by my dentist. Works great at a great price!</li>
            <li> Terrible with battery life, half the brush head broke off in my mouth while I was brushing. After eight months the battery compartment corroded and stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for two weeks and it works okay.  I like that the batteries are replaceable,  but the brush is way too small.  It&#x27;s probably better for children than adults.  I&#x27;m going to get two more and use them for my daughters.</li>
            <li> It could have more speed.</li>
            <li> Get the same great cleaning without being forced to drag a charger along when you travel.  The battery (2 AA batts) life is around 2 months so is not an irritation to have to change too often.</li>
            <li> This is a personal preference, but the toothbrush is a bit loud for me. Makes me worry about waking my family up in the morning when I use it. The timer is great as well is the battery life span, but availability to change toothbrush heads is an enormous advantage. Also, the toothbrush head doesn&#x27;t rotate both ways (rotating-oscillating) which is highly recommended by dentist for electronic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: If your lazy you shouldn&#x27;t buy this. You will need to clean out the build up it accumulates inside the head at least each 2 weeks if you don&#x27;t already take great care of your toothbrushes. I would shell out some more money for one that covers all throughout its head.</li>
            <li> It is as good as the ones i&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and efficient</li>
            <li> I use this for traveling when I don&#x27;t want to pack a charger. The battery gives you about medium power for a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> seems to work better than expected. I also bought an expensive electronic toothbrush just to be able to carry this one around without having to carry a charger. pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> this brush fit the bill for my wife. As we  do a lot of traveling she needed a good toothbrush to pack. this brush is battery operated&lt;br /&gt;and has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get this guy.  Have had no issues at the dentist after I bought this and they are pretty sensitive on your gums.</li>
            <li> I needed a toothbrush with a small head to fit in my small mouth. This one works great and the rotating head spins better than most. I would definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Wow  I have loved this battery toothbrush for about 10 years and it finally gave out suddenly.  I didn&#x27;t know Braun still made this little baby.  Have been without it for about a month or so.  Just went to the dentist for cleaning and noticed the dental assistant spent a little more time cleaning than usual.  Told her my battery toothbrush had broken and she said using one makes a big difference.  Looked on the web and  &amp;#34;voila&amp;#34; here is the same battery toothbrush that broke and at a terrific price.  Much less than I paid for it years ago.</li>
            <li> First, we have used Oral B rechargables for years. We love them and nothing we know cleans like they do. Like most comments here, the cost is high and it seems crazy in this day to throw away a good product just because the batteries can&#x27;t be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this inexpensive option with AA batteries is so weak by comparison, that it is destined for the drawer with other items that we might use after a nuclear war is over. Our two year old Oral B 5000 is losing horsepower but is 2-3 times stronger than this offering. Certainly the AA model is better than an ordinary tooth brush, if you don&#x27;t have $80-100 to spare, it&#x27;s not a horrible option. But for our family (on a tight budget) there is no question. Our dental bills and oral health are easily worth the extra money every two years. Save your money on this one and put it towards the top end Oral B.</li>
            <li> Why it is made in China..</li>
            <li> I used to be one of those saps that brushed his teeth manually. In all honesty, I hate brushing my teeth. I&#x27;m always so exhausted in the early mornings and late evenings that I can barely lift my arms sometimes. These brushes not only take the effort out of brushing, but they also do it more thoroughly than I can myself. In the week since I&#x27;ve started using this brush my teeth have become much cleaner and noticeably whiter. I no longer brush too hard and cause myself pain. I wish this model was a rechargeable brush with a charging station but since I have quite a few AAs batteries lying around the house it&#x27;s not that big of a dealbreaker for me. And at this price, well I can&#x27;t argue with that.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these thinking I could use it when traveling instead of bringing along my sonicare electric toothbrush from home. Well, its ok. It does what it says it does and is compact. Is brush head is small and round though vesus my sonicare&#x27;s sort of rectangular shapped brush head. And the thing vibrates like a jack hammer compared to my sonicare. If you&#x27;re looking for something small for travel, and for a short duration of use, this is pretty good. I couldn&#x27;t use it indefinately, though, because of the head&#x27;s shape and the vibration.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is a good one.  Good battery life.  However, the bristles are a little hard on the gums.  My teeth feel extremely sensitive these days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how much power this toothbrush has compared to previous AA cell toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried. It does a good job maintaining speed even when pressed firmly against teeth. The 2 minute notification feature is nice, too. (It pulses on and off a couple of times at 2 minutes, then continues brushing.)</li>
            <li> Great at first, but started replacing batteries every 10 days or so. Ended up going in the trash. Bummer.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush isn&#x27;t as good as my regular Oral-B electric toothbrush, but it is a good option for when I&#x27;m traveling. When you&#x27;re used to the power of a base-charged brush, this seems pretty slow. Still, it does the trick and is still better than a traditional toothbrush. The battery was still working well even after our four week trip this summer.</li>
            <li> Only toothbrush I use. I like the battery operated since you can take it with you on vacations. My dentist gave me one on last visit and recommends using an electric toothbrush. The only problem is the seal in the battery compartment. It is difficult to remove and can leak or break if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I just received this and put the batteries in and it does not work.  Big disappointment!  I will get some new batteries and try again; otherwise, I&#x27;ll have to return it and go to a store and get one.  I can&#x27;t rate how it works until it does.  Maybe the batteries are dead</li>
            <li> 3rd unit - rally like it</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for kids.  It&#x27;s a good value and well made product.  Also good since kids don&#x27;t usually brush for 2 minutes so the electric model helps.  I use 2-AA rechargeable batteries and good to go.</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered this Thursday night at 7:30 and when I woke up at 8, it was at my house... Honestly that&#x27;s kind of frighteningly fast. BUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is incredibly inexpensive and works better than my previous rechargable Spinbrush. The brush is much smaller, however, the bristles penetrate farther and the actual movement of the brush wipes away the grime on my teeth like a charm. I recommend getting a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger. The batteries haven&#x27;t died just yet after 4 uses, but it just makes sense not to keep wasting money on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Oral-B makes an Excellent battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth it.  It&#x27;s a definite upgrade from my old, manual toothbrush.  I just started brushing with it, but it feels like it&#x27;s polished better in a shorter amount of time than my manual.  My mouth feels so fresh too.  I&#x27;m thinking about picking up some more for my family members.  Worth it!</li>
            <li> A tad slower than the slower than it&#x27;s top models, but it does the job and the batteries last.  I recommend Panasonic  NIMH &amp;#34;eneloop&amp;#34; for the job; they last about a month. GREAT FOR TRAVEL!</li>
            <li> works great like to rotate with my other toothbrush leaves with that clean mouth battery life is good not great</li>
            <li> wish the battery lasted longer, but overall good</li>
            <li> This product works very well, except that it replacing the batteries is extremely difficult because the compartment is too tight.  I have to use a screwdriver with a very small head.  That makes it impractical for travel.</li>
            <li> Good, it was what i was expecting!</li>
            <li> Works well, although the models with rechargeable batteries are a bit more powerful. But toothpaste does accumulate on the a bit difficult to clean charging device, at the base of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Update: 04/28/2016&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has become unserviceable after a year and a half.  Water has leaked into the battery compartment, rusting the contacts--especially the spring coil that connects the two AA batteries, and making a mess of the rechargeable batteries I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lessons learned:&lt;br /&gt;(1) You should not stand the toothbrush upright.  If you have a toothbrush holder, you should place it upside down, not letting the water seep into the battery compartment.&lt;br /&gt;(2)  You might want to consider dabbing some anti-oxidant dielectric compound onto the spring coil to prevent rusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don&#x27;t have too much of a complaint, considering that the toothbrush has already lasted a year and a half.  But there are ways that its design could be improved or that you can do as a consumer to make it last a little longer.  In that connection, I have changed my rating from 5 stars to 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I used one of those rechargeable toothbrushes also by Oral B, but over time, the battery no longer held charge.  It came to a point where I had to charge it every two days.  So I looked for ones with replaceable batteries.  I am glad I got this one.  I am now using Eneloop AA rechargeables.  With one charge, it lasts about 3 weeks with around 5-6 minutes of usage every day.</li>
            <li> really amazing , very cheep , very good ,</li>
            <li> Needed an extra for travel and this works just as well as the chargeable ones we use for the home!Also fits the same heads. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I take pride in my teeth. This toothbrush is one of a kind. It even has a timer so you don&#x27;t stop brushing prematurely.</li>
            <li> This works as well as my AC powered Braun Oral B toothbrush that sits on the counter in my bathroom.  This will make it much easier to brush my teeth when I travel.  And, the brush head uses the standard Oral B replacement heads!</li>
            <li> It is good brush but battery does not last long.I have found that I can buy the same brush cheaper in the store locally.</li>
            <li> One of the BEST product i bought when I came for a vacation!So portable! So handy!!!  LOVE IT SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH! I plan to buy more and give them as gifts when i get back to Manila! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> great for traveling without fear of running out of gas.&lt;br /&gt;the speed is substantially slower than the regular rechargeable, and also substantially louder, but it&#x27;s a great backup for travel. And at these prices, great.&lt;br /&gt;one of the advantages is that you can pack the batteries separately and avoid running down the batteries accidentally by bumping on the switch, which happens with the rechargeable model.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with that! It cleans my teethes a lot mainly the last ones.</li>
            <li> Took forever to find this again. We had one for a few years that finally gave up the ghost. Tried some other, cheaper brands. They were okay, but they weren&#x27;t Oral-B. Also, many of the strictly battery-operated toothbrushes have the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; brush heads. My dentist recommended just the one, round spinner and that&#x27;s what this has.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a replacement for the Oral B Precision Clean brush I ordered over 4 years ago.  The case cracked on my old brush and water was getting in the battery case.  I bought the replacement toothbrush for 9.99 minus a 2.00 coupon.  At 8 bucks a pop, with a new brush head and a set of batteries included, it is just about cheaper to replace the electric toothbrush every few months than to order the replacement brush heads, which are often counterfeit unless you buy the pricey big box store replacements.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. Cleans very well in the small tight spaces and the rotating action brushes away food particles nicely. Where have you been all my life</li>
            <li> great,going to buy another for my wife</li>
            <li> Working great so far!  -But It seems to brush at about 1/2 the speed of our old chargeable Oral-B brushes.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> One of the best travel toothbrushes on the market.  Takes 2 AA batteries and they last for weeks.  Saves you lugging cords and chargers when on vacation and it really gets your &amp;#34;pearly whites&amp;#34; clean.  The heads are the regular Oral-B heads so you can take the ones you use at home and still use this wonderful little brush.  I can&#x27;t think of a single negative thing to say about it.  It&#x27;s economical, it works very well, its easy to use and clean and you can use it anywhere in the world that has AA batteries.  Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.  I bought an extra one for my sister who lives in Australia.</li>
            <li> So far working well. I even keep it in the shower and that does not affect it working properly.</li>
            <li> Use nothing but Oral B products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this toothbrush and have used it twice(usually) daily for about 2 months now and I really like it. It fits comfortably in my hand and I feel it is doing a great job cleaning my teeth. So far the battery has lasted well with no sign of slowing down or power loss like I have experienced with other battery operated toothbrushes. I plan to use rechargeable batteries after the included batteries die out so I will probably update this review later.</li>
            <li> love this spinning brushh</li>
            <li> Love it. Better dentist checkups now that I am using this and not a manual toothbrush. i dont have to work as hard or as long. Love it. Wish I had bought one of these 40 years ago!</li>
            <li> It is better than rechargable ones.</li>
            <li> the package was open and the battery is missing......what will do?do i need to return this product.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t so sure when I bought it but even after 9 months it&#x27;s still going on strong.&lt;br /&gt;I love how clean my teeth feels after brushing!!!&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it for everyone to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite a few months now. It is a very cool product. Planning to buy another one shortly!!!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely love this except that the 1st time I needed to change the batteries, the cover won&#x27;t lock, so I have it taped closed. That&#x27;s very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Items as describe and its more affordable to buy in Amazon.I haven recommended my coll to use and she bought 5 for her family</li>
            <li> I bought two pcs, both broke down after the two-month warranty expired.&lt;br /&gt;I do not appreciate the way the manufacturer produces this product --they should be more responsible to make the product more reliable.</li>
            <li> ...she likes and will not return it.</li>
            <li> Not expensive and a set of batteries last quite a long time.  Not to mention you can clean your toddlers or your own teeth more effectively.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B for over 10 years. No research was necessary for this purchase. What is interesting about this one is that it tells me when to stop brushing, after two minutes it sends a pulsed signal that you are done, convenient and very useful. I recently purchase one more.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the replaceable battery to the rechargeable units, the battery version last much longer and I consider it more convenient on trips not to carry a charger particularly on foreign trips.</li>
            <li> Just let it do what it does, said my dentist.  This isnt the first battery brush I have had in the past, but my dentist noticed that I had been working it too much and my gums were showing signs of that.  It does have awesome cleaning, but I noticed it worked really well the first time I used it and not as great since.  Not sure if too much water had gotten in it or what.  And I wished the box would tell you what you will feel when the timer goes off.  I was expecting a noise or something else, but it does this thing like the battery is going out, which was odd.</li>
            <li> Did not buy this product from Amazon, but I wish I did as Amazon price is cheaper from where I purchased mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been a regular user of braun electric toothbrushes for many years.  Recent electric toothbrush used was the Braun Professional series.  Electric toothbrushes with built in non-user replaceable rechargeable batteries and chargers.  My gripe with electric toothbrushes with built in batteries is that after 2-3 years, the battery looses its charge and you have to charge frequently, to a point that you have to charge it everyday.  To make it worse the full day of charging is only good for 1x brushing, my wife normally brush first, by the time I use it I will loose power during mid brushing which is very irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am DIY guy and do my own built in battery replacement, but this solution does not last long will not explain technical reasons anymore.  But eventually will lead to the disposal of the electric toothbrush.  I have already gone through the cycle of 2x braun professional series toothbrushes.  And a brand new professional series toothbrush is not cheap, and with each purchase I also end up with more and more chargers as it is always the toothbrush that breaks down (I have 3 working chargers to date, with 3 disposed electric brushes).  I wished braun had an &#x27;electric toothbrush only&#x27; replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my wish was finally answered with Oral-B Pro-Health toothbrush!  Oral-B Pro-health toothbrush is also made by braun and powered by 2xAA batteries!  This is the best electric toothbrushes that I have used to date!  Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a. made by braun so expect the same quality and performance with Braun electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b. Unit is powered by 2xAA batteries.  You can use Alkaline or rechargeable batteries very flexible.  And you don&#x27;t have to bring your charger along when you go out of the country or on long trips.  Just pop in AA batteries and you are ready to go.  Oral-B has an electric toothbrush powered by 1xAA battery, but the power output is weak.  This model with 2xAA batteries is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c. 2x batteries last me approximately 4 months with a pair of duracells (as per my usage).  This has more operating time compared to Braun professional series.  4 months means that the toothbrush still works, but I find the power weaker, you will notice this when the 2 minute time starts vibrating, it does not vibrate like normal.  This is a good indication to replace your battery.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Don&#x27;t throw away your batteries as they are still pretty good to power TV remote controls, clocks powered by 1xAA batteries, and other low power devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d. Comes with 2 minute timer as with Braun professional series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e. Toothbrush power is about 50-75% of a Braun professional series.  Power output is decent and very usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f. Uses the same toothbrush head as braun professional series.  These are the best electric toothbrush heads in my opinion as they are small and quite functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g. User replaceable batteries means that I can now use this toothbrush for years and not worry about the non-user replaceable batteries of other electric brush models.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Have been using this product for 5 months so still do not have sufficient data on product life.  Will update this review with statistical data as I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h. Very affordable, I can buy 6 of these compared to the Braun professional series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i. No charger to worry about lessening clutter in the Toilet.  This to my opinion is also safer as I don&#x27;t have electrical wires near the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last tip:  I highly recommend the advise of one of the reviewers.  This is to put vaseline on the o-ring of the battery cover.  This prevents moisture from getting into the toothbrush and will prolong toothbrush life.  From 4 months of use no moisture build up and corrosion found in battery compartment yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and recommendto buy this.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest this model over non-user replaceable batteries of other brands/models.to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest this model over non-user replaceable batteries of other brands/models.</li>
            <li> It does not work.  I tried several times to position the batteries, and nothing helps.  I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Awful! Doesn&#x27;t brush a thing off my teeth. Don&#x27;t buy. Spend 20 more dollars for a spin brush or for one at target that plugs in and charges.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed to realized it was powered by AA batteries. I will run it a few battery cycles to see how long the batteries last.  If the batteries last 3 to 4 weeks the I would give it 4 stars. The grip fits right but the on off switch can be tricky when your hand is slippery with toothpaste.  Of course for the $10 price I should had figured it was not a single lithium rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> Unit appears to be just what I expected.  I plan to use it as a travel toothbrush so I don&#x27;t have to pack my home unit w/plugin charger.</li>
            <li> Bought to use int he hosptial and travel . I just love it  a rechargeable enuloop  battery lasts a long time in one . Brush heads are different then the home base units though but affordable . Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price . Worth keeping one in the glove box of the car .</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  Great price and arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li> At home I use an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush, which I love.  I bought this one for travel because it is smaller and lighter, and used it while traveling the past 3-1/2 weeks.  Although not as fast as my fully-charged rechargeable Oral-B, it works well and does the job.  So far I have used it about 50 times, 2 minutes each time, without it requiring a battery change.</li>
            <li> I love this Oral-B toothbrush.  I have used it for traveling and it works great.  It&#x27;s easy to pack and handy to use.  I do wish it had come with a cover for the bristles.  Would be nicer for traveling.</li>
            <li> This too is a good toothbrush and a great price.</li>
            <li> Its just what I wanted it&#x27;s a replacement for on I had used for 15 yers.</li>
            <li> Works good,  head is kinda small</li>
            <li> Great brush...battery cover a little difficult to remove, but wouldn&#x27;t prevent me from purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B toothbrush at home for years, the kind that sits on a little recharging stand.  I bought this one for traveling so I wouldn&#x27;t have to bring along the charger or worry about adapters when traveling internationally.  I&#x27;ve been using it a few days a month for at least two years, and though I always carry a couple of spare AA batteries,I haven&#x27;t had to change them yet!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat Oral-B for quality and design.  I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for years and just now have had to replace it.  Replace the head every three months, use regularly, and you will love your visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> We own several electric tooth brushes and we like them all and feel that they do an outstanding job in cleaning our teeth.  Almost all of them are made by Oral-B as they seem to make the best.  My wife loves this model as she can throw it into a bag for a trip and not have to worry about taking a charger with her to make sure that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is easy to hold as the outside is coated in a rubberized layer for easy gripping and the batteries seem to last a long time.  We change the brush head every 3 to 6 months.  It helps keep your gums healthy and the rotating head gets into the small nooks and crannies between your teeth and helps make your teeth whiter and cleaner.  That is because you can remove more plaque using this brush than when you use a regular non-electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the 2 minute timer that makes sure that you brush your teeth for at least 2 minutes.  A set of batteries last about a month.  We use Sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries and they do a great job and last longer that even the regular batteries.  The eneloop batteries are rechargeable up to 1500 times.  We charge ours in a smart Sony charger.  I will list the Amazon links below so you can find them easily.  The batteries are amazing and while it costs more money to get started they quickly pay for themselves and the charger many times over their life span.  The charger is about the best one that you can buy for AA and AAA Ni-MH batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004SB1TD4 Sanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 4 Pack AAA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001DL9WDG Sony Cycle Energy BCG34HRE4KN Quick with Refresh Charger and 4 Pre-Charged 2000 mAh AA Batteries]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great tooth brush and it really works well.  I recommend it to you!</li>
            <li> This is a nice toothbrush for the price. I use it when I don&#x27;t want to use my quicker manual brush and it seems to clean my teeth just as well.</li>
            <li> It works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the batteries might go quickly, but they&#x27;ve lasted about 3 weeks with only 10% loss in power (I brush 2-3 times per day).  Anyhow, I have rechargeable batteries ready when the current ones are used up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The batteries lasted an incredible FIVE MONTHS.  They are just common batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also thought it might be a little gimmicky.  But it is really easier to brush with this thing, especially on the vertical faces of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use both a manual toothbrush and this electric, saving the electric for the hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li> So so good for travel</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. The battery cover is a bit hard to open.</li>
            <li> Small head assemly makes it easy to reach back teeth. Good battery life and decent amount of torque. I would recommend this over the cheap $5 motorized brushes you can buy in the grocery store. Really good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Very useful! I like it!</li>
            <li> Product arrived early &amp; what seems to be great shape. Have used this electric toothbrush several times with no problem. It definitely feels as if it gives me an excellent brush &amp; my teeth &amp; mouth feel really clean afterward.</li>
            <li> We got tired of lugging our electric toothbrush charger with us when we travel, it&#x27;s just so big. I know, I know, 1st world problems. Anyway, we got this and it fits our oral-brush heads. Bought it and steripod toothbrush head protectors, and we&#x27;re all set! I can&#x27;t believe how little difference between this cheap brush and our expensive daily brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is perfect. But it has one major defect in battery section: after some time of work when you make a replacement of batteries the battery section cap failed to close. The issue is in rubber O-ring: it should be lubricated to permit the cap fully close.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used these battery powered Oral-B toothbrushes as travel toothbrushes for years. We were surprised to discover when we received this one that there was no plastic cover for the head, greatly reducing the usefulness of the brush for traveling. I called the company&#x27;s Consumer Care department and was told where I could obtain one online. I checked the site and found the cover for $4.80 plus $5.15 shipping for a total of $9.95. That comes to just $2.04 less than the cost of the brush, head and batteries!</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B Toothbrushes for many years and my old one finally threw in the towel. This was by far the best deal I found anywhere. The product was as advertised, shipping was fast-very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The gift to my family, very good.Will continue to buy.Is the toothbrush head is too expensive,Hope to be able to cheaper.</li>
            <li> Purchased the battery operated to take away on a trip as I didnt want to travel with a manual toothbrush or my usual brush with base and powerpoint charging.  This is just perfect.</li>
            <li> I really like this electric tooth brush.  For the price, it&#x27;s great until I decide to get a chargeable one.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am reasonably satisfied with those products. Opening it to insert batteries is very difficult.I purchased it because I thought it would more thoroughly clean my teeth than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I love this item...Other reviewers spoke of the difficulty getting the bottom back on after replacing the batteries...yes, it is a little difficult but put some muscle into it ladies! once it&amp;#34;s on...it&#x27;s completely waterproof! I&#x27;m happy with this item</li>
            <li> One less charger base in the BR. Seems to have a stronger action that my rechargeable that took a powder after 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;I have to keep AA&#x27;s on hand anyway (buy in bulk -- Got a teenage Gamer in the house) and I think this&#x27;ll be handier for traveling &amp; it&#x27;ll stow in my medicine cabinet. Other than that seems same as my rechargeable OralB. Accomplishes exactly what I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;At least with this when the battery fails, I replace the battery not the whole toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good price for performance.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want an expensive toothbrush with a rechargeable battery that would eventually burn out. This tooth brush works great and last a long time on one set of batteries.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive yet great</li>
            <li> Very good and sensitive. Just try.</li>
            <li> Great cleaning &amp; gum stimulation</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Our permanently sealed battery compartment, plug in Oral-B toothbrush finally gave out after 10 years.  This AA battery operated brush was less money than replacement batteries for the old unit (provided I could even get the old unit apart).  This one runs like crazy and I can use my own NiMH rechargeable batteries in it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after using this product and it&#x27;s an incredible price. And your teeth will stay cleaner longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rechargeable Braun Oral-B brushes for many years. I am on my 4th device, although, one of those, Triumph, now discontinued, which also moved the brush up and down, I only used briefly. Didn&#x27;t like it. All the rest, were the basic model, starting with the classic smaller white model. I wish they would bring that one back! It was the smallest of all and a classic design by Dieter Rams - the Joni Ive of the time.&lt;br /&gt;So how does this AA model compare to the rechargeables I had and have?&lt;br /&gt;Not at all the same. The head is the same and moves the same but the rechargeable is like a fast, powerful car. This one is more like a small, economy car. Both made well (the plastic and quality is the same) but, the power is slower and less intense. This is not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;If you run this brush on your teeth the FULL 2 minutes, it will work great for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;If your gums are sensitive, it might also be ideal.&lt;br /&gt;I also found it to be better if you use the gum massaging brush. If I use that gum brush with the yellow paddles on the rechargeable, it is uncomfortable. But on this model, it feels fine with the lower power.&lt;br /&gt;I did all my testing with the batteries that came with it. Later I will try various lithium ion rechargeable with it to see how they work as well as new AA batteries I buy. I&#x27;ll update here when I do.&lt;br /&gt;I am curious how long each battery type lasts. The rechargeable lasts about 3-4 years before it does not work as well. Braun says about 3 years. How does that compare to alkaline or lithium ion you can buy? Lithium batteries are supposed to last 1000 charges. The Braun rechargeable device use a nickel metal hydride, which is better for storage and use with motors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I’ve used it now for some time and, so far, I have not found a good battery option for it yet. It seems finicky on which lithium rechargeable it can use. I suspect it would do better with NiCad rechargeable AA. Regular AA alkaline batteries work better but, seem to loose brushing speed within a week’s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do need to brush for two minutes with this model. Use a fluoride toothpaste too.ed within a week’s time.  You really do need to brush for two minutes with this model. Use a fluoride toothpaste too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. All the pieces are there, it runs, but it&#x27;s noisy and does&lt;br /&gt;not clean teeth as well as the better made Braun&#x27;s that are made in Germany (this one is made in China and seems like a cheap knock-off).&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did not let me return this which is disappointing, but I&#x27;m guessing alot&lt;br /&gt;of people want to return it.  I went to Target and bought a German made model&lt;br /&gt;for 40.00 that is superb, just like the one I was replacing.</li>
            <li> Convenient and works well. However, I have been through 2 of these, and both times I have broken the unit when replacing the batteries for the 2nd or 3rd time. The fit is very tight on the battery unit, and residue of toothpaste tends to build up around the seal. When replacing the battery cover, so much force is required to close it, that the plastic splits.</li>
            <li> So far this is great for work travel. Battery can be changed easily when the time comes and I don&#x27;t have to worry about bringing charge base and plugging in, etc at the hotel now that I travel more for work.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Oral-B battery operated toothbrush I have ordered recently.  Both failed within 2/3 months.  Tried new batteries with no sucess.  No refund or replacement offered.  Loved the toothbrush when it worked!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, and the love it. Good value, oral b is a good brand. Its worth it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Good little toothbrush for great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for about six months now and it is still going strong, haven&#x27;t even changed batteries. It also has a built in timer feature that given a little stutter when you have brushed for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, small head is great for getting behind everything, great timer pulse/pauses at two minutes.  Got one for my grandson also.  Will definitely buy again. I have now been using this toothbrush for aver 2 months, and have had to change the batteries 3 times.  DO NOT BUY THIS TOOTHBRUSH UNLESS YOU OWN A BATTERY CHARGER.</li>
            <li> quickly delivered. I am very satisfied,</li>
            <li> bought this to use at the office. great tooth brush</li>
            <li> no nice. brush tooth so easy.</li>
            <li> This was for my son, and he just loves it.  Very easy to use, and really helps with his permanent retainer.  The batteries last a good long time, we use rechargeable batteries to keep costs down, no complaints at all!</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Great value for traveling.  Not quite as powerful or as fast as our home rechargeable unit, but a very adequate substitute at one sixth the cost. The removable and replaceable batteries thing is great for storage between trips.</li>
            <li> Oh My Gosh. I have had problems with cavities and yellowing on my teeth. After using this product, my teeth are significantly whiter and NO CAVITIES! Also, there is a timer built into it.&lt;br /&gt;Note: cannot disable timer and the bristle head is small.</li>
            <li> There are probably better battery toothbrushes out there, but they cost a lot more than this one.  For the price, this toothbrush does the job of cleaning one&#x27;s teeth quite thoroughly. My husband and I are pleasantly surprised and happy with our new toothbrushes.  I recommend them to anyone who needs a battery operated toothbrush--they do a much better job than regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit from Amazon.com. It functioned perfectly for about three weeks, then one morning, it could not be switched off. The batteries had to be removed to deactivate the unit, and in so doing I noticed that water had intruded into the unit&#x27;s internals and probably short-circuited the power switch. The water had also caused severe corrosion on the battery terminals. The unit was discarded.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS AS A REPLACEMENT FOR MY OLDER BRAUN TOOTH BRUSH, WHEN THE ON-OFF SWITCH STARTED ACTING UP.  I HAVE TO SAY THE OLD ONE WAS BETTER THAN THE NEW ONE. IT SEEMED TO RUN FASTER AND QUIETER.  ALSO, INFO ON NEW ONE SAYS IT WILL SIGNAL YOU AFTER 2 MINUTES OF USE.  THE ONLY SIGNAL I GET IS IT STARTS TO CUT OUT.  IS THIS THE SIGNAL ?</li>
            <li> as other have say its good if u want to be abel to use alot of battery or spend alot on recharable battery the brush head is small but u can change that and it it has a timer but the timer dosent not shut the bursh off it just keeps on going and and dont stop till u figure it that it wasent a short and the lame time and isent realy timer if none of this bothers u then great brush if these are think u dont like or dont think it would suit u speed more money and but one of the higer priced brushes from oral be i will be doing this later on happy hunting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw this is my opion and i am a seller on amazon so i know what i am talking about</li>
            <li> Its working fine, especially considering the price. But one of two stopped to work after just 3 month. I mean I know we are living in 21st centure and no new  \\&quot;thing\\&quot; supposed to work longer than warranty period, normally 1y. but 3 month?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no warranty. no refund. one way investment. there are also happy folks which got broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but works great. My 4 year old loves using it to &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; his teeth so that is enough for me. He actually looks forward to brushing now!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush did a great job and has a great life with regular batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one gripe, the base cap to exchange the batteries are difficult to take off.&lt;br /&gt;After the few changes the base cracked and rust set into the battery contacts and rendered the toothbrush useless.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have been using this product for over 18 months. I liked it enough initially to buy two more and if I wrote this review earlier, I would have given it a 5-star rating. As many reviewers already mentioned, I bought this because of the replaceable batteries. I put 2 Eneloop rechargeable batteries and this toothbrush rocks for over two weeks. I tried the Vitality model before but was disappointed the charge would gradually diminish over time so that you have to charge it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why then the 3-star rating you ask. After about six months, I broke the cover trying to replace the batteries. I bought two more and then subsequently the covers of those broke as well. I wrote to P&amp;G and they are sending me a replacement but that doesn&#x27;t address the basic flaw with the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all AA batteries are of the same size. Depending on the brand and model, length of AA batteries can vary as much as 2 milimeter. That&#x27;s why you read reviews of this model which mentions the impossibility of putting the cover back in. If you have a set of batteries that are longer than the norm, you can not put the cover back in without breaking it. I informed P&amp;G the fact and I hope they redesign the cover to address the issue. As is, it&#x27;s almost a great product.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, but very effective and not cheap.  Why on earth would anyone spend more than I spent for this great toothbrush unless they have a real fixation and money to throw away.  A toothbrush is a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush, best price ever. My almost three year old now loves to brush his teeth, even by himself. Awesome.</li>
            <li> I am used to a sonic toothbrush. The vibrations on this make my nose itchy. Almost every time. I am still using it though, it&#x27;s a nice brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head is only one rotating brush.  The good thing is it is compatible with several Oral-B brush heads.  Does it really need 2 batteries?  It doesn&#x27;t seem like a powerful motor.</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these for over three years, and it is still working fine.  For the battery cover issue, I put a little petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on the gasket, and the cover slides on and off easily.  I have tried rechargeable batteries, but they don&#x27;t work as well as regular alkaline (Lose power too quickly)</li>
            <li> Works well as a daily toothbrush, definitely better than a manual brush, would be ideal for travel as well. I replaced it with a rechargeable Oral B model and noted that this one is slightly heavier and spins at a reduced speed.</li>
            <li> I got this ahead of a three-week vacation.  Two of us used it twice daily and one set of batteries turned out to be fine (voltage down from 1.5 to 1.37 or so, but enough to keep powering the toothbrush adequately at the end of the trip.  Note that I said \\&quot;adequately,\\&quot; b/c after that amount of battery drainage, the brush was not spinning nearly as fast as our Oral-B electric, which sits in the charger all the time).  I used a little vaseline and a piece of electrical tape to seal the battery compartment and don&#x27;t see any evidence of water in the battery compartment. For home use, I&#x27;ll stick with our Oral-B electric so as not to have to hassle with rotating batteries.  (Our last Oral-B electric lasted \\&quot;forever\\&quot; when I followed a program of draining the batteries completely once every one-three months.)</li>
            <li> Bought item 3 months ago form Amazon.com.  Stopped working regularly.  Replaced batteries.  Runs off and on during cycle.  At times, does not run at all.  Will not replace this and would not purchase again.[[ASIN:B002HWS9FW Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li> This little toothbrush is fantastic value for money. If using AA batteries really bugs you, use rechargeable ones, but it&#x27;s a very easy and low-risk way to test whether you like using one or not.</li>
            <li> I had about the same experience as Joanne and 4paws. I bought two of these toothbrushes; this one, for me, and the same one for my wife but with the full brush head (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWS9G6/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i01). Mine had a very weak brushing action from the start, and I tried to remedy it by trying several different sets of batteries. This didn&#x27;t help, and within the week it had fully died on me. My wife&#x27;s is still going strong and I might just purchase that one again, but I fear I may have the same bad luck.</li>
            <li> stopped working after 2 months. normally it&#x27;s a 1 star because of the amount waste of plastic and other materials. i&#x27;ve been using radius env. friendly toothbrushes cost about the same, but this one cleans so well..i would have easily given 5 stars for that reason.. going to try to find something a bit more expensive that will last longer..</li>
            <li> toothbrush to have! It is a must for everyone who can afford it.</li>
            <li> Revised review from 4 to 1 star, after 4 months it began hesitating under pressure (as a few other reviewers have noted), gradually worsened to the point it will not really function.  Not the batteries, same thing after changing.  It&#x27;s going in the trash.  Like the competitive price, but expect better durability than this, going elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review after one day: I give it 4-stars because it works surprisingly well and is a great value if it holds up.  It was very comfortable on the teeth and gums, as well as easy to hold with the ergonomic grip.  The battery compartment seemed like a good design to me.  Took off one star because: No instructions in package (probably a one-off anomaly), the 2-minute timer does not shut the unit off, only slows it momentarily (w/o instructions, don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s intended, seems to me it would be to shut off).  Neither is a deal breaker for me.  For the price, hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Really good product and an amazing price. Perfect for traveling since you don&#x27;t have a charger to lug with you.</li>
            <li> Bought this one for a summer home, since I like the one at the primary home.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 2 months now.  The bottom part where the batteries goes in does not connect anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this device drains the life of batteries quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great beginner&#x27;s toothbrush though, that&#x27;ll last you 2 months if that.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer ensures that you brush for a full 2 minutes, it&#x27;s cheap, and since it runs on AAs, it&#x27;s very portable. No clunky charger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever used one of the higher end Oral B toothbrushes, you&#x27;ll be able to tell that this one is a lot weaker.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first couple of months.  I loved it.  Then it just stopped working.  Tried changing the batteries.  Made sure they were installed properly.  Nothing.  I never dropped it.  I used it twice a day for normal brushing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Worked great for 3 months and then died.</li>
            <li> GREAT BRUSH EASY TO USE &amp; TRAVEL WITH</li>
            <li> Tooth brush workes great, just like the one that I have had for 6 years, which died. Since, leaveing AMAZON PRIME my shipping is slow.</li>
            <li> Should have purchased this long ago</li>
            <li> I really like this. I does the job done and I already see that my teeth are getting cleaned properly. Certainly worth it!</li>
            <li> The rechargeable unit has always run slow. Although it kept its charge, it never seemed to run at the correct speed.  I was thinking of replacing it with another, but ran across this one for $12.  I bought it, and it works very well, better, in fact than the rechargeable unit. And it included both the brush and batteries.</li>
            <li> I love the handle which has a better grip than my electronic Oral-B toothbrush.  Also, the fit of the toothbrush onto the handle is tighter.  I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries after about 3 weeks of using it once/day. (I use my electronic toothbrush the other time each day.)  I&#x27;m testing it out for a coming trip.  So far, excellent.</li>
            <li> Good product and I will purchase it again when needed.  Price was better than the market and I love Prime.</li>
            <li> I seem to have a pretty small mouth and have a lot of problems getting regular toothbrush heads to the back of my mouth. This toothbrush is PERFECT for that. I also threw out my original one after about a year and tried a different brand electric toothbrush, it was terrible! SO i tried YET ANOTHER in a different brand, and that was also awful. underpowered and I just felt like my mouth was never clean! I don&#x27;t think I will be buying any other kind but this brand from now on!</li>
            <li> I had a recurring plaque problem. This toothbrush solved it--and I love the timer feature. And that it stands up all on its own! It&#x27;s like a rocket ship solving dental problems everywhere.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this. I made the mistake and this toothbrush stopped working after 1 month.</li>
            <li> Having an issue with spending an entire two minutes brushing my teeth and wanting an electric toothbrush, I began looking for an electric toothbrush with a built-in timer. I began looking into the Sonicare line of toothbrushes before stumbling upon the Oral-B rotary-style brushes. Because these brushes were a fraction of the price of a Sonicare, I was skeptical, but since it was cheap to &amp;#34;try it out,&amp;#34; I went for it. I won&#x27;t be buying another electric toothbrush anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I picked this toothbrush versus others is based off of what I took away from other reviewers on other products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Price; this product is a fraction of the price compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;- Rotary brush head vs sonic brush head; my dentists have always recommend brushing in a circular manner versus a back-and-forth method. I have heard that sonic brush heads are much more prone to being a breeding ground for bacteria. I decided to opt for the rotary head.&lt;br /&gt;- Replaceable battery vs. rechargeable; most electric toothbrush batteries end up going out completely after a year or two. I didn&#x27;t want to deal with having to dock my toothbrush and worrying about the impending doom regarding the charge going out, so I decided to get the AA-powered model that was cheaper. I instead am using recharegable AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;- Timer; this product has a timer. It will turn on and off about 3 times after 2 minutes. I don&#x27;t need different &amp;#34;brush modes&amp;#34; or anything.&lt;br /&gt;- Travel; Because there aren&#x27;t any additional parts, taking this brush with me while I&#x27;m travelling is just as simple as carrying around a manual toothbrush. Just make sure your battery has juice before you take it with you. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The battery lasts about 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush is relatively loud compared to a Sonicare, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;- The entire brush is waterproof and you can run it under the sink. I wouldn&#x27;t submerge in water though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can prevent the battery seal from cracking by routinely keeping your toothbrush clean. Your saliva/toothpaste will naturally want to get within every groove of this brush. Just run the entire brush under the sink and the wipe everything down after you&#x27;re done, it takes about 20 seconds. I clean the seal around the battery case every 2 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product, it keeps my mouth feeling much cleaner than it ever did with a manual brush and I see it lasting a long time. Even if it does break at some point as other reviewers are stating, it&#x27;s very cheap to replace as the price suggests. I&#x27;m just curious why I didn&#x27;t do this sooner..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can prevent the battery seal from cracking by routinely keeping your toothbrush clean.

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I even tried new batteries &amp; the toothbrush never would come on.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works well, its powerful and the batteries last for a long time. I like it and think its just right for me</li>
            <li> It eats batteries so fast......</li>
            <li> Works great. Battery runs out a little quickly (or maybe it just seemed like it). Gets good power to the head for a good clean.</li>
            <li> this product works well and is well built . u have the ability to be mobile  and &#x60;helps you to keep your mouth and teeth sanitary .</li>
            <li> I had one of these Oral B brushes for years and it was great! When it finally died (after a long time) I was looking forward to getting it again. But I think the product has gotten more cheaply made over the years. It eats through batteries like CRAZY and doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as powerful. It&#x27;s ok but I think I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> Very nice productbwith good quality and performance, it is a good choice for anyone wants to get an effective toothbrush with reasonable price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush. It seems to work even better (more power/rotations) than the rechargeable one I have. Because its so compact it&#x27;ll be great for travelling because I don&#x27;t bother taking my rechargeable one with me when I travel &amp; I travel a lot! I&#x27;ll probably get at least another one of this model to keep in the different locations I travel back &amp; forth between. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the environmental factor of the batteries it needs but I&#x27;ll be sure to dispose of them correctly.</li>
            <li> After using this for a year, this toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t work anymore, even when the battery was replaced. I recommend just saving up for the re-chargable version, unless you are looking for short-term use.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this works since it just uses aa batteries.  It seems to work as well as the rechargeable version.  It works great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I was amazed on how good this product is. Its perfect if you are a beginner in the electric toothbrush. Its been working flawlessly. The batteries hold for almost 3 months ( used every day once 2 mins ).&lt;br /&gt;Easy to open and cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complained about it being too hard. If you have sensitive teeth, you need to look somewhere else. If you have normal teeth, this will work very well. You can then graduate to other products if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the replacement heads. Difficult to find and a lot of fake ones on Amazon</li>
            <li> Okay product, but could be made a little more heavy duty to last longer.</li>
            <li> Good product. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I love this oral-B electronic tooth brush!</li>
            <li> I replaced my electric toothbrush with this purchase.  I highly recommend the brush for cleaning your teeth. I have traveled with it already and it was wonderful having my own and not a manual. It is also nice not to have a unit on your bathroom sink top taking up space.  No problems with shipping, received early, best price I could find. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush but what type of replacement batteries should I use. I only had hit for like a month and no batteries I buy will work.  It&#x27;s not broken</li>
            <li> Works really well - and has a two minute timer which I like.</li>
            <li> Works well, and needed a cheaper priced replacement Oral B electric toothbrush. So far, it has held up to the test of time. Its nice that it accepts the OEM replacement heads that one can purchase in the multi-pack at Costco especially when the go on sale once a year or so.</li>
            <li> This item arrived in several pieces and is not eligible for return. The package was open and the batteries were scattered around the box which contained other items I had ordered.</li>
            <li> Fits in my suitcase, doesn&#x27;t need to be charged, and it does the job.  Stores near me had several alternatives at a much higher price with lots more bells and whistles I did not need.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Pro-Health Precision works very well to me.  One quarter after I have used it, my dentist told me that my teeth had less buildup than before.  It costs only about $10.  To me, this is a nice deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;(1) Circular motion gives you better results.  I tried [[ASIN:B000AMRII0 Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush]] before, however their back-and-forth does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;(2) This one does have a timer.  When it reaches 2 minutes, its vibration becomes slow, and you can definitely feel it.  Please note the 2 minutes duration is not adjustable.  I don&#x27;t mind this at all because the 2-minute duration works just fine to me.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Compatible with rechargeable batteries.  I power this toothbrush with 2 AA Energizer rechargeable batteries and recharge them about every other month.&lt;br /&gt;(4) Replaceable bush head.  I like to use [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]], and they work really well.  I got very good price of these heads from my local Sam&#x27;s Club.&lt;br /&gt;(5) Reasonable Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;(1) Toothpaste buildup on the O-ring of the battery holder.  This is the only drawback I find.  When I change the batteries about every other month, it becomes hard to open or even close the battery cover due to the toothpaste buildup on the O-ring.  One workaround is to wash the O-ring and leave some water on it.  Then it is very easy to close the battery cover.  However be careful for this workaround - make sure you don&#x27;t short circuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on May 20, 2013&lt;br /&gt;The battery cap broke on May 20, 2013. I started used it in Jan 2011, so it life-cycle is about a little over 2 years.</li>
            <li> Works better than my old one battery one. We&#x27;ll see how long the batteries hold up.</li>
            <li> I would have gave this 5 stars, if there is no cover crash issue. Finally I solve the issue by adding some oil each time I replace the battery. Except the design issue, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> did not work properly.</li>
            <li> For the price (little more than the crummy electric brushes that you get at drug and grocery) stores this is a fine dental instrument.</li>
            <li> Great fast service but the toothbrush is very shaky making it very uncomfortable while brushing.</li>
            <li> Low price, great clean fresh feeling after brushing, and long lasting replacement heads convinced me to buy a bunch of these as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> The replaceable batteries and head on this makes it an excellent choice for those who want a power brush on the road. A bit noisier than its big cousins, but still does the job well. I use the long, thin self-sealing plastic bags available at Asian markets to store chopsticks to store this in my bag.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful battery operated toothbrush.  I have had several different brands and this is by FAR the best.</li>
            <li> Had previously for years and loved it&#x27; .It finally went and I replaced it with the same one.its tHe best I&#x27;ve used. Continuation of the review.  Brush is great. Replacement of batteries is almost impossible. A manufacturing defect maybe. Broke a fingernail one time! Would have sent it back but  had used too long. Replaced toothbrush once and am having same trouble. May get another brand. Will contact manufacturer first. Would return to Amazon, but dont know their policy on how long.</li>
            <li> I use it very day! good experience!</li>
            <li> Smaller toothbrush thAn I thought</li>
            <li> I very like it！It&#x27;s very good！</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 of these in the past 8 months.  All of them developed cracks in the batter cover, leading to water corroding the inside and resulting in toothbrushes that stop working.  It&#x27;s a shame because, when the toothbrush worked, it did a good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush since the start of 2011, and it still works like new. I&#x27;m really surprised by how good it is, especially considering its price. It does a great job cleaning and performs consistently even when the batteries are low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is compatible with the usual replacement toothbrush heads, and it works with standard AA batteries. The high-end models have integrated batteries, so when they eventually wear out, you have to replace the whole device. In contrast, using this model with a pair of good rechargeable batteries will go a long way. Batteries such as the Sanyo Eneloop can be recharged over 1000 times, and if they wear out, you can simply get a new pair of batteries, rather than purchase another toothbrush. Fully charged batteries can easily get you three or four weeks of use, so you would have to use the toothbrush for more than 50 years before the batteries wore out, anyway. I doubt any electric toothbrush would last that long, but the point is that the battery is not the limiting factor in the lifespan of this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly care for the extra features on the really expensive models (electronic displays, etc.). They seem pointless to me, and I suspect having numerous extraneous features increases the probability that the toothbrush will break. The pricey models cost 5 to 10 times as much as this basic one, but you can bet they won&#x27;t last 5 to 10 times as long. I spent around $100 on an electric toothbrush a few years ago, and it didn&#x27;t last more than a year. This $11 version is still going after at least two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s absolutely no reason to spend more than $50 on an electric toothbrush. Expensive models don&#x27;t last long enough to justify the price, and they don&#x27;t clean any better than the simpler ones. If you just want the benefit of oscillation-rotation cleaning and not a bunch of fancy but useless features, get this toothbrush. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice product packaging was also good and is very easy to sue and to store would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> First thing to mention here: They fixed the battery compartment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately , there are no instructions on how to replace the batteries; in fact, no instructions at all, though it&#x27;s fairly intuitive. The next paragraph explains how to do this on the current version of this model. It is very easy for me, and I don&#x27;t have a lot of strength in my fingers!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have an earlier version of this toothbrush, but apparently it was a nightmare to attempt to replace the batteries on this model. It is a piece of cake now, but there are no directions to explain how to do it. If you just try and pull the bottom cover off, you will probably not succeed; in fact, you might break the cap so that it will not hold the batteries in place. Here&#x27;s what you need to do: Press firmly on both raised dots in the center of the blue half-circles just above the bottom cover. It will release the cap. Then gently pull the cap away from the bottom . The polarity of the batteries is marked on each side of the bottom of the brush. It is hidden by the cover but you can see it when the cover is removed.  The cap will go on the base in either direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, you can press one raised dot on one side, then the other, and then remove the cap. It can&#x27;t get much easier than this. I feel for those who bought earlier versions of this toothbrush, but the good news is that the company listened to the complaints and made changes. I bought this one knowing I could get a refund if it was difficult to work with the battery compartment, and I was quite happy that it was a breeze to change batteries. Since the batteries come packed separately and are not installed inside the device, I had to remove the cap to insert the Duracell brand AA batteries before I could use it, so I got to test that part out right away. I did this several times to try and see what all the complaints were about regarding the bottom battery compartment cover, but I didn&#x27;t see anything to gripe about. I believe that those who complained must have had an earlier version of this one. I know it&#x27;s not exactly the same device because they advertise on the back of the package \\&quot;Improved technology delivers more consistent battery performance\\&quot; which indicates that they made at least one change to it. I do not know how long the batteries last yet since I just got this today and made some comparisons to the rechargeable model I have. If you have any problems inserting the batteries on this newer version of this model, don&#x27;t force the cover on; just try using the same brand (Duracell) that came with it and you should have no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric toothbrush works very well. No gimmicks, it just works. It&#x27;s the battery-powered version of the one recommended to me by my dental hygienist (which was the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000). It&#x27;s very similar in most respects except for a few things. It has removable batteries, not rechargeable fixed batteries inside the case. The ones that come with it are Duracell AA&#x27;s, but you might be able to use rechargeable NiMH batteries, which I have not tried (yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a 2-minute  timer for brushing your teeth; after 2 minutes have elapsed, it shuts itself off. (Of course, you can turn it back on again if you need to.) Unlike the rechargeable version I mentioned above, it does not vibrate differently every 30 seconds to remind you to move on to another quarter of your mouth. (I would have paid a bit more for that feature.) There are no instructions to explain about the timer, but it has the word \\&quot;timer\\&quot; just below the ON button (which doesn&#x27;t have the word \\&quot;ON\\&quot; anywhere near it) and it mentions it on the package as well. I can see someone trying this out for the first time and thinking that it was defective. Braun would do well to include a slip of paper with brief instructions on this device. It would make using the brush a much better experience for first-time users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This uses the same brush heads that the the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 uses (several other rechargeable models also use the same brush heads also), so they should be readily available. There are at least three types of brush heads for the Oral B toothbrushes. I like the ones with the small round brush only, but there are dual-action types also if you prefer those, and at least one other type.  I did exchange the heads between my rechargeable Oral B toothbrush and this one and they fit either handle. That being the case, this may be less expensive in the long over buying those $5 throw-away battery-powered toothbrushes that have no replaceable heads, especially if the generic replacement heads work out.  It would feel wasteful to me, throwing a powered brush away every 3-6 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are generic brush heads available. I haven&#x27;t tried any of these yet, but I have read that some generic brush heads do not last and break. Some work, others don&#x27;t, and you can have a mix of these in a batch if you buy them from online auction sites. If you buy them here you can send them back for a refund if you are not satisfied. There&#x27;s some satisfaction in knowing that, but it can be an aggravation to return them, so you may just want to buy the brand name replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes have some bristles with a tint that fades over time to let you know when it&#x27;s time to replace it. I think it&#x27;s more of a marketing tool to get you to buy replacement brush heads more often, but you can use that as a reminder if you prefer. I will replace mine when it feels too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads have a colored ring between the head and handle so you can tell one from another if more than two people in a household use the same product. The replacement heads, if you buy them in a multi-pack, have different colored rings, so if you buy one of those packs when you buy the product, you will probably have several colors to choose from. Alternatively, you could color one ring with fingernail polish and let it dry before putting it on a brush head, or just use some colored tape around one or more of the main parts of the device in your bathroom. You could even make a label for each handle with the user&#x27;s name on it. Or just put the brushes in different places for each family member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is much better than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past. I will definitely brush my teeth more often now that it&#x27;s so easy to do. Easy to do? How hard can it be to brush your teeth with a regular toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to try one of these to understand. I tend to brush too quickly and I&#x27;m not very thorough, and this device helps me time how long I brush in each quarter of my mouth. Sure, I could set a timer and keep an eye on it, switching to different parts of my mouth as the timer counts down, but this is very convenient. It also probably does a better job without brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done using this brush or the rechargeable one I have, I feel like I just came from the dentist&#x27;s office having had my teeth cleaned. That&#x27;s better than any powered or manual brush I&#x27;ve ever used in the past. I can highly recommend this powered toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Edit: I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for 2 months and I&#x27;m still on the same set of batteries that came with it. I use this daily at work, 5 days per week, to put this into perspective for you, but I was surprised that I got 2 months of use out of the original batteries. I plan to try rechargeable NiMH batteries and keep one of my small chargers at work when these batteries are finally exhausted.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful, please click the YES button below this review. Thanks!!!ses the same brush heads that the the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 uses (several other rechargeable models also use the same brush heads also), so they should be readily available. There are at least three types of brush heads for the Oral B toothbrushes. I like the ones with the small round brush only, but there are dual-action types also if you prefer those, and at least one other type.  I did exchange the heads between my rechargeable Oral B toothbrush and this one and they fit either handle.

            <li> I love this brush, have used some of their brands earlier and was not disappointed. For the price, the quality is good.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes really work great.  If you use them correctly your teeth are much cleaner than traditional brushing when you are finished.  Battery life is good.  The timer is perfect for trying to get your kids to brush long enough.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  I also had the oral-b 4000 model (I think it&#x27;s been replaced with a new model) that costs around $80 - I left it somewhere while traveling and I bought this to fill in while looking for something else..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m not going to look for something else.  This is essentially the same thing as the fancy model.  The only thing i miss is the 30 second timer - this only tells you when 2 minutes are up.  So far I have gone 3 weeks on the same set of batteries and the motor strength stays the same regardless of battery charge.  The 4000 would get substantially weaker as the charge degrades.  Also, I see the replaceable batteries as a plus.  I can take it on the road and not worry about running out of juice (not that I&#x27;m worrying much about my toothbrush batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Never had a bad Oral B product. Love their electric toothbrush heads and the job the do keeping my teeth clean and my mouth fresh. Had a rechargable one for years, now I prefer the battery operated one.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as a electric charging toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed experiences with this toothbrush.  As a toothbrush, it works brilliantly.  But the heads are expensive, and I&#x27;ve had three major problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first problem is that I tried buying toothbrush heads online, and they were counterfeit heads that broke very quickly!  This upset me a lot...I resolved the problem with Amazon, and got a refund and got the seller shut down, but it bothered me that I was having to do the work for this, rather than the company selling the toothbrush heads.  I did let them know, and they assured me that they&#x27;d take some sort of action, so we&#x27;ll see.  To me though, this is a sign that maybe the toothbrush heads are too expensive.  If they weren&#x27;t so expensive, there wouldn&#x27;t be demand for counterfeiting them, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem was that the brush itself, the handle with the motor and battery, didn&#x27;t last very long.  It worked beautifully for about two years but then it just died.  That&#x27;s not good...I don&#x27;t want to have to throw out and replace a product like this so quickly.  When I called them, they said that that was close to the normal lifetime of the product.  I&#x27;m not happy with that...and seriously, if it&#x27;s just the battery, I&#x27;d rather be able to buy a replacement battery for cheaper instead of throwing out and replacing the whole product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third problem is when I went to Europe.  I checked all my appliances--laptop, camera charger, cellphone charger, everything I would possibly want to bring with me was dual voltage--except the charger for this toothbrush.  Seriously, of all the devices that you would want to travel with, isn&#x27;t a toothbrush the #1 one?  So I bought a converter--which turned out to be defective, and it fried my toothbrush charger.  When I called customer service, they told me I could buy a replacement charger online for my model -- for the cost of $22.  That&#x27;s about the cost of a new toothbrush.  Seriously!  I was frustrated and upset that they wouldn&#x27;t sell me one at-cost, or even ship me out one for free as a courtesy.  It seems wasteful to throw out a functional toothbrush when only the charger is broken.  I hate waste and I think this company&#x27;s handling of this situation creates extra waste by having me throw out a perfectly usable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I raised all these concerns with customer service, and the person was very courteous.  She listened to me, assured me she would pass on my comments, and offered me some coupons, which I accepted.  I think that, for the price of this product and the price of the replacement heads, they could do much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not quite there yet...in terms of the product itself, and the support.  In order fro this to be a five-star product, I&#x27;d like to see (a) dual voltage chargers at least offered as an option (I&#x27;d pay $10-15 extra for this because it would be cheaper than a converter and less risky because I&#x27;d know they&#x27;d tested it with the product) (b) the option to replace just the charger at-cost, for existing customers. (c) a product that lasts longer than 2 years of use. (d) the option to replace just the battery if the battery is the reason for the product dying (e) slightly cheaper toothbrush heads.  I recognize that this is a fairly complex products, and the heads themselves are pretty high quality, but I do think they could do a better job of keeping the price down.me one at-cost, or even ship me out one for free as a courtesy.

            <li> Sturdy and worth the price. It honestly feels like I&#x27;ve just came back from a professional cleaning, and even my dentist told me I&#x27;m doing a good job haha, Batteries do not last incredibly long, but if you use rechargeable ones and are CAREFUL when changing them (aka closing the battery section all the way, not making the same mistake twice...) you&#x27;ll be fine. Also consider that I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice already, the the second time the battery section opened and closed with a lot less trouble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you are looking for something affordable, but of good quality.</li>
            <li> Great. for my stay in the USA.</li>
            <li> loved it but couldnt get replacement heads from amazon...</li>
            <li> Dentist said I must stop using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Using this with rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush!! I love it so much I ordered another one as a gift for my brother! I like that it is battery operated and not a toothbrush you have to charge. This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used in my life, and I&#x27;m so glad that I used this one first. It&#x27;s a good quality brush for the price. The only slight downside is that it&#x27;s hard to remove the bottom cover to replace the batteries (my husband has to actually do it for me and he has a hard time with it), but the toothbrush works so well I consider that a minor thing.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very good and easy to clean the teeth. I am lazy and it helps. And... it is efficient.</li>
            <li> The head of this toothbrush feels too small.  It seems to take forever to brush with.  It spins too fast and irritates my gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for 11 or 12 years and love it. However, when I travel I take this one with me because it is compact and has the same type of brush head that I use on the electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;As far as I am concerned this brush manages to do a terrific job with very little effort. The small brush head can get into the smallest places and get to all that nasty debris that collects. My teeth also feel ultra clean. I usually floss at least once  a day after brushing and I am always a little surprised by how little excess debris is present after using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this brush is the relatively short life span before batteries need to be replaced. I usually need to replace the battery after three weeks of continuous use.</li>
            <li> Comparing to the rechargeable Oral-B model this is as good for a fraction of the price. Use rechargeable AA batteries at 2 for about $5 and it will save you alot of money. The batteries last a long time. Actually longer than the built-in rechargeable Oral-B model. Uses the same exact brush heads so it cleans just as well. For this price, you can get 4 vs 1. Good deal.</li>
            <li> I liked my first electric Toothbruch very much. It&#x27;s works fine, as described, stops every 2 mins to signalize about time to change the sides. I read about hardly-to-open cover, but mine opens easily. To prevent water to leak into battery  cell, i have wraped it up with sticky tape and all seems to work fine :-)</li>
            <li> Purchased 3 of these for my family. Both mine and my husband&#x27;s are very poor quality. We change batteries frequently, but brush works sporadically at best. Vibrates fine until you actually try to brush your teeth. Then, it stops. Frustrating, and do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I keep it plugged up in my bathroom.  there is no indication of how long it will last.  the box states the battery inside is of no use and when it stops then the toothbrush is over.</li>
            <li> These are a great value. Run on 2 AA batteries. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Great as a travel brush. Purchase one and have used it for a few weeks and now ordered a second.</li>
            <li> Good as non-battery Oral B</li>
            <li> It works great! Just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great price and good product. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I did comparison shopping when I wanted to replace my elderly Oral B toothbrush and this is the best price I found. It&#x27;s the brush recommended by my periodontist. Arrived quickly. Works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  You can spend thousands of dollars on a Sonicare toothbrush but your dentist is still going to hate you.  This is an affordable toothbrush and it is BATTERY POWERED!  Yes, therefore, you don&#x27;t rely on a charging system that will eventually lose it&#x27;s effect.  Instead, buy this, buy some rechargeable batteries and get your teeth clean(er).  Will you please floss too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for many months and it still works like the day I opened it.  Replacement brush heads are very affordable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy!  I used it two times with no problem but during the third use the brush stopped spinning.  I tried to open it to see if I could fix the problem but it immediately broke apart. ... It went straight to the trash.  What a disapointment.</li>
            <li> If you start using this, you&#x27;ll never be able to go back to a regular toothbrush, as your teeth will not feel clean. My hygienist recommended this over all the more expensive brands. Coupled with a whitening toothpaste and mouthwash, it works almost as well as a professional whitening treatment. I find I brush longer and pay closer attention to each little tooth with this Oral-B thingy.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great. I only drink bottled water so I buy the tooth paste with fluoride in it and this helps me get it to all the back teeth.</li>
            <li> Works great... can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re so cheap.  The batteries last a long time, so I&#x27;m glad it uses AA batteries instead of needing a charger.  At this price, when the head wears out, I&#x27;ll probably just replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Really like this electric toothbrush.  Just wish it came with a cover for the brush head.</li>
            <li> I like the replaceable head and battery</li>
            <li> Affordable and very good quality</li>
            <li> I typically store my toothbrush, and brush for that matter, in the shower.  I was looking for a good quality electric brush that didn&#x27;t have to be charged daily.  So far this Oral-B is still going strong on the first pair of batteries for over 6 weeks.  The brushing action is certainly not like my old Sonicare, but it is very effective and will vibrate three times when 2 minutes is up.  I use the flossing action heads and so far, I think this is a perfect combination of form, function and price.</li>
            <li> Loved this toothbrush when I first received it - a gift from a dentist.  Easy to use, did a great job, made me wonder why I&#x27;d never tried an electric toothbrush before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it began stopping - or slowing until the brushes were barely moving - after about 30 seconds.  If I turn it off and wait 10 seconds or so, then turn it back on, it will resume working at its normal speed - but then stop after about 10 seconds of use.  At this rate, it can take all morning to brush my teeth.  I&#x27;ve tried replacing the batteries - not at all easy, since the case is VERY difficult to close again.  It made no difference.  I replaced the head of the toothbrush, thinking perhaps it was some sort of switch keeping me from brushing too hard and the worn bristles were causing it to be set off too easily.  That didn&#x27;t make any difference either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad.  When it works, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush, but I&#x27;m not buying another Oral-B, since reviews suggest this is not an uncommon problem.  Think I&#x27;ll try a Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I bought a [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]- plus the soft replacement brush heads recommended by some reviewers - and have been happy with it.  No problems at all - though I do miss the Oral-B, which seemed to fit my hand better and was more comfortable to use.  When it worked.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works better than manual brushing. Nevertheless I am curious just how thorough the brushing is because the head of the tooth brush is much smaller than traditional brushes? All in all, this has been a good investment.</li>
            <li> We purchased 3 of these for everyone is the house.  We will buy them again when ours wear out.  These are great!</li>
            <li> I have used these brushes for several years now.  My teeth are much cleaner than I can manage with an old style manual brush.  I prefer this type of electric brush because AA batteries are available world wide.  Often, when traveling, I cannot conveniently recharge other batteries.</li>
            <li> Not sure of description on Amazon... I read this needs AAA batteries ...  It comes with two AA Duracell batteries and works well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has lasted over a month with rechargeable Energizer batteries I put in. I prefer this now over the rechargeable brush I have that plugs into the wall. So distracting and clumsy to have the brush with a cord by sink. It doesn&#x27;tmake sense anymore to buy an $80 electric brush when the $10 does the same job. Just invest in rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my husband last year because he prefers an electric one over a manual toothbrush. He was using it for 6 months when the head just stopped working. He changed the batteries a couple of times and tried different kinds of batteries but still it didnt work.</li>
            <li> Very good but very slightly under powered toothbrush.  The rechargeable version has much more umph, but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have found that these battery operated brushes last a long time before the battery needs replacement.  My previous rechargeable tooth brush had to have a cord system and added clutter to the sink area.  When the recharging system died, so did the use of the brush.  My dental hygienist has been impressed by the quality of tooth cleaning with these inexpensive brushes - so save money and not get carried away with the exotic brushes. Simple is better and just as effective.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed. Works great and would buy again . Consider if you need a good toothbrush that lasts</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I purchase this device, and I am glad I did. I began to see results within days.</li>
            <li> entrega oportuna y calidad esperada, volver&amp;iacute;a a comprarle a este vendedor. el producto cumpli&amp;oacute; con las expectativas. que buena compra.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B spin brush is absolutely wonderful for a number of reasons and that is why I give it five stars. I&#x27;ll give you a deep cleaning all the way down to the gums and below, your teeth will feel incredibly clean and you&#x27;ll throw every other to express you have in the garbage regardless of how much you paid for it! I&#x27;m talking this will clean as good as a Soniccare vibrating rechargeable brush priced four times this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: An absolute deep cleaning of your teeth and gums each and every time. A convenient timer lets you know when you&#x27;ve already brushed for two minutes and then you&#x27;re done. They handle is designed with a lot of thought; very easy to hold on to all at the same time, there&#x27;s padding to help prevent any spin brush from irritating your teeth from the vibration of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;ve yet to come up against anything I would even think about changing with this brush so I hope the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t do so either.</li>
            <li> For years knew about these and was like - not worth it. After getting this for like 10 bucks it is totally worth it! Teeth feel clean and replacement brushes are not that much more than standard tooth brush. Have rechargeable eneloop AA batteries so good to go. If you are on the fence get it now. Wife has the fancy 100 dollar model but I bet they do about the same</li>
            <li> Its the best toothbrush you will ever own.  Do yourself a favor and buy this little toothbrush, Your mouth will thank you! :)</li>
            <li> My almost 9-year old daughter has a real problem with staining on her teeth.  She brushes regularly but her teeth still looked stained.  Only a trip to the dentist for a cleaning made them look better.  Bought this toothbrush for a very reasonable price and have been astounded at the results.  After just a few uses the staining is almost completely gone, just a bit remains between her teeth.  Very impressed with how well it cleans her teeth.</li>
            <li> I choose this toothbrush because I was looking for an ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH as what was stated on the page ELECTRIC not BATTERY OPERATED as it was, and I only found out when it got here!! I was very disappointed as I have been happy with everything I have gotten from AMAZON up to this point !~!</li>
            <li> I used an electric brush and didn&#x27;t like it.  However, this one really works and it comes at a great price.  We ended up buying another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to watch out is that the replacement brushes are a bit pricey.  Like the Kodak model, the refiles/film is where the money is made.</li>
            <li> Been traveling 2 weeks and still running on the initial batteries.  Works just as well as my rechargeable at home.</li>
            <li> Great produce. Fast deliver.</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a year.  I like how well it cleans, and the battery life, but I hate trying to change the battery - it is almost impossible to get it closed.  I have to push with all my weight on it to get it to snap shut and today it cracked.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say, I LOVE Oral B toothbrushes!  The battery operated ones are great for travel and sleepovers.  So if my kids lose them, I&#x27;m not having a heart attack on the cost to replace them.  This item is a great value bc it includes the batteries AND a toothbrush, replacement toothbrushes are at least $7 a piece.</li>
            <li> So what is the story, I read the description/specs and it says it uses triple A (AAA)&lt;br /&gt;but some of the reviewers say they use Double A (AA). (?)</li>
            <li> I use my electric toothbrush every day and feel it cleans my teeth plus inbetween very well.  Received as expected and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Cleans my teeth much better than manual toothbrush.  Batteries don&#x27;t seem to last very long.  I get around 3 weeks and have to replace.  Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Worth every single cent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the OralB rechargeable toothbrushes for years (the low end models).  But the heads were too expensive to replace.  So I thought for under $10, I&#x27;d give the Oral-B Pro-health precision clean battery powered one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 6 months and I feel pretty happy with it.  While it&#x27;ll never be the $200 sonic blaster ultra mega supreme toothbrush quality, it gets the job done.  Teeth are nice and clean, battery lasts about 6-8 weeks. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Best ever because it is on battaries. No worries about wires.</li>
            <li> Works great! Makes you want to keep brushing. Feels good on your gums.</li>
            <li> the price is very cheap, very worth buying</li>
            <li> This is my travel toothbrush. It works just as well as the re-chargeable home version.</li>
            <li> Died after 4 months.  Replaced identical model that was used for 3 years.  Poor quality all around, seals weak, electronic timer faulty and motor weak.  Save your money on this.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed love it.</li>
            <li> I have a nice Panasonic battery operated electric toothbrush at home, and decided to get another one for the office use.  I decided to purchase  this Oral-B toothbrush because I can find the replacement heads at local stores.  But it was a huge mistake!  It requires 2 batteries, and makes a loud noise and huge vibration.  It sounds like a neck massager or some large device.  It is awful, and rough on my gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I cannot return it, it went to trash.  I ended up buying another toothbrush.  Senzacare TravelSonic Electric Toothbrush is several dollars more than Oral-B, but it is much better in style, size, and noise.  Panasonic slim electric toothbrush is also nice, but cost more.  Just do not buy this Oral-B one.</li>
            <li> No much vibration and very loud</li>
            <li> Works great. Only downside is that the blure parts turn black.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my 6 year old oral-b electric brush, and decided on this one after much reseach. The brush head hugs my teeth perfectly. The shape makes cleaning back molars easy. No corner of my teeth can&#x27;t be reached. It&#x27;s got improved power and effectiveness compared to my old brush. And for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first e-toothbrush and it does its job well. It costs no more than 10 bucks, you can not expect too much of it.</li>
            <li> I like regular tooth brush better you can clean your teeth better because you can apply more pressure but this unit did work just fine for the price.If you want a battery operated tooth brush would recommend it.</li>
            <li> i actually bought this for my 6 year old daughter. But she seems to rather use a a regular toothbrush. So i took it since my electric brush broke. I love that i don;t have to plug this in to charge it. It&#x27;s great and works great.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of cleaning teeth.  However the battery compartment cover is difficult to take off and put on, and has actually cracked.  Ordering another one.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Have had better. Wont buy another one. I DO like the timer (2 minutes) it goes at half speed for a few seconds ... so I am giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement for my brush that stopped working. I like this one because the brush heads spin and are small for smaller mouths. These are harder to find intbis are and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> For me, this battery operated toothbrush tends to break after 6 to 9 months. After going through 4 of them I have now decided to stop buying this product. I don&#x27;t handle the toothbrush roughly or anything, so I don&#x27;t believe that I have caused the problem. This toothbrush uses double AA batteries that you replace by opening the bottom part of the handle, where the battery compartment is. Perhaps water gets inside the battery compartment and then the motor, and that&#x27;s why it breaks? I think I will buy a rechargeable toothbrush (that doesn&#x27;t use replaceable batteries) next time, because those batteries are permanently sealed and probably better protected from water.</li>
            <li> Or just good regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the other heads yet, but the included head works well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it with rechargeable NiMH batteries and see if it retains its power, but it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> Why purchase a recharging unit that hogs up bathroom counter space with wires, etc? This power toothbrush answers this question in spades. My wife told me her Oral B toothbrush was losing power and she needed a new one. I went to Amazon and found this replaceable battery version and read the reviews. This really is the best option for those that are considering ordering another Oral B with the charging station. The power seems even better with the two AA batteries that come with the brush. Next time my wife&#x27;s power toothbrush is losing power, I just need to flip open the easy access port on the bottom and insert two common AA batteries. Oh, and the base of this unit is sturdy enough to support the unit upright on the counter top.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for a recent trip to Europe since my usual Oral-B rechargeable would not work on their electric.  After using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years, I hate to go without, even when traveling.  My usual brushes work on this brush so I won&#x27;t have to buy new ones for future trips (this comes with a brush).  Also comes with batteries which lasted me nearly 2 weeks.  I am a thorough/long brusher so I&#x27;m not surprised that I needed new batteries before the 2 weeks was up.  Batteries are easy to find.  This brush does not spin quite as fast as the rechargeable version but it does a better job than a plain old toothbrush so worth toting along on vacation.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great if you travel and are use to using a similar Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrush.  I like the fact that you can replace the batteries and it takes the same replacement heads as other Oral-B professional care electric toothbrushes.  For 25+ years I&#x27;ve always used normal toothbrushes and ever since I&#x27;ve switched to Oral-B precision care line I will never go back.  Whiter looking teeth and more pleasant dentist checkups.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted this model doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of the fancy rechargeable (plug-in) models, but at only a fraction of the price, I promise you, it gets the job done, perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And overall it is even a better brush than the less expensive Crest Spin Brush (which I also like very much) as the smaller head allows for more thorough cleansing of each individual tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oscillating bristles thoroughly cleans and massages the tooth, tongue and gum areas of the mouth and leave the areas feeling very clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And combined with daily flossing (with regular dental floss) --and weekly use of my handy dandy Waterpik Oral Irrigator (the one with 6 interchangeable heads including the tiny tooth irrigator--so awesome!) and monthly use of my GUM plaque hook scale/scraper thingy, my teeth have absolutely no plaque issues and are looking better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prices vary greatly on this automatic toothbrush, and sometimes the other stores mark the prices up, but it should still be possible to find them on-sale for less-than $12each, so compare prices carefully before buying-- as they always have them on-sale for between $9-$14per toothbrush, and while it&#x27;s really good to be able to find them here, consistently like this, on Amazon and also there&#x27;s another outlet that might be helpful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ob.factoryoutletstore.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: If you are trying to move towards more holistic cleansing, you can try Burt&#x27;s Bees All-natural Toothpaste OR Tom&#x27;s of Maine Total Care All-Natural Toothpaste, OR if you&#x27;re up for it, you can make your own cleansing tooth powder with equal parts Baking Soda, (freshly ground) unrefined Sea Salt and Calcium Magnesium powder and voila, all-natural Re-Mineralizing tooth powder! A great natural-whitening and tooth re-mineralizing powder to supplement your all-natural toothpaste-- and a great way to save money on those messy whitening strips and help the environment in the long term as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this little toothbrush gives great bang for the buck (a great buy)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A, or Five Stars!t way to save money on those messy whitening strips and help the environment in the long term as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this little toothbrush gives great bang for the buck (a great buy)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A, or Five Stars!</li>
            <li> Very good, recommended to every one (with teeth)</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and store . . . gentle but thorough cleaning with a brush that&#x27;s comfortable for those who have a small mouth. For those who have arthritis or related medical conditions, you might need help opening the battery compartment the first time (and yes, I did). To those who wrote reviews, thank you for helping me with a great choice!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had shoulder surgery on my right arm and am clumsy with my left, thinking that I&#x27;d go back to a manual toothbrush when my arm recovered. No way, this unit is getting my teeth way cleaner than I could ever do with a manual toothbrush, without hurting my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried a Philips Sonicare toothbrush a few years ago but was not impressed. The Philips unit just vibrates, whereas the Oral B unit rotates the way they do at the dentist office. (It&#x27;s ironic that Philips invented the rotary electric razor which I use, but they don&#x27;t make rotary electric toothbrushes?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life: Purchased 7 months ago, I&#x27;ve only had to change the batteries twice. I don&#x27;t see the point in spending $100 for a rechargeable toothbrush when batteries only cost a couple of dollars a year. In fact I&#x27;ll probably just discard the whole unit after a year and buy a fresh one, at this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been thrilled with this purchase.  I bought it in 10/2012 and have not had any issues with it.  For me the battery cover comes off and goes on with very little trouble.  I do use Energizer Lithium AA batteries which are stupid expensive but I do get about five or six months out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remove the head and dry the handle after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered a second unit to keep in my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is the volume.  Some have said this is is quiter than more expensive rechargable units but I cannot imagine that.  I&#x27;m always worried about waking the household when I brush early in the morning.</li>
            <li> A great travel toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth and tells me when to stop brushing. Who wouldn&#x27;t like that? The replacement heads are not cheap, but you can&#x27;t put a price on that just-came-from the-dentist feel. I need to try some different heads as the one included doesn&#x27;t seem to get in between the teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush because I accidentally ordered replacement heads that didn&#x27;t fit the one I had. Great toothbrush with excellent power.</li>
            <li> Still getting used to electric toothbrush, but Oral-B products haven&#x27;t failed me yet.. recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to know what replacement head to get.  I&#x27;d like to have a product # so I am sure to get the right one.</li>
            <li> Good alternative option if electronic brushes seem expensive - good battery life</li>
            <li> If you have not used battery operated tooth brush before, please do yourself a favor and start ! It is great.  My son uses it and it has a timer that help him to brush for a full two minutes.</li>
            <li> I travel a good deal and used to carry an electric toothbrush with its plug-in stand. This one works off batteries and eliminates the need for the stand. Not only does this cut down on what I have to pack and carry, but it also means that I don&#x27;t have to worry about using it in countries where the electric current is not the same as that in the US.</li>
            <li> I love this small tipped electric toothbrush.  I have sensitive teeth so this works very well.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works very well.  It&#x27;s very high powered and I find it superior to other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  However, the battery cover is impossible to get on.  We have two of those and both have the same issue.  I&#x27;ve tried both Amazon brand and Duracell batteries.  You have to hammer on the cover by smashing the toothbrush into the counter or floor.  I&#x27;d suggest using a carpeted floor to smash the cover on so you don&#x27;t break it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush failed after a little over a month. Quite a disappointment. Tried lots of different batteries. My husband&#x27;s version works fine.</li>
            <li> The stupid thing doesn&#x27;t stay on while brushing your teeth. I have the plug in oral b and it is great, don&#x27;t know the difference in price but I wouldn&#x27;t waste any money on this one</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes the 2 minute timer and it runs a good-long time on a single battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful changing the battery as some reviewers have stated they broke the battery cap while removing it.  Depress the latch clips and wipe it clean before installing.  I don&#x27;t see this being a problem.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment cover becomes increasingly difficult to remove as time goes by.  Now I almost need to use a pair of pliers to get it off.</li>
            <li> this is my third purchase of this product.. love it</li>
            <li> my second purchase of this and my last, somehow water gets in the motor and reduces the quality of these things.  Its good for perhaps a month or so but the motor always ends up bad on these things.. or atleast on the 2 that i have bought.</li>
            <li> I have bought total 4 pieces of this toothbrush for my son and nephews. It works well until I need to replace batteries. It turned out that I need all my strength to open/close the battery cap. It does hurts my fingertips. Bad design.</li>
            <li> Love it my old one died</li>
            <li> Love the portability (no charger required) and the 2 minute timer. Don&#x27;t need to look at the clock. Also, there are a lot of 3rd-party compatible brush heads out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have two more of these that we&#x27;ve used for a few years and they&#x27;re still working well. The only thing to note is that if you use the heads with 2 bristle groups, the batteries will run down a little faster.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown on picture..no complaints</li>
            <li> IT IS GREAT. AFTER USE IT, I REALIZED I COULD&#x27;T CLEAN THE TOOTH CLEARLY BEFORE. SO I BUY 4 ADDITIONAL AS A GIFT TO MY FRIDENTS.</li>
            <li> Has plenty of power. Batteries still strong after a month. Cleans teeth perfectly. Nice pressure on the brush and it is comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;To clean the small gaps between teeth, I will recommend you get the following oral-B floss&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00240UWGG/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00240UWGG&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;hocivfd-20</li>
            <li> Again, Great price and great item. I bought it exclusively for my back teeth, way back, and boy thank goodness it gets back there! Feels much much better than reg tooth brush I feel like ive actually cleaned there. Wish I had this years ago. I do still use a reg toothbrush all around, taking care of you teeth is a must and so is this item. Thank you seller</li>
            <li> Gets into all the nooks and crannies. Had one before. It lasts  long time.</li>
            <li> Simply purchased as a replacement charger for one that I dropped in water.  It works and always leaves ones teeth clean.  Re-Use Tip - I use the old heads to clean the thin spaces in my car interior, stereo, etc (rinse well first to remove any traces of toothpaste)</li>
            <li> This is my third one of these ... I&#x27;m still using the second one I own, but it&#x27;s several years old and so I purchased a third just in case. They last a long time. Just replace the 2 AA batteries. Nice thing about them is that I can travel anywhere with these and not have to worry about whether my plug will work or if I need a charger converter. The Oral-B head is small enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting my foot in my mouth, and with fully charged batteries, it brushes and polishes away.</li>
            <li> I think this one works just as good as the 89.00 one.  And it really saved me money.</li>
            <li> I bought One for me and one for my husband. It cleans your teeth pretty well. It&#x27;s a very good quality piece considering the price. The only complaint I have is the loudness.</li>
            <li> The price is so good that I bought two, one as a spare.</li>
            <li> Performs as it should and as you would expect from an Oral B product. I purchased this brush and a different variant for my children, work great and my kids love them. Nice price, replaceable AA&#x27;s, good size for smaller hands. The giggles while brushing are priceless! The kids say that it tickles sometimes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 2 previous brushes like this -- both lasted a very long time.  I like the size &amp;weight and it seems to do the job well.  I like not having to plug it into a charger.</li>
            <li> Gives your teeth a dental visit clean.</li>
            <li> Just got the toothbrush and everything is working great. Just what i needed for my travels. very happy with it.</li>
            <li> what can i say about this nice Battery Tooth Brush it&#x27;s work fine &amp; Help me to protect My Teeth i like it very much it&#x27;s Batter then the Regular Manual Tooth Brush easy to use and moor convertible i hope it&#x27;s keep working in good condition cause i read some Costumer Reviews it&#x27;s get slow after 1 month&#x27;s even change the battery new one. any way i love my battery tooth brush &amp; i am Happy to have it</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush a lot because I do feel and see a difference in the way my mouth feels. Also love that it has a 2 minute timer. Would have given it 5 stars however, removing the base to change the batteries is just too much work. The base is hard to remover and it&#x27;s even more difficult replacing the base. I kid you not, I can get it off but my grandson has been putting it back on because I just can&#x27;t do it. Either I&#x27;m not strong enough, (should you really need super human strength to replace the base) or I&#x27;m crazy. And crazy I&#x27;m not!!!</li>
            <li> We switched from the $5 sonic toothbrush to the Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush.  I love the built-in 2 minute timer so the kids (and I) have no excuse.  Affordable, and easily able to change heads every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have owned a pair of these AA-powered toothbrushes for well over a year, and they are still going strong.  We use good quality rechargeable batteries, and we change the heads about every 4 months. I have found that best results are achieved by recharging the batteries every 2 weeks.  Weakened batteries will not provide enough torque to the brush head, and the bristles will not move as they should. Good quality batteries should take at least 300-400 charge cycles, if not more.  This scenario sure beats throwing away a $100 rechargeable toothbrush because of a dead internal battery (been there).</li>
            <li> Water got inside the battery compartment and it stopped working within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use rechargeable brush of the same company and the brush head.  My kids needed better brushing, so I got this, which uses same brush.  It uses 2 AA batteries!  If you read somewhere that this brush uses AAA batteries, it is a misprint.  I also use eneloop rechargeable battery, which I recommend without reservation.  This rechargeable battery is also great for wireless mouse, which consumes batteries.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy ,good choice, i hope to find heads in the future ,consumption is very low on battery it does a great clean like never before..</li>
            <li> same vibrating action as the plug in models&lt;br /&gt;for so very much less than those models and it uses the same brush heads.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist.  It is small so it reaches my back teeth and gums with no problem and no discomfort, which is why the dentist recommended it.  My mouth and teeth feel fresh and thoroughly clean when I&#x27;m done.  It has a 3 minute timer, though I usually go past the the three minutes.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This was my first electronic toothbrush. After one month it slows down or stops while brushing. Very disappointing. Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> When compared to Phillips Sonicare these are more the quality of a kid&#x27;s toy IMHO. Strictly mechanical, plastic parts.  I predict a short service life in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Update: These are / were so ineffective I &#x27;bit the bullet&#x27; and replaced my Sonicare (way more expensive, waaaaay better) brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use/keep at work. It&#x27;s a great little solution. It&#x27;s definitely not as powerful as the more expensive models, but I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and think it&#x27;s a good value for the price. The hum it makes when running is slightly annoying, and solicits some odd looks from others if you&#x27;re in a public restroom, but for the price I think I can get over the strange buzzing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, tried–and–true :) Been using Precision Clean toothbrushes for years now and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else to clean my teeth!</li>
            <li> does not clean like I thought it would but does a fair job</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is ideal for travel. It is just the right size. The convenience of battery and not having to use a charger makes it a winner.</li>
            <li> The spinning/vibrating is not as vigorous as my previous electric toothbrush (which was the kind you set in a charger to charge) but this one also doesn&#x27;t form that gross gunky stuff at the bottom like my previous toothbrush did.  Been using it for a few months and battery seems to be lasting well!</li>
            <li> 2 min timer best thing ever</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Although not a rechargeable toothbrush, it is lasting a long time on 1 battery, and it will be more convenient for travelling which is important to me. (one month, so far and still going well - for 2 people, twice a day) I guess you could use a rechargeable battery and then it solves both problems! Excellent cleaning - as good as the rechargeable (more expensive) variety.</li>
            <li> Great dental check-ups since I have been using this product.  It is handly and travels well.  Bought this for a gift.</li>
            <li> Should probably get a new head though... I looked... it&#x27;s been.... 3 years!  ugh.  I soak it in peroxide (with a little mouthwash to give it a nice smell)  Sometimes the pointy metal end of the handle part needs a dip too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find storing it with the two parts separated helps.  I&#x27;ve stopped doing that in dryer climate though.  Battery door can be incredibly difficult to pry off, but batteries really last though.  I don&#x27;t use rechargeables any more, because alkalines last much longer, and long enough that I don&#x27;t waste too many, maybe 4+ months, when consistently using this, and not grabbing the manual brush.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after one week or so. Not a good option. Can I return this item? I&#x27;m really upset about it!</li>
            <li> First electric I&#x27;ve owned...does a wonderful job of cleaning while being very easy to hold and maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;Will see how long the 2 AA batteries last.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected; works great. I bought replacement heads separately, it turns out those were not the originals. No issues with this product.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B electric toothbrush and always missed it while traveling.  No longer….  Works like a charm.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected too much for the price. As a Sonicare user, I wanted something small for short trips. Well, I use a regular toothbrush rather than this weak thing.</li>
            <li> I have braces and prefer the smaller head as opposed to bigger head electric toothbrushes. Does the job, and love the timer!!!</li>
            <li> very good very good very good very good</li>
            <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon to date.  This is my first battery/electric toothbrush and I now severely regret not adopting these sooner.  I haven&#x27;t tried other brands but I do see why this Oral-B is the #1 seller on Amazon.  It&#x27;s sturdy, easy to use, and cleans the s*** out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditional manual toothbrushes should cease to exist and everyone should start w/ this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome service. Was replaced super fast. Also the toothbrush works great. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It works, but is very weak. It is definitely NOT like the normal rechargeable type. I bought this for traveling, but it might as well be an old fashioned tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I think I wore this battery down!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush over a year ago (I believe), and it has worked very well.  It does a very good job cleaning my teeth, and the batteries last quite a while.</li>
            <li> So fa so good on this product.  Needed a new electric toothbrush and Oral B is always a good bet.</li>
            <li> I have had this for quite a while and it does a good job with enough power to have them feel clean without going over and over. But the batteries don&#x27;t last long and the cap on the bottom is very difficult to remove to change the batteries. Usually need a pliers or something and I have to have my husband do it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I had the first one for years and years and finally broke down and bought a new one. My teeth feel super clean! I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> no doubt........... this is the best electric toothbrush out there........well,, out here.. haha!</li>
            <li> Needed a good electric toothbrush to take better care of my teeth. Oral-B is easy to use and does a great job of cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> I re-ordered because my old one finally died. I also got one for my 88-year-old father who has trouble brushing.&lt;br /&gt;It works great for all of us. Particularly for gums, it cleans and massages helping to prevent cavities and disease.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS.</li>
            <li> efficient and well designed. I just wish the batteries came out more easily.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it.  It is nice and portable so he takes it when we travel.  Because it runs on batteries there is no need to bring along a charger.</li>
            <li> was not going to make a trip to try and find this in a pharmacy. found it online and prime got it to me fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;If you do no have an electric toothbrush GET ONE! They make a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap compared to some plug in/rechargeable ones.&lt;br /&gt;Replaceable heads.&lt;br /&gt;Pulses off-on off-on after two min to let you know your are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;runs on battery. It is powerful enough and you don&#x27;t have to worry about cables outlets which comes in handy when traveling but is annoying when you are out of batteries and have to make a trip for your toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;having to stock batteries.</li>
            <li> Great product great quality best ever</li>
            <li> I have given everyone in our home an Oral B electric toothbrush and the toothbrushes have been used here at home and traveled where ever the family has gone.  They have lasted a long time plus my family has better check ups at the dentist which saves me money.  So this year along with goodies that cause cavities I am giving my guys new Oral B electric tooth brushes in their stockings.  I found the best price and had the convenience of shopping on line at amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a cheap electric toothbrush for my fiancee that worked well. It been a couple months and still works just as well as my model that was twice as much.</li>
            <li> I have had a plug-in Oral B electric toothbrush for over a decade.  It finally stopped working but I still had 3 unused brush heads.  So I checked Amazon.com for a model that would be compatible with these brush heads.  This was the toothbrush that I needed.  I was surprised at how light it was for a battery operated toothbrush.  Works well with my 3 brush heads.  And the price was amazing.  What is there not to like?</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Kills batteries! I have to change the battery almost every week or so. Not worth the cost.. It would be cheaper to just buy a rechargeable toothbrush and not have to deal with the brush dying or freezing halfway through a mouthful of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Good brush. Stopped working within a few weeks because the batteries were expired. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Written by AAA cells, but the actual is supporting the AA battery, which made me buy before the AAA rechargeable batteries are invalid.</li>
            <li> I feel so sad!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The page has shown a wrong message.&lt;br /&gt;It said that 2 AAA batteries required.&lt;br /&gt;But in fact, it AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting for 3 days with having no toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;And then found I bought 24 wrong batteries.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I have owned. Fairly long battery life. Easy to use and keep clean. Multiple heads can be used on the body which makes it great for more than 1 perso.</li>
            <li> Still going strong. Although it burns through batteries, and the head wears out kind of rapidly, I like this brush. My teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m near retirement age, so I&#x27;ve tried toothbrushes from the covered wagon days (manual) through plug in the wall models.&lt;br /&gt;None compared to this Oral B model.&lt;br /&gt;It impressed me to the point that I gifted both of my daughters and our son-in-law with their own. Of course, they looked at me strange, as near 40 year old&#x27;s rarely get oral health tools from mom.&lt;br /&gt;Last night, our youngest called to rave about how great her teeth/mouth feels after using this battery operated brush.</li>
            <li> I loved the battery operated toothbrush.  Every time I change the battery, it is difficult to open the compartment.  Then it is difficult to  close the battery compartment.  What a pain.  I went back to using the same item with an electric cord!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very good ,especially for the price.I bought one in the same price range from another vendor &amp; it lasted a whole 3 brushing s.I use this as a supplemental brush &amp; so far I love it.</li>
            <li> inconsistent timer as batteries become lower charged.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a five-year old but haven&#x27;t yet gotten it out for her because it&#x27;s really heavy.  We have other Oral-B battery toothbrushes so I have some sense of what&#x27;s reasonable and this seems to weigh significantly more.  Not a big deal for an adult probably, but too heavy for little hands.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase. I have owned more expensive Oral B toothbrushes and wanted this when i travel or am away from home. So far no problems to mention. Have used approx 2 months now.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Batteries last just short of a month but the rechargeable one this one replaced lasted about three years and cost about three times as much.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as toothbrushes that are 10 times the price. Great buy, will purchase more for travel.  a+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this toothbrush, it does not spin a full cycle, but just vibrates the bristles back and forth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a plug-in Oral-B until that died recently. I ordered this to replace it because it would take up less valuable bathroom-sink real estate and be easier to travel with. I had wondered if this one would be as powerful as the plug-in version, and it does seem to be. From reading other reviews, I gather that the issue with these used to be short battery life, and I can&#x27;t comment on that yet. So far I&#x27;m very happy with this and am even brushing more.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, I got ones for my kids too - they love it as well. BUT - (reason for the missing star) the supposed &#x27;timer&#x27; feature is pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer &#x27;pulses&#x27; the brush on and off a couple of times once you hit the 2 minute mark. I was hoping for something that would &#x27;beep&#x27; when 30 seconds were up - so my kids would know to move onto the next quarter of their mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless - for the price it&#x27;s a great clean, just don&#x27;t buy it for the timer feature.</li>
            <li> Wow its awesome it sure keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I had one of the 3-5 year Oral-B toothbrushes that lasted exactly three years and then pooped out.  I got a Spinbrush and was disappointed at the design, with a rectangular brush that just dragged along next to the circular spinning brush, so I looked at the Oral-Be brushes and found this one, with replaceable batteries and able to take several of the Oral-B brushes.  Much better! and I can even afford to get a second one to keep in my travel bag and not have to remember to unplug the charger, etc., etc.</li>
            <li> It does not work. It does not work. It does not work. What else can be said about this useless product ? It wont even turn on. Now I will have  to pack up everything, print out a return slip, affix it to the package, set the package outside. I&#x27;m so tired of things that don&#x27;t work. How about, instead of  &#x27;easy returns&#x27; , you try to make things that work ? What a concept !</li>
            <li> Always wanted a decent electric toothbrush. Didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a Sonic, so this got the job done. For a little more than $11 it was well worth it. I&#x27;ve been using it 6 months now and it still works like a charm. I replaced the AA batteries once without a hitch, and the head is easily swapped out for new replacements. Will definitely be buying a new one in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this as an alternative to our main rechargeable toothbrush for when one of us is sick or when I travel. I have a difficult time using a manual brush gently. I use ikea alkaline batteries. I am happy with the battery life and the performance of the toothbrush. I have had no problems with parts not fitting. I have packed this several times. I like that it easily outlasts my rechargeable toothbrush during a travel week and I can get batteries and not have to worry about plugging in.</li>
            <li> Stops working after six months.</li>
            <li> for the price, it is very good and keeps the teeth and gums well cleaned.</li>
            <li> No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Works as well as the expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;Standard OralB brushheads fit  it nicely.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works great. The power and the long lasting batteries and the 2min timer. Its awesome and when brush my teeth with it i always feel clean.</li>
            <li> ok but not as powerful as i had hoped. this might be a good thing as you dont want your mouth ripped apart. for my situation (little bench space in bathroom) battery works better than cordless that need charging.</li>
            <li> The brush stopped working almost as soon as it was first used. The spinning mechanism appears to &amp;#34;skip&amp;#34; and the drive shaft doesn&#x27;t perform a complete revolution of the brush head, which renders brushing process impossible.&lt;br /&gt;This is not the first instance of the same exact problem happening: my previous Oral-B Battery Toothbrush succumbed to the same faith. Chinese origin of the moving parts and consequent assembly methods may be the culprit behind the string failures with this type of brush.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to save your money and either invest into something built to a higher standards or try other brand of battery-powered toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I was hoping for much more from the product, which proudly bears the name &amp;#34;BraAun&amp;#34; on it.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The good thing about it is you want to brush your teeth many times a day  because it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> Battery life stinks pretty bad</li>
            <li> I have never had a more cleaner mouth! The small head goes so far back so you never leave a dirty spot! Also, the price is amazing compared to store prices. I would suggest this to everyone. :)</li>
            <li> Had it for two years then it just stopped working.  Changed batteries no help.  Bought new batteries no help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hated the small little itty bitty button to turn it on and off.</li>
            <li> Bought this brand-new. Couldn&#x27;t get it to work. Fiddled with it. Tried regular batteries. Tried rechargeable batteries. Etc. Wound up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is fine, the batteries packaged with it were dead, with an expiration date of 08/2013. Not a big deal, but still a little irritating.</li>
            <li> Uses the same refills as the WAY more expensive models, and gives and absolute polish on all teeth surfaces like no manual action can. The refills are the same as almost 10 years now, so it has become a sort of de facto standard, so you won&#x27;t be left with an usuels novelty brush, like Colgate and other fad makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not 5 stars only because it lacks a modern voltage controller to keep the same blazing speeds that the disposable Duracells (1.5V AAs) pull, when using a planet-and-pocket-friendly rechargeables (1.2V AA Sanyo Eneloops, another must-have item). The last 3-4 Braun brushes did the same and it was not a big deal.</li>
            <li> A brand new brush is always good. I really like the way that this product works. It even comes with batteries! Who does that anymore?</li>
            <li> I was advised to use an electric tooth brush because of it&#x27;s action by my doctor. She was correct .This brush does the job and you can tell  after using it. As far as time using it goes, you do each quadrent for aproxamately 15-30 seconds believe me you will know when you have completed each area and at the end you will know your teeth are clean. This brush does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> I have a rechargable Oral B Vitality toothbrush that I use for every day use, and I love it.  I travel a bit for work, and when traveling outside of the US, I can&#x27;t take it with me, because it is not dual voltage.  It is probably the one thing (outside of my family) that I miss most.  So, with high hopes, I bought this battery powered version with the hopes it would fill that void.  It&#x27;s no where near as good as my Vitality, but it&#x27;s not terrible either.  It&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush and the various Spin Brush types you can buy at the store. It is a bit on the loud side, but for the price, and the fact that it&#x27;s battery-powered, I can&#x27;t complain too much.  It worked well for what I bought it for, but I&#x27;ll stick to my Vitality at home.</li>
            <li> Well designed, feels great in the hand, this is a perfect low priced battery operated toothbrush that improves  upon the earlier models at this price point. You can spend much more, but why?</li>
            <li> Love it. My only complaint is that it only lasted for 6 months. When it wouldn&#x27;t work and I had to use a regular toothbrush I hated it. It felt weird and didn&#x27;t seem to clean my teeth. I had become very dependent on this spinning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think it should last longer than 6 months. I deducted one star for that. Otherwise it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that i have ever bought a powered toothbrush and it feels like im at the dentist getting a cleaning when i use it. The results are awsome my teeth feel polished and very clean compared to a manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Changing the batteries was easier than I expected.  My only (minor) complaint is that you still have to change two AA batteries every couple of months.  But it is infinitely better than the defective $25 Braun Oral B Replacement Power Handle I bought a few months back from SmallAppliance.com.</li>
            <li> Cheap and fine, very good!</li>
            <li> Great price for a very functional product!  Great for travel.</li>
            <li> Why buy the expensive ones... This one is as good as many times more expensive ones &amp; it lasts many years. Considering AA batteries are cheap these days, this is more economical than more expensive recharge ones.</li>
            <li> very small head and low speed</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to use when I travel to places where there&#x27;s no way to charge my rechargeable toothbrush. It arrived the other day and I tried it yesterday to make sure it would work. It did. It has less power than my rechargeable (also a Braun Oral-B) but it seems to have enough power to do the job. If this one was for use at home I&#x27;d give it only three stars, for its less than stellar power, but since it&#x27;s for use where the rechargeable won&#x27;t be suitable, good enough is fine and for this sort of travel I give it four stars. I&#x27;ll still use and prefer the rechargeable one anywhere there&#x27;s 120-volt electric power.</li>
            <li> We own a system that is charged by a base.  When called out of town for a while this was purchased to use as a back up.  I totally love this tooth brush.  I would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> This brush was bought about the first of July and, in November end, I&#x27;m still using it two times a day on the original batteries that came with it.  They  may be replaced soon, howlever.  It is powerful and cleans well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is right on the money when it comes to cleaning out the crevices between your teeth.  It&#x27;s also really great around the molars - sides and back.  It won&#x27;t completely replace flossing, but it gets pretty darn close.  The 2-minute warning helps out, you just brush and wait for the signal.</li>
            <li> For this price, it is a great product. I have just been using it for a week or so but it seems to be a good product. Cleans good and not very harsh on the gums. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as my Oral-B one that plugs into the electric socket at home but now I have one that is battery operated for travel, buy it, you&#x27;ll love it. &amp;#34;If you can help; help; if not, at the very least, do no harm to no one&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love it, it makes me brush my teath longer and my dentist recommended it to help clean my gums.  It has a 2 minute timer on it.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the smaller brush head and the availability of the five-count brush head pack.</li>
            <li> Pain in the neck refilling it three or four times per use. Expected higher pressure. But the price is right.</li>
            <li> Great product. Frugal with batteries, which last a long time with this product.  Cleans teeth well, so I now get compliments from my dentist, rather than stern looks and scoldings...!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST brush I have had.  Bought one for me and one for hubby ... we BOTH love it.  Gets in and around every tooth because of the small round brush.  Bought the replacement brushes, too,  but haven&#x27;t needed them yet.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Works well and ideal for packing for extended international travel.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality dead out of the box. Great Amazon customer service returned for full refund</li>
            <li> Brush head is too small...unit feels clunky and noisy.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item two days ago received it today. I put the batteries in and it does not even turn on..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I originally gave this item a 1 star review as I figured it was broken. After looking at the bottom where the batteries go in through. It shows how to enter the batteries. I was assuming the flat end of the batteries go onto the spring as it is in so many products. Here one flat end goes on a spring and one + end goes on the other spring.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> It really does a good job for the price.</li>
            <li> After 4 months of use, it doesn&#x27;t working properly now. Sometime it stop in between and than after putting it off and on again it start working. Initially I thought that is because of battery. But later I realized that it has similar behavior with new battery too. I do not expect much in that price range and assume its life is not more than 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> Works Great I would buy this again</li>
            <li> After using this brush as indicated for a few weeks, I visited my dentist who told me that my brushing habits were causing my gums to recede. The exposed roots now cause me daily pain, and I have to resort to a specialty high flouride toothpaste to try to remedy the situation. My dentist&#x27;s advise? Buy a Philips Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase! Product came very fast, I just have to buy new head brush, because the original was very rigid, it scratched my gums a little bit, that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Well let me say this ------------ the first one I received 2 months ago worked for that long. So for the price I figured lets order another and maybe get lucky. No such luck the second one did not turn on out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a crap shot but at least you get two fresh AA batteries.</li>
            <li> The thing is, with 10 bucks or so, you can get a reliable electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replace the brush head every 1-1.5 month, depending on the color indicator on the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my last one one year ago, it is still rolling. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I use my battery powered toothbrush when I&#x27;m away from home. It works great for occasional use, but it isn&#x27;t as powerful as the rechargeable models. When the batteries are fresh, it removes stains and polishes teeth very well. But when the batteries start to lose power, the toothbrush loses its cleaning power.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommend this and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Batteries last a long time.  I gave up on the plug-in version because battery kept wearing out.</li>
            <li> I have been using a battery operated toothbrush for a while. This one is WAY above the one I used to use and it is only $3 more. It has a timer to help you brush the right amount of time &amp; does a great job. So glad I took the chance on it and I would DEFINITELY buy it again.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this decades ago and I&#x27;ve been using these ever since.  They last a long time and my mouth feels so much cleaner than using a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t want to have to throw away yet another rechargeable NiMH toothbrush when it quits after a couple of years, I prefer these with replaceable batteries, because I use EverReady lithium ion batteries, and they last a long, long time, more than paying for their premium price.  I had no problem with the battery insertion process.  The base cap which you remove to insert the batteries seems fairly substantial to me.  The action of the brush head is plenty fast enough.  I swapped out the brush that came with the unit for the Dual Clean type, and it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The brush Does not rotate. Not what I expected. I would not recommend this toothbrush to anyone. Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it NO stars if I could.  Save your money!  The battery only lasts a few weeks.  I found an Oral B electric toothbrush on the internet for $20 that I&#x27;ve had a few years.  It comes with a charging station and you&#x27;ll never have to buy a battery again.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush was Sonicare Essence rechargeable then I changed to Sonicare Healthywhite (rechargeable). After that I tried Sonicare Essence battery version. It works as good as the rechargeable. I have to admit Sonicare brush head is too expensive that why I tried Oral B Pro 1000(rechargeable). It lasted about 2 years. The battery won&#x27;t hold the charge. That why I decided to try battery version again since Sonicare was works well.  I ordered OralB Pro Health and Sonicare PowerUp HX3631/06. As of June2015, Sonicare Essence battery no longer available from Amazon and from Sonicare official website&#x27;s Support Q&amp;A section states that it can use Proresult brush head that I still have(wrong info from official website). Sonicare PowerUp&#x27;s brush head is NOT compatible with ProResult.&lt;br /&gt;  The biggest complaints for battery toothbrushes are battery compartment. I attached the pic to show the improvement in Sonicare has sockets for batteries. the cap just cover it. For OralB, I can see it will be a problem when I change the batteries. The way to solve the problem is to use plumber grease, KY gel or non petroleum base lube. Petroleum jelly will decelerate latex o-ring.&lt;br /&gt;  OralB Battery VS Rechargeable: if Pro1000 get 10/10 for brushing power, Pro Health Battery would get 2.5/10 for it power. In other word if Pro1000 is &amp;#34;forceful&amp;#34; the Pro Health Battery is &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;. Even when Por1000 is low battery, it is still a bit more power that the Battery version. Note: they use the same brush head.&lt;br /&gt;  If you use rechargeable before and like me want to change to battery since the rechargeable won&#x27;t last very long. It&#x27;s about 2 yrs for me. The Battery version neither OralB nor Sonicare are not for you.</li>
            <li> It covers very less area..but good if u are lazy</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works well at a low price.  Nothing fancy, but it performs well and cleans my teeth better than adequately.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works really well.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and I think for a battery operated toothbrush it is quite good.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over a year and it is still &#x27;spinning away&#x27;.  I like the way the 2-min. timer &#x27;stutters&#x27; to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.  Although I need to change the batteries every 5-6 weeks, I prefer it to the rechargeable type. The round head seems smaller than a regular manual toothbrush, but I like that since I can brush my back teeth much easier.  My hygienist has seen a difference-less time in the dentist chair-&#x27;scrapping&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Electric Toothbrush, for several years and for the money, it is worth the cost and provides a superior teeth cleaning than just using a regular tooth brush.  I have not used the more expensive models offered to brush your teeth, but for the money, this is the one I will continue to use.  A pair of AA batteries last a surprizingly long time, brushing twice or more a day, in this unit and I now have purchased Rechargeable AA Alkaline batteries to use over and over.  Only change them out once or twice over 6 months and they just seem to perform quite well.  Good product and I recommend it&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review update:  This is July 2014 and I am still using my Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Electric Toothbrush and I still am very happy with the results.  My gums and teeth have never been cleaner and healthier.  I came back to this review when I realized I have used up my reserves of brushes and needed more.  I was checking my options and one of my review reader&#x27;s stated they felt my review was helpeful to them.  This was Timely.  I checked my review for accuracy and thought I&#x27;d add my thoughts that I still feel good about this purchase after so long.  I regularly pop out my rechargeable batteries, put in fresh ones and forget about the power for up to three months.  I&#x27;ve used Nimh and Alkaline rechargeable batteries and I currently like the rechargeable Alkaline from Amazon Basics.  They are affordable and seem to be as long lasting as any I have used in the past.  A new brush replacement and it will be like a new product again.</li>
            <li> Purchased Dec 10, 2014 and stopped working March 6, 2015. Never really had any power. I guess this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> So far, everything is great. My dentist is happy and I feel like they clean my teeth better then before. The timer keeps us honest! :) Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great. Has a 2 minute timer where the motor skips or intermittently stops to let you know that your brushing time is done. Awesome!</li>
            <li> really good for a new user as me. and cheap enough, also can change the battery as i wish, just hope it lasts long time</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare before this. You know, an expensive one? The battery lasted a mere two years before refusing to hold a charge. So I got this instead. I&#x27;m still using the original double A batteries two months later (although they&#x27;re on their way out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Besides the replaceable batteries, it&#x27;s also easy to clean. Pop the top off, rinse, and you&#x27;re done. Waaaay cheaper than the built-in battery kind, as are the replacement heads. It&#x27;s easier to carry a spare set of batteries than it is a wall charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: The head doesn&#x27;t vibrate as much or as powerfully as the kind with the battery built in. However, my teeth feel just as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Lasted 6 months an then wouldn&#x27;t work at all.  Batteries changed continuously (which I didn&#x27;t mind) but then it just quit working even with brand new batteries-&lt;br /&gt;Did like the convenience while it worked though...</li>
            <li> Yes, it does clean your teeth, but it is a bit big for a small mouth and it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it at first, but when I had to change the batteries I couldn&#x27;t get the cap back on.  Time for a new brand/brush!</li>
            <li> this is third time to purchase this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not like the expensive one but still has good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it if you are looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So far this toothbrush is working great for us. The main reason I bought this is because of my daughter hanging some tooth issues and needing to be sure we could clean her teeth better because she wasn&#x27;t always as cooperative and it was hard to really clean her far back upper molars. So far I believe this is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for the price, this brush seems to do as good as I believe any of the high priced rechargeable brushes do for a huge chunk of change less. Especially when all the others had very spotty reviews as they would die and stop charging or just weren&#x27;t very strong etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think so far this is hands down the best deal for a power/spin brush. But time will tell and I will update as we go along. So far I have used it intermittently and my 7 yr old as well as 3.5 yr old uses it. I also bought a pack of the soft head replacement tips and glad I did. As the one that comes with is a bit tough for my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li> it is easy, cheap, and good enough. using battery is just what i need, which means i could use it for years.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush for a kid.  I use a more expensive one for myself but this one is perfect for the kid in my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the vibrate/sonic style of electric toothbrushes as well as the \\&quot;spin brush\\&quot; type, and the spin brush type tends to leave me with smoother cleaner feeling teeth.  That being said this is a really nice unit for the cost, has a timer built in, and the head is smaller than the spin brush type so those with smaller mouths or less access space between the cheeks and the teeth may prefer this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give equal opportunity to this one and [[ASIN:B000QS59ZM Spinbrush Prowhitening Battery Powered Toothbrush, Soft (Colors May Vary)]] (sometimes branded Crest, lately branded Arm &amp; Hammer)</li>
            <li> This is a great battery powered electric toothbrush.  The brush head is about the same size as the tool a dentist uses to clean/polish teeth thus, it reaches and cleans even the hard to reach back teeth well.  The price is great and it even comes with Duracell batteries.</li>
            <li> Have used the Oral-B electric toothbrush for several months and it has performed flawlessly.  It is great for traveling, has a long battery life and you don&#x27;t ever have to wait for it to charge.  Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out why the other toothbrushes are so expensive. This one works great...battery lasts a long time, spins fast, replaceable head, waterproof.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly as described and what I ordered!</li>
            <li> I was annoyed when the un-replaceable rechargeable battery in my previous Oral-B toothbrush wore out, and the whole thing became junk.  I got this toothbrush, put rechargeable alkaline batteries in it, and am very satisfied.  the batteries last for weeks on a single charge.</li>
            <li> works good so far, purchased the refills we&#x27;ll see how they do too</li>
            <li> Pretty good no issues so far. The battery cover seems to better than the ones I have used before. All in all good stuff</li>
            <li> I used all the time perfect for traveling and overnight stayed</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush。But today when I  change battery , I found that I found that I can&#x27;t close the lid. I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product, glad we can still get these on the internet.</li>
            <li> I travel to Europe regularly.  This is perfect, because I don&#x27;t need to worry about it running out of poser and I don&#x27;t have to drag along the charger or a converter.  And it&#x27;s every bit as powerful as the one I use at home.  I only need to remember to  carry fresh batteries which are already on my packing list for some of my other electronics (eg my mouse).</li>
            <li> This brush does just as good a job as the more expensive ones.  I recommend it highly if you can&#x27;t afford the other ones..</li>
            <li> We LOVE brushing our teeth now!  I never thought a battery-operated toothbrush could be so much fun.  Both my husband and I now spend more time cleaning our teeth.  I think our next dental checkup will be a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read in some reviews that the battery doesn&#x27;t last long.  We have had two of these toothbrushes for 10 weeks now, doused in water occasionally, and no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, excellent for anyone with arthritis because the grip is so comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it uses less toothpaste than a conventional toothbrush.  So you save money by using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s two months the product is working well for me, using it at least once a day. The batteries worked for two months as well. I haven&#x27;t used any other similar product but anyway I give this flawless one 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to make the jump from a normal toothbrush to an electric one. It makes a big difference cleaning wise and you can even feel your teeth having less plaque then before. My dentist/dental hygenist commented on how good and clean my teeth were when I went in for my most recent cleaning.</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped, but this little thing does an amazing job for the price.  Much better than the Crest or Colgate brands that you find at local retailers and for about the same price.  As I said, I wish batteries lasted a little longer, but I guess it&#x27;s a trade off for being so powerful and doing its job so well.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to try out a powered toothbrush.  Gets the job done well at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rationalize spending a lot on the super-exotic mechanical teeth-cleaning products available out there, but I WAS a little skeptical about buying this one (despite the bargain-basement price), because of the &amp;#34;battery&amp;#34; issue. Happily, I found some spare &amp;#34;rechargeables&amp;#34; PLUS a charging unit in the house, and I am using it 2X a day. It&#x27;s still fully functioning after 3 weeks on the first charge. 4 Stars is as high as I go on inanimate objects!</li>
            <li> Ordered two of these for traveling.  They work just like the expensive models except it doesn&#x27;t have the timer to tell you when to change the area you are brushing.  My only complaint is I haven&#x27;t found a brush cover for when we travel so currently are just using the plastic case it was delivered in.</li>
            <li> The batteries went dead after a few times of use. I replaced them. Since then the toothbrush stops frequently.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a failing old unit. new unit was very reasonably priced and seems to be better made than my old unit</li>
            <li> But only if you have VERY strong hands.  This toothbrush does not have the screw-off closure most other Oral B battery toothbrushes have.  It&#x27;s more like that of some household products where you must press the sides and twist at the same time and it is Very Stiff.  I have a pair of adjustable pliers with which I was finally able to twist it off.  Every that took some strength and, to be frank, this toothbrush isn&#x27;t worth the effort to me when there are several models with a simple screw-off cap to the battery compartment.&lt;br /&gt;  The one thing I did like about it is the small, circular brush head.  For me this design works better than the larger/longer brush design.  It seems to get into areas that are difficult with the larger brush ending.&lt;br /&gt;  I Do like the Oral B battery toothbrushes in general; just not this particular design.  So now I must look and see if I can find the small, circular brush with the easy-screw battery cap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several of these toothbrushes the last several years and each one has had the same problem: faulty battery compartment covers. Unfortunately, Oral-B refuses to use screw-on battery covers and instead uses squeeze-on ones. With each model I&#x27;ve owned, eventually the cover breaks. With a crack down the side, water enters and corrodes the batteries, and soon both the batteries and the toothbrush are useless and have to be thrown out. What a waste! If they used screw-on covers the toothbrush would be last longer and the batteries too. But then perhaps that&#x27;s the point. They are selling these at disposable prices. Sad, especially since we don&#x27;t need to be making more plastic trash. :(</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace the standard toothbrush. I was hesitant for a while thinking a standard brush is all I need (and it is) however electric toothbrushes really do more work than manual brushing when you think about it (It&#x27;s a buffer on your teeth). Most importantly it targets my teeth so I don&#x27;t beat the crap out of my gums and cause bleeding/gum receding. To top it all off, the price is the best out there. Solid toothbrush!</li>
            <li> nice to know you are really cleaning your teeth, the right way ... this toothbrush does a great and easy job</li>
            <li> My previous toothbrush was the Braun Oral-B with the old style rectangular brush.  The toothbrush was still working, but I could no longer find refills for the brush, so I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed how this round brush with its brisk circular vibration motion cleaned much better than the old style.  Even the hard-to-reach teeth in the back are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the old model, this has a two-minute timer to let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It uses two AA cells. I am using NiMH rechargeable batteries. With a daily usage of two minutes at night and one minute in the morning, the batteries lasted almost a month on a charge.  The batteries are in a water-sealed compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, especially considering the economical price.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush mainly because it was time to replace the brush head on a Braun battery brush, when I saw this. This \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush was about the same price I paid for the Braun battery toothbrush, and decided to try this, instead of looking for the brush heads for the Braun battery toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things strike me immediately -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t understand why this brush is referred to as \\&quot;electric,\\&quot; when both of my Braun toothbrushes run on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- this toothbrush does NOT have a cover for the brush head, as does my older battery version, so traveling with this \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush would/should require devising some other type of cover for traveling. For the time being, I use the brush head cover from my old Braun toothbrush for my new Braun toothbrush. Although not designed for the new brush, it does work, in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Replacing the batteries on this \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush has proven to be a nightmare. The straight-bottom cap to insert the batteries was extremely difficult for me to grab. My nails are not long, but after more than 10 minutes and 1 broken thumbnail, I finally managed to open the battery case and insert the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope these Duracell batteries last a VERY long time, because I don&#x27;t want to go through this again too soon. My older version Braun toothbrush has a rounded battery compartment, which is MUCH easier to grasp, and therefore insert/change batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Found genuine Braun replacement brush heads for a very good price. I read reviews that talk about generic replacement brush heads that are poorly made (in China?), and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the potential risk, so I used a coupon and got a great deal on the real thing. I hope they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this brush has a 2 minute timer, which my older Braun toothbrush does not have. I like the brush head on my new toothbrush, as it&#x27;s able to get into smaller places, and in the back of my mouth more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush. Both of my Braun toothbrushes are comparable, with small differences. When the replacement brush heads run out, and it&#x27;s time to buy more, I may very well buy brush heads for the older Braun battery toothbrush, as it is so much easier to insert new batteries.re easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an OK toothbrush. Both of my Braun toothbrushes are comparable, with small differences. When the replacement brush heads run out, and it&#x27;s time to buy more, I may very well buy brush heads for the older Braun battery toothbrush, as it is so much easier to insert new batteries.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Makes you want to brush your teeth several times a day.  Comfortable, quiet and does a great job of cleaning your teeth.  A good, durable product.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Great for travel.  But WHY can&#x27;t they include a travel case.  I have to put it in a baggy.</li>
            <li> Bought my last one 21 years ago.  Finally the motor went and it was time.  Got one for my son, too.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Oral B line so buying two of these toothbrushes were a no-brainer.  I have used this toothbrush for a year and haven&#x27;t have any issues at all; just regular battery and head changes which is expected.  The on/off switch is protected under the casing, has a 2 minute timer which many people should pay attention to, the bottom cap stays sealed to keep water out of the battery compartment and it delivers the exact same cleaning experience as the more expensive units.  The bottom cap can be irritating to open however my husband has no problem so I just leave this to him.  I use rechargeable batteries, brush my teeth three times a day and change the batteries every month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no complaints with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I have to replace mine about every 2-3 years.  Investing in a rechargeable battery system is economically effective if you brush regularly.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is inexpensive but does an excellent job. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a battery operated toothbrush and this toothbrush has made me wish I&#x27;d purchased one years ago. My teeth are clean and plaque free. They appear to get whiter with each use. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it was able to indicate 30-second time intervals along with the two-minute indication that it does provide. It uses two AA batteries, so it is on the heavy side, but is extremely well built and should travel well.</li>
            <li> cheap and good to use</li>
            <li> Handles nicely, good balance and weight.  The brush is itself is a good size and can reach in between the teeth and the entire surface of the tooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so great, love it everyday.</li>
            <li> Its been a month and my toothbrush is sti working great. Comes with battery which is a plus and has been working great for a less expensive option of battery powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> my son loves it. i guess this system doesn like short comments. so i will keep typing regardless of the stupid system.</li>
            <li> Makes teeth cleaning for us lazy folk easy and effective. Well designed and well thought out. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost one and half month now and i am happy so far with it. My tooth were never this clean before, when i was using normal brush. I don&#x27;t think i will ever go back to normal brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One draw back with this product i observed is that it operates on normal aaa battery. The first one got drained in a month.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of electric toothbrushes, and this one is just great. It cleanse the hard to reach places and Oral-B has great products. Shipped fast and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> nice item, works well and no hassle packaging, plus it came on time, and I got to use a 3 buck off coupon...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and practice for my teeth, I feel my teeth  clean everyday and is easy for clean I like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. I like it. I feel that it gets the job done, however I would probably recommend also purchasing the oral b dual clean replacement brush heads as well since those heads have the extra bottom part for a better brush.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 4 &amp; 6 years old.  They are great for the price.  And the tip is replaceable.</li>
            <li> This is very good quality for the price!  The motor is made in Germany, not in China,. My sister gave me a more expensive battery operated toothbrush, which didn&#x27;t last a year. This one works better and German craftsmanship is better than made in China. Just ask a Mercedes or BMW owner. I use 2 AA, rechargeable batters and get about 3 weeks on a charge. And they include 4 extra brushes! You can&#x27;t beat that for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because: (a) it uses the same heads as the ordinary Oral-B toothbrushes, (b) it uses regular AA batteries, which means I can use my rechargeable AAs and I don&#x27;t have an extra base to lug around with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good! I love this brush and my teeth definitely feel cleaner using this fella.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B for home use. But I often travel for 3 to 7 nights for both work and family. I don&#x27;t want to carry a charger, etc. This is perfect because it uses AA batteries. The battery lasted for the whole 3 weeks while I traveled last, and only ran out because I accidentally left it on (a design flaw, if you ask me, as it should have an auto shut-off after a few minutes - so minus 1 star).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good enough too, if you want to use it for home use - as long as you&#x27;re ok with wasting batteries or swapping it out with a rechargeable AA. I prefer the charging stand when at home.</li>
            <li> Purchased for travel so I would not have to carry a charging base. Worked great.</li>
            <li> Over time the cap on the bottom splits and is a Pain in the butt to push back in when replacing batteries. It cleaned the best as far as battery powered toothbrushes. But I finally invested in a rechargeable one same brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a much more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. The only surprise I got is that while it does have a 2 minute timer, it does not give any indication at 30 second intervals. Otherwise, it vibrates just like the one it replaces.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Love it, for the price I paid! Ordered the second one (for work).</li>
            <li> This replaced the travel tooth brush my other half had.</li>
            <li> My first Oral B battery toothbrush, just like this one, has lasted for 7 years, with replacement heads and batteries of course!  This is a great toothbrush!  The only reason I replaced the old one was that the tooth-whitening toothpastes started to corrode the soft plastic.....but again, that took 7 years!  I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning, but keeps on slowing down, even with new batteries, maybe I get a lemon.</li>
            <li> I have a regular Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush at home.  I keep this one in my desk at work, and it&#x27;s perfect for mid-day refreshing.</li>
            <li> Worth the price and it is really an effective toothbrush that cleans your teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The battery cover tends to crack and it gets a lot of toothpaste gunk in the battery area.  But a pair of batteries lasts a long time and  I prefer this to having a charger and cord on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush for the price.  The batteries included are cheap Chinese Duracells, which fizzled-out quickly.  Despite no instructions (with the brush, or on the internet), it is easy to replace the batteries and brushes.</li>
            <li> It could function as a decent travel electric brush. In any case, its very underpowered.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these electric toothbrushes, one as a gift, and coincidentally they both quit working within the same week six months after buying them.  It would have been better if Amazon offered a superior product and charged more, instead of cluttering our lives and dumps with poor quality items.  I do not recommend buying this Oral-B Precision Clean Toothbrush which doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Great quality and build. It looks and feel like it will last for a dependable amount of time. I recommend getting the extra caps that have the dual brush on them. The one circle won&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li> i had written about the oral b electric toothbrush that did not work,  i was wrong as i have discovered that the two batteries were not placed correctly.  i wish the instruction and having better + and - on the battery compartment would help align the batteries correctly..  my name is george hara  emailgsyhara@msn.com</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. It&#x27;s not for me, I switching back to a non-electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush worked fine with 2 AA batteries and the batteries last a couple of months.  However, replacing the batteries was such a chore I have finally put it in the recycle bin.  The cap at the bottom that lets you access the battery chamber connects with a catch on each side that are very difficult to engage.  I replaced it with one that has a screw on cap.  I&#x27;ll see how that works out.</li>
            <li> I look forward to brushing my teeth now more than I used to. It does all the work for you and you just guide it over your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality buy at this low price.</li>
            <li> I love this one for traveling as I don&#x27;t have to worry about bringing a charging stand/charging it. AA batteries are pretty cheap pretty much anywhere! No fancy functions and ultra high speed but I don&#x27;t really need all that.</li>
            <li> No cover for the head!</li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare and an Oral B. I reach for this toothbrush almost all the time. The battery runs low quickly.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item before, and it lasted me about a year. I ordered 2 at the same time, one for my husband, one for me. His is still going strong, mine had trouble closing the battery compartment from the start, until finally it cracked and it stopped working all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like that it is battery operated and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space or an outlet. This newer version looks the same as before, but I noticed that the batteries went in more easily and the compartment was much easier to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if this one only lasts a year, I would buy a new one for this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wished this one came in more color choices...I would buy them for my children as well if there were more colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> cheap battery  toothbrush. Works well! I love it.Don&#x27;t have to carry it from another room where I had electric outlet.</li>
            <li> Great product for a good price</li>
            <li> Excellent Electric Toothbrush For The Price. You don&#x27;t have to spend more than $12 bucks to get your teeth really clean. I can&#x27;t believe how much money some of these electric toothbrushes cost! Some are as much as $210 or more.</li>
            <li> I had been using a different brand electric timer brush and thought I was getting a great cleaning.  Oral-B came along and proved me wrong!!!  My mouth feels cleaner for a longer amount time!!! YAY!!! Highly Suggested!!!  The price is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This work good for what it is! If your looking for a cheap toothbrush this should be your choice!</li>
            <li> Just right for my kids. Affordable and good product b</li>
            <li> Almost like the real thing, but not. Doesn&#x27;t have the speed or intensity of my wall charged units, but will pass for a vacation toothbrush.</li>
            <li> have had this since Jan 19th, 2013.  It works great and I have yet to use up the two original batteries it came with.  ( I use 2 battery powered toothbrushes by Oral-B.  The other I purchased at Wal-mart for half the price and that is still going strong too.  The heads are different, so I like the choice.  Both were purchased at the same time and both still have the original batteries.  I purchase Ni-MH Pre-Charged rechargeable batteries to use with this.</li>
            <li> It will be so easy for travel -- I&#x27;m tired of carrying the whole kit and caboodle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other inexpensive electric toothbrushes but don&#x27;t seem to have any power. This one feels like it&#x27;s really getting some work done. Great product! Super value!</li>
            <li> these are very good tooth brushes, the first one lasted 10yrs and was still usable, battery cap split not allowing batteries to make good contact on the old one</li>
            <li> Came in on-time! Great! Good tooth brush.. My little one is not complaining! Though, I hope it came in on a different color like pink.. It is more appealing for my daughter..</li>
            <li> My previous Oral-B battery powered toothbrush lasted forever (7 yrs).  In fact I know it will still last longer yet, but I wanted to go to the smaller spin head and wanted one that stood up.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but this one requires 2 batteries instead of one, and they drain faster!  ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would be my only complaint.  I ordered lithium batteries hoping this extends the period of having to replace the batteries.  Especially since it uses 2.  We&#x27;ll see.  But it does have gr8 power and works nicely.  I just didn&#x27;t want cords all over my countertops.</li>
            <li> I loved it, until it slowly stopped working. Changed the batteries, no change in function. This lasted me less than two months.</li>
            <li> This thing lasts and lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Just keep replacing the batteries every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;This thing may need the brush replaced as I&#x27;ve used it so much...or I may just buy another!</li>
            <li> I bought this less than 6 months ago, and already 2 months after I bought it it already stopped working. It recently tried again to get it to work, and initially I thought it did - but burns through the batteries really quickly so after a couple of days it stopped working again. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> i have had this for about 2 months now and have just switched to my second set of batteries.  this is cheap but it does the exact same job as the more expensive rechargeable versions.  as the battery wore down i noticed that it didn&#x27;t pulse as vigorously as it did when they were fresh, but overall it was usable until they completely died.</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth really clean!</li>
