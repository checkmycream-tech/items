            <li>If you own a Kent hair brush or any hair brush you need this handy hair brush cleaner!  </li>
            <li>Everyone should own one.</li>
            <li>I thought that this was kind of a gimmick but decided to give this a try on my ebony wood Kent MN-11.  </li>
            <li>Nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li>As someone who likes to keep things clean and in good shape I opted to buy a new cleaner when I purchased my latest Kent hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done a good job, and the brush looks like new after every cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little brush/comb for keeping my hairbrush clean.</li>
            <li>And, the brush liked being related to the device!</li>
            <li>Wash your hair brush occasionally with warm soapy water, then run the brush cleaner through it a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>strongly recommend buying this cleaner as a companion to a new, quality hairbrush.</li>
            <li>Take care of your Kent brush and it will last your lifetime. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not exactly rocket science.  </li>
            <li>brush has stiff bristles designed to go between and get to the bottom of the bristles on a Kent OS11 hair brush, but it also works fine on my wife&#x27;s fine brushes.</li>
            <li>Nice little brush, but it clogs up with the stuff it cleans and has to be cleaned itself.</li>
            <li>Cleaned up my Kent brush without much effort.</li>
            <li>Not surprisingly, the Kent Brush Cleaner does a good job on my Kent OS 11 hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little brush works great for getting hair and dust and fluff that collect in the bore bristle brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I bought this cleaner to help me maintain my new Kent hairbrush.</li>
            <li>Works well with old and new brushes.</li>
            <li>I tested the cleaner on my 40 year old Kent hairbrush.</li>
            <li>Got this to clean fine hairs from my quite expensive Kent hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works on my brushes but is a little hard to maneuver in between the rounded brush setup since the lines are more concave.</li>

            <li> Use it on your dry hair brush routinely by running the bristles of the brush cleaner through the hair brush, starting at the bottom and working up.  </li>
            <li> Should have used it long ago as I had to dispose of my favorites hair brush because I didn&#x27;t have this.</li>
            <li> This brush cleaner should help me keep this brush a very long time.</li>
            <li> This brush will clean about 1/3 of my Kent brush with each pass, removing fine hairs and any scum that may collect on the base of the bristles.</li>
            <li> It takes some effort but it removes all the fluff and gunk stuck between the dense bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are designed, it seems , to clean up what mere soap and water will not!</li>
            <li> little pleasures.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to toss out my brushes when I cannot remove the fluffy dirt off, but now it has extended the life of my brush.</li>
            <li> It broke within a few months.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the cleaner have little barbs on the end, to catch dead hairs and fluff in the bristles and on the base of your hairbrush.</li>
            <li> All you need to do is get down at the base of the hairbrush and brush up the brisles</li>
            <li> If you have an expensive Kent brush and intend on keeping it for years to come, I would recommend this hair brush cleaner.</li>

            <li> I thought that this was kind of a gimmick but decided to give this a try on my ebony wood Kent MN-11.  It works like a charm.  Does the job in cleaning the hairs and junk out of the brush.  If you have an expensive Kent brush and intend on keeping it for years to come, I would recommend this hair brush cleaner.</li>

            <li> Works well with old and new brushes. Should have used it long ago as I had to dispose of my favorites hair brush because I didn&#x27;t have this.</li>
            <li> As represented.  It does the job as well as any similar product ever has.  Not perfect, but nothing is better, yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush for a brush.</li>
            <li> If you own a Kent hair brush or any hair brush you need this handy hair brush cleaner!  Compact and utilitarian.</li>
            <li> Got this to clean fine hairs from my quite expensive Kent hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has stiff bristles designed to go between and get to the bottom of the bristles on a Kent OS11 hair brush, but it also works fine on my wife&#x27;s fine brushes.

It&#x27;s done a good job, and the brush looks like new after every cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last Kent brush, without any cleaning like this, lasted me almost 40 years. This brush cleaner should help me keep this brush a very long time.</li>
            <li> Cleaned up my Kent brush without much effort. And, the brush liked being related to the device!</li>
            <li> My husband is amazed how simply this product cleans his brush.  He used to use his comb and that didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Not surprisingly, the Kent Brush Cleaner does a good job on my Kent OS 11 hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly rocket science.  Use it on your dry hair brush routinely by running the bristles of the brush cleaner through the hair brush, starting at the bottom and working up.  Wash your hair brush occasionally with warm soapy water, then run the brush cleaner through it a couple of times.  Rinse your hairbrush and voil&amp;agrave;!  Nice and clean.</li>
            <li> A necessity for a guy like me.</li>
