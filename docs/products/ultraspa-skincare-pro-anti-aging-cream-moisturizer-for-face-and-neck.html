            <li>Prety good, love the pump bottle</li>

            <li>I liked how absorbent and non-greasy</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, it has nice smell and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice under layer for make up.  </li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I put it on it smells nice and minty and the smell isn&#x27;t pefumey and doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>I love how moisturizing this product is and the fact that it is very refreshing too.</li>
            <li>Another great thing I confirmed from the seller is that this moisturizer is cruelty free!</li>
            <li>most woman I am always trying to make sure my skin looks as good as it can.</li>
            <li>and this is the best moisturizer I have used so far.</li>
            <li>When I put on any kind of cream, gel, etc, on to my face, the one thing it needs to be is non-oily and the quicker it blends in to my skin, the better.  </li>
            <li>34;This is an amazing product - its even better than I</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews for anything, but this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It has a slight minty scent and best of all, my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>One pre-measured pump doesn&#x27;t seem like much, but it is a perfect amount and works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant scent that dissipates quickly, so it does not interfere with my perfume when I apply it under my makeup before going out for the evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many creams but this moisture is the best so far, will order more.</li>
            <li>This is the most AMAZING anti-aging moisturizer formula that I have ever used and well worth every penny!!  </li>
            <li>No breakouts and my skin feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Ultra Spa was very light and had minty fragrance.</li>
            <li>The cream is very light when applied and doesn&#x27;t seem sticky as some creams do</li>
            <li>Afterwards this moisturizer is not sticky as it&#x27;s very smooth to touch, unlike others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It has a very light and pleasant fragrance (smells like fresh rain) but goes away after I put on.</li>
            <li>I use this at night and just love the smell and feel of it on my face.  </li>
            <li>buy her more</li>
            <li>and I want to stay on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>love the bottle with the see through sides.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for a friend, they love it...</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this from the moment I opened the bottle.  </li>
            <li>the fact that this is made with no parabens, dyes, fillers or alcohol, makes this product so much better in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t at all greasy which is always my problem with most products like this.</li>
            <li>I can see improvement in my face complexion and enjoying the result.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate her skin as most products do.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more radiant.  </li>
            <li>I love the refreshing minty fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would do even better if I hadn&#x27;t smoked.  </li>
            <li>I hope I will be getting more results soon.</li>
            <li>that was refreshing my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that because I don&#x27;t have to wait to put my make-up</li>
            <li>and I love how this has vitamin C which helps with reducing aging signs on the skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product smells and feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is so refreshing, and has a minty scent.</li>
            <li>Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Am very much enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I love the bottle, the pump dispenser...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and the Ultra Spa goes on and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling either greasy or &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34;, the peppermint extract smells wonderful and is soothing to the skin, and my skin looks healthier every day!</li>
            <li>The only thing that keeps it from being perfect?</li>
            <li>Tried so many moisturizer over the years, there is no room to name them all.</li>
            <li>I really love the way this moisturizer feels.</li>
            <li>More of a lotion than a gel.</li>
            <li>Have already ordered more.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean feel without tightening the skin.</li>
            <li>and it has a nice clean minty smell but don&#x27;t worry...</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Smells ok, moisturizes ok, but does do a thing for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>After using for a month, my skin feels smoother, firmer, more hydrated with fine lines virtually eliminated.  </li>
            <li>I found this cream to feel light, tingly and refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be doing great.  </li>
            <li>and so far it is great on my skin</li>
            <li>but it goes on nicely, has a pleasant smell &amp; works well with my makeup (which is another big plus!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend this cream if you are looking for a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li>, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is not at all greasy and it is rather easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>this product was, but I went through the bottle very, very quickly.</li>
            <li>I received my order very quickly and immediately started using the cream on my face and neck every evening after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy feeling and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>I tend to break out easily, but have not had any reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li>the clean, refreshing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is rich in vitamin C which helps with reducing fine lines and making skin more brighter.</li>
            <li>This is only (DAY 1) but impressed so far as product feels extremely nice on face.</li>
            <li>Feels very silky, has a pleasant scent and my skin soaks it up quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easily absorbs to my skin.</li>
            <li>but this is just fine for me.</li>
            <li>It appears that the fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy applicator which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell yet if it works on wrinkles and fine lines because I just started using it two days ago.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent and the easy to use pump dispenses just the right amount.</li>
            <li>A really great product to add to your daily routine.</li>
            <li>It has a light peppermint scent and once on almost has a tingly feeling.  </li>
            <li>And the skin on my face and neck remains smooth and moist after washing it every morning.</li>
            <li>luck and enjoy.</li>
            <li>This will tighten your skin, but one of the primary ingredients is good old witch hazel, which is an astringent that you can get cheaply in the drug store.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a great product.</li>
            <li>When applying feels tingly and light.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Well, so far so good, it&#x27;s like a drink of water for my skin.</li>
            <li>Clearer more beautiful skin with less breakouts.</li>
            <li>I almost never think a moisturizer actually does anything, and I did not even like this the first night because it felt kind of sticky, smelled like peppermint, and made my face pinkish in a way that didn&#x27;t look good (which happily did not happen the second night)</li>
            <li>I love the fresh, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>One of the best new finds on Amazon for me of this entire year!!  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love how my face feels after trying it out for the first time.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer did moisturize my skin pretty well and made it feel healthy.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try so as soon as it arrived</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff but pump stopped working after first week , now have to smack bottom of the bottle ( like ketchup) to get it out.</li>
            <li>cream felt really rich and thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far I am pleased with the cream and look forward to seeing more wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>LOVE the soft refreshing smell of mint.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am ready to order more......</li>
            <li>I use Clinque during the day because I have sensitive skin, but this is so nice at night.</li>
            <li>I really like it but don&#x27;t know if I love it yet.  </li>
            <li>The minty aroma is very pleasing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I could not give a full review of its benefits  to the skin  because I have just used it for a week.</li>
            <li>it smooths on very evenly and leaves a refreshing tightness on the skin.  </li>
            <li>After trying numerous more costly moisturizers on my maturing sensitive skin, I found this to be the best so far.  </li>
            <li>I have also found that it absorbs quickly and it has really helped to smooth out those fine lines.</li>
            <li>This lotion is silky and smells fresh and clean..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Light lotion , penetrates quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It hydrates and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>well and dries quick, so I can apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>I can see a mild difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin feel good and help with some minor flaws I had.</li>
            <li>My mom is getting older and loves to try new get young quick creams but likes this best by far.</li>
            <li>will have to come back next month and give an update as to how well this Ultra Spa Skin Care Anti Aging Moisture Cream is working at reducing my fine lines and wrinkles, but from what I have seen so far, I anticipate having a very good report and for now I give this product my 5 star recommendation!</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating, yet light....</li>
            <li>after apply feel fresh</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this product so far.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to most fragrances</li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer so far.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>but I love it this far</li>
            <li>do not feel it is any better than most other products.</li>
            <li>I really like the rich, creamy quality of the cream.  </li>
            <li>The serum itself is probably as good as any other Retinol product, but getting to it was a pain.  </li>
            <li>I ve used many high end brands and This one really works.</li>
            <li>and it goes right into my skin!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has just the right formulation that it does not leave greasy oil on my forehead and</li>
            <li>can put my makeup on right away.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>After trying so many different moisturizers, I have finally found one I love!  </li>
            <li>I have big hopes for this one after reading positive reviews and like I said has an extremely nice feel on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the refreshing minty fragrance and how soft my face and neck feel after applying even just a tiny dab of cream.  </li>
            <li>It was a good product, but not worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and it keeps my face moist for a long time and I am hoping the wrinkles will soften soon</li>
            <li>thanks for such an amazing product..</li>
            <li>Overall a fantastic product that I would recommend over many of the high priced ones on the market.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have to use very much to cover my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first review to ever write.</li>
            <li>I am almost done with my first bottle of moisturizer and could kick myself for not taking a before and after photo.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling refreshed and touchable soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My 60-year-old skin looked firmer, fresher, and had a better color after a week of daily use.</li>
            <li>Try this first and you will never look for</li>
            <li>I chose this product because although there were few reviews - only about 5 at the time, they were all good -- and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>It appears smoother and my pores are not as evident as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first day I used this product, I received a compliment on my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>It helps to reduce wrinkles and my skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My face feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is not worth 20$ -- it is more the quality and the feel of a cheap brand.</li>
            <li>It has a minty aroma and it makes my skin feel really soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Can see a difference in my \\&quot;smile\\&quot; area ;-)  </li>
            <li>I first put some on my face, I noticed</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh or strong smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the results will be after a few weeks, but right now I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>It is a great anti aging treatment because after a few uses, I can see and feel that my skin is more firm.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, almost light minty smell to it; not a strong mint smell but just a mild smell that almost is minty and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a firm face with a huge reduction in fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li>The Ultra Spa Skin Care moisturizer definitely is non-greasy and easily glides over and absorbs into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>The easily absorbed cream does what it claims by moisturizing dry aging skin and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The bottle dispenser has a convenient pump with small opening which I like so it does not give out too much at a time and the size is good for my hand (not too small).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had large pours,.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything (cheap &amp; expensive) &amp; to find something that is reasonably priced is remarkable.</li>
            <li>When I applied it, it absorbed quickly and my skin was hydrated the entire day.</li>
            <li>the fine lines on my face are starting to decrease.</li>
            <li>Dispenses in a nice little pump.</li>
            <li>this product is so  amazing, why does it need so many fake reviews?  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer works really well</li>
            <li>She recommends this to any woman who wants to feel youthful again.</li>
            <li>so I  really thought I might not even use it again.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 and a redhead, although my wrinkles are minimal, what I noticed the most was</li>
            <li>It says non-greasy but for me its really sticky and feels like i put glue on my face</li>
            <li>Didnt really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this about a month and really like it</li>
            <li>was using drug store brand moisturizers but didn’t see much change.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my face very sticky.</li>
            <li>used it according to the instruction sent in the email which is very helpful.</li>
            <li>and I use it on my whole face.  </li>
            <li>I started applying this cream, and it&#x27;s really been combating the dryness and keeping my skin well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn’t greasy and I was surprised how quickly it absorbed into my skin</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>but my skin hasn&#x27;t rejected it as it does with so many other products.</li>
            <li>She said it left her skin feeling hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, about the same as Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for about 4 nights, and I think I am actually seeing diminished fine lines around my lips and maybe a couple of light brown spots are even fading a little, but that seems too good to be true -- maybe I just died and went to heaven, because  I am in my sixties and there are only about 3 other products that I think have helped my skin, like in my whole life.  </li>
            <li>I used all of mine and I am about ready to order a new one.  </li>
            <li>Skin is a lot better so far..softer and the wrinkles ar less</li>
            <li>This cream reminds me most of the deep line reducers or the firming facial pads I have used by Dr. Denise</li>
            <li>Getting older now</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and rejuvenated!!</li>
            <li>; I think it&#x27;s helping, but it may take a little time to be sure.</li>
            <li>My skin responds to it very well, even though I tend to be sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Only been using it a few days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It seems to help the wrinkles on upper lip and smile lines.  </li>
            <li>After I allowed it to absorb into my skin, I applied my make up as normal.</li>
            <li>but I need to apply it for few more times to write another review.</li>
            <li>I can see my skin feeling more firm</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for only a few days and am very pleased with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lighter creme that absorbs quickly and completely, so no worries of staining my clothes or pillowcases.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to change it up with new products that my skin need to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I’ve been concerned with my skin because I live in Arizona and spend a lot of time</li>
            <li>It replenishs your skin leaves it very soft like a baby face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft after using this.</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>It really does seem to moisturize, probably better than anything I have ever used before -- my skin not only feels less rough to touch but also feels less stiff when I smile, not dry-itchy, and just more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it both morning and night and with the quickly absorbing action it is perfect to use as a base before adding my foundation, as my foundation seems to guide on after use.</li>
            <li>Do too me having sensitive skin this product made my skin sting !</li>
            <li>I realize this is only my first day, however I will follow up in 2-3 weeks giving it time to see results.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way and skin feels nice.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and like I said it isn&#x27;t a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li>other plus is that this cream blended in to my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>She said she feels prettier and her skin is soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft, and I can see the lines Disappearing and smoothing out...</li>
            <li>However I do like want I have seen so far.  </li>
            <li>Those unnatural ingredients can really cause extra damage to your skin and defeat the purpose of the product that they are in.  </li>
            <li>how old I was, I asked her to guess, she guessed 40-45.</li>
            <li>This Darling Woman made my day, since i&#x27;m 65 years young and have never had anything done to my Face, no Lift, no Botox, no needles peels etc.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I just started using this product and so far it meets all my expectations.  </li>
            <li>and I already feel a difference in my 71 year old skin.</li>
            <li>The pump mechanism died early on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 year&#x27;s old - and I have plenty of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>No break outs so far</li>
            <li>It does leave skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>So definitely worth every penny spent, plus some....</li>
            <li>, it feels a little tacky at first but absorbs into the skin really well.  </li>
            <li>We tried tons of anti-aging lotions, some made her skin even more dry, some were really heavy.</li>
            <li>I dab forehead one cheek at a time and chin then smooth in circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle seems small but its lasted me since Feb 4th.</li>
            <li>I have used this for only a few days and seem to already see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and forehead.  </li>
            <li>It has hardly any scent and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>I can also see a difference in the laugh lines around my eyes, they seem less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>using the moisturizer for one week I feel like the fine lines above my lip are less definitive and the crows feet around the outside of my eyes are less noticeable unless I smile</li>
            <li>Product works very well, Cleanse Face first and let it air dry, Then I use Anti Aging Serum and let it dry, last  </li>
            <li>my eyebrows were miraculously gone, as well as a general flakiness!  </li>
            <li>It instantly agreed with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I switched from Bare Minerals neck cream and the jury is still out....</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t made me break out as I have sensitive skin, so that is a big plus.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face and neck feel so soft after applying even just a tiny dab of cream.</li>
            <li>I can bare it</li>
            <li>This did make my face a bit pink at first, but it didn&#x27;t last and wasn&#x27;t too noticeable with makeup on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 years old now and have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with rich ingredients and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>And when they say a little goes a long way, they are right.</li>
            <li>won’t feel self conscious about the red dry areas on my face</li>
            <li>Not worth the money -- seriously, do not buy it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this less than a month, but I can definitely see a change in my complexion, especially the fact that my pours are smaller and my face is much smoother.  </li>

            <li> When I put it on it smells nice and minty and the smell isn&#x27;t pefumey and doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>

            <li> Another great thing I confirmed from the seller is that this moisturizer is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> most woman I am always trying to make sure my skin looks as good as it can.</li>
            <li> and this is the best moisturizer I have used so far.</li>
            <li> When I put on any kind of cream, gel, etc, on to my face, the one thing it needs to be is non-oily and the quicker it blends in to my skin, the better.  </li>
            <li> 34;This is an amazing product - its even better than I</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews for anything, but this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It has a slight minty scent and best of all, my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> One pre-measured pump doesn&#x27;t seem like much, but it is a perfect amount and works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a pleasant scent that dissipates quickly, so it does not interfere with my perfume when I apply it under my makeup before going out for the evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many creams but this moisture is the best so far, will order more.</li>
            <li> This is the most AMAZING anti-aging moisturizer formula that I have ever used and well worth every penny!!  </li>
            <li> No breakouts and my skin feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Ultra Spa was very light and had minty fragrance.</li>
            <li> The cream is very light when applied and doesn&#x27;t seem sticky as some creams do</li>
            <li> Afterwards this moisturizer is not sticky as it&#x27;s very smooth to touch, unlike others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It has a very light and pleasant fragrance (smells like fresh rain) but goes away after I put on.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and just love the smell and feel of it on my face.  </li>
            <li> buy her more</li>
            <li> and I want to stay on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> love the bottle with the see through sides.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a friend, they love it...</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this from the moment I opened the bottle.  </li>
            <li> the fact that this is made with no parabens, dyes, fillers or alcohol, makes this product so much better in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t at all greasy which is always my problem with most products like this.</li>
            <li> I can see improvement in my face complexion and enjoying the result.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate her skin as most products do.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more radiant.  </li>
            <li> I love the refreshing minty fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would do even better if I hadn&#x27;t smoked.  </li>
            <li> I hope I will be getting more results soon.</li>
            <li> that was refreshing my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that because I don&#x27;t have to wait to put my make-up</li>
            <li> and I love how this has vitamin C which helps with reducing aging signs on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells and feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is so refreshing, and has a minty scent.</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Am very much enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I love the bottle, the pump dispenser...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and the Ultra Spa goes on and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling either greasy or &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34;, the peppermint extract smells wonderful and is soothing to the skin, and my skin looks healthier every day!</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps it from being perfect?</li>
            <li> Tried so many moisturizer over the years, there is no room to name them all.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this moisturizer feels.</li>
            <li> More of a lotion than a gel.</li>
            <li> Have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean feel without tightening the skin.</li>
            <li> and it has a nice clean minty smell but don&#x27;t worry...</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Smells ok, moisturizes ok, but does do a thing for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After using for a month, my skin feels smoother, firmer, more hydrated with fine lines virtually eliminated.  </li>
            <li> I found this cream to feel light, tingly and refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be doing great.  </li>
            <li> and so far it is great on my skin</li>
            <li> but it goes on nicely, has a pleasant smell &amp; works well with my makeup (which is another big plus!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend this cream if you are looking for a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li> , it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is not at all greasy and it is rather easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> this product was, but I went through the bottle very, very quickly.</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly and immediately started using the cream on my face and neck every evening after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy feeling and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> I tend to break out easily, but have not had any reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li> the clean, refreshing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is rich in vitamin C which helps with reducing fine lines and making skin more brighter.</li>
            <li> This is only (DAY 1) but impressed so far as product feels extremely nice on face.</li>
            <li> Feels very silky, has a pleasant scent and my skin soaks it up quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easily absorbs to my skin.</li>
            <li> but this is just fine for me.</li>
            <li> It appears that the fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an easy applicator which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell yet if it works on wrinkles and fine lines because I just started using it two days ago.</li>
            <li> I love the light scent and the easy to use pump dispenses just the right amount.</li>
            <li> A really great product to add to your daily routine.</li>
            <li> It has a light peppermint scent and once on almost has a tingly feeling.  </li>
            <li> And the skin on my face and neck remains smooth and moist after washing it every morning.</li>
            <li> luck and enjoy.</li>
            <li> This will tighten your skin, but one of the primary ingredients is good old witch hazel, which is an astringent that you can get cheaply in the drug store.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> When applying feels tingly and light.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Well, so far so good, it&#x27;s like a drink of water for my skin.</li>
            <li> Clearer more beautiful skin with less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I almost never think a moisturizer actually does anything, and I did not even like this the first night because it felt kind of sticky, smelled like peppermint, and made my face pinkish in a way that didn&#x27;t look good (which happily did not happen the second night)</li>
            <li> I love the fresh, clean scent.  </li>
            <li> One of the best new finds on Amazon for me of this entire year!!  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love how my face feels after trying it out for the first time.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer did moisturize my skin pretty well and made it feel healthy.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try so as soon as it arrived</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff but pump stopped working after first week , now have to smack bottom of the bottle ( like ketchup) to get it out.</li>
            <li> cream felt really rich and thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far I am pleased with the cream and look forward to seeing more wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> LOVE the soft refreshing smell of mint.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am ready to order more......</li>
            <li> I use Clinque during the day because I have sensitive skin, but this is so nice at night.</li>
            <li> I really like it but don&#x27;t know if I love it yet.  </li>
            <li> The minty aroma is very pleasing and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I could not give a full review of its benefits  to the skin  because I have just used it for a week.</li>
            <li> it smooths on very evenly and leaves a refreshing tightness on the skin.  </li>
            <li> After trying numerous more costly moisturizers on my maturing sensitive skin, I found this to be the best so far.  </li>
            <li> I have also found that it absorbs quickly and it has really helped to smooth out those fine lines.</li>
            <li> This lotion is silky and smells fresh and clean..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Light lotion , penetrates quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It hydrates and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> well and dries quick, so I can apply makeup.  </li>
            <li> I can see a mild difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin feel good and help with some minor flaws I had.</li>
            <li> My mom is getting older and loves to try new get young quick creams but likes this best by far.</li>
            <li> will have to come back next month and give an update as to how well this Ultra Spa Skin Care Anti Aging Moisture Cream is working at reducing my fine lines and wrinkles, but from what I have seen so far, I anticipate having a very good report and for now I give this product my 5 star recommendation!</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating, yet light....</li>
            <li> after apply feel fresh</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product so far.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to most fragrances</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer so far.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> but I love it this far</li>
            <li> do not feel it is any better than most other products.</li>
            <li> I really like the rich, creamy quality of the cream.  </li>
            <li> The serum itself is probably as good as any other Retinol product, but getting to it was a pain.  </li>
            <li> I ve used many high end brands and This one really works.</li>
            <li> and it goes right into my skin!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has just the right formulation that it does not leave greasy oil on my forehead and</li>
            <li> can put my makeup on right away.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After trying so many different moisturizers, I have finally found one I love!  </li>
            <li> I have big hopes for this one after reading positive reviews and like I said has an extremely nice feel on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing minty fragrance and how soft my face and neck feel after applying even just a tiny dab of cream.  </li>
            <li> It was a good product, but not worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and it keeps my face moist for a long time and I am hoping the wrinkles will soften soon</li>
            <li> thanks for such an amazing product..</li>
            <li> Overall a fantastic product that I would recommend over many of the high priced ones on the market.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have to use very much to cover my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first review to ever write.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with my first bottle of moisturizer and could kick myself for not taking a before and after photo.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling refreshed and touchable soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My 60-year-old skin looked firmer, fresher, and had a better color after a week of daily use.</li>
            <li> Try this first and you will never look for</li>
            <li> I chose this product because although there were few reviews - only about 5 at the time, they were all good -- and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> It appears smoother and my pores are not as evident as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first day I used this product, I received a compliment on my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> It helps to reduce wrinkles and my skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My face feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth 20$ -- it is more the quality and the feel of a cheap brand.</li>
            <li> It has a minty aroma and it makes my skin feel really soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Can see a difference in my \\&quot;smile\\&quot; area ;-)  </li>
            <li> I first put some on my face, I noticed</li>
            <li> I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh or strong smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the results will be after a few weeks, but right now I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> It is a great anti aging treatment because after a few uses, I can see and feel that my skin is more firm.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, almost light minty smell to it; not a strong mint smell but just a mild smell that almost is minty and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a firm face with a huge reduction in fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> The Ultra Spa Skin Care moisturizer definitely is non-greasy and easily glides over and absorbs into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> The easily absorbed cream does what it claims by moisturizing dry aging skin and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The bottle dispenser has a convenient pump with small opening which I like so it does not give out too much at a time and the size is good for my hand (not too small).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had large pours,.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything (cheap &amp; expensive) &amp; to find something that is reasonably priced is remarkable.</li>
            <li> When I applied it, it absorbed quickly and my skin was hydrated the entire day.</li>
            <li> the fine lines on my face are starting to decrease.</li>
            <li> Dispenses in a nice little pump.</li>
            <li> this product is so  amazing, why does it need so many fake reviews?  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer works really well</li>
            <li> She recommends this to any woman who wants to feel youthful again.</li>
            <li> so I  really thought I might not even use it again.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 and a redhead, although my wrinkles are minimal, what I noticed the most was</li>
            <li> It says non-greasy but for me its really sticky and feels like i put glue on my face</li>
            <li> Didnt really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a month and really like it</li>
            <li> was using drug store brand moisturizers but didn’t see much change.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my face very sticky.</li>
            <li> used it according to the instruction sent in the email which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> and I use it on my whole face.  </li>
            <li> I started applying this cream, and it&#x27;s really been combating the dryness and keeping my skin well moisturized.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn’t greasy and I was surprised how quickly it absorbed into my skin</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> but my skin hasn&#x27;t rejected it as it does with so many other products.</li>
            <li> She said it left her skin feeling hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, about the same as Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for about 4 nights, and I think I am actually seeing diminished fine lines around my lips and maybe a couple of light brown spots are even fading a little, but that seems too good to be true -- maybe I just died and went to heaven, because  I am in my sixties and there are only about 3 other products that I think have helped my skin, like in my whole life.  </li>
            <li> I used all of mine and I am about ready to order a new one.  </li>
            <li> Skin is a lot better so far..softer and the wrinkles ar less</li>
            <li> This cream reminds me most of the deep line reducers or the firming facial pads I have used by Dr. Denise</li>
            <li> Getting older now</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and rejuvenated!!</li>
            <li> ; I think it&#x27;s helping, but it may take a little time to be sure.</li>
            <li> My skin responds to it very well, even though I tend to be sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Only been using it a few days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It seems to help the wrinkles on upper lip and smile lines.  </li>
            <li> After I allowed it to absorb into my skin, I applied my make up as normal.</li>
            <li> but I need to apply it for few more times to write another review.</li>
            <li> I can see my skin feeling more firm</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a few days and am very pleased with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lighter creme that absorbs quickly and completely, so no worries of staining my clothes or pillowcases.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to change it up with new products that my skin need to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I’ve been concerned with my skin because I live in Arizona and spend a lot of time</li>
            <li> It replenishs your skin leaves it very soft like a baby face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft after using this.</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> It really does seem to moisturize, probably better than anything I have ever used before -- my skin not only feels less rough to touch but also feels less stiff when I smile, not dry-itchy, and just more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it both morning and night and with the quickly absorbing action it is perfect to use as a base before adding my foundation, as my foundation seems to guide on after use.</li>
            <li> Do too me having sensitive skin this product made my skin sting !</li>
            <li> I realize this is only my first day, however I will follow up in 2-3 weeks giving it time to see results.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and skin feels nice.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, and like I said it isn&#x27;t a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li> other plus is that this cream blended in to my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> She said she feels prettier and her skin is soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels baby soft, and I can see the lines Disappearing and smoothing out...</li>
            <li> However I do like want I have seen so far.  </li>
            <li> Those unnatural ingredients can really cause extra damage to your skin and defeat the purpose of the product that they are in.  </li>
            <li> how old I was, I asked her to guess, she guessed 40-45.</li>
            <li> This Darling Woman made my day, since i&#x27;m 65 years young and have never had anything done to my Face, no Lift, no Botox, no needles peels etc.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and so far it meets all my expectations.  </li>
            <li> and I already feel a difference in my 71 year old skin.</li>
            <li> The pump mechanism died early on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 year&#x27;s old - and I have plenty of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> No break outs so far</li>
            <li> It does leave skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> So definitely worth every penny spent, plus some....</li>
            <li> , it feels a little tacky at first but absorbs into the skin really well.  </li>
            <li> We tried tons of anti-aging lotions, some made her skin even more dry, some were really heavy.</li>
            <li> I dab forehead one cheek at a time and chin then smooth in circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle seems small but its lasted me since Feb 4th.</li>
            <li> I have used this for only a few days and seem to already see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and forehead.  </li>
            <li> It has hardly any scent and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> I can also see a difference in the laugh lines around my eyes, they seem less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> using the moisturizer for one week I feel like the fine lines above my lip are less definitive and the crows feet around the outside of my eyes are less noticeable unless I smile</li>
            <li> Product works very well, Cleanse Face first and let it air dry, Then I use Anti Aging Serum and let it dry, last  </li>
            <li> my eyebrows were miraculously gone, as well as a general flakiness!  </li>
            <li> It instantly agreed with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I switched from Bare Minerals neck cream and the jury is still out....</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t made me break out as I have sensitive skin, so that is a big plus.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face and neck feel so soft after applying even just a tiny dab of cream.</li>
            <li> I can bare it</li>
            <li> This did make my face a bit pink at first, but it didn&#x27;t last and wasn&#x27;t too noticeable with makeup on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old now and have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with rich ingredients and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> And when they say a little goes a long way, they are right.</li>
            <li> won’t feel self conscious about the red dry areas on my face</li>
            <li> Not worth the money -- seriously, do not buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this less than a month, but I can definitely see a change in my complexion, especially the fact that my pours are smaller and my face is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that is right for my skin type because I have oily skin on my forehead and the rest is dry/normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed too that my skin is not rough and dry as before.</li>
            <li> especially it&#x27;s so hard to find skin products that are suitable and non-irrirating to your skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long, only 5 days.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any benefits</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last for long</li>
            <li> I just received my new anti aging cream a few days ago.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN FEELS SO SOFT, AND MY WRINKLES SEEM TO BE GETTING LESS NOTICEABLE.</li>
            <li> and yet my skin is feeling hydrated, especially with this dry winter itchy skin</li>
            <li> But by the very next morning my face felt soft to the touch, and a couple of small scaly patches around  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> to early to tell I just got it a few days ago...</li>
            <li> You only need to use a tiny bit; a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Over the past several months, I have tried several different Anti Aging Creams and this one does not disappoint  </li>
            <li> I was having problems with dry, flaky skin, but haven&#x27;t since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I wash my face, let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> my cheek is moisturized so it does not feel dry.</li>
            <li> My skin has been so dry this winter, which has never happened to me before.  </li>
            <li> By the time I am finished rubbing some in to my neck, the portion around my eyes is already dry.  </li>
            <li> OMG, yet another product full of fake 5-star reviews.  </li>
            <li> I found this cream and in just a few days I have, seen a big difference!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected on me.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly tried this, expecting minimal results.  </li>
            <li> I have bags under my eyes, as I have aged, and since using this , I am noticing a difference.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how the next few week go with Ultra Spa.</li>
            <li> It smells slightly minty which is weird, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I also like that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The fakeness is so blatant you can even find reviews by the same person on the same day such as user Alzaghtiti (her reviews are here http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1049MTDEQ8TID/ref&#x3D;pdp_new) and user Alzaghtiti09</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this cream!</li>
            <li> the lotion has made my skin very red, I usually wait til the redness disappears, but it seems to stay longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It’s not like other moisturizers I’ve bought in the past from the local convenient or department store that leave a film of grease on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cannot wait to try some of this companies other products.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend trying this product for at least 1 month.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I thought I would try to slow down the inevitable wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is an average moisturizer, not a super beauty product as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t as dry as it usually gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but there is a slight smell that I did not like.</li>
            <li> doesn’t feel like thick goop is blocking my pores and a small amount is enough to cover my face</li>
            <li> mosturizers have a strong perfume base, which has never made sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on stuff that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I received the product a few day&#x27;s ago .</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see results in just a few days.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking forward to using this everyday.</li>
            <li> I have tried  La Mer, Renu, Philosophy, Clinique Repairwear, and L&#x27;Occitane to name a few.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in my skin after a few uses of it.</li>
            <li> Started using Ultra-Spa anti-aging moisturizing cream and believe it or not I see a difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for a few days, the dryness is gone and my skin feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also tried some on my cracked dried knuckles and heels.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> have been using it everyday, and I have noticed that my skin has a glow.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizer for almost a month, and by golly - my wrinkles look softer, and less visible!</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed in how quickly 1 ounce gets used.</li>
            <li> As the cold weather approaches, I find the need for an extreme facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> never realized that some of the products I have used in the past contained parabens, dyes, fillers or alcohol</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t real heavy and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, as some others I have tried  </li>
            <li> Then put a small amount into the palm of my hand, and apply to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I have used this on my face now for a few days and it is not oily in the slightest!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to tell since I&#x27;ve got lots of wrinkles from all my years of smoking like a dumbo!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have bad crows feet around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> When the stickyness goes away, my face does not feel moisturized in the least.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or thick, so</li>
            <li> Been using the product for a few weeks &amp; the one plus side is my face hasn&#x27;t broken out!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> After the second time using I noticed a difference, my face looks brighter and less tired, skin is tighter!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately a month and see no visible change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> and there is nothing wrong with smiling.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I hated to use them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my first review to ever write. I am almost done with my first bottle of moisturizer and could kick myself for not taking a before and after photo. Bought a second bottle for my daughter and she agrees. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Prety good, love the pump bottle</li>
            <li> OMG, yet another product full of fake 5-star reviews.  The fakeness is so blatant you can even find reviews by the same person on the same day such as user Alzaghtiti (her reviews are here http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1049MTDEQ8TID/ref&#x3D;pdp_new) and user Alzaghtiti09 (reviews are http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NXENR1R8SCP/ref&#x3D;pdp_new).  If you look at each of those user profiles you&#x27;ll notice that they have reviewed a lot of the same products including THIS ONE!  They even reviewed this one on the same day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product is so  amazing, why does it need so many fake reviews?  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling refreshed and touchable soft and smooth. I use this every day in my daily routine and still cant get over the way it leaves  my face feeling . A really great product to add to your daily routine.</li>
            <li> Love how my face feels after trying it out for the first time.</li>
            <li> One of the best moisturizer I ever used. Moistures  your skin but It does not leave your skin oily. It replenishs your skin leaves it very soft like a baby face. I ve been using it for 2 days and I loved it so far. I ve used many high end brands and This one really works.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a few days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I just received my new anti aging cream a few days ago. So far so good. My face feels soft and rejuvenated!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product...a little goes a long way and skin feels nice.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and bought this moisturizer I&#x27;d never heard of, based on the reviews I read. Am I glad I did! It instantly agreed with my sensitive skin. It is very hydrating, yet light....no sticky or greasy feeling. And when they say a little goes a long way, they are right. One pre-measured pump doesn&#x27;t seem like much, but it is a perfect amount and works fine. My 60-year-old skin looked firmer, fresher, and had a better color after a week of daily use.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works really well, it feels a little tacky at first but absorbs into the skin really well.  It smells slightly minty which is weird, but it&#x27;s not bad. I also like the pump it is in, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to give to my mom. She loves it! She said she feels prettier and her skin is soft and glowing. This lotion is silky and smells fresh and clean..almost minty. My mom is getting older and loves to try new get young quick creams but likes this best by far. She recommends this to any woman who wants to feel youthful again. I might have to get a bottle to try for myself! Don&#x27;t waste money on stuff that doesn&#x27;t work. Try this first and you will never look for another product.(That is what she told me)</li>
            <li> finally.....I found this cream and in just a few days I have, seen a big difference!! I am ready to order more......thanks for such an amazing product..by the way, I am 82 and never dreamed I could have something like this ...</li>
            <li> I received the product a few day&#x27;s ago . I like the way it feels on my skin and you can actually feel the tightening happen shortly after application. so far I am pleased with the cream and look forward to seeing more wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li> I almost never think a moisturizer actually does anything, and I did not even like this the first night because it felt kind of sticky, smelled like peppermint, and made my face pinkish in a way that didn&#x27;t look good (which happily did not happen the second night)...so I  really thought I might not even use it again.  But by the very next morning my face felt soft to the touch, and a couple of small scaly patches around  my eyebrows were miraculously gone, as well as a general flakiness!  It really does seem to moisturize, probably better than anything I have ever used before -- my skin not only feels less rough to touch but also feels less stiff when I smile, not dry-itchy, and just more comfortable.  I have only used it for about 4 nights, and I think I am actually seeing diminished fine lines around my lips and maybe a couple of light brown spots are even fading a little, but that seems too good to be true -- maybe I just died and went to heaven, because  I am in my sixties and there are only about 3 other products that I think have helped my skin, like in my whole life.  I chose this product because although there were few reviews - only about 5 at the time, they were all good -- and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> My skin feels baby soft, and I can see the lines Disappearing and smoothing out...Goes on Creamy, not sticky or Greasy ,Has a Wonderful Fresh Scent</li>
            <li> I use this at night and just love the smell and feel of it on my face.  It is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever had. I use Clinque during the day because I have sensitive skin, but this is so nice at night. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> after apply feel fresh</li>
            <li> I am 60 and a redhead, although my wrinkles are minimal, what I noticed the most was I had large pours,. I&#x27;ve been using this less than a month, but I can definitely see a change in my complexion, especially the fact that my pours are smaller and my face is much smoother.  I can also see a difference in the laugh lines around my eyes, they seem less noticeable.  I would definitely recommend trying this product for at least 1 month.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light lotion , penetrates quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy her more</li>
            <li> After the second time using I noticed a difference, my face looks brighter and less tired, skin is tighter!!!! I am 38 and I want to stay on top of my skin. I love this cream and will be getting more!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very deep lines above my upper lip which have been improving since I started using Ultra Spa Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream. I will keep on using this cream, hopefully the lines will disappear...........</li>
            <li> This is an average moisturizer, not a super beauty product as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected on me.</li>
            <li> It says non-greasy but for me its really sticky and feels like i put glue on my face and then it felt like my face was on fire lol it was an interesting adventure with this product. But everyone has different reactions to these. Didnt really like it. Good luck to you :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a month and really like it (I just ordered another bottle).  I love the fresh, clean scent.  No breakouts and my skin feels very smooth.  I was having problems with dry, flaky skin, but haven&#x27;t since I started using this.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used! My skin looks and feels years younger in just a week. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a firm face with a huge reduction in fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have bad crows feet around my eyes.  I reluctantly tried this, expecting minimal results.  I felt it tightening my skin within 30 seconds of applying it.  After about a week of use, my crows feet are about 50 percent GONE!  You only need to use a tiny bit; a little bit goes a long way.  It has hardly any scent and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this cream!</li>
            <li> I can see a big difference in my skin in just a week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this product for almost a week now and so far I&#x27;m satisfied with it. It&#x27;s light and easily absorbs to my skin. I&#x27;m also happy that&#x27; its made in the US and FDA approved especially it&#x27;s so hard to find skin products that are suitable and non-irrirating to your skin. I&#x27;ve noticed too that my skin is not rough and dry as before.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product a week ago. I had been using another moisturizer that I loved. But after using this , I&#x27;m now hooked! My skin has NEVER looked this good!. I wake up and can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks.  You&#x27;ll see results in just a few days..... This product was given to me at a discount rate for my honest opinion</li>
            <li> #antiagingcream  I love how moisturizing this product is and the fact that it is very refreshing too. I used this during the day and at night. It is a great anti aging treatment because after a few uses, I can see and feel that my skin is more firm. It is rich in vitamin C which helps with reducing fine lines and making skin more brighter. Bottom line: Defiantly recommend!</li>
            <li> Looking For An Anti-Aging Moisturizer? Check Out Ultra Spa Skin Care #antiagingcream&lt;br /&gt;Like most woman I am always trying to make sure my skin looks as good as it can. I have been using moisturizer since the age of 12 and now that I am almost 50 I like to change it up with new products that my skin need to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;I love the bottle with the see through sides. The Ultra Spa Skin Care moisturizer definitely is non-greasy and easily glides over and absorbs into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the moisturizer for one week I feel like the fine lines above my lip are less definitive and the crows feet around the outside of my eyes are less noticeable unless I smile and there is nothing wrong with smiling. This is a great addition to my morning skin routine.  It has a nice pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to using this everyday.</li>
            <li> Great Product makes your skin feel really good</li>
            <li> As the cold weather approaches, I find the need for an extreme facial moisturizer.  I really like the rich, creamy quality of the cream.  It is not at all greasy and it is rather easy to apply.  I have also found that it absorbs quickly and it has really helped to smooth out those fine lines.</li>
            <li> I liked how absorbent and non-greasy this product was, but I went through the bottle very, very quickly. It was a good product, but not worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I will definitely be ordering this moisturizer again!!!</li>
            <li> I really like it but don&#x27;t know if I love it yet.  I switched from Bare Minerals neck cream and the jury is still out....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long, only 5 days.  However I do like want I have seen so far.  I like the feel and it hasn&#x27;t made me break out as I have sensitive skin, so that is a big plus.  I feel like I have seen a change also with lines but that could be wishful thinking.  I will keep using the Moisturizer Cream.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer did moisturize my skin pretty well and made it feel healthy.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a friend, they love it...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a few days and am very pleased with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lighter creme that absorbs quickly and completely, so no worries of staining my clothes or pillowcases.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant scent that dissipates quickly, so it does not interfere with my perfume when I apply it under my makeup before going out for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have found as I am aging, is that the skin on my face is getting drier with every year that passes. The revitalizing agents in this product already seem to be replenishing the moisture that time has stripped away.&lt;br /&gt;I especially notice a difference in the way my skin looks after applying my foundation. It appears smoother and my pores are not as evident as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;I never realized that some of the products I have used in the past contained parabens, dyes, fillers or alcohol and I believe that the lack of these elements in Sandman LLC&#x27;s Ultra Spa Skin Care Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream is what is making the difference!&lt;br /&gt;I feel good about using a product that is made in the USA at an FDA registered facility.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to come back next month and give an update as to how well this Ultra Spa Skin Care Anti Aging Moisture Cream is working at reducing my fine lines and wrinkles, but from what I have seen so far, I anticipate having a very good report and for now I give this product my 5 star recommendation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited a while to write my review.  I wanted to see how well it worked.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  I think that it has helped my skin.  I also use a Hyaluronic Acid Serum with this.  I like the way it makes my skin feel.  I will be buying this again.  I also like the smell.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this from the moment I opened the bottle.  It has a light peppermint scent and once on almost has a tingly feeling.  I have used this for only a few days and seem to already see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and forehead.  I am very happy with how this product works with my foundation.  I use it before applying the foundation and even after a couple of hours, my face doesn&#x27;t get that greasy/oily feeling.  the fact that this is made with no parabens, dyes, fillers or alcohol, makes this product so much better in my eyes.  Those unnatural ingredients can really cause extra damage to your skin and defeat the purpose of the product that they are in.  This did make my face a bit pink at first, but it didn&#x27;t last and wasn&#x27;t too noticeable with makeup on.  This product is a must have in any beauty arsenal!  I am happy that I was given this product in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly and immediately started using the cream on my face and neck every evening after cleansing.  I love the refreshing minty fragrance and how soft my face and neck feel after applying even just a tiny dab of cream.  And the skin on my face and neck remains smooth and moist after washing it every morning.</li>
            <li> I’ve been concerned with my skin because I live in Arizona and spend a lot of time outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;The left side of my face gets additional exposure to sun when I’m driving my car.&lt;br /&gt;I was using drug store brand moisturizers but didn’t see much change.&lt;br /&gt;They made my face feel greasy so I hated to use them.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Ultra Spa and it goes right into my skin!&lt;br /&gt;It feels like nothing is coating my face but my skin is definitely softer and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t feel like thick goop is blocking my pores and a small amount is enough to cover my face, I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;What a find!&lt;br /&gt;Wendy  Fishkind</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I was excited to try so as soon as it arrived I immediately opened it and applied it. It left my skin feeling so soft and smooth! It wasn&#x27;t at all greasy which is always my problem with most products like this. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh or strong smell.</li>
            <li> Product works very well, Cleanse Face first and let it air dry, Then I use Anti Aging Serum and let it dry, last  I apply Ultra Spa Moisturizer, this lotion has a very pleasant aroma, minty cool, found out that it&#x27;s better not to be too stingy with the amount I use, after all it&#x27;s Fall and Winter to follow shortly. During the colder month&#x27;s I like to spoil my Skin. Last week  I was asked by a  Lady how old I was, I asked her to guess, she guessed 40-45. This Darling Woman made my day, since i&#x27;m 65 years young and have never had anything done to my Face, no Lift, no Botox, no needles peels etc.&lt;br /&gt;Now, i can not guarantee the same results, since everyone&#x27;s Skin is different, however, I believe you will like ULTRA SPA Products.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product @ 3 wks and I like it.  It seems to help the wrinkles on upper lip and smile lines.  It absorbs quickly and has a pleasant scent.  I will probably order again.</li>
            <li> I am very thrilled to find an anti-aging product that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. I have tried  La Mer, Renu, Philosophy, Clinique Repairwear, and L&#x27;Occitane to name a few. This cream reminds me most of the deep line reducers or the firming facial pads I have used by Dr. Denise I found this cream to feel light, tingly and refreshing on my skin. It hydrates and absorbs quickly. The first day I used this product, I received a compliment on my skin&#x27;s appearance. Upon application, my skin is visibly refreshed and feels firmer. Overall a fantastic product that I would recommend over many of the high priced ones on the market. At $40 and prime shipping, I plan on using this product going forward.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this cream.  It helps to reduce wrinkles and my skin feels soft and smooth.  I can see improvement in my face complexion and enjoying the result.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Non greasy. Soaks in quickly. My face feels soft and smooth. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and so far it meets all my expectations.  My skin responds to it very well, even though I tend to be sensitive.  It has a slight minty scent and best of all, my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this moisturizer.  Over the past several months, I have tried several different Anti Aging Creams and this one does not disappoint  It isn&#x27;t real heavy and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, as some others I have tried  I wash my face, let it air dry.  Then put a small amount into the palm of my hand, and apply to my face and neck.  It goes on easily, and like I said it isn&#x27;t a heavy cream.  After I allowed it to absorb into my skin, I applied my make up as normal. Anytime I apply a moisturizer and then make up , my concern is that it will make my face greasy feeling by the end of the day.  But this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t do that.  I have already noticed just in the short time I have been using that my face is softer.  I have bags under my eyes, as I have aged, and since using this , I am noticing a difference.  Great moisturizer!   I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect anti aging moisturizer cream I have found.  The easily absorbed cream does what it claims by moisturizing dry aging skin and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. I love the light scent and the easy to use pump dispenses just the right amount. I have been using it both morning and night and with the quickly absorbing action it is perfect to use as a base before adding my foundation, as my foundation seems to guide on after use.</li>
            <li> I have just purchased the product. It has a nice scent and it keeps my face moist for a long time and I am hoping the wrinkles will soften soon but I need to apply it for few more times to write another review.</li>
            <li> Skin is a lot better so far..softer and the wrinkles ar less</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product so far. It has a nice clean feel without tightening the skin. I have oily skin prone to acne and this is the best moisturizer I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I got this moisturizer for my mom. She is in love with it! It didn&#x27;t irritate her skin as most products do. We tried tons of anti-aging lotions, some made her skin even more dry, some were really heavy. Ultra Spa was very light and had minty fragrance. She said it left her skin feeling hydrated and clean. She had a cooling sensation and firmer skin. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It makes my face very sticky. That&#x27;s not a pleasant feeling. When the stickyness goes away, my face does not feel moisturized in the least. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 days now.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be doing great.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any benefits but my skin hasn&#x27;t rejected it as it does with so many other products.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, about the same as Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> Hydrating cream based moisturizer. Does not leave skin feeling oily or sticky like some moisturizers I&#x27;ve applied!&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well and dries quick, so I can apply makeup.  Dispenses in a nice little pump. Small amount goes a long way. Anti aging, so I apply all over face and neck.</li>
            <li> very good moisurizer.  will consider purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that is right for my skin type because I have oily skin on my forehead and the rest is dry/normal. This moisturizer has just the right formulation that it does not leave greasy oil on my forehead and my cheek is moisturized so it does not feel dry. It has a very light and pleasant fragrance (smells like fresh rain) but goes away after I put on. The bottle dispenser has a convenient pump with small opening which I like so it does not give out too much at a time and the size is good for my hand (not too small).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it according to the instruction sent in the email which is very helpful. I am very happy with how my skin feels afterwards and would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Received this 5 days ago and I already feel a difference in my 71 year old skin. My skin looks more radiant.  I love the refreshing minty fragrance.  I am sensitive to most fragrances but this is just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product. No irritation to your face and works as described. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> After trying so many different moisturizers, I have finally found one I love!  After using for a month, my skin feels smoother, firmer, more hydrated with fine lines virtually eliminated.  I just turned 40 and I got carded last night at the grocery store!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Not greasy and absorbs into skin immediately.</li>
            <li> This will tighten your skin, but one of the primary ingredients is good old witch hazel, which is an astringent that you can get cheaply in the drug store. This product is not worth 20$ -- it is more the quality and the feel of a cheap brand. Not worth the money -- seriously, do not buy it.</li>
            <li> I can see a mild difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s a little hard to tell since I&#x27;ve got lots of wrinkles from all my years of smoking like a dumbo!  I&#x27;m sure it would do even better if I hadn&#x27;t smoked.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Smells ok, moisturizes ok, but does do a thing for fine lines and wrinkles. Skin not tighter of younger looking.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I feel my skin so smooth. I Apple every night, when I wake up in morning my face feel so smooth. The best</li>
            <li> Do too me having sensitive skin this product made my skin sting ! I contacted the seller and was given superior customer service !</li>
            <li> Awesome, non greasy, absorbs well</li>
            <li> I had purchased an $80 eye cream.  This I think does just about as well and I use it on my whole face.  I will buy this product again.  For the price, it is great!!!</li>
            <li> girl friend likes the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, it has nice smell and the fine lines on my face are starting to decrease. I hope I will be getting more results soon. This cream is recommended to prevent anti aging process on matured skin. I love the ingredients of this cream, which contains matrixyl and vitamin c, it is very good to prevent skin aging.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! The minty aroma is very pleasing and refreshing. It is not greasy feeling and it absorbs very quickly. My skin feels very soft after using this. I also like that a little goes a long way. I am very happy that I tried this brand. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My skin has been so dry this winter, which has never happened to me before.  I started applying this cream, and it&#x27;s really been combating the dryness and keeping my skin well moisturized.  I tend to break out easily, but have not had any reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li> When I put on any kind of cream, gel, etc, on to my face, the one thing it needs to be is non-oily and the quicker it blends in to my skin, the better.  Well, this stuff is perfect for both of those things.  I have used this on my face now for a few days and it is not oily in the slightest!  It has a fresh, almost light minty smell to it; not a strong mint smell but just a mild smell that almost is minty and fresh smelling.  It doesn&#x27;t last for long but when I did smell it, it just felt like I was putting something on my face that was refreshing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other plus is that this cream blended in to my skin quickly.  By the time I am finished rubbing some in to my neck, the portion around my eyes is already dry.  I love that because I don&#x27;t have to wait to put my make-up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this cream if you are looking for a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer so far. Thank you for making such a great product. Definitely has done wonders for my face already!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS WONDERFUL!!  MY SKIN FEELS SO SOFT, AND MY WRINKLES SEEM TO BE GETTING LESS NOTICEABLE.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I used all of mine and I am about ready to order a new one.  Made my skin feel good and help with some minor flaws I had.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results instantly. I&#x27;ve used many creams but this moisture is the best so far, will order more.</li>
            <li> #antiagingcream Moisturized my skin and kept it moisturized! Noticed a difference in my skin after a few uses of it. I can see my skin feeling more firm and I love how this has vitamin C which helps with reducing aging signs on the skin. I greatly recommend this!</li>
            <li> the lotion has made my skin very red, I usually wait til the redness disappears, but it seems to stay longer.  I have decided not to use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;can I return it?</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells and feels on my skin. It has a minty aroma and it makes my skin feel really soft and smooth</li>
            <li> After trying numerous more costly moisturizers on my maturing sensitive skin, I found this to be the best so far.  I can see the difference in my skin and have had no breakouts after a week of use.</li>
            <li> Great Seller, great product</li>
            <li> This cream is so refreshing, and has a minty scent. It makes my face and neck feel so soft after applying even just a tiny dab of cream. It&#x27;s not greasy or thick, so it&#x27;s a nice under layer for make up.  It&#x27;s made with rich ingredients and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cream! Very light and easy to apply. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients. Nice light fragrance. Skin feels nourished.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff but pump stopped working after first week , now have to smack bottom of the bottle ( like ketchup) to get it out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 week. I have used it twice a day. I see no improvement in the hydration or improvement of my skin.</li>
            <li> Good mosturizer but there is a slight smell that I did not like.I can bare it but I would prefer that it does not exist.I could not give a full review of its benefits  to the skin  because I have just used it for a week.</li>
            <li> Getting older now so I thought I would try to slow down the inevitable wrinkles. Started using Ultra-Spa anti-aging moisturizing cream and believe it or not I see a difference in just a few days. I would recommend this to any one. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly without feeling greasy. It appears that the fine lines are diminishing. Nice moisturizer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol T.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing!  UPDATE 2 weeks after using:  Am very much enjoying this product. Lightweight and refreshing.  Can see a difference in my \\&quot;smile\\&quot; area ;-)  Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;This is an amazing product - its even better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the soft refreshing smell of mint.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that it leaves my face perfectly moisturized but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I can put my makeup on right away.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> using product for about a week now and I can see my skin is feeling smoother and just has a overall glow that I did nit see before</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this cream. I had some discoloration on one side of my face. After using this the spots have gotten lighter. It makes my skin feel tighter.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately a month and see no visible change in my skin.  It has a pleasing texture and citrus smell&lt;br /&gt;but do not feel it is any better than most other products.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews for anything, but this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;When I first put some on my face, I noticed the clean, refreshing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream felt really rich and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t greasy and I was surprised how quickly it absorbed into my skin but I didn&#x27;t have to use very much to cover my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not like other moisturizers I’ve bought in the past from the local convenient or department store that leave a film of grease on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time too. I only put it on in the morning but my skin was still softer and smoother when I washed it in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t as dry as it usually gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few days, the dryness is gone and my skin feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An additional benefit is looking and feeling better.&lt;br /&gt;I won’t feel self conscious about the red dry areas on my face anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried some on my cracked dried knuckles and heels.&lt;br /&gt;It’s working there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would have thought that a moisturizer would work so well.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old now and have sensitive and dry skin. I used to use department store brands but they didn&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;ve applied this product for about a week and so far it is great on my skin and there is no irritation. When I applied it, it absorbed quickly and my skin was hydrated the entire day. Another great thing I confirmed from the seller is that this moisturizer is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> The serum itself is probably as good as any other Retinol product, but getting to it was a pain.  The pump mechanism died early on.  I was also disappointed in how quickly 1 ounce gets used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 year&#x27;s old - and I have plenty of wrinkles. I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizer for almost a month, and by golly - my wrinkles look softer, and less visible! I&#x27;m reordering today - because I don&#x27;t want to be without. I love the bottle, the pump dispenser... it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for a few weeks &amp; the one plus side is my face hasn&#x27;t broken out! I&#x27;m 58 and still prone to breakouts (I have very sensitive skin). I&#x27;ve tried just about everything (cheap &amp; expensive) &amp; to find something that is reasonably priced is remarkable. Can&#x27;t say I see any amazing improvements but it goes on nicely, has a pleasant smell &amp; works well with my makeup (which is another big plus!). We&#x27;ll see how the next few week go with Ultra Spa. Hopefully I&#x27;ll come back &amp; give an update of 5 stars!</li>
            <li> to early to tell I just got it a few days ago...</li>
            <li> I was blessed not to have pimples all my life. After using this my face broke out. I hated it.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and the Ultra Spa goes on and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling either greasy or &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34;, the peppermint extract smells wonderful and is soothing to the skin, and my skin looks healthier every day!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the product minty!!!</li>
            <li> Feels very silky, has a pleasant scent and my skin soaks it up quickly. The only thing that keeps it from being perfect? It doesn&#x27;t have Retinol in it.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of the product...it smooths on very evenly and leaves a refreshing tightness on the skin.  It&#x27;s an easy applicator which is important to me.  I&#x27;ve only tried it for a week or so but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Tried so many moisturizer over the years, there is no room to name them all. This cream is easy to apply, smells great and leaves a feeling of TLC on your skin. Cannot wait to try some of this companies other products.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding products I&#x27;m not allergic to as I have very sensative skin.  I&#x27;ve begun using this and it has a nice clean minty smell but don&#x27;t worry...it doesn&#x27;t last forever.  The cream is very light when applied and doesn&#x27;t seem sticky as some creams do but I can tell that its still on after several hours.  Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Clearer more beautiful skin with less breakouts. Will continue to use but I love it this far</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all. It feels great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it everyday, and I have noticed that my skin has a glow.&lt;br /&gt;Most mosturizers have a strong perfume base, which has never made sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;This one does not have that smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see an eye cream made with caffenine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order this product again</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer! Leaves no greasy after feel! Does the job</li>
            <li> what shall i say...it works!!!</li>
            <li> This is the most AMAZING anti-aging moisturizer formula that I have ever used and well worth every penny!!  I noticed a difference within the 1st 3 days of using it, and I only apply it once a day.  Even my husband noticed the difference and has started using it himself.  One of the best new finds on Amazon for me of this entire year!!  I truly cannot recommend it highly enough.  If you&#x27;re thinking about trying it - do not hesitate!! :D</li>
            <li> I really love the way this moisturizer feels. Well, so far so good, it&#x27;s like a drink of water for my skin. I don&#x27;t know what the results will be after a few weeks, but right now I&#x27;m loving it. No break outs so far and yet my skin is feeling hydrated, especially with this dry winter itchy skin, my skin still feels so good. Thank you for your great customer service.</li>
            <li> This is only (DAY 1) but impressed so far as product feels extremely nice on face. When applying feels tingly and light. Pleasant smell. Afterwards this moisturizer is not sticky as it&#x27;s very smooth to touch, unlike others I&#x27;ve used. More of a lotion than a gel. I realize this is only my first day, however I will follow up in 2-3 weeks giving it time to see results. I have big hopes for this one after reading positive reviews and like I said has an extremely nice feel on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****QUICK DAY 2 UPDATE**** Had to add as only (DAY 2) but could actually see a difference starting to soften the lines around my mouth...Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE AFTER A MONTH:*** This stuff is a miracle in a bottle. Has continued to improve skin not only firmness but the texture and all around appearance. My skin has never looked healthier and felt better.&lt;br /&gt;The diminishing of lines was only the beginning. I use it in the morning after washing my face and again before I go to bed. Using one squirt for entire face. I dab forehead one cheek at a time and chin then smooth in circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle seems small but its lasted me since Feb 4th. I am just now getting to the bottom and its the end of April. So definitely worth every penny spent, plus some....Have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer for 24 bucks, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if it were anymore than that. It does leave skin feeling soft. I can&#x27;t tell yet if it works on wrinkles and fine lines because I just started using it two days ago. I will update this review after a month, and let you know. I of the best things about it, it does not leave your skin feeling oily or greasy if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product is really really good!  When I put it on it smells nice and minty and the smell isn&#x27;t pefumey and doesn&#x27;t linger.  I can feel it firming my skin.  I like that you can use it also under your eyes.  I have noticed my lines diminishing and my skin looks better!  I would order this product again!  The price is great too!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this product 5 stars, but I have used it only a couple of weeks; I think it&#x27;s helping, but it may take a little time to be sure.</li>
