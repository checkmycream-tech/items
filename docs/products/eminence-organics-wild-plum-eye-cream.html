            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>One of the best daily eye creams out there.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love it Would recommend to anyone...</li>
            <li>It lasts a lng time so all the cheaper creams that you buy you will spend more and it will not work as well as this.</li>
            <li>I Love Eminence products and this lives up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>I love eminance products since my aesthetician recomend it to me.</li>
            <li>Love all eminence products.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>The eye exfoliant by Eminence is much better.  </li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and has a lovely smell.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Eminence line for over a year now and love all their products.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smelled okay, but didn&#x27;t do anything for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure about how well this product is working for my eye area.  </li>
            <li>Since I began using this a few weeks ago, my eyes are brighter, the skin is taught and incredibly conditioned (and it smells amazing!).  </li>
            <li>I am sure it is fine.</li>
            <li>After I hit my thirties I started to notice more defined wrinkles and fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is a large bottle and a good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>It is really creamy and smells SO good.</li>
            <li>Feels really good in the application, but isn&#x27;t really taking care of the darker circles.  </li>
            <li>I love Eminence and was excited to try this eye cream out.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and the iron-rich plum ingredients reduce dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li>This cream addresses all of my concerns, wrinkles and fine lines, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is gentle and light, but penetrates nicely.</li>
            <li>It is so light on the eyes.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon, for bringing amazing products to us at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>GREAT EYE CREAM and love how it soothes the eyes when you put it on with the other products I got from here</li>
            <li>I have already noticed a significant difference and so have my friends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, paraben free and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so good for you, such a pleasure to the senses.</li>
            <li>try their tropical vanilla day cream, its so full of moisture and has 32 spf.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely, no bad smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve relied on Bobbi Brown products for years, but found this recently and love it even more than Bobbi.  </li>
            <li>make up line.&lt;br /&gt;Received quickly and without problems.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it blends in quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma of Eminence products, and the high quality without chemicals.</li>
            <li>Wish it did more for the dark circles, but I would recommend to anyone looking for a really nice eyecream.</li>
            <li>and I have been using it for more than six weeks so far.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural too.</li>
            <li>I also use it over my whole face when I have a sunburn because it&#x27;s the most gentle lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it for me.  </li>
            <li>Also love that the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>Worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>Although it felt nice going on, I honestly was not seeing a difference from other store bought eye products I had used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like my eyes to get a little lighter but over all its looking good.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Eminence all natural, organic skin care.</li>
            <li>I have used many different Eminence products and would recommend everyone of them.  </li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with a face creme-putting the eye cream on first then moisturizing the rest of my face after.</li>
            <li>This is a standard favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I do so many Eminence reviews because I am HOOKED on the stuff and this one is no different.</li>
            <li>but this product really helps!</li>
            <li>This product does absolutely nothing for my dark circles, but it smells wonderful and is so rich and creamy without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay, because it is highly concentrated and you only need a grain of rice size</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bottle</li>
            <li>- dark circles and crows feet have are not nearly as noticeable as they were and it feels great on.  </li>
            <li>Really makes you feel like you are doing something for your eye area.</li>
            <li>The cream feels really hydrating under my eyes.</li>
            <li>the eye cream is really hydrating, which i have also had a problem with.</li>
            <li>Is very soothing product and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very soothing.  </li>
            <li>It sinks into the skin versus sitting on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it was just me, being overly excited, but i have had multiple friends ask</li>
            <li>because it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and feels light and hydrating, not greasy or unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I did not find that it helped my dark circles that much - again I had better results with the Cucumber.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyecream, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my dark circles.</li>
            <li>The Eminence Wild Plum Eye Cream is amazing for dark circles and hydration!</li>
            <li>i am 53 and fair skinned, especially since it is the dead of winter</li>
            <li>I was using the Bearberry Eye Cream, which is a very light eye cream that was recommended due to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this</li>
            <li>and i am thrilled to report that it definitely has diminished my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Using this product my skin has become velvety soft and I look a bit younger (which is a welcome development as my thirty-something eyes are starting to show a little wear).  </li>
            <li>youre new to eminence</li>
            <li>I am new to eminence.</li>
            <li>I find that I don&#x27;t need to use very much so it lasts a long time, making the price tag a bit less overwhelming.</li>
            <li>it is very a creamy lotion with a pump that meters out just enough - so it lasts without pumping out too much.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this and many other products in the Eminence line, especially if you have sensitive skin / rosacea.</li>
            <li>Worth the money - you need the tiniest dab of it, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>First, and last cause are the easiest to cure.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I see much improvement in my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and keep going back to this one because it&#x27;s so great.</li>
            <li>The formula is light (my main complaint with Bobbi eye cream is how heavy it is) and it really works to relieve undereye circles and bags, as well as hiding fine lines.  </li>
            <li>even at the young age of 60</li>
            <li>I developed an eye allergy (redness and swelling on both eyes) after using it three times.  </li>
            <li>but I can say the skin under my eyes feels soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do remember that these contain natural ingredients and can spoil if in heat for a period of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at the size of it.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>This product makes the skin around my eyes so soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin texture has completely changed and is now a lot softer ...</li>
            <li>However, I have friends that prefer the Wild Plum.  </li>
            <li>Especially since it comes in a pump, portion control is really easy, so It will last for a very long time!</li>
            <li>After using this as directed, my eyes are definitely less puffy and have less dark coloration underneath them than I used to, which is a great improvement.  </li>
            <li>It really did lighten the dark areas on my eyelids that were caused by an allergic reaction to some highly pigmented eyeshadow I had been using.</li>
            <li>use their products on a daily basis and have been for years, this is my first and last purchase of this specific product they carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every product under sun and up until this one, had little success.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and often such creams irritate my eyes, or leave me feeling like I put nothing on at all.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful, too much will make your eyes burn.  </li>
            <li>I will go back to it when my supply of this Wild Plum is gone.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product as expected.</li>
            <li>So much that I might consider other products in the line.  </li>
            <li>Having dark circles under your eyes can be very discouraging since there is not a lot you can do if it&#x27;s a hereditary thing and not just lack of sleep...</li>
            <li>But it really does actually DO something as opposed to all the other eye creams I have used.</li>
            <li>Which is a long time for a natural product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how useful it is for anti aging.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Absorbs nicely, no bad smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve relied on Bobbi Brown products for years, but found this recently and love it even more than Bobbi.  </li>
            <li> make up line.&lt;br /&gt;Received quickly and without problems.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it blends in quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the aroma of Eminence products, and the high quality without chemicals.</li>
            <li> Wish it did more for the dark circles, but I would recommend to anyone looking for a really nice eyecream.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for more than six weeks so far.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural too.</li>
            <li> I also use it over my whole face when I have a sunburn because it&#x27;s the most gentle lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth it for me.  </li>
            <li> Also love that the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> Worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> Although it felt nice going on, I honestly was not seeing a difference from other store bought eye products I had used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like my eyes to get a little lighter but over all its looking good.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Eminence all natural, organic skin care.</li>
            <li> I have used many different Eminence products and would recommend everyone of them.  </li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with a face creme-putting the eye cream on first then moisturizing the rest of my face after.</li>
            <li> This is a standard favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I do so many Eminence reviews because I am HOOKED on the stuff and this one is no different.</li>
            <li> but this product really helps!</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing for my dark circles, but it smells wonderful and is so rich and creamy without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay, because it is highly concentrated and you only need a grain of rice size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bottle</li>
            <li> - dark circles and crows feet have are not nearly as noticeable as they were and it feels great on.  </li>
            <li> Really makes you feel like you are doing something for your eye area.</li>
            <li> The cream feels really hydrating under my eyes.</li>
            <li> the eye cream is really hydrating, which i have also had a problem with.</li>
            <li> Is very soothing product and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very soothing.  </li>
            <li> It sinks into the skin versus sitting on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just me, being overly excited, but i have had multiple friends ask</li>
            <li> because it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and feels light and hydrating, not greasy or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I did not find that it helped my dark circles that much - again I had better results with the Cucumber.  </li>
            <li> I love this eyecream, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> The Eminence Wild Plum Eye Cream is amazing for dark circles and hydration!</li>
            <li> i am 53 and fair skinned, especially since it is the dead of winter</li>
            <li> I was using the Bearberry Eye Cream, which is a very light eye cream that was recommended due to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this</li>
            <li> and i am thrilled to report that it definitely has diminished my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Using this product my skin has become velvety soft and I look a bit younger (which is a welcome development as my thirty-something eyes are starting to show a little wear).  </li>
            <li> youre new to eminence</li>
            <li> I am new to eminence.</li>
            <li> I find that I don&#x27;t need to use very much so it lasts a long time, making the price tag a bit less overwhelming.</li>
            <li> it is very a creamy lotion with a pump that meters out just enough - so it lasts without pumping out too much.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this and many other products in the Eminence line, especially if you have sensitive skin / rosacea.</li>
            <li> Worth the money - you need the tiniest dab of it, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> First, and last cause are the easiest to cure.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I see much improvement in my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and keep going back to this one because it&#x27;s so great.</li>
            <li> The formula is light (my main complaint with Bobbi eye cream is how heavy it is) and it really works to relieve undereye circles and bags, as well as hiding fine lines.  </li>
            <li> even at the young age of 60</li>
            <li> I developed an eye allergy (redness and swelling on both eyes) after using it three times.  </li>
            <li> but I can say the skin under my eyes feels soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do remember that these contain natural ingredients and can spoil if in heat for a period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the size of it.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> This product makes the skin around my eyes so soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin texture has completely changed and is now a lot softer ...</li>
            <li> However, I have friends that prefer the Wild Plum.  </li>
            <li> Especially since it comes in a pump, portion control is really easy, so It will last for a very long time!</li>
            <li> After using this as directed, my eyes are definitely less puffy and have less dark coloration underneath them than I used to, which is a great improvement.  </li>
            <li> It really did lighten the dark areas on my eyelids that were caused by an allergic reaction to some highly pigmented eyeshadow I had been using.</li>
            <li> use their products on a daily basis and have been for years, this is my first and last purchase of this specific product they carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every product under sun and up until this one, had little success.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and often such creams irritate my eyes, or leave me feeling like I put nothing on at all.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful, too much will make your eyes burn.  </li>
            <li> I will go back to it when my supply of this Wild Plum is gone.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product as expected.</li>
            <li> So much that I might consider other products in the line.  </li>
            <li> Having dark circles under your eyes can be very discouraging since there is not a lot you can do if it&#x27;s a hereditary thing and not just lack of sleep...</li>
            <li> But it really does actually DO something as opposed to all the other eye creams I have used.</li>
            <li> Which is a long time for a natural product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how useful it is for anti aging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit spendy, but products are highly concentrated and a little goes</li>
            <li> The entire Eminence line is natural, and works extremely well!</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I had tried the Wild Plum Eye Cream previously.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention for the price on Amazon and how long it has lasted</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time, though.</li>
            <li> Though expensive, worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see a drastic change to the dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, and this cream keeps me hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> I use this in both the morning and the evening, every single day.  </li>
            <li> However the dark circles under my eyes are not totally gone.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see big difference in dark circles yet.</li>
            <li> Initially I hesitated to buy because of price, however a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I only use half a pump for both eyes.</li>
            <li> The dark circles that i have had all my life (seriously, my pictures from elementary look like i have a black eye every year).</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for women in their late 20&#x27;s to early 30&#x27;s, who worry about moisturizing their eye area.</li>
            <li> Brightens the eye area visibly after only a few days of using.</li>
            <li> The next time you want to save a few bucks here then buying it from Eminence</li>
            <li> Does exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> and it also seems to irritate my eyes even if I&#x27;m careful with application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not very moisturing.  </li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream which removes black lines, does not containing caffeine, and that it works!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the seller took a long time to get it to me.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding when I say a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> i also use their firming facial cleanser and i am anxiously awaiting the neck cream</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and truly have noticed instant results in just a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Would like to receive other products from this</li>
            <li> It fades dark circles as advertised, but also decreases crows feet.</li>
            <li> I got this product to try and get rid of the persistent dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> my lifestyle is not a factor for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in the hope of alleviating dark under eye circles as it promises - have not seen any noticeable difference</li>
            <li> of money on this item in the hope of getting rid od dark circles -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles</li>
            <li> I have milia and dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a change in the somewhat dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I luckily do not suffer from bags or dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Black lines under your eyes are caused by lack of sleep, allergies, nasal infections, and or a result of a poor/violent relationship.....</li>
            <li> It was just a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long....way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little over a month and both my friends and family have seen inprovments.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little over a month and both my friends and family have seen improvements.</li>
            <li> A few friends recommend keeping in the fridge.</li>
            <li> my opinion, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with anything by Eminence, since its organic, all natural, and you don&#x27;t need a PhD in chemistry to understand the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to eye cream for the past few years.</li>
            <li> I agree with others who say use only a little as I find if I accidentally use too much it does sting a bit - nothing horrible and it goes away quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trying to delete this review / message and I am not sure how to do it on a mobile device.</li>
            <li> I used to get small calcium deposit bumps around my eyes and never since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Usually, you get 1/2 ounce for eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Also not sure of the cause of my circles.</li>
            <li> Tight eyes!!</li>
            <li> This cream is not effective at all.  </li>
            <li> With a very small amount, you can feel the softening.  </li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t got any worse either.  </li>
            <li> I was looking in the mirror over the weekend and noticed that my eyes haven&#x27;t looked really tired or as wrinkly since I started using this eye cream exclusively.  </li>
            <li> Not great for me</li>
            <li> The package was open not sealed the way it would be from the manufacturer as well as it was spoiled the smell was awful!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong in buying them.</li>
            <li> That is a bit inconvenient for me, i am just mindful not to leave them in the car or carry them with me when i travel.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> With a cold finger if you want added benefits.</li>
            <li> Does not work and smells bad.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed by any of the Eminence line.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see any changes :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years --- an excellent product</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed by any of the Eminence line.  I truly love this and my eyes look amazing!  even at the young age of 60.. But no one ever knows that.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and it does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT eye cream! It fades dark circles as advertised, but also decreases crows feet. It is really creamy and smells SO good. And by the way, the price for over an ounce of product is unbeatable!  Especially since it comes in a pump, portion control is really easy, so It will last for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks.  I got this product to try and get rid of the persistent dark circles under my eyes.  After using this as directed, my eyes are definitely less puffy and have less dark coloration underneath them than I used to, which is a great improvement.  However the dark circles under my eyes are not totally gone.  I eat very healthy and get lots of sleep, so my lifestyle is not a factor for my dark circles.  Using this product my skin has become velvety soft and I look a bit younger (which is a welcome development as my thirty-something eyes are starting to show a little wear).  Initially I hesitated to buy because of price, however a little goes a long way.  It will last a long time.  It&#x27;s a great product and I would recommend it to others.  It is a fairly priced for a high quality product and the dispenser it comes in is excellent.  My only complaint is the seller took a long time to get it to me.  I would order it again, but not from the same seller.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how long it lasts.  Really makes you feel like you are doing something for your eye area.</li>
            <li> i have only been using this for about a week and i am thrilled to report that it definitely has diminished my dark circles.  i am 53 and fair skinned, especially since it is the dead of winter and i am loving this product.  i also use their firming facial cleanser and i am anxiously awaiting the neck cream</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for an eye cream. I use it twice a day and truly have noticed instant results in just a few weeks! A little goes a long way. I wear contacts and like all Eminence products have no sensitivities. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in search for the perfect eye cream for months.   I have sensitive skin and often such creams irritate my eyes, or leave me feeling like I put nothing on at all.  Since I began using this a few weeks ago, my eyes are brighter, the skin is taught and incredibly conditioned (and it smells amazing!).  Though expensive, worth every cent!</li>
            <li> This is literally the only eye cream I have ever used that has produced results! It&#x27;s all natural, paraben free and smells amazing. But it really does actually DO something as opposed to all the other eye creams I have used. Brightens the eye area visibly after only a few days of using. And it&#x27;s so good for you, such a pleasure to the senses. Worth the money - you need the tiniest dab of it, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I developed an eye allergy (redness and swelling on both eyes) after using it three times.  I have not had any allergic reaction to skin care products before.</li>
            <li> Such a great quality product!</li>
            <li> Just started using........I am sure it is fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve relied on Bobbi Brown products for years, but found this recently and love it even more than Bobbi.  The formula is light (my main complaint with Bobbi eye cream is how heavy it is) and it really works to relieve undereye circles and bags, as well as hiding fine lines.  My skin is very dry, and this cream keeps me hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> Nice and light for added moisture around the eye area.  So far so good.  Great fragrance.</li>
            <li> The cream feels really hydrating under my eyes. It also has a nice scent to it. I have not used it long enough to see a drastic change to the dark circles under my eyes but I can say the skin under my eyes feels soft.</li>
            <li> The package was open not sealed the way it would be from the manufacturer as well as it was spoiled the smell was awful! The next time you want to save a few bucks here then buying it from Eminence don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hope of alleviating dark under eye circles as it promises - have not seen any noticeable difference and I have been using it for more than six weeks so far. I still use it as a form of eye moisturizer - after all I did spend a fair amt. of money on this item in the hope of getting rid od dark circles - plus it was recommended by an spa aesthetician.</li>
            <li> I love Eminence skin care products..I had tried the Wild Plum Eye Cream previously.  This cream keeps my eye area moisturized.  I have used many different Eminence products and would recommend everyone of them.  Great product line.</li>
            <li> Trying to delete this review / message and I am not sure how to do it on a mobile device. Argh.</li>
            <li> GREAT EYE CREAM and love how it soothes the eyes when you put it on with the other products I got from here</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for some time now.  I think this is my 4th re-order of it.  I recommend it.  Now, I know you don&#x27;t know me&lt;br /&gt;and I don&#x27;t know you but I am 63 and my skin in amazing.  These eminence products help me to maintain it</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye cream I have ever used. It smells wonderful and the iron-rich plum ingredients reduce dark circles under the eyes. All ingredients are organic. Worth the higher price. It is so light on the eyes. I used to get small calcium deposit bumps around my eyes and never since I started using this product. I use it in conjunction with a face creme-putting the eye cream on first then moisturizing the rest of my face after. One bottle lasts about 4-6 months. I use one pump a day.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  So much that I might consider other products in the line.  It is a large bottle and a good deal for the price.  Feels like velvet!</li>
            <li> Does exactly as expected.  Just be careful, too much will make your eyes burn.  Don&#x27;t get it too close to the eyes either.</li>
            <li> The Eminence Wild Plum Eye Cream is amazing for dark circles and hydration! I would say the best I&#x27;ve tried for those issues. The cream has a great smell and texture. You get a lot of product for the price also. My last bottle lasted about 9 months. I love that it&#x27;s all natural too.</li>
            <li> This is a standard favorite of mine. One of the best daily eye creams out there. Moisturizes with out being oily. A little goes a long....way.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Would like to receive other products from this make up line.&lt;br /&gt;Received quickly and without problems.  Will repeat!</li>
            <li> I love Eminence and was excited to try this eye cream out.  I honestly don&#x27;t tell any difference and it also seems to irritate my eyes even if I&#x27;m careful with application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use their products on a daily basis and have been for years, this is my first and last purchase of this specific product they carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If youre new to eminence try their tropical vanilla day cream, its so full of moisture and has 32 spf.  love it.</li>
            <li> great for the lines around your eyes..Love it Would recommend to anyone...It lasts a lng time so all the cheaper creams that you buy you will spend more and it will not work as well as this.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very soothing, luminescent, and smells very good. I&#x27;ve purchased this product multiple times and it is now part of my routine.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  I have only this this for 2 weeks. i have been reading a lot of great things about Eminence and my Avon products that i have been using for years just don&#x27;t seem to be working anymore. I have already noticed a significant difference and so have my friends. The dark circles that i have had all my life (seriously, my pictures from elementary look like i have a black eye every year). I thought it was just me, being overly excited, but i have had multiple friends ask if  i had a peel or something else done, my skin is glowing. the eye cream is really hydrating, which i have also had a problem with. I used to carry eye cream in my purse to reapply during the day. I do not have to do that with this product. My eyes stay hydrated all day.I also bought the Blueberry soy moisturizer and have been using them together.  My face also stays moisturized all day and has this nice feel/glow to it. The products are amazing. I just ordered the Grapefuit-C gel from them as well. Thank you Amazon, for bringing amazing products to us at reasonable prices. I have been telling all my friends about Eminence. I wish i had known about them years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Do remember that these contain natural ingredients and can spoil if in heat for a period of time. A few friends recommend keeping in the fridge. That is a bit inconvenient for me, i am just mindful not to leave them in the car or carry them with me when i travel.&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret the purchase and will become a repeat buyer!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!! I do so many Eminence reviews because I am HOOKED on the stuff and this one is no different. It is great of darker circles under the eyes.  I don&#x27;t feel like it &amp;#34;tightens&amp;#34; but used with the Eminence Neroli Age Corrective Eye Cream BAM!! Tight eyes!! The trick is to use a TINY TINY bit and pat it in.  Don&#x27;t rub your eye skin.  Pat. pat. pat. pat.  With a cold finger if you want added benefits.</li>
            <li> I Love Eminence products and this lives up to my expectations. I love the aroma of Eminence products, and the high quality without chemicals.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is gentle and light, but penetrates nicely. It really did lighten the dark areas on my eyelids that were caused by an allergic reaction to some highly pigmented eyeshadow I had been using. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Like the smell. Works good.</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing for my dark circles, but it smells wonderful and is so rich and creamy without being heavy or greasy. I would recommend it as *just* an eye cream. I find that I don&#x27;t need to use very much so it lasts a long time, making the price tag a bit less overwhelming. This bottle should last me about a year.</li>
            <li> I love this eyecream, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my dark circles. I give it 4 stars though because it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and feels light and hydrating, not greasy or unpleasant. It soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t effect my eye makeup. Wish it did more for the dark circles, but I would recommend to anyone looking for a really nice eyecream.</li>
            <li> Absorbs nicely, no bad smell.  I&#x27;m surprised at the size of it.  Usually, you get 1/2 ounce for eye cream.  With 1 ounce, it lasts over a year!  Which is a long time for a natural product.  I guess the packaging keeps the ingredients working still... hopefully.  Not sure if I see much improvement in my fine lines.  They haven&#x27;t got any worse either.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles so can&#x27;t say if that part works.  I doubt I&#x27;ll repurchase since it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; me.</li>
            <li> I love eminance products since my aesthetician recomend it to me. I start it using it and saw the difference in my eyes.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT; IT ARRIVED PROMPTLY.  I WOULD PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!  THIS PRODUCT IS LIGHT AND NOT GREASY, IT&#x27;S GREAT!</li>
            <li> This cream is not effective at all.  It is not very moisturing.  Do not waste your money.  I prefer orland eye cream.</li>
            <li> Having dark circles under your eyes can be very discouraging since there is not a lot you can do if it&#x27;s a hereditary thing and not just lack of sleep... but this product really helps! I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every product under sun and up until this one, had little success. It definitely lightened the under eye area. It&#x27;s worth the money and lasts a long time. It will be a staple in my skin care / beauty routine from now on.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working, but it smells wonderful and feels fabulous. I also use it over my whole face when I have a sunburn because it&#x27;s the most gentle lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how useful it is for anti aging. But my eyes felt pampered &amp; the eye area, brighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was looking in the mirror over the weekend and noticed that my eyes haven&#x27;t looked really tired or as wrinkly since I started using this eye cream exclusively.  I figured I should write a review since it&#x27;s actually working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this almost a year ago(December 2013) and I&#x27;m still using the same bottle.  I&#x27;m not kidding when I say a little goes a long way.  I use this in both the morning and the evening, every single day.  I have oily, acne prone skin.  After I hit my thirties I started to notice more defined wrinkles and fine lines under my eyes.  I luckily do not suffer from bags or dark circles under my eyes.  I tried about 5 or 6 different eye creams ranging from drugstore brands to department store brands.  Nothing seemed to work well.  They caused me to break out or get clogged pores all around my eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to point out that I still have the wrinkles, they just aren&#x27;t as defined and my eye area looks younger and refreshed.  This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker or a plastic surgeon. This cream addresses all of my concerns, wrinkles and fine lines, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  That&#x27;s a win-win in my book.  Not to mention for the price on Amazon and how long it has lasted it&#x27;s totally worth it for me.  I would recommend it for women in their late 20&#x27;s to early 30&#x27;s, who worry about moisturizing their eye area.</li>
            <li> Love all eminence products. But I have been using for 1 week. I don&#x27;t see big difference in dark circles yet. But I do feel maybe you have to give it time to work. Also not sure of the cause of my circles. Being inherited is not the cause for me. I&#x27;ll see what happens when i have used all the contents in this bottle. Is very soothing product and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I love these products.</li>
            <li> This product makes the skin around my eyes so soft.  It&#x27;s also very soothing.  A little goes a long way.  I only use half a pump for both eyes.</li>
            <li> With a very small amount, you can feel the softening.  Great product for aging skin .&lt;br /&gt;This was the lowest price found anywhere.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Delightful fragrance, but more than that ... it is very a creamy lotion with a pump that meters out just enough - so it lasts without pumping out too much.  This should have 10 stars.</li>
            <li> My skin texture has completely changed and is now a lot softer ... I use with Naseberry Creme.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see any changes :( I have milia and dark circles around my eyes. i personally haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. The eye exfoliant by Eminence is much better.  It is moisturizing and has a lovely smell. Not great for me but it may work for you!</li>
            <li> Does not work and smells bad.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to eye cream for the past few years. It smells great and never irritates my skin. I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and keep going back to this one because it&#x27;s so great. Also love that the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Eminence line for over a year now and love all their products.  However, I just started using this eye cream about 3 weeks ago and what a difference already.  I was using the Bearberry Eye Cream, which is a very light eye cream that was recommended due to my sensitive skin.  Although it felt nice going on, I honestly was not seeing a difference from other store bought eye products I had used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for all the reasons many have noted - dark circles and crows feet have are not nearly as noticeable as they were and it feels great on.  I use one pump twice a day, but I do expect it will last me several months.  I agree with others who say use only a little as I find if I accidentally use too much it does sting a bit - nothing horrible and it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and many other products in the Eminence line, especially if you have sensitive skin / rosacea.</li>
            <li> Black lines under your eyes are caused by lack of sleep, allergies, nasal infections, and or a result of a poor/violent relationship..... First, and last cause are the easiest to cure. As for the others, you&#x27;ll need to see a specialist as products like these will only &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; the symptoms, but will not take them away. The entire Eminence line is natural, and works extremely well! You really can&#x27;t go wrong in buying them. This is the only eye cream which removes black lines, does not containing caffeine, and that it works!</li>
            <li> I am new to eminence.I was introduced to the brand from a recent facial I had. This stuff is wonderful. I love the way it feels. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it blends in quickly. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel overly oily or anything. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I the mornings I put this on and then a primer and my makeup stays put. In the evenings i use it before going to bed. I don&#x27;t have any issues with lines around my eyes (yet, knock on wood) but am hoping this will help keep them away!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Eminence all natural, organic skin care. If you don&#x27;t want to keep putting chemicals in your skin, check out Eminence. It&#x27;s a bit spendy, but products are highly concentrated and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the size of this bottle fool you.  It&#x27;s a large bottle but there is a much smaller reservoir of product inside.  That&#x27;s okay, because it is highly concentrated and you only need a grain of rice size amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several different Eminence eye products, and I must say I prefer the Cucumber Eye Gel.  I will go back to it when my supply of this Wild Plum is gone.  I did not find that it helped my dark circles that much - again I had better results with the Cucumber.  However, I have friends that prefer the Wild Plum.  Like anything, you have to find what works best for you and your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with anything by Eminence, since its organic, all natural, and you don&#x27;t need a PhD in chemistry to understand the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a change in the somewhat dark circles under my eyes.  I have been using the creme for about two months.  I have not found a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creme comes in a beautiful container and feels good when putting it on, but that&#x27;should it.</li>
            <li> Smelled okay, but didn&#x27;t do anything for my eyes.  It was just a greasy mess.  Do not get too close to eyes because it will cause blindness for about 30 min</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about how well this product is working for my eye area.  I agree with erbear&#x27;s 2012 review.  Feels really good in the application, but isn&#x27;t really taking care of the darker circles.  The bottle lasts a long time, though.</li>
            <li> This is a light creamy and wonderful smelling face cream.  It sinks into the skin versus sitting on top of the skin. It is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little over a month and both my friends and family have seen inprovments. I would like my I have been using this cream for a little over a month and both my friends and family have seen improvements. I would like my eyes to get a little lighter but over all its looking good.</li>
